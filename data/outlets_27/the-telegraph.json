                "body": "If Gareth Southgate wants his senior England players to learn to \"play with freedom,\" as he said after Friday's defeat of Holland, then he can do much worse than showing them a tape of their young colleagues in the under-21s.\n\nThere is no fear of expression or flamboyance among this side, many of whom look just as comfortable executing an artful pirouette or nutmeg as they do playing the simple pass. Perhaps it is a culture shift, a generational change of attitudes, or maybe it really is the result of the FA's drive to produce more technically comfortable footballers.\n\nEither way, to watch the under-21s here was, at times, refreshingly close to seeing that old ideal of 'playground football', as they feinted and jinked, whirled and twirled.\n\nThe problem with this particular approach, of course, is that it does not lend itself to defensive solidity. And while they can be credited for their experimental approach, England conceded a sloppy goal from a set piece, and too often played themselves into trouble with their over-elaboration.\n\nIn the end, despite an unexpectedly nervy finish, goals from Demarai Gray, captain on the night, and Jake Clarke-Salter were just about enough to secure victory in a match played in honour of the late Cyrille Regis, and to prepare the side for Tuesday's Euro 2019 qualifier against Ukraine.\n\nIt is not beyond the realms of possibility for one or two of these under-21s to make a late bolt for Southgate's senior squad. If nothing else, Southgate has shown that he is prepared to be more experimental than previous England managers, while his experience and deep knowledge of England's youth ranks can surely only help the cause of those players hoping for a rapid promotion.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold, for example, will see the progress of his Liverpool team-mate Joe Gomez in the England first team and think that could easily have been him, based on domestic performances alone this season. The same can be said for Tammy Abraham, who has openly said he is targeting place in the World Cup after making his senior debut in November.\n\nAnd that's all before we come to the most hyped member of this under-21 side, Ryan Sessegnon. The 17-year-old, who has scored 14 goals in 40 appearances for Fulham this season, has been touted as a surprise call-up by Southgate, even if that may seem extreme for a player who had not been called up to the under-21s until this month.\n\nSessegnon started on the bench here, from where he would have enjoyed the view as his team-mates strutted their way through the opening 20 minutes of this friendly. Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who has impressed in the Arsenal first team this season, was putting on a show in midfield, while Ademola Lookman joined him in producing a series of jinking turns and flicks against a Romania side that appeared bewildered.\n\nThe early goal came through Gray, an electric presence on the left side. The Leicester City winger combined smartly with Lookman before stepping inside and flashing a low shot inside the near post, with the help of a deflection.\n\nIt was open, and it was fun. The towering Ovie Ejaria snaked and slalomed through midfield, while Kieran Dowell provided flair and trickery from the right. Abraham, meanwhile, had more than enough power to trouble the Romanian back four and twice went close before 20 minutes had passed.\n\nIf anything, though, it had become a little too comfortable for Aidy Boothroyd's side. Romania belatedly decided to challenge the stepovers and flicks, and England soon began to play themselves into trouble.\n\nOver-elaboration in midfield allowed Andrei Ivan with a clear sight of the England goal, and home goalkeeper Dean Henderson was fortunate to see the striker's shot roll back off the post.\n\nThere were also two clear openings for Florinel Coman, who spurned the first and was thwarted by Henderson for the second after England were ripped apart by a gorgeous through ball by Ianis Hagi, the 19-year-old son of Romanian legend Gheorghe.\n\nStill, England were comfortably the better side, and Dowell, who is thriving on loan at Nottingham Forest from Everton this season, twice went close to doubling the lead before the break.\n\nAfter half-time, England twice struck the post, through a looping Abraham header and a Lookman effort, before Clarke-Salter finally doubled the lead with a powerful header from Alexander-Arnold's corner.\n\nIt was a deserved contribution from the classy Alexander-Arnold, who had been pushed from right-back into midfield and had fast become England's most dangerous attacking player.\n\nDespite the extended lead, the air of unease remained in defence, and Romania had their goal as Henderson flapped at a cross to allow Valentin Costache to fire home into the empty net. Cue panic in the England ranks, where only a phenomenal block from Kyle Walker-Peters prevented a late Romanian equaliser.\n\nMatch details\n\nEngland (4-2-3-1): Henderson 5; Alexander-Arnold 8, Tomori 6, Clarke-Salter 7, Walker-Peters 6; Maitland-Niles 7 (Onomah 70), Ejaria 6; Dowell 7 (Maddison 84), Lookman 7, Gray 7 (Kenny 58), Abraham 6 (Calvert-Lewin 84).\n\nRomania (4-2-3-1): I Radu 6; Butean 5, Ghita 6, Pascanu 6, A Radu 6 (Olteanu 69); Oaida 5 (Ciobanu 45), Nedelcu 6; Dobre 6 (Costache 62), Hagi 7, Coman 7; Ivan 6 (Petre 69).\n\nAttendance: 15,314.\n\nReferee: Iwan Griffith (Wales)",

                "body": "Anyone remember Waterhouse-gate? That moment, a good, oh, six weeks ago when the removal from the walls of Manchester Art Gallery of a painting by the great Victorian painter John William Waterhouse led to fears of the rise of a \"new puritanism\" in the wake of the #MeToo and Time's Up campaigns.\n\nThe painting, Hylas and the Nymphs (1896), showing an ancient Greek hero being lured into a pool by a group of apparently underage water nymphs, was replaced by post-it notes requesting public responses to the removal, prompting a public outcry about politically correct meddling in our public collections.\n\nWhen it emerged that the removal wasn't quite the act of censorship it appeared, but part of a performance staged ahead of an exhibition by Sonia Boyce - a \"pathetic stunt\" as one tweeter put it - the whole thing quickly blew over. Now, however, with the opening of Boyce's exhibition, Waterhouse's painting is once again back in the spotlight and we have the opportunity to find out the intentions behind one of the more bizarre curatorial interventions of modern times.\n\nIt's ironic that while curator Clare Gannaway (who acted as gallery's spokesperson during the Waterhouse furore) became a hate figure for those outraged by the painting's removal, Boyce herself was barely mentioned. Ironic, because Boyce, a stalwart of the Eighties Black Art Movement, has spent much of her career campaigning for greater visibility of the Black presence in British culture. She might at least have been granted the starring role in her own media storm.",

                "title": "Holding plank for a long time is pointless, fitness professor claims  ",
                "body": "Holding plank for ever-increasing periods of time has become a staple of many gym classes. Fitness experts claim that staying at the top of a push-up builds core, strengthens back muscles, tones the arms and teaches endurance.\n\nBut one sports scientist suggests that holding the position for any longer than 10 second intervals is pointless.\n\nAccording to Stuart McGill, emeritus professor of spine biometrics at the University of Waterloo in Canada, fitness fanatics will see greater gains from doing shorter holds more frequently.\n\nHe advises three bouts of 10 seconds as the ideal regime, and claims that classes which recommend minutes of planking are not useful.\n\n\"There's no utility to this kind of activity other than claiming a record,\" he said.\n\n\"Basically holding repeated holds of 10 seconds is best for the average person. But for people looking for better back health they should be doing the Big 3 everyday.\n\n\"This was the programme for the front, sides and back of the core musculature we developed a number of years ago.\n\n\"My conclusions come from many studies that we have performed, not just a single one.\"\n\nThe 'Big 3' involves curl ups, side-plank and bird dog, a pose which involves starting on the hands and knees the reaching out the opposite arm and leg.\n\nAll increase endurance of the muscles around the spine. He recommends starting with five reps, holding each position for 10 seconds, then four, three, two and one.\n\nProfessor McGill spent 30 years as a professor of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo where his laboratory has become a renowned destination for Olympic and professional athletes from around the world who are struggling with back pain.\n\nProfessor McGill also warned that the spine is more vulnerable in the morning, so advised being careful if doing back exercises first thing.\n\n\"Your discs are hydrophilic, which means and they love water, they suck up fluids, so when you go to bed at night you're actually shorter than when you wake up in the morning. And it's harder to put your socks on in the morning, your spinal discs are much more inflated, they don't like to bend and actually it has three times the stress.\n\n\"When we stress real spines they fracture much more than later on in the day. We would really advise against anyone getting up in the morning and doing bending exercises, pulling their knees to their chest, doing sit-ups and those kinds of things.\n\n\"They would be much wiser just to wait an hour, go for a walk, and let gravity squeeze out some of the water.\"\n\nBack pain is the world's leading cause of disability. Every year, a total of one million years of productive life is lost in the UK because of disability from low back pain.\n\nBut Prof McGill said there were still 'silly exercises' such as the speed sit-up, which causes back pain.",

                "title": "Mark Sampson was handed Uefa ban after former manager chased unknown intruder out of England Women's dressing room at Euros",
                "body": "England Women were forced to eject a man who was trying to film them in their dressing room after the defeat to Holland at last summer's European Championship, Telegraph Sport can reveal.\n\nThe unknown man walked in with a video camera just minutes after the game, frightening players, and was chased away by staff, prompting criticism of the security measures at the stadium in Enschede. Several players were half-dressed and immediately called for security to remove the intruder, who was wearing a Uefa bib but did not have the correct accreditation.\n\nThe European Championship had been identified as a potential terrorist target last summer and England's staff and players had been warned of the potential dangers. As a result, the presence of an unidentified man in the dressing room caused distress and panic, with some players still upset after their semi-final exit.\n\nMark Sampson, the then manager, was called to the dressing room by other staff. He chased the intruder down the corridor, before clashing with Uefa officials when he discovered a barrier supposed to prevent people entering the area was not in place.\n\nUefa announced on Friday that Sampson, sacked as England manager last October, would have to serve a three-game ban if he returned to international football for verbally abusing one of their match officials after he was accused of acting in an aggressive manner towards referee liaison officer Fijke Hoogendijk.\n\nThe Football Association provided six witness statements confirming the man had entered the dressing room to explain why Sampson had been so agitated at the entrance to the corridor.\n\nTelegraph Sporthas seen the statements but the FA refused to comment on Saturday. Uefa made no mention of the FA's plea for mitigation when it announced the former England manager's ban and sources say that the FA feels the evidence it provided was ignored.\n\nSampson had been accused of confronting Hoogendijk with \"multiple expletives.\" outside the referee changing room and was said to have approached her with \"aggressive body language\".\n\nThe disciplinary report continued: \"He then picked up a metal pillar raising it above his head aggressively before throwing it down hard against the floor. Fijke was concerned he was going to strike her. Fijke felt intimidated and offended by his actions.\"\n\nThe FA is understood to have denied that Sampson lifted the pole above his head, telling Uefa that it would have been impossible given its weight. It is understood the pole was part of a barrier, picked up by Sampson, with help from other staff members, in order to block access to their dressing room. This was confirmed in the witness statements.\n\nSampson apologised for his use of inappropriate language, but denied saying he would shut the door in Hoogendijk's face.\n\nUefa's disciplinary body concluded that Sampson's conduct was of \"great concern\" as he \"threatened the integrity\" of an official. He had also verbally abused Hoogendijk during the game when England had a penalty appeal turned down. \"The language he used and his attitude grossly violated the basic rules of decent conduct and his behaviour was insulting,\" Uefa said, in reporting the verdict of a seven-person panel in Austria. \"It is without hesitation a cause of sorrow that persons deployed at matches who have no relation to the football performance of the teams are attacked in such an aggressive manner by a team's officials,\" the panel said.\n\n\"Even accepting the statements of the coach in full it can't be permitted that Uefa officials like the venue director and the referee liaison officer endure the aggressive manners of others present at the match, let alone the head coach of one of the teams.\"\n\nIn October, the FA concluded its own investigation into Sampson's conduct while he was coaching the team and found that he had directed racially discriminating remarks at two of his players. Sampson, who led the team to the 2015 Women's World Cup semi-finals, was replaced by former Manchester United player Phil Neville.",

I wouldn't be inclined to let them settle for that because I believe we are better.\"\n\nKidney avoided using the word \"relegation\" but the consequences of failing to beat Harlequins at The Stoop in two weeks are obvious. \"We have another massive game against Harlequins and unless we perform well in that match, then all those other things [consequences of relegation], I am sure you would have to write about them and think about them. But we just need to get ourselves right for that one game. If we try and think about anything else we will only bury ourselves,\" he said.\n\nIrish's best crowd of the season, for the annual St Patrick's Party, generated a lively atmosphere in this cavernous stadium and Josh McNally provided the day's most heart-warming story by scoring a try just 10 minutes into his Premiership comeback having undergone surgery for a hole in the heart in November.\n\nScrum-half Piet van Zyl also nipped in for a try in the opening quarter in which Irish needed to make just 14 tackles to Gloucester's 71. But the game changed as soon as Gloucester got out of their own half.\n\nHooker James Hanson and wing Tom Marshall scored from Gloucester's first two attacks and they then conjured a try from nothing for flanker Lewis Ludlow after Willi Heinz wriggled free on the left. Mark Atkinson sliced through for the bonus-point try and Marshall soon got his second try of the day after Atkinson had again exploited Irish's defensive frailties.\n\nWith the game lost, Irish had no alternative but throw everything into attack. They rattled Gloucester when Theo Brophy-Clews and then Joe Cokanasiga exploited some feeble tackling but time ran out on them and it is quickly running out on their Premiership stay.\n\nGloucester's win was their first away from Kingsholm in the league in four months and it keeps them in the hunt for a play-off place.\n\n\"We are excited about the win but there's nothing to get excited about in the season yet,\" said Johann Ackermann, Gloucester head coach. \"There's work to be done before we can get a pat on the shoulder.\"\n\nMatch details\n\nScoring: 3-0 Marshall pen, 8-0 McNally try, 10-0 Marshall con, 15-0 Van Zyl try, 17-0 Marshall con, 17-5 Hanson try, 17-7 Twelvetrees con, 17-12 Marshall try, 17-14 Twelvetrees con, 17-19 Ludlow try, 17-24 Atkinson try, 17-26 Burns con, 17-31 Marshall try, 17-33 Burns con, 22-33 Brophy-Clews try, 24-33 Bell con, 29-33 Cokanasiga try.\n\nLondon Irish: J Marshall (T Bell 58), J Cokanasiga, T Fowlie (A Tikoirotuma 58), J Williams, A Lewington; T Brophy-Clews, P van Zyl (S Steele 58), B Franks (H Elrington 58), D Paice (D Porecki 55), O Hoskins (P du Plessis 58), F van der Merwe, J McNally (S de Chaves 55), A Botha, C Gilsenan (J Schatz 71), O Treviranus.\n\nGloucester: J Woodward, C Sharples, H Trinder (B Twelvetrees 49), M Atkinson, T Marshall, B Burns (B Twelvetrees 23-33), W Heinz (C Braley 77), J Hohneck (V Rapava Ruskin 63), J Hanson (M Matu'u 60), J Afoa (G Denman 74), T Savage, M Galarza (J Thrush 67), J Polledri (F Clarke 74), L Ludlow, R Ackermann.\n\nReferee: M Carley.",

Radwanska is up 4-3 on serve in the final set of that one.\n\n7:20PM Welcome\n\nEvening everyone, welcome to our live blog of this Miami Open second-round match between the world No 1 Roger Federer and the young Aussie Thanasi Kokkinakis.\n\nFederer received a bye into this stage, while Kokkinakis thumped the Frenchman Calvin Hemery 6-1, 6-2.\n\nIn theory this should be a regulation win for Federer against the world No 175, who has been ravaged by injury over the last couple of years. The only real danger for Federer would appear to be fatigue, given he's coming into Miami off the back off a gruelling Indian Wells final defeat to Juan Martin del Potro last Sunday.\n\nThere were even murmurs that had Federer won that match, and in so doing secured the No 1 ranking until the start of the clay-court season, he might have pulled out of Miami.\n\nAs it is, he's here and in need of a quarter-final berth to ensure he retains top spot ahead of his old rival Rafael Nadal.\n\nAfter his defeat to Del Potro, Federer said he was looking forward to getting going in Miami: \"It was a fun match to be part of and at the end, a well-deserved winner in Juan Martin to be honest.\n\n\"But I enjoyed looking back at it even though it hurt a bit, not making those match points.\n\n\"But it's how it goes sometimes. I feel I've been quite lucky the last year and a half, that's why I can put a better perspective on that match.\n\n\"I've recovered now as well. I feel really good going into Miami now starting on Saturday.\"\n\nKokkinakis meanwhile will be hoping a run here can propel him back towards the world's top 100 where he surely belongs.\n\nBut assuming Federer is in reasonable physical shape, it's hard to see anything but a straight sets win.",

                "title": "Ian Poulter rediscovers a bit of that old magic in time for the Masters",
                "body": "Much has been said and written about this WGC Dell Match Play being so ­inappropriately scheduled, just two weeks before that completely different Masters test at Augusta. But for Ian Poulter, the timing has been nigh-on perfect.\n\nThis is the format for which he was made. The 42-year-old won this event in 2010, as well as the Volvo World Match Play a year later, and in forming his reputation as \"Mr Ryder Cup\" he has shown a killer instinct in the mano-a-mano arena only rivalled by the game's greats.\n\nPoulter's 2&1 win over South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen in yesterday morning's round of 16 was his 27th victory in this event - and only Tiger Woods has recorded more.\n\nOn coming in, Poulter might have been down at 64th in the world rankings, with three missed cuts in his first six tournaments of the year, but he was understandably as confident as he was excited and in order to get, as he put it, \"the juices flowing again\" he dug out the putter which inspired Europe's \"Miracle of Medinah\" triumph in 2012.\n\nFor more than five years it had been gathering dust in a bag in the corner of his office, but after he cleaned it up, the wand has proved that it retains the magic. That much was evident in his success against Oosthuizen, which sent him through to the quarters to face Kevin Kisner and brought Augusta into tantalising focus.\n\nPoulter arrived here believing if he wanted to qualify for the season's first major he needed to advance to the semi-finals. And considering the fact he was ranked 58th player in the 64-man field, his quest did not seem too hopeful to the casual observer. However, to Poulter it did.\n\n\"I'm buzzing,\" Poulter said. \"I had adrenalin out there to get it done. It was a tough match for that reason. There was a lot on the line. I knew I had to get up for it and I was up. I knew I needed to throw a lot of birdies out today. I did.\"\n\nThe evidence was scrawled all over the scorecard. Poulter was eight-under for the 17 holes and even though Austin Country Club was playing easier than the previous three days - with the barest of breezes and softening greens - that was still a mighty display.\n\nNo doubt that Odyssey 7 putter played its part, especially when converting a 40-footer from off the green on the par-three fourth, but the quality of his iron play also stood out. There were four approaches to within 10 feet on the front nine and then a tee-shot to two feet on the 185-yard 11th and a wedge from 116-yards to 18-inches on the 13th. Oosthuizen, the 2010 Open champion, could only stand by and shake his head in admiration.\n\n\"You're going to be tough to beat if you make eight birdies,\" Poulter said. \"I was aware I needed that today against Louis.\"\n\nTyrrell Hatton knew exactly how Oosthuizen felt. The 26-year-old from Buckinghamshire was on the wrong end of a 2&1 scoreline to Cam Smith, who also reeled off eight birdies.\n\nThere was no shame for Hatton, as he was six-under and pushed the young Australian hard with three birdies in their last three holes. Smith eventually closed it out with a nine-footer on the par-three 17th for a two, just after ­Hatton had holed a 12-footer.\n\nSome days you simply have to doff your visor to the victor. Certainly, the 26-year-old should take only positives into the Masters from his performance in Texas.\n\nHatton, the world No 16, is skipping the Houston Open and instead will accompany Matt Fitzpatrick to Augusta for a two-day reconnaissance mission.\n\nHatton missed the Masters cut on his debut last year but in this form, making the weekend should be the very least of his ambitions.\n\nOf course, Sergio Garcia heads to Georgia as the defending champion and his game appears in good shape. The Spaniard was beaten 3&1 by Kisner but he was content enough and took great consolation in being able to return to his nearby home to see daughter Azalea, who was born two weeks ago.\n\n\"It was a solid week,\" he said. \"I guess at the end of the day a little disappointing, but I get to see my little girl.\"",

                "body": "It sounds like the plot line from an episode of Black Mirror set in a dystopian future, but China's \"social credit\" system has already seen over 12 million people slapped with domestic travel bans as punishment for bad behaviour.\n\nNine million Chinese have been banned from buying domestic flights, and three million more from buying business class tickets in early trials of the scheme, under which citizens are rated on their compliance with social norms and rules.\n\nBehaviour that triggered the bans varied from obstructing footpaths with electric bikes to failing to pay fines.\n\nZhang Yong, deputy director of the China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said the trials were taking place across China's provinces over the next two years.\n\nThe social credit system is based on the government's phrase \"once untrustworthy, always restricted\", and is set to be tested further on the country's train system from May 1, it was announced last week.\n\nFrom that date violating a new set of transport-related offences listed by the NDRC and China's Supreme Court could result in travel bans.\n\nSmoking cigarettes in no smoking areas of trains, riding a train without a correct ticket and selling counterfeit tickets were among the offences listed, that could result in 180 day bans from buying train tickets.\n\nMr Zhang said that the NDRC will \"increase the intensity of joint rewards and punishments so that dishonest people will be punished and the faithful will be motivated\".\n\nThose punished under the system will also be shamed online by having their names listed on a train ticket booking website for one week.\n\nHuman rights groups are concerned that as the system is fully implemented around 2020, it may widen its use of apps and citizens' social media behaviour to rate them, including using information about political allegiances.\n\nThe government has already worked closely with retail giant Alibaba to develop Sesame Credit, a credit score system that judges users on behaviour such as how long they play video games for and what products they buy online.\n\nJohan Lagerkvist, Chinese internet specialist at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told Wired: \"It is very ambitious in both depth and scope, including scrutinising individual behaviour and what books people are reading. It's Amazon's consumer tracking with an Orwellian political twist.\"",

                "title": "Caroline Wozniacki calls out Miami Open after family members receive death threats mid-match",
                "body": "World No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki called out the Miami Open on Saturday for failing to control a hostile atmosphere on the Stadium Court, which she said had extended to death threats against her family.\n\nWozniacki had concluded Friday night's schedule against Monica Puig, the Puerto Rican who took the singles gold medal at the Rio Olympics two years ago. Given the local demographics, Puig would naturally have expected to earn the crowd's support in Miami, where Spanish is virtually the first language.\n\nYet this went far beyond simple partisanship, according to Wozniacki. As Puig roused herself from a disastrous first set to pull off a brave comeback, winning 0-6, 6-4, 6-4 in 1hr 55min, the rowdiness and aggression inside the main Crandon Park stadium breached all reasonable bounds.\n\n\"I'm fully aware that tennis is a game of wins and losses,\" said Wozniacki in a statement that she posted on her Twitter page. \"However, during the match last night people in the crowd threatened my family, wished death upon my mom and dad, called me names that I can't repeat here and told my Fiancé's niece and nephew (who are 10 years old) to sit down and shut the f*ck up, meanwhile security and staff did nothing to prevent this and even accepted this to take place.\n\n\"I will always encourage fans to cheer for their favourite player,\" added Wozniacki, \"and I thrive on a challenging atmosphere, [but] when certain lines are crossed, it makes tennis miserable for both competitors. I hope the Miami Open chooses to take this seriously because it's a horrible example to set for the next generation of players and fans.\"\n\nThe tournament was preparing a statement in response on Saturday. The Miami Open has long been described as the South American slam, and has generated many passionate atmospheres, but behaviour of this kind has not been reported before and must surely be addressed.\n\nFriday night's crowd would have been particularly feisty because of two factors. Firstly, both the night session matches on the Stadium Court went the distance, lasting around two hours apiece, so that Puig finally completed her win at 12.45am. Secondly, both matches saw a victory for a player who inspired strong local support. Puig and Wozniacki walked on to the court after Juan Martin del Potro - who seemed to be hampered by a back problem - had struggled to a 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 victory over Robin Haase.\n\nThis is the second successive Masters tournament that has been marred by unfortunate crowd behaviour, after the Indian Wells final between del Potro and Roger Federer found both men exasperated by interruptions during their service games. \"The people are screaming when I miss a first serve!\" del Potro complained to the umpire at one point.\n\nFrom a British perspective, there was a doubles victory on Saturday for Jamie Murray and his partner Bruno Soares, who eased past their opponents Ryan Harrison and Max Mirnyi by a 6-3, 6-4 margin. This might sound like a regular day at the office, but in fact it represented a notable recovery from Murray, who revealed afterwards that he had spent the first half of last week lying on the floor.\n\n\"I woke up stiff in my lower back the day I was leaving Indian Wells,\" said Murray. \"It was like spasms, joints, discs, nerves - really uncomfortable. I was lying on the floor for three days over the weekend before I got here and could see people. I was in Scottsdale with my wife's family, so they gave me a bit of TLC. But I'm definitely over the worst of it. Compared to Wednesday, I feel a lot better.\"",

                "title": "Exclusive interview: Joseph Parker can shock the world and beat Anthony Joshua, says trainer Kevin Barry",
                "body": "Trainer Kevin Barry, the mastermind behind underdog Joseph Parker's assault on Anthony Joshua next weekend, expects \"a complete performance\" from his pupil and remains utterly convinced that the young Samoan is about to \"shock the world\" and return from Cardiff with three of the world heavyweight titles.\n\nBarry, 58, a fascinating character who employs a blend of old-school boxing ways and cutting-edge sports science, hails from New Zealand's most famous boxing family, fought Evander Holyfield in controversial circumstances at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984 - when he won a silver medal in the light-heavyweight class - and trained the rumbustious David Tua when he unsuccessfully challenged Lennox Lewis for the world heavyweight crown 18 years ago in Las Vegas. At the time, Tua had knocked out 80 per cent of his victims. That event was, Barry now feels, \"a dress rehearsal\" for this moment.\n\n\"Lennox Lewis was a great fighter, the best of that era, and was far too skilful for Tua. I was also far less experienced,\" Barry admitted to Telegraph Sport on Saturday. \"We fancied our chances of Tua catching Lewis and knocking him out because Tua had uncommon power. Even when you talk about the greatest punchers of all time, you have to have Tua in that group.\"\n\nIndeed, Tua had a left hook from hell, but Tua, in Barry's words, \"never showed up that night\".\n\n\"There was no Plan B. When he was unable to land his knockout left hook, he was lost. The occasion got to him. He bought into the hype a little bit. I was also far less experienced then myself.\"\n\nParker, he affirmed, is a different character altogether, and the two men have planned for this moment against Joshua for the past two years, after training camps in Las Vegas, where Barry has based himself for almost 20 years.\n\n\"The difference here in this fight is that Joshua is no Lennox Lewis. They were both Olympic gold medallists, of course, and you can't win one of them without a degree of skill. But I don't think he's a Lennox Lewis. He might turn out to be better than Lennox Lewis but right now you can't compare the two.\"\n\nBarry's own boxing story is intriguing. His father, also Kevin Barry, was awarded an MBE for services to boxing, having been the Olympic and Commonwealth Games coach for a number of years, and trained Barry for the Olympics, where he met Holyfield in the Los Angeles Games semi-final, which was to become highly controversial. Barry was renowned for his jab and great chin, but received multiple warnings for trying to hold Holyfield and was deducted two points for holding and for repeatedly hitting Holyfield to the back of the head. When referee Gligorije Novicic yelled break during a flurry of Holyfield punches in the second round, the American continued to punch Barry, knocking him down. Novicic disqualified Holyfield for hitting after the break. As Barry was knocked out by Holyfield's illegal punch, under health regulations he was not allowed to box for 28 days and hence pulled out of the final against Yugoslav Anton Josipovic.\n\nBarry took the silver medal, and became the first boxer in 56 years to win a medal at the Olympic Games for New Zealand. \"It took me a couple of years to get over it,\" explained Barry. \"I was a very, very proud guy. I knew I was fighting well but I knew I was coming second against a very good fighter. I walked over and lifted his hand up. I was so proud for my family and my supporters that I'd been guaranteed New Zealand's first ever medal but I felt so tainted when I got the silver and he got the bronze.\"\n\n\"Joe's met Evander. Early in his career, Evander rang me up and said he was forming this promotional company and would love to do some work with Joe down in the South Pacific. I told him we had a promoter and were on a six-year contract. A couple of times I was sitting in the car with Joe on the way back from training and the phone would ring and it would be Evander. We'd just chat away and Joe would be listening.\"\n\nBack to next weekend, and Barry is convinced that Joshua's style is perfect for his fighter. \"Joseph has always looked at his best when fighters come to him. We know Joshua will not be moving backwards.\n\n\"That's another thing that excites us about this fight. We will have him coming on to Parker's power.\n\n\"On paper, this is a very fan-friendly fight. Both these guys have been on a collision course for three years. We have known for a long time that we would be fighting Joshua as long as Joe stayed undefeated and Joshua stayed undefeated. There hasn't been a unification fight in the heavyweight division for seven years. Now we have two of the youngest world champions in heavyweight boxing, both undefeated, clashing for three heavyweight belts.\"\n\n\"This is very exciting for myself as a coach but it's very, very exciting for Joseph. It's the challenge he has always needed, fighting someone who many people believe is the best heavyweight in the world.\n\n\"It's a real challenge and a chance for Joseph to find out about himself, to find out how good he is at the highest level. Joe, I believe, has more talent than both Deontay Wilder [the WBC heavyweight champion] and Joshua. I see skill in the gym on a daily basis. My challenge to Joe is to give me a complete fight. Just to do what I know he can do. If he does that he will be very hard to defeat on March 31.\"",

Mr Bramson's past campaigns have led to an overhaul of several British companies, including fund managers Electra and F&C. He typically builds up a stake, wins fellow investor backing, deposes management teams and pursues major overhauls.\n\nBarclays declined to comment.",

                "body": "Penstemons rank among the most valuable of late-summer flowering plants.\n\nTheir elegant spires of tubular, foxglove-like flowers in tones of pink, red, white, blue and purple are perfect for adding height and colour to a well-drained, sunny border.\n\nUsed by indigenous Americans as a toothache remedy, penstemons were popular with the Victorians before falling out of fashion. Now a resurgence in pastel plantings, not to mention their excellent garden value - flowering for more than four months and until the first frost - means penstemons are back in vogue.\n\nYoung plants are best planted in spring so they establish a strong root system over the summer. In a sunny or partially shaded spot, they will grow to their full potential within two to five years. They are easily propagated, attract masses of bees and other pollinators and resist many popular garden pests like slugs and rabbits. What's not to love?\n\nThe Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has trialled more than 100 varieties at RHS Garden Wisley - including border, dwarf and mat-forming penstemons. Here are ten that have been awarded the coveted Award of Garden Merit (AGM).\n\n1. 'Hewell Pink Bedder'\n\nFlowering over a particularly long period, this clump-forming penstemon boasts bright, reddish-pink flowers with a deep red streaked white throat and silvery grey-green foliage. One of the hardier varieties.\n\n2. Penstemon 'George Home'\n\nThis striking, very free-flowering variety, with dark green contrasting leaves, grows to 70cm and flowers from June to August.\n\n3. Penstemon 'Pensham Tiger Belle Coral' (Pensham Series)\n\nFeatures particularly attractive deep-purplish-red throat markings that contrast with the pale green stems. Grows to 90cm and maintains an upright, uniform habit.\n\n4. Penstemon 'Evelyn'\n\nCompact and bushy, 'Evelyn' has damson-pink flowers that grow up to 1in long. It holds its flowers well between mid-summer and autumn and also features purple-tinged stems.\n\n5. Penstemon 'Pensham Just Jayne' (Pensham Series)\n\nConsistently floriferous from mid-summer to autumn, this is a good late-season cultivar with striking pink-magenta flowers and olive-green leaves.\n\n6. Penstemon 'Rich Ruby'\n\nSteady-flowering throughout the summer, there's a velvety texture to the rich red flowers that spring from upright, clean foliage with reddish stems.\n\n7. Penstemon 'Shoenholzeri'\n\nWith a lax habit, 'Schoenholzen' is perfect for more naturalistic planting schemes. Vibrant red-pink flowers from mid-summer to autumn contrast well with the pale green foliage. It is also frost-hardy.\n\n8. Penstemon 'Sour Grapes'\n\nThe flowers of 'Sour Grapes' have an iridescent quality, blending purple and blue shades with a whitish throat.\n\n9. Penstemon 'Hidcote Pink'\n\nA vigorous rose-coloured plant with light green and purple-tinged stems. Vigorous and growing to 90cm, it produces a uniform display.\n\n10. Penstemon pinifolius 'Wisley Flame'\n\nThis selection arose at RHS Garden Wisley as a chance seedling of Penstemon pinifolius but it has greater vigour and a richer flower colour, that ranges from bright orange to red. Grows to 60cm wide.\n\nFor more information about penstemons, to download the RHS Grower Guide or learn more about the Award of Garden Merit, visit rhs.org.uk.",

                "body": "Campaigners are calling for a national competition to design a public water fountain to make them as commonplace and iconic as British telephone and letter boxes.\n\nIn a bid to help rid the country of the scourge of plastic bottles, it is believed that water fountains could even form part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\nBen Reynolds, the deputy chief executive of the charity Sustain, claims the country needs a bold new design for a drinking fountain to replace the crumbling Victorian fountains.\n\n\"I think a new wave of water fountains could be the crux of dealing with our plastic water bottle problem, as well as our addiction to sugary fizzy drinks,\" he said.\n\n\"We should be looking to have water fountains in every single park and high street. Telephone boxes are on their way out, and letter boxes will soon follow.\n\n\"So, the public water fountain could unite people around a vision of what we want our country to be like in the years to come. A competition would also help raise public awareness about them.\"\n\nRalph Baber, trustee of the Drinking Fountain Association which was set up in 1859 when there was very little free drinking water available in London at a time when cholera was also water borne, backed the call for a competition.\n\n\"I think the reemergence of the drinking fountain is very much on the agenda. One of the big issues we've experienced is finding ones that are vandal proof,\" he said, adding that Paris has new fountains that at night automatically drop down below the pavement to avoid any unwanted attention.\n\nMr Baber said the actual fountain can cost as little as £400 with the greatest expense going on connecting the device to the water supply, pushing the final figure to about £5,000.\n\nSome major British cities have already begun building fountains in parks and high streets.\n\nBristol Water is planning to build 10 water fountains in the city this year after it estimated that 30,000 plastic bottles were saved in the first six months of its first public fountain which was installed in 2015. Last year, Hull unveiled three new drinking water fountains in the city centre.\n\nThe City of London Corporation announced at the beginning of the year that there would be a \"significant increase\" in the number of drinking fountains in the Square Mile as part of its 'Plastic Free City' project.\n\nMeanwhile, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is also drawing up plans to install fountains at popular locations around the capital.\n\n\"Britain is overflowing with pointless plastic, piling up in landfills and polluting our oceans,\" he said. \"I'm determined to take the lead and cut London's plastic waste. That's why I'm installing new drinking fountains across the capital, and encouraging shops and other venues to offer free tap water refills. I'm also looking at the potential for a bottle return scheme.\"",

This strength may give the Bank of England more confidence to raise interest rates, with the next increase expected in May.\n\nWorkers typically move jobs when they are sufficiently upbeat to give up an already secure role, taking a risk for a new one in a sign that they know more work is out there if the decision goes wrong.\n\nIt has the added benefit that new jobs tend to come with significantly higher pay packets.\n\n\"Job-to-job flow rates had continued to pick up in the fourth quarter and were now back to pre-crisis average levels, with voluntary job-to-job rates slightly above their pre-crisis average,\" said the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee in the minutes of their March meeting. \"Vacancies had also continued to pick up in the three months to February compared with the three months to November,\" they added.\n\n\"Taken together with the continued strengthening in wage growth, these measures suggested that the labour market remained tight.\"\n\nIt comes as unemployment has fallen to 4.3pc, its lowest level since the Seventies, and employment has risen to a record high.\n\nThere are also signs of pay growth slowly accelerating, with wages soon set to overtake the pace of price rises.",

                "title": "PwC accused of cheating firm out of £75m",
                "body": "The accounting giant PwC is accused of conspiring to cheat a firm of consultants out of at least £75m in a deal with the controversial mining tycoon Frank Timis, in a High Court battle over natural riches in Sierra Leone.\n\nFraser Turner alleges that PwC ­administrators sold the Marampa Mine to Timis Mining on terms that meant its rights to royalties on iron ore were breached.\n\nThe mine had been owned by Aim-listed London Mining, which went bust in 2014. Within two weeks Marampa was bought out of administration by Frank Timis, a Romania-born mining entrepreneur with a chequered history that includes a fine for misleading Aim investors in Regal, a company which he was chief executive of, and a conviction for heroin dealing in Australia.\n\nAmid mounting debate over conflicts of interest among the Big Four accountants, court documents allege that PwC held a string of different roles linked to London Mining and Mr Timis.\n\nAccording to a claim filed at the High Court in London by Fraser Turner, PwC advised a syndicate of creditors prior to the administration, and the company and senior lender Standard Chartered.\n\nIt also worked for Standard Chartered on attempts to secure new investment from third parties including Glencore, court documents claim.\n\nOnce rescue talks failed, PwC partners Peter Dickens and Russell Downs were appointed administrators. Fraser Turner alleges that when Timis Mining bought Marampa two weeks after London Mining entered administration it paid PwC a substantial sum.\n\nMr Timis gained control \"effectively for nothing other than an assumption of responsibility for the principal sum due to the secured creditors and payment of $3.5m to PwC\", according to court documents. Fraser Turner alleges that Marampa changed hands for less than it was worth.\n\nThe consultants claim that they were owed a 0.3pc royalty on iron ore from Marampa, including a $70m (£50m) stockpile that had already been mined. It is alleged that PwC's conspiracy to transfer ownership to Timis Mining cost Fraser Turner at least $106m, according to court documents.\n\nPwC denies the allegations and a trial is due later this year. PwC claims that Fraser Turner was not entitled to royalties under any new owner. Frank Timis's bid succeeded because he agreed to take on all of London Mining's £225m secured debt, whereas a refinancing ­offer from the Indian giant JSW ­demanded a steep cut in liabilities.\n\nTimis Mining demanded the transfer of Marampa on a \"clean\" basis, however, so existing contractor and supplier contracts were scrapped, according to court documents, including a 2pc royalty agreement with Blackrock. Fraser Turner's allegation that PwC received $3.5m from Timis Mining is \"scurrilous and vexatious\", defence documents claim.\n\nPwC said: \"We believe the claim is without merit and are optimistic it will be dismissed.\"",

They can chuck some rocks pretty fast.\"\n\nMr Helsel explained the river stones were his idea and were placed in classrooms two years ago having initially considered using golf balls.\n\n\"We chose to make it well known about the river stone because if it's an existing student [they will] be aware that the chances are they're going to be stoned severely if they try to do anything,\" he added.\n\n\"We didn't want our students to be helpless victims,\" he later told Reuters. \"River stones were my idea. I thought they would be more effective than throwing books or book bags or staplers.\"\n\nStudent survivors of the Florida school massacre attended a massive rally against gun violence Saturday in Washington, D.C.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School students will be required to use clear backpacks when then return to school after spring as part of new security measures to prevent another mass shooting.",

                "body": "The crowd were evidently in the mood. I have never seen such a (shall we say) well-lubricated audience at the Royal Albert Hall. They were singing lustily along before the band even took to the stage, bellowing out What's the Story (Morning Glory) by Oasis and chanting \"Leeeee-Amm! Leeee-Amm!\"\n\nThe object of their veneration, oddly, was not Liam Gallagher but a less well-known Mancunian rock hero, Liam Fray of Courteeners. When his five-piece band launched into the first of many rowdy, tub-thumping guitar anthems, the august London venue erupted into celebratory chaos, the five-thousand-strong audience punching the air, hurling themselves into spontaneous mosh pits and tossing plastic glasses of beer overhead. Courteeners, whose fans also celebrate with flares, pyrotechnics and smoke canisters, appear to employ a roadie specially designated to wipe away beer spills, lest musicians slip and hurt themselves.\n\nThere is much joy to be had in this kind of audience response. Euphoric collective release is one of the things music does well, and rock does better than most. In this age of hip hop and digital pop, there is a lot of talk of rock being dead, or at least in terminal decline. Yet Courteeners are part of a strand of bellicose indie that remains hugely popular beyond the southern metropolitan media heartland. Call it Northern Rock. Courteeners have had five top 10 British albums, but sales are concentrated north of Watford.",

                "body": "It may have seemed a little incongruous with post-Cheltenham snow still hanging about but the British turf Flat season began at Doncaster on Saturday - hardly a harbinger of spring this year.\n\nThough the Derby is only 10 weeks away, far from it being quick out of the blocks, the Flat season is a little like a hibernating tortoise which sticks its nose out of its box, sniffs the air and decides it will go back to sleep until after the Grand National has been run.\n\nIt is the early Classic trials at the Craven and Greenham meetings when it really kicks off.\n\nBut, with last season's two star performers, Cracksman and Enable, both coming back for more, we should all have a spring in our step, not just their trainer John Gosden and jockey Frankie Dettori.\n\nThough less accomplished than his stable companion, Cracksman ended the season with a higher rating (130) after his scintillating seven-length victory in the Champion Stakes.\n\nThe so-far best son of Frankel is now expected to start off in the Prix Ganay at Longchamp on April 29.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, fillies generally feel the cold a bit more than colts, so Enable (128), who won the Oaks, Irish Oaks, King George, Yorkshire Oaks, and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe last year, is pencilled in for a late May/early June start either in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh or the Coronation Cup at Epsom.\n\n\"History is against us,\" said Lord Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Khaled Abdulla, referring to her defence of the Arc, \"but it's not putting anyone off.\n\n\"Physically and mentally, she seems in good form and her big three targets will be the King George, the Juddmonte International and the Arc.\"\n\nWhile jump fans are still coming to terms with the fact that Cheltenham was dominated ostensibly by two Irish trainers, Aidan O'Brien remains out on his own on the Flat both there and in the big races here.\n\nThough former super-power Godolphin began to show green shoots of recovery, Charlie Appleby and Saeed bin Suroor are still some way off blocking the road to stop O'Brien's onward march.\n\nLast year, O'Brien sent out a record 28 Group One winners around the globe, was champion trainer in Ireland and Britain, and the horse which broke Bobby Frankel's existing record in the Racing Post Trophy, Saxon Warrior, went into winter quarters as the Guineas and Derby favourite.\n\nClemmie, the sister of last year's Guineas-Irish Guineas winner Churchill, is favourite for the 1,000 Guineas.\n\nAs for keeping it at home, Expert Eye looked head and shoulders above his contemporaries when winning the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood for Sir Michael Stoute but he was bitterly disappointing in the Dewhurst after becoming fractious in the stalls. He ran no race at all.\n\nConnections retain the faith, however, and one can assume that his trainer did not get to where he is today by hoping a stalls problem such as Expert Eye's will just go away and he will have had plenty of extra tutorials on the subject during the winter.\n\nIf there is a North-South divide over jumps, there is no such thing on the Flat and the biggest threat to O'Brien's annexation of the early Classics could come from Middleham, where Mark Johnston trains the colt Elarqam, a son of his 1,000 Guineas winning filly Attraction, and Karl Burke looks after Laurens, the Fillies' Mile winner.\n\nElarqam, another colt by Frankel, looked very good winning the Tattersalls Stakes at Newmarket in September and a proven ability to handle Newmarket is no bad thing.\n\nThe same applies to Laurens, although her breeding suggests a mile will be her minimum this year.\n\n\"Siyouni, her sire, is such an influence for speed that, at the moment, the plan is to go for the Guineas,\" said Burke.\n\n\"If, in the next month, we feel she wants further, we'd switch to the Musidora but she is not slow. Otherwise, we think the Prix de Diane, the French Oaks, is her race.\"\n\nBurke also has the sprinters Havana Grey and Unfortunately in his yard. Havana Grey may find it tough in the early part of the season because he will have to take on his elders over five furlongs but Unfortunately will be aimed at the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot.\n\nThe best race of 2017 was the Ascot Gold Cup in which the popular Big Orange beat Order of St George in a thriller.\n\nBig Orange flew out on Friday for the Dubai Gold Cup, a traditional starting point for his year, on World Cup night next Saturday.\n\nBut he and Europe's stayers have the boost of the new Weatherbys Hamilton Stayers Million to go for this year.\n\nThe £1 million bonus is for any horse who can win one of either the Sagaro, Ormonde, Yorkshire Cup or Henry II in May before landing the Gold Cup, Goodwood Cup and Lonsdale Cup. Silvestre de Sousa has a favourite's chance of retaining his champion jockey status. Only a handful have the ability and backing to win it and some of those would consider they have bigger fish to fry. De Sousa, at least, is up for it.\n\nOf course, if I had to be a pound behind one jockey at the end of the year it would be Ryan Moore.\n\nHe won more than the top two jockeys at Cheltenham combined in two minutes last Sunday when guiding Ping Hai Star to success in the Hong Kong Derby and, until the international racing returns to Hong Kong in December, Moore is likely to dominate the big-race scene.",

Our star of the show, Spring Turkey will give you all kinds of #MondayMotivation.\"\n\nSome on Twitter have suggested the supermarkets are recycling their Christmas adverts.\n\n\"No budget for a shoot - use the Christmas ad...\" @IcelandFoods #turkey #easter #lamb pic.twitter.com/qZnN4xy8uL -- Jamie Pettigrew (@JC_Pettigrew)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nJamie Pettigrew tweeted, attaching a picture of an Iceland turkey advert: \"No budget for a shoot - use the Christmas ad...\"\n\nOther supermarkets are also blurring the culinary lines between the holidays. Panettone is a traditional Christmas treat, a bread-like cake studded with dried fruit to be eaten at breakfast.\n\nHowever, Waitrose has stocked it for Easter, making a special version for the Christian holiday.\n\nThe supermarket said: \"A Christmas classic gets an egg-citing Easter makeover with our new egg shaped Waitrose Christmas Panettone.\n\n\"Our Panettone is made with a traditional sourdough recipe nurtured since 1964. This is combined with butter and chocolate and topped with pastel coloured sugar discs to make this treat look as pretty as an Easter egg!\"\n\nDutch store Hema has also been promoting an 'Easter stollen' - despite the bread being a German Christmas delicacy.\n\nIn other cases, Easter treats have taken a Christmas flavour. Aldi has broadened its range of hot cross buns to include chocolate and toffee and cranberry and orange - with sales having doubled on last year.\n\nCharles Banks, co-founder at food trends firm The Food People\n\n\"This is far more strategic than supermarkets wheeling out their old Christmas stock,\" said Charles Banks, co-founder at food trends firm The Food People.\n\n\"The UK has a uniquely competitive supermarket culture. This drives innovation as companies fight for differentiation by developing new products.\n\n\"Supermarkets are targeting consumers with food that they already associate with celebration, family time, and relaxation.\n\n\"If it proves successful this year then you should expect to see even more Easter foods with a Christmas twist next year.\"\n\nEaster this year has also been given a 'millennial' flavour, with one of the most popular offerings being an 'avocado' egg.\n\nThe chocolate treat, available at Waitrose, is shaped like half of an avocado, and has been so sought-after that many took to social media to complain that it was out of stock.\n\n'Free-from' takes on Easter favourites are also on the rise, catering for those who have cut gluten and dairy out of their diets.\n\nA Waitrose spokesperson said: \"Sales of our dairy free egg (from brand Moo Free) are up 45% on the same time last year.\"\n\nMarks and Spencer experienced a similar spike in their vegan egg sales. A spokesperson revealed: \"Sales of our Made Without Dairy Dark Chocolate Egg are up +13% on last year.\"\n\nGluten-free and dairy-free hot cross buns are also proving more popular this year.\n\nAlexa Masterson, Product Developer at Sainsbury's, said: \"We're committed to opening doors for those who have specific dietary requirements and Easter is no exception! Our Deliciously FreeFrom products, including our popular Easter Eggs and brand new Hot Cross Buns, mean that even more people are able to enjoy the celebrations together.\"\n\n\"We've seen overwhelming appetite for our Deliciously FreeFrom Hot Cross Buns which launched this year, and are now the best-selling product in our FreeFrom morning goods range.\"",

                "body": "Tens of thousands of Americans gathered across the country on Saturday at March For Our Lives rallies to demand tighter gun laws, led by survivors of last month's Florida school massacre which reignited public anger over mass shootings.\n\nStudents from the Parkland, Florida, high school where 17 people were killed on Feb. 14 were set to speak at the biggest event, in Washington, where organisers said as many as 500,000 people were expected to demonstrate near the Capitol and call on Congress to fight gun violence.\n\nThe protests aim to break a legislative gridlock that has long stymied efforts to increase restrictions on firearms sales in a nation where mass shootings at schools and colleges have become a frighteningly frequent occurrence.\n\n\"I don't want any child to be seen as another statistic,\" said Ashley Schlaeger, an 18-year-old freshman at Ohio State University who drove to the Washington rally with friends.\n\nIn the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland, thousands of people passed through police checkpoints to assemble in a park for a rally and march. Many held signs with slogans including \"Am I Next?\" \"A Call To Arms For the Safety of Our Sons and Daughters\" and \"Congress = Killers.\"\n\nAdam Buchwald, who survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the crowd he and his friends would stay focused on getting new legislation passed.\n\n\"Sadly, this could be repeated in your city or town. This stops now!\" he said to loud cheers.\n\nAt a rally in New York, a moment of silence was held for the Parkland victims. The accused gunman, 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, faces the death penalty if convicted.\n\nMore than 800 demonstrations were set to take place in US cities from Los Angeles to New York and in countries around the world, according to coordinators.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, rally organiser Jennifer Smith told a crowd of about 300 people, many of them Americans, that she could \"breathe easy\" about sending her children to school in Australia with its tough gun laws.\n\n\"I never have to worry about them having to do active shooter drills,\" she said.\n\nOrganisers of the US marches retweeted photos from sister demonstrations as far afield as Northern Ireland, Mauritius, and Stockholm.\n\nOrganisers want the US Congress, many of whose members are up for re-election this year, to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Florida rampage and to tighten background checks for gun buyers. On the other side of the debate, gun rights advocates cite constitutional guarantees of the right to bear arms.\n\nThe teenage US organisers have won kudos and cash from dozens of celebrities, with singer Ariana Grande and \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda among those performing in Washington.\n\n\"Trainwreck\" star Amy Schumer is set to appear at the Los Angeles rally. Actor George Clooney and his human rights attorney wife, Amal, have donated $500,000 and said they would be at the Washington rally.\n\nOn Friday, Republican President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that includes modest improvements to background checks for gun sales and grants to help schools prevent gun violence.\n\nDemocrats and nonpartisan groups hope to register at least 25,000 first-time voters at the rallies, potentially a boost for Democrats, who generally favor stricter gun controls.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said the administration applauded \"the many courageous young Americans\" exercising their free-speech rights on Saturday.\n\n\"Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the president's,\" said Walters, noting that on Friday the Justice Department proposed rule changes that would effectively ban \"bump stock\" devices that let semi-automatic weapons fire like a machine gun.",

No bother.\n\nDropped out of school aged 16? Sure thing.\n\nStill in primary school? Great\n\nToday we are all blue. Light v dark. Cambridge v Oxford. Let battle commence.\n\n2:58PM Boat Race preview\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt's the 164th annual boat race between Oxford University and Cambridge University.\n\nThe race takes place close to Easter each year on the River Thames between Putney and Mortlake.\n\nThe first race took place in 1829 in Henley on Thames following a challenge between old school friends.\n\nSince the second race in 1836, the contest has taken place in London.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nThe race is on Saturday, 24 March. The women's race begins at 4.31pm and the men's race follows an hour later at 5.31pm.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nLive coverage begins on BBC One from 3.50pm with Dame Katherine Grainger and Helen Glover part of their team.\n\nWhere does it start and finish?\n\nThe Boat Race course, known as the Championship Course is 4 miles, 374 yards or 6.8 Km long.\n\nIt stretches between Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in South West London.\n\nWhere else can I watch?\n\nThere are several pleasant vantage spots along the river including two bridges at Hammersmith and Putney. Other places popular among crowds are Chiswick Pier, the Emanuel School Boathouse and Dukes Meadow - which offers a view of the closing stages of the race.\n\nWho has won the most races?\n\nOxford won last year's race to reduce Cambridge's overall lead to 82-80 in the 189-year history of the event.\n\nThe only draw in the match came in 1877 with a dead heat finish.\n\nWho will be rowing?\n\nWomen's Blue Boat crews\n\nOxford Bow: Renee Koolschijn 2: Katherine Erickson 3: Juliette Perry 4: Alice Roberts 5: Morgan McGovern 6: Sarah Kushma 7: Abigail Killen Stroke: Beth Bridgman Cox: Jessica Buck\n\nCambridge Bow: Tricia Smith 2: Imogen Grant 3: Kelsey Barolak 4: Thea Zabell 5: Paula Wesselmann 6: Alice White 7: Myriam Goudet-Boukhatmi Stroke: Olivia Coffey Cox: Sophie Shapter\n\nMen's Blue Boat crews\n\nOxford\n\nIain Mandale, bow (St Edmund Hall) Felix Drinkall, 2 (Lady Margaret Hall) Will Cahill, 3 (Christ Church) Anders Weiss, 4 (St Hugh's) Will Geffen, 5 (Keble) Benedict Aldous, 6 (Christ Church) Claas Mertens, 7 (Christ Church) Vassilis Ragoussis, stroke (Linacre) Zachary Thomas, cox (Wolfson).\n\nCambridge\n\nPatrick Elwood, bow (Magdalene) Charles Fisher, 2 (St John's) Dara Alizadeh, 3 (Hughes Hall) James Letten, 4 (Hughes Hall) Spencer Furey, 5 (Jesus) Finn Meeks, 6 (Hughes Hall) Rob Hurn, 7 (St Edmund's) Freddie Davidson, stroke (Emmanuel) Hugo Ramambason, cox (Trinity)\n\nWhat is the weather forecast?\n\nInclement weather has caused havoc at the Boat Race over the decades, with boats sinking in 1951, 1978 and 1981.\n\nLast year, the race threatened to be postponed when an un-exploded World War II bomb was discovered near the start-line.\n\nThere are no such concerns for Saturday's event despite the recent 'Beast from the East', with a high temperature of a mild 9°C, light winds and about a 10% chance of light rain.\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nCambridge 4/9 Oxford 7/4 Draw 100/1",

                "body": "Mount Etna, Europe's largest and most active volcano, is slowly sliding towards the Mediterranean Sea, scientists have observed.\n\nThe entire 3,350m (11,000ft) stratovolcano, located on the east coast of the Italian island of Sicily, is currently moving downslope at an average rate of 14 mm per year - or 1.4 metres over 100 years.\n\nExperts have warned the sliding could eventually lead to greater risk of large scale slope failure, which could trigger landslides, however researchers at The Open University emphasised there is currently no sign of that happening.\n\nDr John Murray, lead author of the paper published in the Bulletin of Volcanology, stressed the minute movement currently posed no danger to life, but warned that monitoring the volcano for more significant changes was crucial.\n\n\"At the moment there is no cause for concern from the sliding of the volcano towards the sea, the movement is just too small,\" Dr Murray told The Telegraph. \"However, the possibility of things changing in the future needs to be taken seriously, so it is important to keep monitoring the movement.\"\n\nThe UK-led team found the sliding is lubricated by the weak sediments beneath Etna and the slope of the basement.\n\nDr Murray, who has been working for nearly 40 years studying the active volcanoes of Mount Etna, said if a sector collapse were to occur, the results could be \"catastrophic\".\n\n\"Around one million people live on Etna and its immediate surroundings, so the destruction of property and loss of life could be catastrophic; but I cannot emphasise enough that there is no sign of this happening at the present time,\" he explained.\n\n\"Clearly even the mention of such a dangerous event would be very unnerving for the people who live on Etna, so I am anxious that they don't get the wrong impression.\"\n\nIt is the first time basement sliding of an entire active volcano has been directly observed, with the team suggesting that similar edging may be taking place at other active volcanoes such as Mexico's Volcán de Colima and Mount Teide in Tenerife.\n\nDr Murray said he did not expect the rate of movement to increase, but added: \"I regard it as essential to keep measuring our stations, and will be on the lookout for any kind of change in rate of downslope sliding.\"",

                "body": "Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont faces arrest in Finland after authorities there received an international warrant for his detention issued by Spain, the latest legal action against separatist politicians from the wealthy northeastern region.\n\nIf he returns to Spain, Puigdemont faces up to 25 years in prison on charges of rebellion and sedition for his part in organising an illegal referendum on secession last year.\n\nWhen police reach Puigdemont, a normal extradition process will begin, though they currently have no knowledge of his whereabouts, Finnish authorities said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIn an interview with Spanish radio station Catalunya Radio earlier, Puigdemont's lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, had said his client was prepared to present himself to Finnish police.\n\nPuigdemont went into self-imposed exile in Belgium last year, shortly after the Catalan parliament made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain. He arrived in Finland on Thursday to meet lawmakers and attend a conference.\n\nOn Friday, Spanish supreme court judge Pablo Llarena ruled a total of 25 separatist politicians, including Puigdemont, would face trial for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state.\n\nOf those, five were sent on Friday to pre-trial jail, among them Jordi Turull, a close ally of Puigdemont who was due to be put forward for a second vote on Saturday to become the next regional president.\n\nWith Turull in jail and unable to attend the session for which his presence is a requirement, Catalan parliament speaker Roger Torrent cancelled the vote on Saturday, holding in its place a debate that at several points became heated and saw members of one opposition party abandon the chamber in protest.\n\nSpeaking after the debate, accompanied by various other heads of parties and in front of a crowd of supporters, Torrent described Madrid's legal action as an \"attack on the heart of democracy.\"\n\n\"Locking up people for their political ideas and pursuing those that refuse to renounce them is to put an end to the freedom of political thought,\" Torrent said, calling on Catalan politicians to form a broad coalition in opposition to Madrid's actions.",

Despite months of careful work, many of the bodies that were eventually buried in the Islands' Argentine military cemetery bore plaques simply stating \"Argentine soldier known unto God\".\n\nYet 35-years-later the retired colonel will on Monday return to the islands alongside hundreds of relatives of the Argentine dead, after Red Cross forensic experts were able to build on his painstaking efforts in order to formally identify 90 bodies.\n\nHis compassion for the dead of his former enemy and his efforts to ensure that mothers and fathers should know where their sons are buried have seen the 68-year-old feted in Argentina.\n\nHe and the relatives will take rare direct flights from Argentina to the Islands to the hillside cemetery near Darwin to see the anonymous plaques replaced with names.\n\n\"I would have never imagined 35 years later that we would achieve this kind of success,\" he said. \"It's formidable, miraculous.\"\n\nThe Royal Dragoon Guards officer arrived with military headquarters in the aftermath of the fighting and found himself tasked with looking after discipline, but also dealing with Argentine bodies as they were found.\n\nIn all, 649 Argentine and 255 British soldiers, sailors and airmen died in the 10-week war.\n\nSupervised Argentine prisoners were at first responsible for collecting and burying their dead. But the prisoners went home and bodies kept being found almost daily, mainly by engineers trying to make the island safe.\n\nThe bodies were at first \"summarily buried\" in temporary graves where they could be found and retrieved later. When the Argentine government refused to repatriate any of the bodies, arguing they were already on Argentine soil, Margaret Thatcher decided to place them in a purpose built cemetery.\n\nCol Cordozo, who left the Army in 2004, was given the job of organising it, and collecting all the bodies, using a team of staff from undertakers.\n\nHis careful records of which remains were found where, as well as his far-sighted decision to bury each body in three body bags, meant that when the forensic experts exhumed the bodies last year, they were able to easily identify them from DNA evidence.\n\nHe said: \"At the time, I realised, God, we are not going to be able to identify half these guys. I have got to wrap them up not in just one body bag, I have got to put them in three body bags so that they will perhaps be preserved for the next few years when we want to exhume them.\n\n\"I don't know what went through my head, I'm not a scientist, I didn't know this was going to happen, I just had a hunch that perhaps this was the way to keep them.\n\n\"It really just peeved me to bury these guys with their mums not knowing about it.\"",

                "title": "From crime to grime - how Hackney Wick FC are challenging gang culture in inner London",
                "body": "Bobby Kasanga remembers precisely what it was that first drew him into crime. \"Trainers,\" he says. \"My brother was big in local gangs and was buying new trainers all the time. His were always box fresh. Me, I still had the same pair I'd had for two years. I wanted shoes like his. I wanted some of his status. Simple as that.\"\n\nA bright, articulate teenager, doing well in his studies, reckoned a real prospect of a footballer, Kasanga still found the lure of easy money from crime impossible to resist. He wanted those trainers.\n\n\"I had everything going for me: college, football, I had a good part-time job. It should have been enough. I should have been leading a productive life. Instead I spent most of my 20s doing time.\"\n\nIt is a pattern he sees being played out across modern London: black teenagers succumbing to criminal temptation when they could offer so much.\n\nThe city, he reckons, is littered with squandered opportunity, wasted potential, lives torpedoed by crime. Which is why, three years ago, when he came out of prison for what he was determined would be the last time, he decided he was going to do something about it.\n\n\"Basically, I wanted to use my experience to make a difference.\"\n\nThe vehicle he chose was football. He might not have progressed as far in the game as his half-brother Medy Elito, the Cambridge United winger. But, in between spells in prison, he played for many a non-League club, from Fisher Athletic to East Thurrock, from Corinthian Casuals to Ashford. And during his time patrolling the semi-pro game, he noted that in his home borough of Hackney there was not a single club that played above tier seven. So, he decided when he left prison to set one up.\n\nIn January 2015, he established Hackney Wick FC. And, within three seasons, thanks to his tireless enthusiasm, energy and skill in accessing funds, the first team are playing semi-professionally in the Middlesex Senior League, there is a women's team and the club have 250 junior playing members. This season they played in the FA Cup for the first time and drew over 750 for a derby with Clapton FC. And their founder has ambition to climb much higher.\n\n\"I see AFC Wimbledon as our role model,\" he says. \"Twenty years ago, they didn't exist. Now they are in League One with a new stadium planned. Given where we've got in three years, I can't see why we shouldn't be thinking of doing the same.\"\n\nThe point about Hackney Wick, their founder says, is that they were not established as an ordinary club. They are ones with a message. This was a club set up to challenge the supremacy of crime, to give proper alternative to gang culture. By locking the club into the community, the intention is to address the growing dislocation between the youth and the mainstream where criminality festers. Thus everyone who joins has to guarantee to do a minimum of two hours a month voluntary work in Hackney.\n\nAt the Hackney half-marathon run through the borough last June, the players manned the drinks stations. Every week, \"Wickers\", as the members of the club are known, visit old people. They have played against prison teams. Only by reaching out, Kasanga says, can they help themselves.\n\n\"We have a collective ambition to represent our borough positively,\" he says. \"We've got more than 250 people playing for us. Yeah, maybe they'd be playing elsewhere. But when they come here we can try to deliver our message. And when it comes to being anti-crime, one thing I can do is point out I've been there. I know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nUNITED AGAINST KNIFE CRIME EARLY BIRD TICKETS OUT NOW. SEARCH ANTI KNIFE CRIME MATCH. FEATURING ALL STAR LINE OF UK GRIME AND RAP STARS.

Watching him in action at a Friday evening training session, when hundreds of junior players spin out across floodlit pitches in the middle of the borough, is to see someone who commands absolute respect.\n\nHis charisma is extraordinary. When he tells them some of his stories, their eyes widen.\n\nHe remembers, for instance, being on the team bus about to make his debut for Ashford in the Ryman League, when his phone rang. He knew his fellow gang members were planning a robbery on a security van (\"everyone in London was doing security vans at the time,\" he says). But the call told him that, after the raid, there had been a row about splitting the proceeds during which his best mate had been stabbed to death.\n\nThe following week, in the attempt to conduct a revenge shooting on the guy who had wielded the knife, an innocent party was shot dead. He was nowhere near it, but Kasanga was reckoned the prime suspect for the killing and arrested. Because he had an alibi (he was at football training) he was bailed.\n\n\"At this point, any normal human being would have seen the signs and knocked it on the head,\" he recalls. \"Not me. I was a right idiot. I continued robbing.\"\n\nIn 2007, he was caught and sentenced to five years. When he came out, he took up where he left off, subsidising his football with the proceeds of crime.\n\n\"At one point, I messed up probation and had to go on the run. I was playing under an assumed name. And still I hadn't learned my lesson.\"\n\nIn 2011 he was caught in the act once more. He was sentenced to a further five years. And this time he finally saw the light. While in prison, he took an Open University degree in criminology and began to plan for a new, crime-free life outside. One which could help the next generation not make the mistakes he did.\n\n\"I knew the one thing that can really challenge crime in grabbing kids' attention is football. Listen, it doesn't always work. One of our players has just been sent to prison for 18 years. People are still falling through the net. It's not an overnight process.\"\n\nBut Kasanga is working tirelessly to make things happen. Backed by a local property development company which pays him to run the club, he is forever seeking out new ways to secure funding for more programmes. In the midst of a relegation fight exacerbated by weather-related postponements, last month he contacted William Hill to see if it might sponsor the club. So intrigued was the bookmaker by his story, it offered him the services of Robbie Savage, to play for the Wick as a publicity stunt in the last few matches of the season. Unfortunately, Savage declined the opportunity.\n\n\"I think he thought he'd be a target for a kicking,\" says Kasanga. \"Probably right.\"\n\nOther celebrities are less nervous of engagement with the club. On June 29, at their new home ground at the warm-up track next to the Olympic Stadium, Hackney Wick will play against a team of leading grime artists in an anti-knife crime match. Dave, Not3s and Dappy are among the rappers who will be playing.\n\n\"It is going to be huge,\" Kasanga reckons. \"And what a message it is going to send out. Grime and football: if you want your message to reach the youth, there is no better way of doing it.\"\n\nHackney Wick FC is living proof of that.",

                "body": "Flags were flown at half-mast in gendarme stations across France as the country honoured the officer declared a national hero by President Emmanuel Macron after he swapped himself for a hostage and was killed by an Islamist gunman.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" Mr Macron said. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old Lieutenant Colonel in the gendarmerie died in hospital overnight from gun wounds after he offered himself in exchange for a hostage held by an attacker holed up in a supermarket in the southwestern town of Trèbes on Friday.\n\nUnbeknownst to his Morocco-born captor, who had by then killed three people in a shooting spree and wounded 16 more, he left his mobile phone on so police outside could hear what was happening inside the store.\n\nThey stormed the building when they heard gunfire and shot dead the hostage-taker. But Mr Beltrame was wounded in the intervention and died hours later.\n\nTributes to the dead officer, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and was decorated in 2007 after serving in Iraq, flooded in on Saturday morning as the country woke to the news of his death.\n\nThe president was among the first to respond, with a long statement listing the gendarme's glittering career - which included four years handling security at the Elysée - and saying he \"deserved the respect and admiration of the entire nation.\"\n\nThe officer's name was the top trending hashtag on the French edition of Twitter, with members of the public in France and around the world paying tribute to what many of them called a \"true hero.\"\n\nThe name of the 25-year-old Islamist hostage-taker, Redouane Lakdim, who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State, was the second most used term on Twitter.\n\nIt was General Richard Lizurey, the director general of the national gendarmerie, who ordered the French tricolour to be flown at half-mast at stations across the country, saying he wanted to pay \"solemn homage to the heroism of our comrade.\"\n\nLocals placed flowers on the ground outside the barracks in the town of Carcassonne where Mr Beltrame was based.\n\n\"He gave his life for someone else, for a stranger,\" said the officer's brother Cédric. \"He departed as a hero.\"\n\nMr Beltrame's mother, speaking late on Friday while her son was still fighting for his life in hospital, said that when she heard the news that a gendarme had swapped himself for a hostage, she immediately \"knew it was him.\"\n\n\"He's always been like that. He is someone... who would do anything for his country,\" she said.\n\nMr Beltrame, who was married with no children, graduated from France's elite Saint-Cyr military academy in 1999.\n\nHe later trained for the elite GIGN police force that specialises in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue, and at one point trained to become a military freefall parachutist, a type of high-altitude parachuting most often carried out by special forces.\n\nHe worked as an advisor at the ecology ministry for three years before going back to field work last year in the Aude region where his final - and fatal - intervention took place on Friday.\n\nMr Beltrame had organised a training session in the region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nInvestigators probing Friday's attack will focus on establishing how the gunman, who was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing, got his weapon and how he became radicalised.\n\nTwo people have been detained over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and one friend of his, a 17-year-old male, the Paris prosecutor's office said.",

                "body": "The seasons dominate the British countryside. The new leaves and buds of spring, the blazing skies of summer, the golden leaves of autumn and the frozen earth of winter - and National Trust properties around the country showcase the seasons to their best advantage.\n\nThe Trust is responsible for nearly 613,000 acres of land, almost 775 miles of coastline and more than 300 historic buildings across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, so whether you want to see ancient woods, dramatic clifftops or landscaped gardens, you're spoilt for choice when it comes to finding a walk at a National Trust property. A new guide, Great British Seasonal Walks, features 100 walks on National Trust property, divided by season. Here are some of our favourites for spring.\n\nSalcombe Hill to Sidmouth Circular Walk\n\nSalcombe Hill, Sidmouth, Devon EX10 0NY\n\nOS Map: Landranger 192\n\nStart/End: National Trust Salcombe Hill car park, OS grid ref: SY 148889\n\nDistance: 5 miles\n\nTime: 3 hours\n\nThis spectacular circular walk showcases the Regency town of Sidmouth. Starting with the stunning views across the Sid Valley, the walk takes you down into Sidmouth town through the woods and fields of Salcombe Hill and then upriver through The Byes, Sidmouth's lovely, tranquil riverside park. A walk in the spring provides an outstanding display of bluebells in the woodland of Soldier's Hill as well as being a wonderful time of year to enjoy the Devon coast.\n\nLook out for... views of the Jurassic Coast\n\nCovering around 95 miles, the Jurassic Coast stretches from Exmouth to Studland Bay, and spans 185 million years of geological history. Coastal erosion has exposed rock formations that form an almost continuous sequence from the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, providing evidence that over time the area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marshland.\n\nBetween the village of Sidford and the Old Toll House of Sidmouth, The Byes riverside walk stretches one-and-a-quarter miles. You might spot dippers, kingfishers, tawny owls and even otters playing in and around the fast-flowing river.\n\nTake the path past the picnic tables and follow the Salcombe Hill Cliff and Link to Coast Path sign. Follow the footpath to the cliff where you can enjoy fantastic views of Sidmouth and beyond. Follow the path to the right, then take a path on the left signposted \"Coast Path Sidmouth ⅔ mile\". Go down through a small woodland and across a field. Turn right at the end by the Coast Path. At a junction, turn left onto Laskeys Lane then continue along the footpath next to West Combe House and into Cliff Road. Follow the footpath to the left down the hill and across a temporary bridge over the mouth of the river Sid. Turn right and head inland along the left side of The Ham (a small park), past a seascape mural. Continue along the path and then straight ahead along the National Cycle Network path along Riverside Road. Turn right onto Mill Street by the car park and cross over a footbridge at the ford before continuing along Milford Road. At the junction, cross the road and enter The Byes riverside park. Follow the path upriver along the side of the river Sid, crossing over the third bridge, signposted Sidford. Walk upriver towards Sidford through Margaret's Meadow and the Gilchrist Field until you reach a cycle path junction. Turn right following the \"Fortescue ¼\" mile sign crossing a bridge and through some gates, and out onto Fortescue Road. Turn left and follow a quiet road before turning right into Griggs Lane towards Salcombe Regis. Follow lane and woodland path up the hill, through a kissing gate marked \"Soldier's Hill ¼ mile\". At the end of the path continue across the field and through another kissing gate onto Salcombe Hill Road.\n\nTurn right, then left at the war memorial. Take the path to the right through the SVA Allotment Field Wood kissing gate; turn right following the Link Path to Salcombe Hill sign. Follow the path around to the right and down some steps, then follow the sign marked \"Link Path Salcombe Hill\". Turn left and then right at the Salcombe Hill and car park sign. Turn right next to a barn and follow the track back to the car park. Leigh Woods Woodland Wander\n\nLeigh Woods National Nature Reserve, Bristol BS8 3PL\n\nOS Map: Landranger 154\n\nStart/End: North Road entrance, OS grid ref: ST 555730\n\nDistance: 1 mile\n\nTime: 30-45 mins\n\nThis walk runs through beautiful woodland with rare and veteran trees as well as grassland. In spring the woods are covered in a carpet of bluebells - a must-see at this time of year. Stokeleigh Camp hill fort is perched on the edge of the Avon Gorge and there are dramatic views along the river.\n\nLook out for... rare trees\n\nLeigh Woods has long been recognised for its rich natural environment, including an abundance of rare whitebeam trees. They contain nearly every indigenous tree in the country, and offer a foliage of singular varied tint, from the darkest yew to the pale light green of lime and oak. The woodland in spring, when the trees are coming into leaf, is a stunning sight.\n\nGo through the kissing gate and up the sunken track straight ahead. This brings you out onto an open grassy area. Cross this, sticking to the right-hand side. You'll walk past a line of whitebeam trees.\n\nTake the small path that runs along the top of the valley and straight on to another grassy area. Ahead of you are the ramparts of Stokeleigh Camp, an Iron Age hill fort. Follow the narrow rocky path through these; it can be slippery. Follow the grassy path straight ahead for 200m to the viewpoint. Turn left and follow the path along the gorge side for 300m, back through the ramparts and past a fenced pond. Turn left onto the Purple Trail, where you can see the dramatic sweep of the ramparts. Turn right and follow the Purple Trail to the stone wall.\n\nWhen you reach the parish wall leave the Purple Trail and turn left following the stone wall. Go straight through the gate after 200m and join the Blue Trail. Follow the Blue Trail straight ahead. Once you reach the ancient yew that grows in the line of the wall, the path should curve away from the wall. Carry on past the low wooden building, the National Trust office. Follow the gravel road and look out for the blue-topped waymarker on the left.\n\nFollow the Blue Trail back downhill to the start. Sissinghurst Castle Estate Walk\n\nSissinghurst Castle, Biddenden Road, near Cranbrook, Kent TN17 2AB\n\nOS Map: Landranger 188; Explorer 136\n\nStart/End: National Trust car park, OS grid ref: TQ 807384\n\nDistance: 3 miles\n\nTime: 1 hour 30 mins\n\nThe estate is set in 460 acres of beautiful Wealden countryside that comes to life during the spring. Crocuses and daffodils start the season off in a flurry, dotted around the woodland and in the surrounding fields. April sees the bluebells come into their own, creating a carpet of purple amongst the trees.\n\nLook out for... the Gazebo and the Tower\n\nThe Gazebo, in the corner of the garden, looks out over the estate and Wealden countryside. It was built as a memorial to Harold Nicolson (author, politician and husband of the writer Vita Sackville-West). Built in the 16th century, the Tower was used as a viewing platform for deer hunts on the 700-acre deer park surrounding the Elizabethan house.\n\nFrom the car park follow the path towards the castle. Walk to the left of the castle and continue along the moat, following it round to the right at the Gazebo. Continue along this path, through a gate and downhill towards the lake. At the bottom of the field, go through the gate and turn left around the Lower Lake. After crossing the second bridge, turn right and continue along the Ride through the traditional coppice woodland. After 350m bear left then right and continue 420m along the ride until you reach the edge of the woodland. Turn right down a narrow path and cross a stile into Park Field. Bear left across the parkland, taking in the views of the castle. At the next stile cross the drive and enter Bull and Birches Woods. Follow the path for 60m, then turn right along a public footpath up the field. At the top turn right, pass through the second double gate then bear diagonally left across the Orchard. Join the bridleway, passing the vegetable plots on your right and continue along this track. Turn right into the field and follow the margin until you come to a gate. Bear right onto the lane and follow this to the next gate on your right. Go through this gate onto the path, continuing over the stream back to the castle. Melford Hall to Lavenham Railway Walk\n\nLong Melford, Sudbury, Suffolk CO10 9AA\n\nOS Map: Landranger 155\n\nStart: Melford Hall car park, OS grid ref: TL 867462\n\nEnd: Lavenham Guildhall, OS grid ref: TL 916493\n\nDistance: 4.5 miles\n\nTime: 2 hours\n\nThis walk provides the opportunity to see wild flowers, birds and animal wildlife in their natural habitat - and springtime is one of the best times of year to do this. Starting and finishing in these two well-preserved medieval \"wool\" towns, you can return to Long Melford by bus, or retrace your steps - if you have the energy.\n\nLook out for... the railway line\n\nThe line (single track with passing places) from Melford to Bury St Edmunds opened in 1865. The line closed to passengers in 1961 but continued to be open for goods traffic until 1966; the line closed completely in 1967. Long Melford Railway station building still exists, (now a private house) and is located at the southern end of the village by the Old Maltings. This walk largely follows the route of the old Great Eastern Railway. Selected areas of the banks of this cutting are being returned to grass, and others left as semi-natural woodland. The grassland provides a valuable habitat for insects and wildlife.\n\nMany species have been recorded along this disused railway line, including common and lesser whitethroat, blackcap, goldcrest, treecreeper, bullfinch, garden warbler and marsh tit, along with pied flycatcher, redstart, whinchat, firecrest, red warbler, waxwing, little egret and red kite.\n\nFrom the car park, turn right out of the gate and walk 600m to the Cherry Lane Garden Centre. Entering it, look for the public footpath sign in front of you, known as Hare Drift. Hare Drift continues along a concrete path until joining the main A134 Sudbury to Bury St Edmunds road. Cross it with care, go through the gate on the opposite side and follow the footpath, which after 90m continues downhill. At the bottom of the hill turn left and follow the tree line ignoring a footpath sign to the left. Exit through the trees on the right-hand side after about another 100m or so. Continue across a small bridge over Chad Brook, heading uphill until exiting into a plain with scrub to the right. You can see signs now covered with scrub, showing where the path was/should be. Head up the plain for about 180m keeping the scrub to your right, until the path runs alongside some woodland to the left. Follow the path for 360m until reaching a path crossroads. The section after this is a permissive footpath; dogs should be on leads. Keep on for about another 180m or so until the path rises up to the old railway embankment as you enter Lineage Wood to your left and Paradise Wood to your right. This is the site of an 1891 railway derailment. When exiting the woodland/embankment, the route to follow is directly opposite you, but you will need to walk along the line of trees to your left, circumnavigating the open field until you reach the narrow entrance in the wood to your front. Follow the wooded path until you reach a section of railway cutting designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). You will have reached the end of the SSSI section when reaching the Bridge Street railway bridge. The next section is now known as the Lavenham Walk. Continue on the Lavenham Walk until reaching some gates and the Park Road crossing. Crossing the road, go through the gates, and continue on for approximately 440m until reaching Lavenham High Street. Cross the road and continue right up High Street, for 270m; turn left into Market Lane, walk up to the Market Square and Lavenham Guildhall. Spring Walk at Croome\n\nNational Trust Croome Visitor Centre, near High Green, Worcester, Worcestershire WR8 9DW\n\nOS Map: Landranger 150\n\nStart/End: National Trust Croome Visitor Centre, OS grid ref: SO 888451\n\nDistance: 4 miles\n\nTime: 1 hour 30 mins - 2 hours\n\nThis relaxing circular walk around the outer parkland at Croome offers superb views across the Worcestershire countryside to the Malvern Hills and great spots to see Croome's spring flora and fauna.\n\nLook out for... the Chinese Bridge\n\nThis is an exact replica of the original bridge, created using images from a painting by Richard Wilson in 1758 of Croome and also a book from 1749 called Developments in Architecture and Carpentry.\n\nFrom the visitor centre, follow the path through the Wilderness Walk shrubbery (look out for flowering bulbs) to a gate, which brings you to the top of Church Hill. Walk around the front of the church and pass through a gate into Church Shrubbery. Follow the path, passing the hide on your left. Follow the path, crossing a road. Continue until you reach the Rotunda. Follow the path to the right down through the Home Shrubbery to the gate at the bottom. Enter the park and follow the path to the right towards the court and the Chinese Bridge. From the bridge, staying on the court side of the river, follow the mown path alongside the river for just under a mile until you reach a stile. If you are lucky you will see a kingfisher or a heron. Cross the stile and walk clockwise around the pool. Cross over a small bridge. Turn left across a wooden platform into the shelter belt - a wooded area where you might spot muntjac deer. Follow the path for about a mile through the woods until you reach the end of the shelter belt. At a National Trust sign turn right, go through the gate and turn right into the field, follow the fence along the shelter belt back in the direction you have walked. You will reach three gates on the right, go through the gates until you reach the farm road. Turn left and walk along this road until you see a large gate on the right back into the park. Go through it, turn left and on the left you will see another gate into the lake area. Enter the lake area and follow the path to the right past the remains of the derelict Boat House. Whilst walking around the lake, look out for spring flowering primroses, daffodils and bluebells. Where you meet the main path round the lake, turn left and cross the two white bridges linking the island to the main path. Follow the path around the lake, past the Grotto, until you reach the Dry Arch Bridge. Turn left under it and follow the path, past the Temple Greenhouse. Continue through the shrubbery back to the church and the visitor centre. Newton Pool Coastal Walk\n\nLow Newton, Northumberland NE66 3EH\n\nOS Map: Landranger 75, Explorer 340\n\nStart/End: Low Newton car park, OS grid ref: NU 239248\n\nDistance: 1 mile\n\nTime: 30-40 mins\n\nEnjoy a gentle walk alongside the Northumberland coast with plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities along the way. In spring thousands of birds arrive for the start of the breeding season.\n\nLook out for... Dunstanburgh Castle\n\nSavour the great views of the magnificent ruin of Dunstanburgh Castle to the south and, on a clear day, the distant Farne Islands to the north.\n\nOystercatchers and other shore birds may be visible around the Emblestones, an outcrop of hard volcanic rock protecting Newton Haven from the ravages of the North Sea. Sometimes seals can be spotted basking at the far end of the rocks.\n\nStart at the car park above Low Newton. Head downhill to the village square. Low Newton is an 18th-century fishing hamlet, with whitewashed cottages and a historic pub. At the square take the right-hand turn, following the road by the National Trust information board. Turn left behind the Ship Inn and follow the road south, past the back of the cottages, parallel with the seashore. Continue past the Boat Park, checking the field to your right for wetland and coastal birds on the muddy scrape. Continue past Risemoor Cottage, a former fisherman's pub, through a small woodland path until you see two wildlife hides facing into the waters at Newton Pool. Continue southward; after about 30m the path forks. Take the left track past some beach bungalows in the dunes. Head for the centre of the green space where a waymarker shows the path through bracken leading to the beach. Take in the views of Dunstanburgh Castle before turning left on the beach and heading back toward the village. Dudmaston Hall and Dingle Walk\n\nDudmaston Estate, Quatt, near Bridgnorth, Shropshire WV15 6QN\n\nOS Map: Explorer 218\n\nStart/End: National Trust Orchard car park, OS grid ref: SO 746887\n\nDistance: 0.8 mile\n\nTime: 40 mins\n\nSurrounded by traditional woodland and a lakeside garden, Dudmaston Hall has been a family home since the 17th century and offers lovely walks teeming with history and wildlife. Bluebells are a favourite at Dudmaston, and this walk provides the opportunity to spot these pretty springtime blooms, together with daffodils and snowdrops - depending on the timing of your visit.\n\nLook out for... the Dingle\n\nThe wooded valley was a pet project of Francis Whitmore who, along with her husband William, resided in Dudmaston between 1775 and 1815 - she was a keen botanist. Together with Walter Wood, their head gardener, they created a picturesque route over rustic bridges and past waterfalls, urns and a hermitage.\n\nDudmaston is home to a variety of species. Dippers, grass snakes and dragonflies are regular visitors to Dudmaston's rivers and pools and there are signs of otters. The orchard is the perfect place to relax.\n\nLeave the orchard car park via the kissing gate at the entrance. Turn right and follow the signs downhill to the Dingle. Proceed through the gate and follow the trail downhill. Go through a second gate and enter the woods. Take the steps to your right before you reach the brook. Continue along the path passing the Rustic Bridge on your left. Crossing the bridge takes you on one of many other walks in the grounds of Dudmaston Hall. Follow the trail along the forested riverbanks of the Dingle. After passing the Mill Pool on your left you will reach the Big Pool Dam. Take the path to the right, signposted for Dudmaston. Continue along the banks of the Big Pool, passing the Boat House as you go. Enter the pedestrian gate and cross the meadow towards the hall. At the marked gate, you may enter the garden and make your way to the hall, or turn right and continue up the hill to your starting point at the car park. Yockenthwaite to Cray Wildlife Walk\n\nUpper Wharfedale, Yockenthwaite, North Yorkshire BD23 5JH\n\nOS Map: Landranger 98\n\nStart/End: Yockenthwaite Bridge, OS grid ref: SD 904790\n\nDistance: 6 miles\n\nTime: 2 hours\n\nDiscover a landscape of limestone pavement, glaciated valleys and flower-rich hay meadows in the glorious setting of the Yorkshire Dales. Springtime is when the flowers begin their dazzling display and the birds start to breed.\n\nLook out for... wild flowers and bird life\n\nThe first signs of spring arrive with wood anemones, primroses, lesser celandines and the smell from the wild garlic; later in the spring cowslips, mountain pansies and early purple orchids start to appear. These flowers then start to support the dormant insect population. Bees that have spent the winter hibernating in holes in trees and the gaps in drystone walls emerge looking for some sweet early nectar.\n\nThere is a strong bird population in Upper Wharfedale - you will begin to hear and see oystercatchers, lapwing and curlew in March with the wintering blackhead gulls beginning to show their distinctive (black head) breeding summer plumage. From April onwards, you will begin to notice the golden plover and skylarks on the fell tops on Buckden Pike.\n\nStart at Yockenthwaite (meaning \"Eoghan's clearing in a wood\") Bridge and follow the footpath signposted to Scar House. Turn right off the farm track at another footpath sign, going through Strans Wood and emerge onto the open hillside. In 1652, George Fox, the founder of the Quakers, stayed at Scar House and \"converted the farmer to the Quaker Truth\". The house later became a Quaker meeting place. A small enclosure with five trees marks an old burial ground. Continue towards Cray, keeping the woodland boundary on your right. (For a shorter walk, turn right at Scar House and follow the track into Hubberholme). Enjoy the view down Wharfedale's glaciated valley with its wide floor and ice-carved steep sides. Cross Crook Gill and carry on through hay meadows to Cray. Hay is a valuable crop to farmers and it can suffer if trampled by too many feet, so please walk in single file. Drop down to your right when entering Cray and follow a footpath along Cray Gill to a road. Turn right and walk along it for a quarter-of-a-mile until you reach Hubberholme. Return to Yockenthwaite via a footpath behind Hubberholme Church and follow this route beside the river Wharfe all the way back. There are lots of other interesting places to discover around here. If you have time, walking three miles extra will take you to Buckden. Take the fellside path across the stepping stones from Cray to get there. Take the riverside path from Buckden to Hubberholme to rejoin this walk. 'Capability' Brown Walk at Dinefwr\n\nDinefwr Park, Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire SA19 6RT\n\nOS Map: Explorer 186\n\nStart/End: Welcome Centre car park at Dinefwr Park, OS grid ref: SN 615224\n\nDistance: 1.5 miles\n\nTime: 1 hour 30 mins\n\nDinefwr was the first parkland National Nature Reserve in Wales and is bursting with colourful flowering plants; the show begins in spring with blossoming trees and a carpet of bluebells. Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown suggested this walk, and the specimen trees to be planted along it as markers, when he visited Dinefwr in 1775.\n\nLook out for... deer antlers\n\nThe Deer Park at Dinefwr is home to a herd of more than 100 fallow deer. In spring the males shed their large, shovel-like antlers and you might find a set on your walk.\n\nFrom the welcome centre follow the driveway up past the front gates of Newton House. Go through the metal gate across the drive. To the right, back towards the town of Llandeilo, you'll see the outer park where the White Park cattle graze for much of the year. The clumps of trees and tree-lined avenues were laid out in about 1770. The Deer Park is on your left. Carry on up the drive and through the wooden gate, then turn left. Instead of following the sign to the ice-house, head straight on and go through the gate into the Deer Park. Follow the path through the woods, stopping at the breaks in the trees below you to admire the different views. Follow the path through the woods down to the mill pond. Look out for the fallow deer that roam the park. Go out of the metal gate and turn across the bridge between the mill pond and the Pump House below. Follow the track around the mill pond and out onto Castle Field. The abundance of the flowering plant yellow-rattle in the grass from May onwards is a good indication of biodiversity. Follow the track round to the left, through two gates, and back up to the car park. The Begwns Walk\n\nThe Begwns, Painscastle, Powys LD2 3JN\n\nOS Map: Landranger 148, Explorer OL13\n\nStart/End: Car park, OS grid ref: SO 162443\n\nDistance: 2 miles\n\nTime: 1 hour\n\nAdd a spring to your step as you take on this tranquil walk amongst the hills of the Brecon Beacons. Follow grass paths and moderate slopes to be rewarded with spectacular views of the Brecon Beacons and towards the Black Mountains of Carmarthenshire. It is possible to see almost the entire Brecon Beacons National Park from the roundabout, so this walk gives you all of the views with none of the climb.\n\nLook out for... the Common and the Roundabout\n\nThe Begwns is a 1,433 acre common that was given to the National Trust in 1992 by the De Winton family. The common has five scheduled ancient monuments including a deserted medieval village on the western side. The roundabout was built by volunteers and staff to celebrate the millennium. A stone circular seat designed by a local architect was also built in 2000. The views are spectacular and you can see from Hay Bluff all the way to the Black Mountains in Carmarthenshire with the Brecon Beacons in the centre.\n\nStarting from the grass verge car park, the roundabout surrounded by a drystone wall with trees inside will be your first goal at the top of the hill. (This the highest point on the Begwns). Once you have reached the roundabout, take time to absorb the views, if the weather permits. Then, from the roundabout retrace your steps for about 90m downhill until you see a track heading right towards the woodland on the far side of the common. When you reach the wall by the woodland, follow the fence line downhill and left, until you meet the tarmac road. Cross the road and follow the grass track uphill until Monks Pond comes into view; walk down to the pond and turn left. Follow the edge of the pond until you reach a bank at the top of the pond, turn right and follow this track across the wet ground onto a grass track. Turn left and follow the grass track that heads back to the tarmac road and turn right back towards the car park.\n\nThis is an extract from Great British Seasonal Walks (National Trust, April 5); available for £12.99 plus p&p from books.telegraph.co.uk",

                "body": "A British journalist for The Times was arrested, threatened with trial in a military court and deported from Egypt, the newspaper said Saturday.\n\nBel Trew was detained by plain-clothes police in late February while doing an interview in a central Cairo cafe.\n\nShe was held for several hours without access to a lawyer or British diplomats, she said, and then told she could either get on a flight out of Egypt or face military prosecution.\n\n\"Less than 24 hours after I was first detained, I was marched on to a plane with nothing but the clothes I was standing up in. The choice before me -- stay for a military trial or leave -- was no kind of choice,\" Ms Trew said in an article about her experience.\n\nShe was given no official reason for her expulsion.\n\nI've lived in #Egypt for 7 years, it's my beloved home and I'm not sure when I can return. I was arrested after doing an interview and threatened with military trial unless I got on a plane. Like others, I still don't know what happened:https://t.co/m5EmyP8bg7 -- Bel Trew (@Beltrew)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nEgypt's government has severely cracked down on the media and independent Egyptian journalists are routinely harassed and jailed. But it is unusual for a foreign correspondent from a major Western outlet to be arrested.\n\nThe Times initially hoped that it was a misunderstanding that could be rectified in discussions with senior Egyptian officials.\n\n\"The circumstances of her detention and the threats made against her were sufficiently outlandish to suggest that a mistake had been made, based on a misunderstanding,\" the newspaper said in a statement.\n\n\"It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return.\n\n\"The Times deplores this attempt by the Egyptian authorities to intimidate the media and suppress our coverage. This is sadly in line with the increasingly oppressive environment that President Sisi has created for both domestic and international press.\"\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Egyptian government.\n\nEgypt is among the worst countries in the world for press freedom and is ranked 161 out 180 on the 2017 World Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has become particularly sensitive about foreign reporting ahead of this month's election, which the president is expected to win overwhelmingly after all credible opponents were arrested or intimidated out of the race.\n\nEgypt has also bridled over reporting on human rights abuses in the northern Sinai, where the military is carrying out a major counter-terrorism operation against jihadist groups.\n\nThe government also angrily denounced a report by the BBC investigating allegations that Egyptian security forces are responsible for torture and widespread forced disappearances.\n\nMs Trew said she was now on a list of \"undesirable people\" and would be re-arrested if she returned to Egypt.\n\n\"In the end I am leaving behind seven years of my life, my friends, my flat and two rescue cats.

                "body": "The former Russian double agent left close to death after a nerve agent attack in Salisbury had written to President Vladimir Putin asking to be pardoned and to be allowed to visit his home country, a friend has claimed.\n\nVladimir Timoshkov, a friend of Sergei Skripal, said he regretted being having spied for the British and wanted to return to Russia to visit his family.\n\nIn 2006 Colonel Skripal was jailed by the Russian for selling secrets to MI6 and came to Britain in 2010 as part of a spy swap, setting up home in Salisbury.\n\nHe remains in a critical condition with his daughter Yulia, three weeks after they were poisoned with the highly lethal nerve agent Novichok.\n\nThe attempted assassination sparked a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Britain.\n\nOn Friday, EU leaders promised an \"unprecedented\" diplomatic response to the attack after backing Theresa May's assertion that Moscow was responsible.\n\nAccording to Mr Timoshkov, who says he had known him since school, Col Skripal, 66, did not see himself as a traitor as he had sworn an oath to the former Soviet Union.\n\n\"Many people shunned him. His classmates felt he had betrayed the Motherland,\" he told the BBC. \"In 2012 he called me. We spoke for about half an hour. He called me from London.\n\n\"He denied he was a traitor... (he told me) he wrote to Vladimir Putin asking to be fully pardoned and to be allowed to visit Russia. His mother, brother and other relatives were (in Russia).\"\n\nIn what is being interpreted as a cynical move Russia's ambassador to the UK sent his well wishes to Mrs Skripal and his daughter on Friday, saying he hoped for their recovery.\n\nAlexander Yakovenko also wrote to Wiltshire Police detective sergeant Nick Bailey, who was left seriously ill after he was exposed to the poison as he went to the aid of the Skripals.\n\nDetectives are still trying to established whether the nerve agent which left the Skripals fighting for their lives was inserted into Col Skripal's car or unwittingly brought from Russia to Britain by Yulia in her suitcase, possibly secreted in a present or item of clothing.\n\nOn Friday police officers in chemical protection suits removed the bench onto which Skripals collapsed shortly after leaving Zizzi's restaurant in Salisbury following the attack.\n\nIt is understood the bench has been taken to the Ministry of Defence's Porton Down laboratory for closer examination.\n\nThe move signals the beginning of the end of the overtly visible part of the investigation into who targeted the Skripals, how they did it and, crucially, on whose orders.\n\nIt came as a relief to the people of Salisbury.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see it go,\" said Jennifer McMenamin, 66, a school cleaner from Salisbury, who joined a small group of shoppers to watch. \"To think what happened to those poor people on that bench. It makes you wonder what else goes on in the world.\n\n\"Perhaps Salisbury can start getting back to normal now. It's been like a ghost town since it happened.\"\n\nScotland Yard said: \"The park bench that Sergei and Yulia Skripal were sitting on when they were found unwell in Salisbury is being removed to preserve it as a potential crime exhibit as part of the investigation into the attempted murder.\"\n\nOn hearing it had been taken away one nearby cafe owner said simply: \"It's gone? Thank God for that.\"",

The women's race begins at 4.31pm and the men's race follows an hour later at 5.31pm.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nLive coverage begins on BBC One from 3.50pm with Dame Katherine Grainger and Helen Glover part of their team.\n\nWhere does it start and finish?\n\nThe Boat Race course, known as the Championship Course is 4 miles, 374 yards or 6.8 Km long.\n\nIt stretches between Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in South West London.\n\nWhere else can I watch?\n\nThere are several pleasant vantage spots along the river including two bridges at Hammersmith and Putney. Other places popular among crowds are Chiswick Pier, the Emanuel School Boathouse and Dukes Meadow - which offers a view of the closing stages of the race.\n\nWho has won the most races?\n\nOxford won last year's race to reduce Cambridge's overall lead to 82-80 in the 189-year history of the event.\n\nThe only draw in the match came in 1877 with a dead heat finish.\n\nWho will be rowing?\n\nWomen's Blue Boat crews\n\nOxford Bow: Renee Koolschijn 2: Katherine Erickson 3: Juliette Perry 4: Alice Roberts 5: Morgan McGovern 6: Sarah Kushma 7: Abigail Killen Stroke: Beth Bridgman Cox: Jessica Buck\n\nCambridge Bow: Tricia Smith 2: Imogen Grant 3: Kelsey Barolak 4: Thea Zabell 5: Paula Wesselmann 6: Alice White 7: Myriam Goudet-Boukhatmi Stroke: Olivia Coffey Cox: Sophie Shapter\n\nMen's Blue Boat crews\n\nOxford\n\nIain Mandale, bow (St Edmund Hall) Felix Drinkall, 2 (Lady Margaret Hall) Will Cahill, 3 (Christ Church) Anders Weiss, 4 (St Hugh's) Will Geffen, 5 (Keble) Benedict Aldous, 6 (Christ Church) Claas Mertens, 7 (Christ Church) Vassilis Ragoussis, stroke (Linacre) Zachary Thomas, cox (Wolfson).\n\nCambridge\n\nPatrick Elwood, bow (Magdalene) Charles Fisher, 2 (St John's) Dara Alizadeh, 3 (Hughes Hall) James Letten, 4 (Hughes Hall) Spencer Furey, 5 (Jesus) Finn Meeks, 6 (Hughes Hall) Rob Hurn, 7 (St Edmund's) Freddie Davidson, stroke (Emmanuel) Hugo Ramambason, cox (Trinity) What is the weather forecast?\n\nInclement weather has caused havoc at the Boat Race over the decades, with boats sinking in 1951, 1978 and 1981.\n\nLast year, the race threatened to be postponed when an un-exploded World War II bomb was discovered near the start-line.\n\nThere are no such concerns for Saturday's event despite the recent 'Beast from the East', with a high temperature of a mild 9°C, light winds and about a 10% chance of light rain.\n\nWhat are the odds?

                "title": "F1 2018 driver-by-driver guide: Can Lewis Hamilton match Juan Manuel Fangio's five titles?",
                "body": "The past four Formula One seasons have had one thing in common: Mercedes dominance.\n\nLewis Hamilton won three of those drivers' titles, with Nico Rosberg winning one. 2017 was the closest another team has come to breaking the grip of the Silver Arrows on the championship. But for an Asian implosion, Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari might have beaten Hamilton. But that is a big if. And, as Murray Walker used to (incorrectly) say, \" F1 spelt backwards is 'IF'.\"\n\nPre-season testing gives us only an idea of how the teams are doing and drivers' past performances are but an indicator of future success, as they get used to their new machines and, in some cases, team-mates. There are tasty inter-team rivalries across the grid in 2018, a few new faces and highly-regarded future stars.\n\nWho is under pressure? Who needs to improve? Who is well past their best? And who is the next big thing? Read our driver-by-driver guide to find out before lights out in Melbourne on March 25.\n\nMercedes Lewis Hamilton (Number 44)\n\nStarts: 208\n\nRace wins: 62\n\n2017 points: 363 (1st)\n\nIt would take a bold person to bet against Hamilton winning his fifth drivers' title this year. He claims that 2017 was his finest year and, at points, he drove better than ever. His run of six wins in eight races from Silverstone to Austin, for example.\n\nHe is still capable of an off weekend, though. Whether and how much that costs him will mostly depend on how Vettel performs in his Ferrari, unless Bottas can surpass all expectations. How much longer Hamilton will be in F1 we don't know. We should appreciate him while he's here.\n\nWhat his target should be: A fifth world title\n\nOur prediction: Champion\n\nValtteri Bottas (77)\n\nStarts: 97\n\nRace wins: 3\n\n2017 points: 305 (3rd)\n\nIt would be unfair to suggest that Valtteri Bottas struggled in his first year at Mercedes but he will have likely learned a lot. He will have to take this all into consideration as a lacklustre 2018 may cost him his seat.\n\nThree wins and third place in the championship in 2017 was a respectable effort but he needs to be closer to Lewis Hamilton across the season. Beating him a few times is not quite enough. He also needs to be beating Vettel more than he did in 2017, for both his own and Hamilton's sake.\n\nTarget: Second in the championship and five race wins\n\nPrediction: 2nd, an improved 2018\n\nFerrari Sebastian Vettel (5)\n\nStarts: 198\n\nRace wins: 47\n\n2017 points: 317 (2nd)\n\nSebastian Vettel might think it should be him going for his fifth world title in 2018, not Lewis Hamilton. It all fell apart for the German in Singapore in 2017, where his first corner collision with Max Verstappen and Kimi Raikkonen put him out of a Grand Prix he was expected to win. A further retirement in Japan effectively handed the title to an in-form Hamilton.\n\nHe will go into the first race as second favourite for the championship but the difference between the Mercedes and the Ferrari will decide whether the title fight is a close one.\n\nTarget: A fifth world title\n\nPrediction: 3rd\n\nKimi Raikkonen (7)\n\nStarts: 270\n\nRace wins: 20\n\n2017 points: 205 (4th)\n\nIt is a frustration that the Kimi Raikkonen of 2018 is not the driver he once was. His role as a second driver is clearly defined and he seems content, if not exactly ecstatic, in it. After some public criticism from his bosses in 2017, Ferrari (and Vettel) appear happy with his position in the team, following a strong end to the season.\n\nIt is also frustrating that a younger, fresher driver is not Vettel's teammate, but risking team harmony is not high on Ferrari's list of priorities. Top of that list is Vettel himself. Expect more criticism from Ferrari if the Finn's levels dip. Here's hoping the SF71H is more suited to his needs in 2018.\n\nTarget: A first race win since 2013 and 10 podiums\n\nPrediction: Splitting the Red Bulls in the standings, 5th\n\nRed Bull Daniel Ricciardo (3)\n\nStarts: 129\n\nRace wins: 5\n\n2017 points: 200 (5th)\n\nDaniel Ricciardo has had very varying battles with his Red Bull Racing teammates. He outclassed Sebastian Vettel in 2014 with three victories, whilst narrowly losing out to Daniil Kvyat in 2015. Then came Dutch prodigy Max Verstappen, who represents a challenge like no other. Last year he scored more points but Verstappen drove to two dominant late-season wins in Malaysia and Mexico, compared to Ricciardo's sole victory in Baku.\n\nThe Australian finished the season poorly, with three retirements in the last four races. Before that, though, he drove some exceptional races. Their relationship seems to have improved after their collision in Hungary but beating Max Verstappen should be Ricciardo's target. He's certainly capable of it.\n\nTarget: Multiple race victories and to beat Max Verstappen\n\nPrediction: Behind Verstappen but close to Raikkonen, 6th\n\nMax Verstappen (33)\n\nStarts: 60\n\nRace wins: 3\n\n2017 points: 168 (6th)\n\nMax Verstappen's two victories at the end of last season show that, if you offer him a chance to win a race he will take it. Have Red Bull provided him with a car that is capable of that on a more regular basis? There is no doubt about his immense talent at such a young age.\n\nLast year he managed to keep multiple retirements from affecting his performances and finish the season in fine form. If Red Bull can deliver a car capable of matching the frontrunners then there is potentially no limit to the excitement that Verstappen could bring F1. Heaven knows we need it.\n\nTarget: Top four in the drivers' standings, multiple wins\n\nPrediction: Beating at least one Ferrari, 4th place\n\nForce India Sergio Perez (11)\n\nStarts: 134\n\nBest finish: 2nd\n\n2017 points: 100 (7th)\n\nPerez can be put in the same box as Nico Hulkenberg: an experienced, quick and constant driver without a top car. There are only so many of those to go around, though, and Force India is not a bad team to be in. His one year in a McLaren in 2013 was a disappointment for the driver and the team but he has scored heavily for Force India since.\n\nNo podiums for Perez last year (compared to four in the previous three) but he passed 100 points for the season in both 2016 and 2017, taking seventh place in the drivers standings, the highest-ranked driver outside Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari. The same this year would be impressive.\n\nTarget: 100 points and to be the best-ranked outside the top three teams\n\nPrediction: A tougher season, 12th in the championship\n\nEsteban Ocon (31)\n\nStarts: 29\n\nBest finish: 5th\n\n2017 points: 87 (8th)\n\nLike his teammate last year, Esteban Ocon failed to score points on only two occasions in 2017, his first full season. He will hope to improve on his 7-13 qualifying record against Perez . That record is not a bad one, given Perez's experience and the average gap in qualifying being just 0.074 seconds.\n\nShould Ocon (part of the Mercedes young driver program) begin the season well, there could be premature talk of him replacing Bottas at Mercedes in 2019. Thinking about that prospect at this point would be a mistake. First he needs to beat Perez.\n\nTarget: To beat Perez and feature on the podium\n\nPrediction: Beating Perez but outside the top 10\n\nWilliams Lance Stroll (18)\n\nStarts:20\n\nBest finish: 3rd\n\n2017 points: 40 (12th)\n\nFor all the talk of the Canadian teenager being outlcassed by Felipe Massa in 2017, Stroll only finished marginally behind his teammate in the standings. That was despite him only out-qualifying Massa on two occasions. This was also after he failed to score a point in his first six races, so not a bad comeback.\n\nHis third place at Baku was the standout, of course, but he also finished in the top-8 on four other occasions. He will effectively be leading the team in 2018 alongside Sirotkin, so will need to have consistently strong weekends instead of just occasional ones if Williams are to maintain their fifth place in the constructors championship.\n\nTarget: Improve poor qualifying, 10 points finishes\n\nPrediction: 15th\n\nSergey Sirotkin (35)\n\nStarts: 0 (7 race weekend appearances as test driver)\n\nRacing record: 3rd in 2015 and 2016 GP2\n\nThe talk about Sergey Sirotkin has been that he's a \"pay\" driver, someone who was chosen for the significant sponsorship money he brings to the team. The truth, though, is that Williams felt he was simply quicker than Robert Kubica in their end-of-season tests last year and the Pole's fairy tale comeback was halted.\n\nWhilst money may be a factor, we should take Williams at their word. Sirotkin comes with a decent record, finishing third in the GP2 series in 2015 and 2016. His battle with Stroll should be an intriguing watch, given Stroll now has a season's experience behind him. Should he start slowly, the vultures may appear.\n\nTarget: 40 championship points\n\nPrediction: Behind Stroll in the standings, 16th\n\nRenault Nico Hulkenberg (27)\n\nStarts: 135\n\nBest finish: 4th\n\n2017 points: 43 (10th)\n\nIt is incredible to think that Nico Hulkenberg has never stood on an F1 podium. He has been one of the most consistent drivers in F1 for several years but has never been given the machinery to compete at the very front, his one pole position notwithstanding. Since 2012 he has finished 11th, 10th, 9th, 10th, 9th and 10th in the championship, at an average of 64 points.\n\nIn this period he has had 67 points finishes from 118 races. Given the strength of Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari and increasing reliability, a first podium finish looks like an outside bet. What will be a better measure is how he fares against Carlos Sainz, who will be a tougher competitor than Jolyon Palmer.\n\nTarget: A first podium, to beat Sainz and to finish the best of the midfield drivers\n\nPrediction: A first podium, 70 points and 7th in the championship\n\nCarlos Sainz Jr (55)\n\nStarts: 60\n\nBest finish: 4th\n\n2017 points: 54 (9th)\n\nCarlos Sainz joined F1 in 2015 as Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso teammate. Verstappen has since gone onto three race wins and a place at the front of the grid with Red Bull. Sainz, meanwhile, has put regularly put in great performances, ending his Toro Rosso career with an exceptional fourth place on the tricky streets of Singapore.\n\nHe has been rewarded with a drive in the works Renault team. We should see Sainz in the higher points-paying positions a little more often this year (he got the best out his Toro Rosso in 2017, scoring points on nine occasions) but the prospect of regular tussles with countryman Fernando Alonso is exciting.\n\nTarget: Beat Hulkenberg and six top-six finishes\n\nPrediction: Marginally behind Hulkenberg, 8th\n\nToro Rosso Brendon Hartley (28)\n\nStarts: 4\n\nBest finish: 13th\n\n2017 points: 0 (23rd)\n\nHartley comes to F1 as the 2017 World Endurance Champion and as a former Red Bull Junior driver. Perhaps surprisingly, Toro Rosso gave him a seat for the final four races of 2017, where he was solid. At 28 he is older than most drivers Toro Rosso employ, so the \"grand plan\" for Hartley may be a little different.\n\nMost likely they want a consistent driver alongside Pierre Gasly for the entire season, to avoid the merry-go-round of drivers of the end of last year.\n\nTarget: Occasional points and regular top-12 finishes\n\nPrediction: 18th\n\nPierre Gasly (10)\n\nStarts: 5\n\nBest finish: 12th\n\n2017 points: 0 (21st)\n\nWinning the GP2 championship clearly tells us something about a driver. But it does not guarantee a place in F1, never mind actual success. For every Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg there is a Jolyon Palmer or Pastor Maldonado, drivers who showed only glimpses of their talent.\n\nThe 22-year-old Frenchman beat Antonio Giovinazzi to the GP2 title in 2016 and Toro Rosso promoted him (like Hartley) towards the end of 2017. It's difficult to judge Gasly on just those races, so a fair assessment will have to wait until the end of the year.\n\nTarget: Occasional points and regular top-12 finishes\n\nPrediction: 17th\n\nHaas Romain Grosjean (8)\n\nStarts: 122\n\nBest finish: 2nd\n\n2017 points: 28 (13th)\n\nRomain Grosjean's performances are fairly reflective of Haas's first two seasons, occasionally excellent but too often anonymous. In fairness to Grosjean, a lot of the blame can be placed on the car, with the team struggling to get it to regularly run to its strengths.\n\nThe Haas's brakes have been the most persistent and troublesome issue for the Frenchman and it doesn't really feel like it's an F1 race weekend unless you hear him complaining on the team radio about it. He has since admitted he needs to find a way to address the issue. If the Haas is as quick as it seemed in testing then it could be Grosjean's best season since leaving Lotus in 2015.\n\nTarget: More consistent points and four top-6 finishes\n\nPrediction: 10th and more brake-related woes\n\nKevin Magnussen (20)\n\nStarts: 60\n\nBest finish: 2nd\n\n2017 points: 19 (14th)\n\n2018 is the first time that Kevin Magnussen has been in a team for longer than a season, after single years racing for McLaren in 2014 and Renault in 2016. He has not yet come close to matching his debut race podium but the Renault he drove in 2016 was one of the poorest on the grid. Last year's Haas was like the girl who had a little curl in the middle of her forehead - when it was good it was very good indeed but when it was bad it was horrid.\n\nHe didn't score points as consistently as teammate Grosjean in 2017 but will desire a car that is capable of being quick far more often than not. If not, it could be another frustrating season for him and his teammate.\n\nTarget: To beat Grosjean, 10 points finishes\n\nPrediction: 13th\n\nMcLaren Fernando Alonso (14)\n\nStarts: 290\n\nRace wins: 32\n\n2017 points: 17 (15th)\n\nHow much longer can Fernando Alonso tolerate battling in the midfield? He is a man who can extract every split second from whatever car he drives, but another season struggling to get into the points will surely mean the end of the McLaren-Alonso partnership for good.\n\nThe most frustrating thing for Formula 1 is that one of its greatest talents in a generation has wasted years in sub-standard machinery. His sidelines into the Indy 500 and sportscar racing (he'll complete the World Endurance Championship Super Season) show a growing impatience. Would it be too much to suggest that he might just ditch F1 altogether in search of motorsport's Triple Crown? Formula 1 needs a strong McLaren but not as much as Fernando Alonso does.\n\nTarget: To be the best-ranked driver outside of Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes\n\nPrediction: 9th, a happier but still unhappy Fernando\n\nStoffel Vandoorne (2)\n\nStarts: 20\n\nBest finish: 7th\n\n2017 points: 13 (16th)\n\nAfter a disappointing start to 2017, the Belgian began to steadily improve his performances in a poor McLaren. Vandoorne clearly has the talent to succeed at this level and learning alongside Alonso is not a bad way to begin. His 13 points to Alonso's 17 in 2017 (three points finishes to five) is acceptable for a rookie. He will hope to be closer to Alonso more often that he was last season in a car that should be regularly competing for points.\n\nTarget: To consistently challenge Alonso in qualifying and races, some top six finishes\n\nPrediction: More regular points, 14th\n\nSauber Marcus Ericsson (9)\n\nStarts: 76\n\nBest finish: 8th\n\n2017 points: 0 (20th)\n\nAfter scoring points in two of his first three races for Sauber in 2015 it has been a steady decline for Marcus Ericsson. This, though, is directly linked with the worsening of Sauber. Ericsson hasn't scored a point since Monza in 2015 and Sauber only scored five points in 2017 (all by Pascal Wehrlein) and just two in 2016, both by Ericsson's teammate Felipe Nasr.\n\nA renewed sense of optimism exists now at Sauber with an increased technical relationship with Ferrari and an Alfa Romeo sponsorship link-up but scoring more than a handful of points will still be tough. He will probably be expected to lose to Ferrari Academy driver Leclerc, so surpassing those expectations should be motivation enough for the Swede.\n\nTarget: To occasionally battle for points, beat Leclerc\n\nPrediction: 20th, his first points since 2015\n\nCharles Leclerc (16)\n\nStarts: 0 (8 race weekend appearances as test driver)\n\nRacing record: 2016 GP2 and 2017 F2 champion\n\nIt is not often that you get a driver whose home Grand Prix will be at Monte Carlo. The last driver to do this was Olivier Beretta in 1994 for Larrousse. More enticing than that, though, is the prospect of Ferrari Academy driver Leclerc's presence on the F1 grid. He has a superb racing record: he won the 2017 F2 title with three rounds to spare and also took the GP3 championship in 2016.\n\nSauber have a history of nurturing talent (Raikkonen and Massa both made their F1 debuts with the team) so it's promising to see Leclerc being given this opportunity. He is unlikely to have the chance to fight for points but he will be closely monitored by Ferrari and fans alike.\n\nTarget: Beat Ericsson and score a few points\n\nPrediction: 19th, a few points",

India lost 4-0 on their last tour, as did England on their last tour of India.\n\n\"We have Mitch Marsh signed as our overseas player with Aaron Finch being added in for our T20 Blast,\" Stewart said from Surrey's pre-season tour of Dubai.\n\n\"I did enquire a while back about Kohli when it appeared to be a possible option for him to play county cricket but was told India were playing Ireland in T20s and an inaugural Test against Afghanistan in June before the England tour. If he does now become available we would look at it again to see if it could potentially work around our current overseas arrangements.\"\n\nIn the last three weeks of June, Surrey have three Championship matches that might suit Kohli, starting with a game against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl on June 9, followed by a game against Somerset at Guildford then an away game against Yorkshire at Scarborough.\n\nThe cost of beefing up security, to keep fans away from the world's most famous cricketer, would have to be taken into consideration by the counties concerned..",

The women's race begins at 4.31pm and the men's race follows an hour later at 5.31pm.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nLive coverage begins on BBC One from 3.50pm with Dame Katherine Grainger and Helen Glover part of their team.\n\nWhere does it start and finish?\n\nThe Boat Race course, known as the Championship Course is 4 miles, 374 yards or 6.8 Km long.\n\nIt stretches between Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in South West London.\n\nWhere else can I watch?\n\nThere are several pleasant vantage spots along the river including two bridges at Hammersmith and Putney. Other places popular among crowds are Chiswick Pier, the Emanuel School Boathouse and Dukes Meadow - which offers a view of the closing stages of the race.\n\nWho has won the most races?\n\nOxford won last year's race to reduce Cambridge's overall lead to 82-80 in the 189-year history of the event.\n\nThe only draw in the match came in 1877 with a dead heat finish.\n\nWho will be rowing?\n\nWomen's Blue Boat crews\n\nOxford Bow: Renee Koolschijn 2: Katherine Erickson 3: Juliette Perry 4: Alice Roberts 5: Morgan McGovern 6: Sarah Kushma 7: Abigail Killen Stroke: Beth Bridgman Cox: Jessica Buck\n\nCambridge Bow: Tricia Smith 2: Imogen Grant 3: Kelsey Barolak 4: Thea Zabell 5: Paula Wesselmann 6: Alice White 7: Myriam Goudet-Boukhatmi Stroke: Olivia Coffey Cox: Sophie Shapter\n\nMen's Blue Boat crews\n\nOxford\n\nIain Mandale, bow (St Edmund Hall) Felix Drinkall, 2 (Lady Margaret Hall) Will Cahill, 3 (Christ Church) Anders Weiss, 4 (St Hugh's) Will Geffen, 5 (Keble) Benedict Aldous, 6 (Christ Church) Claas Mertens, 7 (Christ Church) Vassilis Ragoussis, stroke (Linacre) Zachary Thomas, cox (Wolfson).\n\nCambridge\n\nPatrick Elwood, bow (Magdalene) Charles Fisher, 2 (St John's) Dara Alizadeh, 3 (Hughes Hall) James Letten, 4 (Hughes Hall) Spencer Furey, 5 (Jesus) Finn Meeks, 6 (Hughes Hall) Rob Hurn, 7 (St Edmund's) Freddie Davidson, stroke (Emmanuel) Hugo Ramambason, cox (Trinity) What is the weather forecast?\n\nInclement weather has caused havoc at the Boat Race over the decades, with boats sinking in 1951, 1978 and 1981.\n\nLast year, the race threatened to be postponed when an un-exploded World War II bomb was discovered near the start-line.\n\nThere are no such concerns for Saturday's event despite the recent 'Beast from the East', with a high temperature of a mild 9°C, light winds and about a 10% chance of light rain.\n\nWhat are the odds?

                "body": "The UN has come under fire for sharing the coordinates of Syrian hospitals with Russia, which medical charities say is an \"extremely high-risk strategy\" that could be exploited.\n\nThe organisation has given GPS locations supplied by NGOs operating in rebel-held Idlib and Eastern Ghouta to Russia and the US as part of a new \"notification system\".\n\nThe Syrian government and its Russian backer, which has been bombing in support of President Bashar al-Assad since 2015, have systematically targeted hospitals and clinics during assaults on opposition strongholds.\n\nIn recent weeks, dozens of facilities in Eastern Ghouta have been put out of service, most others have been forced to move underground.\n\nThe UN hopes making them public will either act as a deterrent or at least better enable them to establish intent should they later be attacked.\n\n\"There were 120 attacks on hospitals and medical facilities in Syria last year,\" Jan Egeland, UN humanitarian adviser on Syria, told the Telegraph. \"Syria is one of the worst wars on medical workers in recent history and part of the problem is there has been no functioning notification system to protect them.\"\n\nHe said there had been a reluctance among doctors on the ground to share their location, but they have been left with few other options. \"'We've been attacked for so long,' they tell me, 'I can't see how it could be worse',\" Mr Egeland said.\n\nHe said some NGOs had in the past provided their coordinates to the UN and reported a subsequent drop in the number of air strikes on its services.\n\nThe initiative was led by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which has seen a number of its hospitals hit in recent months.\n\nHowever, others warned the strategy could backfire given Russia has shown little deference for international law on the targeting of medical facilities.\n\n\"They have bombed hospitals with little thought, and have always given the excuse that they were harbouring terrorists, which is untrue,\" said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, director of Doctors under Fire and the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations (UOSSM). \"They act with impunity as there has been zero consequence so far.\n\n\"Until there is, why would they stop?\" he told the Telegraph. \"It's an extremely high-risk move.\"\n\nMr Egeland said Russia had offered assurances they would not target any of the facilities identified, while the UN in turn provided Moscow assurances they were not being used by any armed groups.\n\nHowever, there could be no real guarantee that the Syria regime would not use the information shared with them by Russia to carry out their own attacks.\n\nIt was also not clear what the recourse would be if Russia broke its promise.\n\nMr Bretton-Gordon said UOSSM, along with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), stopped sharing the locations of its hospitals \"years ago\" after their medical facilities in eastern Aleppo began being targeted.\n\n\"Every time we did, shortly after they'd be hit,\" he said.\n\nHe said every UOSSM clinic in Eastern Ghouta, an enclave outside Damascus where regime forces are attacking rebels, has been put out of service in recent weeks.\n\nThose that have managed to reopen are now only able to operate underground and move location daily.\n\nDoctors there say they have seen much more sophisticated weapons used since Russia joined the war, such as so-called bunker-buster bombs that burrow deep underground before exploding.\n\nEarlier this week the Telegraph reported that a British doctor helping surgeons in rebel-held Aleppo in 2016 may have had his computer hacked and the information retrieved from it used to carry out an air strikes on the hospital.\n\nDr David Nott was giving instructions from the UK over Skype to doctors in an underground theatre of M10 hospital in 2016 when he believes that his computer was infiltrated, revealing the operating room's coordinates.\n\nThe hospital was struck by a bunker-busting bomb days later. Experts said that only Russia could have dropped it.\n\n\"The grim reality is that we have reached a stage in the war where the international community is unable to offer protection to civilians or humanitarians,\" said Emma Beals, an independent Syria analyst. \"So policies are decided based on possible future accountability for inevitable loss of life.\n\n\"That's astonishingly macabre, even within the context of the Syrian war.\"",

The satellite channel will start their programme at 4am. Alternatively bookmark this page and follow all the action here in our lap-by-lap live blog.\n\nWhat happened in qualifying?\n\nLewis Hamilton is in prime position to open his Formula One championship with a victory after storming to pole.\n\nHamilton was in a class of one as he steered his Mercedes to the front slot of the grid with an utterly emphatic display which will send out an all-to-familiar warning to his rivals.\n\nThe 33-year-old British driver's best lap was more than an eye-watering six tenths of a second faster than the rest of the field with Kimi Raikkonen edging out his Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel for second.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen qualified fourth ahead of his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who is due to serve a three-place grid drop following an infringement in practice on Friday.\n\nFinal positions after qualifying:\n\n1 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 1min 21.164secs\n\n2 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:21.828\n\n3 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:21.838\n\n4 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:21.879\n\n5 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Red Bull 1:22.152\n\n6 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 1:23.187\n\n7 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas F1 1:23.339\n\n8 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 1:23.532\n\n9 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Renault 1:23.577\n\n10 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP No Time\n\n11 Fernando Alonso (Spa) McLaren 1:23.692\n\n12 Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren 1:23.853\n\n13 Sergio Perez (Mex) Force India 1:24.005\n\n14 Lance Stroll (Can) Williams 1:24.230\n\n15 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Force India 1:24.786\n\n16 Brendon Hartley (Nzl) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:24.532\n\n17 Marcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber-Ferrari 1:24.556\n\n18 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Sauber-Ferrari 1:24.636\n\n19 Sergey Sirotkin (Rus) Williams 1:24.922\n\n20 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:25.295\n\nWho won it last year?\n\nGerman driver Sebastian Vettel won his second Australian Grand Prix in 2017, adding to his 2011 win Down Under.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\n\"I want to somehow be better than I was last year, which I think was the best year I had performance-wise. How can I top that? I proved it was a very, very strong year, but there are lots of areas actually.\"\n\nLewis Hamilton\n\n\"I always enjoy going to Melbourne, I like the country and the temperature which is always a welcome change compared to Europe at this time of year. The fans are very passionate about racing and especially Formula 1 as it has a great history in Australia.\n\n\"Albert Park is not the easiest track to overtake on, we will try our best but the straights are not quite long enough and a lot of the corners leading to the straights are 90 degrees, this makes it hard to set-up a pass. Turns 11 and 12 are the fastest corners and really cool to drive, especially in qualifying with low fuel in sixth or seventh gear.\"\n\nMax Verstappen\n\n\"Finally, time to go racing! This isn't my first time racing this year of course - I've already done a 24-hour race in Daytona and have a very busy season ahead of me - but I'm really excited about getting behind the wheel of the MCL33 for the first grand prix of the year.\n\n\"Our car showed a lot of potential in winter testing and, although we know we still have a lot to work on, we've already learned a lot about the package and how all the new elements to this year's car work together. Australia is its first real test, and we need to work hard all weekend to bring all the ingredients together.\n\n\"Nobody can ever predict how other teams will perform at the first race of the season and that all contributes to the excitement. Melbourne is a great track and, after what feels like a long winter, I'm really looking forward to seeing what we can do.\"\n\nFernando Alonso\n\nWhat are the odds? Lewis Hamilton: Evens Sebastian Vettel: 10/3 Max Verstappen: 11/2 Daniel Ricciardo: 7/1 Valtteri Bottas: 15/2 Kimi Raikkonen: 25/1 Fernando Alonso: 50/1 Stoffel Vandoorne: 175/1 Nico Hulkenberg: 225/1 Carlos Sainz: 225/1 Esteban Ocon: 275/1 Sergio Perez: 275/1 Romain Grosjean: 425/1 Kevin Magnussen: 475/1 Brendon Hartley: 500/1 Pierre Gasly: 500/1 Marcus Ericsson: 500/1 Charles Leclerc: 500/1 Sergey Sirotkin: 500/1 Lance Stroll: 500/1 How did the final standings in the drivers' and constructors' championship look after last season?

What is Lucas Browne's record and style?\n\nBrowne is on a 25-fight unbeaten run, and has been a nightclub bouncer and a cage-fighter in previous lives. Now 38, Whyte should have a physical advantage over the Australian but he has a powerful right-hand and has a reputation as a swinger.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nBrowne on Whyte and feeling no pressure:\n\nI love big, competitive, fights and also the exposure, the UK has given that to me.\n\nI'm going into this as an underdog but that's better for me, I have no stress. Whyte has to put on a good show, I just have to turn up and beat him.\n\nIt's going to be a knockout win, that's the only prediction I am going to give.\"\n\nBig Daddy' has only fought once since his WBA world title win over Chagaev in early 2016, but the unbeaten powerhouse is assured of his ability.\n\nAs a fighter, Whyte's OK, but I think I'm better and have more tools.\n\nPhysically, he's a big boy with a long reach and good work rate. He will bring that, but can he keep up with my pace and power?\n\nHe has to stay away from my right hand and my left now for 12 rounds. If I land a nice, good, shot it could change everything.\n\nAs a person I don't know him, he could be doing his thing for the camera or it could be him. I don't like the person in front of the camera, that's why we don't get along.\n\nWhyte on Browne being a 'clubber':\n\nKeep my hands up. It's heavyweight boxing. If you fear one punch, move down a division or two. I don't fear that.\n\nI've fought guys with a big punch, with speed, power, flashy technique, traditional boxing technique, tall guys who get a lot of leverage. He's just a clubber.\n\n\"He's strong but he hasn't fought anyone as youthful as me. He might have fought guys with better technique but they have been old.\n\n\"I've got the skill, speed and power. People forget, but I've got power. I can knock people out.\n\nWhyte on improving:\n\nBefore I fought AJ I was a three-to-six round puncher but now I've got the punch power late into the fight, and I've got the cardio and conditioning to go with it.\n\nIt's not just about trying to put people to sleep in the first round.\n\nPeople say: 'you're more calm'. I know what I need to do. Hindsight is a great thing. It's about experience. I've grown physically and mentally.\n\nWhat are the odds? Dillian Whyte 1/4 Lucas Browne 11/4 Draw 25/1 What is our prediction?\n\nWhyte is absolutely desperate for another shot at a world title and possible bout with Anthony Joshua, and we fancy that incentive will be enough to carry him through what could be a slug-fest.\n\nVerdict: Whyte to win by KO.",

                "title": "How to make the most of window boxes - the ultimate urban gardening hack",
                "body": "The balcony I learned to garden in came with window boxes attached. Large, long metal things that dated from the Sixties and had seen enough gusts not to shift any time soon. When I moved in, they were home to some sad Skimmia japonica, battered heathers and a viciously spiky grass thing. When I moved out a little over three years later, they were filled with ivy and pansies that I had left for the new inhabitants, and wouldn't come into their own until after my departure.\n\nIn those inbetween seasons, the window boxes had been treated as both a playground and a showground. Iris reticulata always put up with the exposure and nudged at Spring. Coleus flowered madly in the sunshine, as did various shades of heuchera. Rosemary put up with the poor drainage for a while (holes and hydroleca will improve any box); winters saw violas, ranunculus and cyclamen and summer was a candyfloss riot of pelagonium and petunias which frothed over the boxes' vertiginous edge.\n\nI had to implement my own window boxes on the new balcony, and I did so swiftly: for the urban gardener, they are near essential. Whether they grasp onto railings, suspend themselves from balcony edges or sit, as they are meant to, on or under window sills, these little troughs provide colour and interest in the most unlikely places - which means they are usually gloriously pest-free, too.\n\nAfter four years of tepid horticultural experimentation, this time around I settled on planning and perennials: Bird's-nest ferns, adiantums, windflowers, heucheras galore and saxifraga have been planted to keep each other happy in a sheltered woodland spot for several seasons. Come May, hostas will join them. A rudimental collection of complimentary plants that suit their environs (shelter and dappled shade with a backdrop of trees), rather than a schmozzle of suck-it-and-see.\n\nA post shared by Alice Vincent (@noughticulture) on Feb 24, 2018 at 9:56am PST\n\nThis approach, as luck would have it, is one also suggested by the Chelsea Gardener's Andrew Kyte. \"The biggest mistake people make is trying to grow things that simply aren't compatible with the conditions,\" he tells me. \"Many plants are fussy and need a certain amount of care: window boxes and containers often aren't ideal in terms of the conditions they offer so try to keep it simple - round pegs don't fit into square holes!\"\n\nSo where should the novice windowboxer begin? \"If in full sun (South/West facing) then geraniums are a winner through the summer, giving non-stop flowering from May through to late autumn and the first frosts,\" Kyte advises. \"Ivies will trail and are a great neglect-proof evergreen, preferably in a bit of shade but will thrive almost anywhere.\"\n\nAnd, for evergreen structure: \"In Central London we're seeing a movement away from the standard boxwood ball because of the buxus caterpillar. A reliable alternative is ilex crenata which they won't touch!\"\n\nThose fancying a challenge may find inspiration in How to Window Box, a pocket-sized guide that suggests a range of themed window boxes for the novice gardener by Chantal Aida Gordon and Ryan Benoit, the duo behind US blog The Horticult. It talks you through the intricacies of mixing different potting mediums for optimal plant happiness (I usually rely on peat-free, organic multi-purpose with some slow-release pellets thrown in and topped up with compost twice a year). After admiring the noticeably competitive window box game in New York's West Village last summer, I was pleased to find some of those mysteries unravelled here - notably, the combination of sweet potato vine and Senecio cineraria, both of which look lovely with coleus, too.\n\nAnd, if all else fails, Kyte is an advocate of that most controversial of gardening supplements: the artificial plant. \" Many of ours at The Chelsea Gardener are \"UV proofed\" and designed for use outdoors,\" he says. \"Mixed and matched in with real plants you genuinely can't tell the difference!\"\n\nAlice Vincent is the author of How to Grow Stuff: Easy, no-stress gardening for beginners (Ebury, £12.99).

                "body": "With mounting student debt, rising living costs and the struggle to save a house deposit, many millennials are shunning the investment market.\n\nThe generation that reached adulthood in the thick of the financial crisis is also wary of stock markets.\n\nThose aged 18 to 24 have been deterred from investing thanks to the 2008 banking crisis, according to Gallup, a polling firm. It found that less than 40pc of the age group invest today, compared with 52pc in 2007.\n\nUnderstanding of pensions and other financial areas was lower among 18 to 24 year-olds than those aged 35 and over, according to figures from insurance company Aviva.\n\nBut not all are so cautious. For those that do invest their money, what made them get into the markets and how did they learn their skills? We asked four young investors.\n\n'I bought Apple because I liked their products'\n\nDrawing on his work in technology, George Brown got into investing by buying tech company shares. American-born, but living in London for the past three years, 27-year-old Mr Brown is a software engineer, having recently started his own company.\n\nHis first investment was Apple stock in 2008, using money saved from his summer job. \"I thought it was a cool company building cool products. Obviously now I wish I had put more than £300 in,\" he said.\n\nWhile working during university Mr Brown saved some of his salary and started researching the markets.\n\n\"The wisdom online is that unless you have a lot of time you're not likely to outperform the market, so the good thing is to hope for the same returns as the market,\" he said. This meant that he bought some passive \"tracker\" funds, which are low-cost and simply track the performance of an index, such as the FTSE 100.\n\nMr Brown has since expanded on that and picks individual technology stocks to buy, too.\n\n\"I have understanding of what they are selling. My thesis is that if they excite me today maybe they are interesting, and so maybe the company will do well,\" he said.\n\nAmong his holdings are Chinese tech giant Baidu, although he said the growth has stagnated recently, while Google has continued to grow. He also bought computing giant Nvidia after finding it better than competitors.\n\nUntil he began his start-up Mr Brown was taking home a six-figure salary each year, and said he was able to save a large chunk of it.\n\nHe said his parents encouraged him to get involved in investing, setting him up with his first broker account - but admits they are more cautious investors than him.\n\n'You could lose money anywhere, so why not invest?'\n\nThe B P Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 made Ali Rizvi decide he would venture into investing.\n\nNow aged 28, and a site manager in the construction industry, he said: \"At the time I was very, very young and didn't know much about stocks and shares, but I thought the company was big enough to survive the bad PR, saw the opportunity and jumped in.\"\n\nAfter initial share price falls, he saw a return and cashed in his money.\n\n\"That was the turning point when I realised I had to get more involved. Had I walked away when I was still at a loss, it would have been the end of it for me, but making a profit was a wonderful feeling that sparked the energy to carry on,\" he said.\n\nNow Mr Rizvi invests the majority of his money in individual stocks, although he has some holdings in the S&P 500 index of American shares. He buys stocks using online broker A J Bell, and picks which to buy by reading about company management and structure, and looking at competitors.\n\nHe said he bought online clothing company Boohoo.com because \"it was making its own products, doing their own marketing and I really liked that structure\". He also bought online estate agent Purplebricks as \"it took the best from high-street estate agents and took it online\".\n\nHe added that he also likes to buy companies when they cost just £1 or £2 per share, rather than buying giants such as Amazon, which have much higher share prices: \"That doesn't excite me, to have one or two shares in a company\".\n\nHe has used the money he's made from investing to purchase buy-to-let property in Northampton, and ultimately, Mr Rizvi wants to use his investments to provide him with a steady income stream so he doesn't have to work a nine-to-five job.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm, Mr Rizvi said most of his friends don't invest their money. \"It's quite sad, I really do push them, and it's one of my favourite subjects, I'm always talking about it.\n\n\"When I feel like I have a sure bet I always make a point of mentioning it to them and telling them to get involved,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they just don't want to lose money. But the reality is you could lose money anywhere, nothing in life is guaranteed.\"\n\n'My friends think investing is like going to the casino'\n\nPeter Hicks, 26, only considered investing once he joined a financial services company - working in the operations team at Chelsea Financial Services, the fund shop.\n\n\"I think my generation by and large doesn't know much about the investment industry,\" he said. \"The general perception is of suspicion to finance and asset management, particularly after the global financial crisis. You've got films like The Wolf of Wall Street and the Big Short that taint the industry as a big rip-off.\"\n\nHe started by making fund choices for his pension, to which he contributes £60 a month, picking four funds after doing his own research and consulting colleagues.\n\n\"My pension money is invested over a massive time horizon, so I've picked small company funds that have huge room for growth: Baillie Gifford Japan, Asian Frontiers and Schroders Small Cap Discovery fund, as well as Fundsmith, which is well established,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Hicks faces the same problem as many young savers: he has large student loan debt he needs to pay off before he can start investing non-pension money.\n\nThe average student now leaves university with £50,000 worth of debt. Mr Hicks took out a Future Finance Loan to help fund his studies: a private loan company, which charges interest between 6pc and 24.9pc.\n\n\"I want to get rid of my student debt before I invest in an Isa,\" he said.\n\n\"Before I took this job I worked on a potato farm. I went back there and because of who I work for now they think I'll cause the next crash.\n\n\"You realise how silly that is when you work in the industry, but they think it's no different to going to the casino and playing roulette,\" he said.\n\n'I started investing at 33'\n\nAmanda Blacker only started investing her money three years ago, after she realised she needed to engage more with her pension.\n\nMs Blacker, 36, said that despite working for financial services company Aviva, in their legal team, she found getting into investment a bit daunting.\n\n\"I have always been a saver, ever since getting my first part-time job aged 13, and I wanted to look at getting a better return than cash was offering,\" she said.\n\nShe started by moving her pension money from the default funds into self-selected funds, and after a year, moved some of her cash savings into a stocks and shares Isa.\n\n\"I had no real experience of investing, so I looked at how the funds had performed recently, and what risk they took,\" Ms Blacker said.\n\nShe now has between £10,000 and £20,000 invested in funds in Japan, Asia, Europe and the UK.\n\n\"As I became older and more aware of my own finances, I looked into ways of preparing for the future and making my money work better for me,\" she said.\n\n\"It was daunting when I started out, trying to make sure that I wasn't doing something silly with my money.\n\n\"I made sure I looked at funds that were not really high-risk while I started to find my feet and see how it all worked and then look to take more risky investments in the future.\"",

                "body": "The cold weather which has gripped the country for weeks is set to make a chilly return over Easter, adding to travel woes and train closures over the weekend.\n\nThe Met Office has warned that the UK could see snow over the festive weekend, which could add to congestion and delays on the roads.\n\nIt is expected there will be temperature lows of up to -10C, as well as bitingly cold winds and possible snowfall.\n\nRail problems will also likely see travellers from Maundy Thursday taking to the roads instead of going by train, adding to traffic.\n\nRAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis warned that the Easter getaway is due to be one of the busiest times of the year on the road.\n\nHe said: \"The getaway for Easter tends to be one of the busiest of the year, and we're expecting 2018 to be no exception. But if people are hoping for spring-like warmth to accompany the longer days, they might well be disappointed.\n\n\"With a distinctly wintry feel to the weather persisting right up to Easter itself, millions of families will be need to make sure they still bundle their hats and thick coats as they pack up the car so they don't get caught out.\"\n\nAlthough there will not be roadworks, it is likely that the major works on the railways will cause more people to take to the roads.\n\nMr Dennis explained: \"The good news is that the majority of roadworks on England's major roads - the motorways and A-roads that carry the bulk of the traffic to popular Easter destinations such as the coast - will be free of works around the main Easter weekend.\n\n\"However, that's not the case on the railways with some major works planned so that will likely mean more people turning to cars, buses and coaches in some parts of the country. The message to drivers is to plan ahead and try to avoid the busiest times on the roads, which are likely to be Maundy Thursday and Good Friday itself.\"\n\nHave you heard about the possibility of #snow at #Easter?

We highly value our conductors, we're keeping them on our trains but we want them to concentrate on customer service rather than opening and closing doors.\"\n\nThe company said it would continue to run a full service during any proposed strike action using stand-in conductors.\n\nIt said they have been trained to the same standards as the usual conductors for the routes they operate.",

                "body": "My problem concerns funds held on my behalf by the Court Funds Office.\n\nIn 2004 I was awarded £5,000 compensation following a family holiday that resulted in sickness for my parents, my brother and myself.\n\nThe case was brought because the travel company had failed to advise us in advance that there was sickness at the resort, although it was aware of it.\n\nThe repercussions for me were particularly serious as I was under the care of a paediatrician at the time. My settlement has been with the Court Funds Office since then.\n\nShortly before my 18th birthday six months ago, I was invited to send my bank details so the funds could be transferred to me.\n\nThis I did, so they had the details just before my birthday. I heard nothing until I received notification to appear before a judge on a date that clashed with an exam.\n\nWe wrote explaining this, and asked for another date. This was acknowledged but I was still classed as a \"no show\". I had to wait 28 days for another date and eventually was invited to attend.\n\nMy mother took the day off work. We spent less than five minutes with the judge.\n\nCS, Warwick\n\nThe letter explaining you would not be available for the first hearing had not apparently reached the court file.\n\nThis meant the next hearing was not rescheduled until later than it would otherwise have been. When a hearing did take place, the judge completed a form and added a note requesting that the amount, which was more than £9,000, be transferred as soon as possible.\n\nThe payment schedule that was sent to the Court Funds Office was returned to the court as there were security holdings on the account that required another section on the payment schedule to be completed.\n\nAll this was taking time and by now you were needing the money to fund your gap year in Australia. You were setting off two weeks after you wrote to me and the matter had become decidedly urgent.\n\nI contacted the Court Funds Office, part of the Ministry of Justice. It now wrote to you elaborating that the court had not provided directions regarding the securities that form part of your fund.\n\nIt said the court must instruct the Court Funds Office on the reverse of the CFO 200 form regarding the payment, transfer or other relating to them.\n\nIt stressed that it couldn't pay out the funds without clear and concise instructions regarding the security holding. In the meantime your mother was using her own money to fund your trip.\n\nYou observe that your older brother had also received funds from the court. This was in 2015 and there were no such delays in him getting his money. My involvement led to your money being paid out in two tranches, some 33 weeks after it had been due.\n\nNormally applications to close a Court Fund account attract a fee of £50, which in this instance the court did not request.\n\nThe HM Courts and Tribunals Service said that the court has written to the individuals concerned and offered their apologies for the delay experienced. It has also paid you £150.",

Then we found that, without reference to us, it had sent out a settlement cheque by ordinary first-class post at the risk of the recipient.\n\nWe would never have selected this method of payment and, having voted against the scheme, had not consented to it in any way. Then we discovered the cheque had been intercepted and a fraudulent account opened with the Nationwide Building Society in our names.\n\nWe complained to Equiniti that it had acted beyond its authority and, having paid dividends by BACS in the past, could have paid us in the same way.\n\nThis complaint was rejected on the grounds that the terms of the offer were that the risk was ours.\n\nWe also complained that Nationwide had let someone open a fraudulent account using fake or forged documents.\n\nDavid Draysey, Kent\n\nFor more than 30 years you have had a legitimate account. How could Nationwide allow a fraudulent account to be opened in your name with a different address?\n\nIn the space of a week or so, the funds were withdrawn until just £22 remained in the account. Three weeks after it had been opened and two weeks after your cheque had been deposited, the account was reviewed by Nationwide's financial crimes team in relation to an issue affecting another customer. A week later it was closed.\n\nYou complained to Nationwide that it had failed to exercise a duty of care and due diligence. It asserted that it had followed all proper procedures.\n\nIt refused to disclose any further information to you but did admit to the police and the Financial Ombudsman Service's (FOS) adjudicator that it had not kept copies of any of the documents used to open the account. The adjudicator rejected your case.\n\nYou escalated it to a full ombudsman. He was not impressed with some of Nationwide's excuses.\n\nFor example, the identification documents were supposed to have been convincing. Yet the record of them showed that they were alleged to have been issued in different parts of the world on the same day. The claim was then upheld and Nationwide repaid the £27,000 plus 8pc interest, coming to £28,935.\n\nNationwide insisted it followed the correct account opening processes. It doesn't believe it acted negligently.\n\nEquiniti said it acts on the instructions of the company it does the administration for. In this case the corporate action was a Scheme of Arrangement, the rules for which are approved by the court including those relating to payments on share transfers.\n\nIt said the terms of these transactions were communicated via an \"Offer Document\" that was posted to all shareholders.",

The peer claimed her daughter picked this perception up from watching Peppa Pig, the popular children's cartoon.\n\n\"Deeply ingrained gender stereotyping starts early on,\" she said. \"It can still subconsciously drive women and men down different paths.\"\n\nHer comments were not limited to the issues women face and addressed the challenges for working fathers. Lady Bertin called for the \"stamping out of a macho culture that sniggers behind its hand at shared parental leave or dads playing a bigger role\".\n\nThe Government's new task force is chaired by Nikki Da Costa, the head of legislative affairs at No10 and made up of a committee of peers, MPs and policy experts.\n\nThe group aims to ensure all policy developed by the Government considers the impact on women and focuses on increasing their role in politics, business and society as a whole.\n\nIt follows the launch of a Telegraph campaign to champion female entrepreneurs and tackle the disparities in start-up funding between men and women.",

                "body": "Police on British military bases in Cyprus have used drones and night vision goggles to turn the tide in a campaign against illegal trappers catching and killing hundreds of thousands of songbirds.\n\nOfficers working with forces personnel estimate they have cut the number of migratory songbirds caught in trappers' nets by as much as 70 per cent and destroyed large amounts of kit used to catch them.\n\nThe year-long crackdown on illegal bird poaching on the British sovereign bases in Cyprus has resulted in a \"huge\" drop in the number of poachers operating inside the bases' territory.\n\nSmall migratory birds such as blackcaps are considered a traditional delicacy by some Cypriots and sophisticated trapping feeds a multimillion-pound illicit trade.\n\nGavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, said: \"Bird trapping is not only a cruel and barbaric trade, it lines the pockets of criminal gangs to the tune of thousands of pounds.\n\n\"Thanks to the fantastic work of our Armed Forces and the Sovereign Base Police there has been a 70 per cent fall in the number of birds killed in the Sovereign Base Areas. By seizing and destroying the tools criminals use, we are protecting migratory birds and hitting bird trappers in the pocket. And by doubling the number of thermal image drones used to catch the poachers, we will strive for even more positive results.\"\n\nTrappers use fine mist nets strung up in acacia trees or glue coated sticks to trap the birds which are then served up as the local dish ambelopoulia.\n\nExtensive irrigation systems are set up to water the acacia trees and the campaign by base police has included destroying 40 miles of pipes as well as nets and bird calling devices seized from trappers. More than sixty acres of acacia have been taken down at Cape Pyla.\n\nOne small mist net alone traps hundreds of birds at a time, and blackcaps sell for up to £65 per dozen.\n\nThe RSPB has estimated that more than 260,000 birds such as black caps and robins were trapped and killed last autumn at the British territory, down from the previous year's estimate of 880,000.\n\nChief Constable Chris Eyre, who has been leading the police efforts, said: \"With the support from the UK Government we have been able to dedicate more resources to this problem and we are now seeing the rewards of that commitment and that message is reaching the bird trapping community.\n\n\"Our work with the RSPB and the use of hidden cameras can also not be overlooked and that has led to a number of high-profile convictions.\"\n\nIn 2014 a leaked letter disclosed the Prince pf Wales had lobbied the commander of British forces on Cyprus to stop the annual \"barbaric slaughter\" of the birds at the Dhekelia base.\n\nIn a letter to Major-General Richard Cripwell he called for the removal of the acacia groves saying it would \"not only at a stroke save hundreds of thousands of birds being killed illegally on British soil, but would also prevent significant profits from flowing into the pockets of the serious organised criminals who control this barbaric practice\".",

                "body": "Picture this: Lewis Hamilton emerges from the corrugated iron pits at Silverstone in his ERA B-type. He's making his way to the grid, but pauses at some oil drums at the end of the pitlane. He's lost. His eyes glance left and right. Turning left takes him on to the circuit but right sends him to the infield and the ignominy of getting lost in a pig farm.\n\nA friendly marshal points the way, then Lewis pulls down his goggles and roars left on to the track. He has his work cut out today; the exotic Maseratis and Lago-Talbots are favourites to take victory at this, the very first British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It's 1948.\n\nIt's a favourite daydream of motoring enthusiasts and writers (like this one) to imagine what it would be like to teleport drivers from one era into another, which makes it hard not to chuckle at the notion of Lewis Hamilton racing at Silverstone when it hosted its first ever Grand Prix.\n\nAt that first ever Grand Prix, more than 100,000 spectators flocked from miles around - searching for fun and adventure in the stark austerity of post-war Britain. Silverstone was wildly different back then, with corrugated iron pits, oil drums and hay bales marking out a dauntingly fast circuit stitched together from the airfield's runways and aprons.\n\nAlmost incredibly, the initial lay-out for what understandably was dubbed the \"Race on the Runways\" saw drivers barreling towards each other from either end of the same central landing strip. And yes, there was indeed an active pig farm at its centre during Silverstone's first ever Grand Prix....\n\nWith Donington and Brooklands unavailable post-Second World War, the organising Royal Automobile Club tasked Jimmy Brown (an ex-RAF pilot) with creating the circuit in just a few weeks. Nearly 200 tonnes of straw bales were transported in, plus 10 miles of signal wiring, while more than 600 marshals were required to prepare it for race day.\n\nLittle did Brown know, or I suspect dream, that well into the next millennium echoes of his track would remain and turbocharged Grand Prix cars would still compete at what is a truly international venue.\n\nThe spirit of Silverstone is as strong as ever today, exactly 70 years later. It remains a pilgrimage for race fans and adventurers, or those who simply want a bloody good weekend's entertainment. And, for daydreamers who like to hybridise their eras, an extraordinary demonstration will take place later this summer that is unlikely to be repeated.\n\nFrom July 20-22, the Silverstone Classic - the world's biggest historic motor racing festival - will be celebrating the 70th anniversary of that first ever Grand Prix in 1948. Huge grids of cars from the majority of those seven decades will be back competing on the very same asphalt that's used for the current British Grand Prix, and parts of which that were used for the original Grand Prix.\n\nThe HGPCA races will undoubtedly appeal to those interested in 1950s and 1960s F1 cars, with early front-engined cars doing battle with examples of the earliest rear-engined cars. And that's not all. Fans will have the chance to watch the fat tyres and high airboxes that adorn the cartoonish DFV-era racing cars of the 1970s, plus the sensationally fast machines from the 1980s.\n\nAdding to the magic, these evocative cars are still painted, or stickered, in their original liveries which makes wandering around the paddocks and enjoying them up close almost as rewarding as seeing them out on track. It's a worthy celebration of the spirit and grit of the circuit's founding fathers and racers.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the Silverstone Classic has created a spectacle to match - if not exceed - that of 2014 when Stirling Moss led a world record parade of F1 cars in a Maserati 250F. At that first Grand Prix meeting of 1948, an 18-year-old Moss actually led the very first racing lap on the circuit when heading the pre-Grand Prix support race in his 500cc Cooper.\n\nAt this year's event, the organisers aim to assemble as many of the cars that raced in 1948 as possible for a very special display and track parade. As many as 20 of these cars are expected to come together in what promises to be an unmissable, and perhaps unrepeatable cavalcade.\n\nThe Silverstone Classic, of course, is famous for large track parades, with McLaren owners setting a Guinness World Record with a noisy and colourful collection of their cars in 2017. Other parades to enjoy in 2018 include the Ferrari Daytona (50 years young), the Porsche 356 and Jaguar XK120 (both celebrating 70th anniversaries) and the Aston Martin DB4 (turning 60 this year).\n\nAs ever at the Classic, off-track entertainment matches the on-track action, with live music from Soul II Soul and UB40 featuring Ali, Astro and Mickey plus numerous car club displays and endless family entertainment.\n\nIf you've never been, it really is a wonderful event for all ages. I tend to assemble three generations of my own family and spend the weekend exploring the event, safe in the knowledge that they will each find something to not only entertain, but fascinate.\n\nThat first Grand Prix in 1948 may sound inglorious to modern sensibilities, and, while a lot has changed in 70 years (including the removal of the pig sties), the unique character and spirit of the venue remains. Joining the celebrations at the Silverstone Classic promises to be a treat - even more so for those taking advantage of Early Bird ticket offers available until the end of this month.\n\nNick Trott is the Editor of Motor Sport.

                "title": "TAG Heuer hits the road with Aston Martin",
                "body": "TAG Heuer's partnership with Aston Martin is a match made in racing heaven, says Alex Doak\n\nFor a brand that began making dashboard chronographs in 1911, and almost single-handedly invented the notion of the \"driving watch\" with its Autavia and Carrera wrist chronographs in the early 1960s, TAG Heuer has been playing its motoring connections relatively lightly of late.\n\nDespite its status as \"engine name partner\" for Red Bull Racing's F1 cars, the brand's reorientation towards younger lifestyles has placed DJs, supermodels and surfers as prominently in its activities as things car-related. Which is why the announcement at this month's Geneva Motor Show of a new partnership with Aston Martin - also a sponsor of Red Bull Racing, and this season with its name in the title - seems so significant.\n\n\"The great thing about TAG Heuer is of course its huge, iconic heritage in motor racing,\" says Aston's design director Marek Reichman, who explains that his own first watch was a Heuer Monaco (see boxout, below), acquired at the Monaco Grand Prix. \"I spent all of my first two terms' student loan and ate beans for the next six months, but if you're a guy, who wouldn't want to be Steve McQueen?\" he says.\n\nTwo special-edition chronographs have been unveiled: a quartz Formula One watch inspired by the successful Aston Martin Racing (AMR) endurance racers, and a Carrera Calibre 01 chrono, designed in the same luxurious vein as Aston's grand-touring coupes, with exclusive features including a hexagonal cut-out dial inspired by details on the latest Vantage, and redesigned lugs and case.\n\nTo its many petrol-head fans, this brings TAG Heuer back into the mainstream motoring world - petrol coursing through its veins once more, as it were - alongside a carmaker truly going places. In late February, Aston Martin posted record pre-tax profits, and the strongest fourth-quarter performance in its history, fuelled by its first new core product in 13 years, the DB11.\n\nNew CEO Andy Palmer, meanwhile, is driving through a \"Second-Century Plan\" that sees its traditionally GT-oriented range exploding into almost every other conceivable luxury segment, from the \"Valkyrie\" mid-engined hypercar developed with Red Bull Racing (a new version with TAG Heuer's logo, shown above, was unveiled in Geneva) to an all-electric SUV being built at a vast new facility in south Wales.\n\nSimilarly, TAG Heuer is a watch brand that has been on manoeuvres in recent years. For example, both its tourbillon, retailing for an unprecedentedly accessible £12,100, and its high-profile swerve into the smartwatch sector, have been developments as notable as Aston's extreme Valkyrie project. The much-vaunted \"shared DNA\" conversation is actually far easier than expected with the new bedfellows.\n\n\"Our portfolio is growing, and that's where TAG Heuer really makes sense for us,\" Reichman told Telegraph Time on a trip to the carmaker's headquarters in Warwickshire. \"Because of its range, you can align with one collection that feels 'midengined', or another that's more 'GT' or 'SUV'.\" Reichman adds that TAG Heuer's speed of development is also very different to the slow lead times that are traditionally found in the watch industry.\n\n\"If you're a company running at a certain clock speed, you're never going to fit with someone running slower,\" he says. \"The reality is that TAG's clock speed is as fast as ours.\" The new launch models are just the start of an ongoing series - like Aston's Second-Century Plan, the long term is firmly in mind, with a Connected smartwatch on the cards, and then the promise of something that's truly unique. \"Start walking, then running,\" Reichman continues. \"We're getting the product to market to then get revenue to invest in what hasn't been done before.",

His former employee, Nico Rosberg, beside him, though, says he looks a bit more relaxed than usual. All will be revealed shortly, I suppose.\n\n5:17AM Tricky conditions in final practice\n\nBoth Sainz and Verstappen had a couple of \"moments\" in third practice...\n\nὢe Slip slidin' away... #AusGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/m9GNn7KT7H -- Formula 1 (@F1)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\n2:58PM Good morning! Hamilton will be title favourite again in 2018 but can he take pole in Melbourne? And how will Ferrari and Red Bull far?\n\nLewis Hamilton will start 2018 aiming for his fifth drivers' title and his fourth for Mercedes. But first he most focus on winning in Melbourne, something he failed to do last year. The world champion got off to an excellent start on Friday, topping the timesheets in both practice sessions - ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas in P1 and Red Bull's Max Verstappen in P2.\n\nA wet final practice didn't tell us much, but it saw a Ferrari 1-2, with Vettel leading Raikkonen, 2.5 seconds back. Only three drivers - the two Ferraris and the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson - set a time on dry-weather tyres. The Force India cars did not set a timed lap at all. That makes it difficult to read anything much into P3 times.\n\nWhat looked like a confirmation of the pace of the Silver Arrows in the morning session was rebutted in the afternoon session, as the margin between Hamilton and Verstappen was just 0.127 seconds. On first impressions it seems like Red Bull will be challenging Ferrari more frequently this year. Daniel Ricciardo, though, will take a three place grid penalty as a consequence of not slowing down sufficiently under red flag conditions.\n\nElsewhere in the field, Haas's Romain Grosjean put in a strong Friday to finish sixth, suggesting that the Haas might be as strong as they hope. The Frenchman does seem to go well on the streets of Albert Park, though. McLaren's partnership with Renault already looks better than their disastrous one with Honda but it looks like leading the midfield is the best they can hope for in 2018. It looks mighty tight in the midfield.\n\nAt the very back of the pack is Sauber, who are struggling immensely with their new-concept 2018 car. In other news, there will be an additional DRS zone for the Australian Grand Prix this weekend, which runs down the \"straight\" from turn 12 to the tight turn 13.\n\nWith a potentially damp Albert Park track for qualifying we should expect the unexpected, as the cliche goes. There are a few drivers handy in damp conditions and a few too who will be hoping for a wet weekend in Melbourne.",

Opting for Singapore Airlines via Singapore would take an extra 2 1/2 hours but cost just A$4,843 (£2,600), according to fares on Webjet.\n\nQantas has challenged Boeing and Airbus to build a jet by 2022 that can fly fully loaded from Sydney to London without a break.

                "body": "Comic Relief's tracksuit-clad offshoot returned for another night of fundraising challenges, sports-themed comedy and iffy music. But would it beat 2016's record total of £55,444,906?\n\nHere are the top 10 highlights from Friday night's stamina-testing six-hour telethon...\n\nMurray vs McIntyre was perfect match\n\nTennis titan Andy Murray got a rude awakening when comedian Michael McIntyre, a camera crew and an array of celebrities sneak into his hotel room in the dead of night.\n\nThe former Wimbledon champion's slumber was abruptly disturbed to take part in Midnight Gameshow, a regular segment on McIntyre's Big Show. Murray groggily greeted the gatecrashers with a string of bleeped-out expletives, before bursting into laughter and throwing himself into proceedings like a good sport.\n\nHe high-fived Peppa's Daddy Pig, hit tennis balls at The Stig's helmet, sang along to Spice Girls hits with Geri Halliwell and slurped down Ainsley Harriott's gruesome smoothies. Perhaps most impressively, he recognised Tim Henman by scent alone.\n\nMurray was game, as well as set and match. Any cynic who ever accuses him of being dour just needs to be shown this clip - one of the highlights of the evening.\n\nScott salsa-ed to Strictly victory\n\nGlitterball control was in evidence as Wembley Arena hosted a special footballing mini-edition of Strictly Come Dancing. Gallic smoothie David \"Daffeeed\" Ginola, England women's stalwart Alex Scott and pundit-cum-online betting plugger Chris \"Kammy\" Kamara transferred their fancy footwork to the dancefloor.\n\nAfter limited training time, their salsas to New Order's World In Motion weren't terribly slick. Kammy's lumpen disco dad moves were inevitably declared \"a complete dance dis-ah-ster\" by judge Craig Revel Horwood - who duly got a red card from colleague Bruno Tonioli. Ginola was far superior and enjoyed sizzling Latin chemistry with pro partner Karen Clifton.\n\nHowever, it was Scott who deservedly lifted the glitterball trophy after her routine with partner Pasha Kovalev was full of sassy leg action and spectacular lifts. Anglo-Russian relations were at least cordial in the ballroom.\n\nFemale viewers of a certain age might have complained that silver fox Ginola was robbed, but by far the biggest cheer of the evening came for John Barnes, who put in a surprise appearance to bust out his much-loved Eng-er-land rap. \"Express yourself, it's one-on-one\" indeed.\n\nJohn Bishop's \"Spirit Of '66\" skit fell flat\n\nStepping into the motivational shoes of James Corden's Smithy character, Scouse comic John Bishop was on a mission to help the England football team win this summer's World Cup. Miracles were required, frankly.\n\nThe sketch's tenuous premise tried to restore old-skool values to the 21st century game. Hence Sir Geoff Hurst admonished today's squad for their elaborate goal celebrations, Jamie Vardy donned a Bobby Charlton combover wig and four unfortunate players were made to dress as the Beatles - complete with a stilted phonecam appearance from Thomas The Tank Engine. Sorry, Ringo Starr.\n\nHowever, the involvement of Ricky Hatton, Mel C and Jonny Wilkinson didn't remotely fit the theme. Other celeb cameos were painfully stilted. Gags were met with tumbleweed. This disappointing skit was all guest and no giggles.\n\nCelebrity boxing was back\n\nA regular feature of Sport Relief is well-padded famous faces - well, their cheekbones are their fortunes - taking to the boxing ring. Who can forget Ricky Gervais vs Grant Bovey or Bob Mortimer vs Les Dennis back in the early Noughties? You did? Ah, well.\n\nSuch bouts have been off our screens for more than a decade after the boxing authorities denounced them as dangerous and irresponsible, threatening to revoke the licences of professional trainers taking part.\n\nHowever, hoops had been jumped through, three months' training was undertaken and licences were granted again. We got not one but three fights here. They didn't feature the starriest names, admittedly, but were still grimly compelling to watch.\n\nThe first two bouts were bruisingly one-sided. Blue Peter alumnus Helen Skelton gave Love Island's Camilla Thurlow a thorough pasting. You wouldn't squabble with Skelton over the sticky-backed plastic. Former footballer Wayne Bridge then wiped the smile off Made In Chelsea ladies' man Spencer Matthews with his jack-hammer jab and superior skills.\n\nFinally, the battle of the popstrels was the closest clash of the evening. Fists flailed. Technique failed under pressure. Yet Vanessa White from The Saturdays' heavy right hand narrowly edged out S Club 7's persistently plucky Hannah Spearritt. There will be some sore jaws and shiners on red carpets next week.\n\nOarsome BBC beat sinking ITV\n\nThe \"Battle of the Channels\" celebrity boat race was broadcast on the BBC and held on a 1200-metre course along Salford Quays near BBC Sport HQ. Surely there could only be one winner?\n\nSighs of relief all round at the Corporation, then, when their team beat ITV's by a boat length. It didn't help that the ITV crew seemed to take a commercial break mid-race and lost their oars. It was like the Strictly vs X Factor ratings battle in nautical form.\n\nQuestion time for Ed Balls\n\nWhile the News at Ten interrupted proceedings on BBC One, perma-smiling Sue Barker kept things ticking over on BBC Two with a special edition of back-slapping, banter-swapping quiz A Question Of Sport.\n\nGuests Denise Lewis, Frank Skinner, Paddy McGuinness and Ed Balls joined regular rival captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell, who finally got to team up. And, indeed, dramatically win by a single point. \"No wonder Labour aren't in government!\" yelled a hoarse McGuinness as Balls struggled in the crucial quickfire round.\n\nThe result was a rollickingly entertaining half-hour during which Skinner and McGuinness stole most of the laughs but Balls won hearts with his endearingly nerdy musical knowledge and not one but two gratuitous outbreaks of his signature Gangnam Style dance moves. Oppa Ed Balls style! Again!\n\nMusical offerings hit some bum notes\n\nAgeless Aussie pop pixie Kylie \"she goes by one name nowadays\" Minogue opened the show with a nasal live rendition of her country-scented new single Dancing. We later saw the return of dormant Scots stadium rockers Snow Patrol. During a stripped-back and creaky rendition of their signature hit Run, a backing choir covered a multitude of sins.\n\nEven worse was John Bishop and Melanie \"Sporty Spice\" Chisholm's unofficial football anthem Merry World Cup, which would have had Slade turning in their graves. Well, if they were dead anyway.\n\nInstead it was the younger female artists who provided the night's musical high points: Meghan Trainor with her infectious new single No Excuses and Rae Morris with lighters-aloft piano ballad Someone Out There.\n\nMagic of sport was alive and well\n\nMop-topped magician Ben Hanlin - star of ITV2's Tricked (me neither) - went behind the scenes at the Sports Personality Of The Year to wow an array of A-list athletes with his conjuring skills.\n\nHanlin did some Derren Brown-style mind control on Tom Daley and Michael Johnson. He freaked out Harry Kane and Anthony Joshua with card tricks. He baffled a quartet of Olympians by making them design the same kit he was wearing beneath his suit. How did he do it all? That's magic. Hanlin certainly deserves a bigger stage than ITV2, though.\n\nLive TV was as gloriously unpredictable as ever\n\nLike always with live television, plentiful moving parts and random factors meant things didn't always run smoothly. We got fluffed links, occasional sound problems and awkward pauses.\n\nAnchorman Gary Lineker managed to miss an air-kiss with Alex Jones and trip over a glitter cannon, nearly setting it off at an inopportune moment. In fact, the stage manager might want to rethink their placemen because Freddie Flintoff later tripped over the same pyrotechnic device.\n\nThe night's best blooper, though, was when Strictly Come Dancing champion Joe McFadden surprised a fundraising hero in the studio audience and she exclaimed: \"I love Casualty!\" \"I'm in Holby! Holby!\" he replied with a rictus grin. Easy mistake to make.\n\nSwimming With Men made a splash\n\nRob Brydon and the cast of upcoming Britflick comedy Swimming With Men donned wetsuits and nose clips for a special all-male synchronised swimming routine. Joined by co-stars including Rupert Graves, Thomas Turgoose, Daniel Mays and Jim Carter (going from Downton to Drownton), Brydon's chlorine-scented choreography was really rather impressive.\n\nWhether this summer's film - dubbed \"The Full Monty in goggles\" - lives up to this sneak peek remains to be seen but it sure showed promise. No ducking, no bombing, no petting.",

It is free to correct a spelling mistake.\n\nAirlines have denied that their charges are hidden.\n\nUnder government plans, airlines could be required to present costs in a transparent way and review their charges if they are deemed to be excessive, The Times reported.\n\nAccording to a study last year, 66 of the world's biggest airlines made £33 billion via fees - amounting to nearly 10 per cent of their total income.\n\nAviation Minister Baroness Sugg said: \"When passengers book flights, they can sometimes be hit with additional charges over and above the original quoted flight cost.\n\n\"The DfT puts passengers at the heart of everything we do and we want to ensure people have as much information as possible when making decisions over which flight to book.\n\n\"Through our Aviation Strategy, we will explore ways to improve and enhance the information available, so passengers can make well-informed decisions before deciding who to fly with.\"",

Brasher's hallmark - the letters EB - are inside an oval on the eagle's right wing.\n\nThe reverse displays a version of the state of New York's coat of arms, featuring a sun rising over a mountain peak and the sea surrounded by the words NOVA EBORACA COLUMBIA EXCELSIOR, which translates to \"New York, America, Ever Higher.\"\n\nExcelsior remains the state motto to this day.\n\nBrasher lived at 3 Cherry Street and Washington at 1 Cherry Street in Cherry Hill, a fashionable part of Manhattan in the late 18th century, which lies just north of the present day Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nThe first American president was a loyal customer of Brasher's, buying a number of other items including silver skewers.\n\nMore recently the coin entered popular culture thanks to Raymond Chandler, whose novel The High Window centred on the fictional theft of a Brasher Doubloon.\n\nIt was also featured in a film called The Brasher Doubloon made by 20th Century Fox in 1947.\n\nThe coin was sold to an anonymous collector on the US west coast in a private transaction brokered by Heritage Auctions, the world's largest rare coin auctioneer.",

                "body": "Modern car headlights are too bright and are distracting drivers, the RAC has warned, as it is feared that \"energy efficient\" light bulbs are behind a rise in complaints.\n\nSome 15 per cent of drivers have suffered a near-miss due to the brightness of some new car headlights, according to a new report by the motoring body.\n\nFollowing a rise in complaints the Department for Transport set up a United Nations working group to explore why more drivers felt car headlights had become overly bright.\n\nThe rise in popularity of LED lights are among the potential causes of the problem being explored by the group.\n\nLED lamps produce light using light-emitting diodes and have a lifespan and electrical efficiency which are several times greater than incandescent lamps and fluorescent lamps.\n\nLighting experts said it was \"no coincidence\" that makers of upmarket cars have been fitting more car headlights with efficient LED lights over the past decade, instead of traditional halogen bulbs.\n\nStephen Dixon, a lighting expert at the Quality Light Source Factory, said the rise of LED lights in car headlights was likely to be why people perceiving them to be brighter.\n\nHe said: \"LED light is more directional. Rather than being big spread of light which comes from a halogen bulb, LED light is more focused. It is also a traditionally brighter light which appears as blue white, hence why it appears brighter in the dark.\"\n\nLED lights are most commonly found in upmarket cars as well as top-spec versions of mid-range vehicles.\n\nAll cars sold for road use in the UK have to be fitted with headlamps that conform to standards set by the EU in line with the United Nations' World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations.\n\nGovernment guidelines say all vehicle lamps and in particular headlamps, are designed and tested to ensure that they balance the need to be sufficiently bright to illuminate the road ahead whilst limiting the likelihood of affecting the vision of other road users.\n\nFor all vehicle lamps irrespective of technology used to generate the light, there are approval requirements that define maximum and minimum intensity, light pattern and position on the vehicle. Before vehicles can be sold and registered in the UK, they must be approved to the required regulations.\n\nRAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said: \"The intensity and brightness of some new car headlights is clearly causing difficulty for other road users.\n\n\"Headlight technology has advanced considerably in recent years, but while that may be better for the drivers of those particular vehicles, it is presenting an unwanted, new road safety risk for anyone driving towards them or even trying to pull out at a junction.\n\n\"Drivers also find it very distracting when they have to contend with being dazzled by bright lights in their rear view mirrors.\n\n\"While regulations specify that all types of dipped headlights must fall between a maximum and minimum luminosity the night-time driving experience of motorists of all ages is very different with many saying dipped beams of some modern vehicles are too bright.\n\n\"We look forward to seeing the progress of the United Nations' vehicle lighting working group in April.\"",

                "body": "Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee would not have succeeded as political leaders today because modern Britain prefers the showmanship of \"bounders\" like Boris Johnson, according to the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey.\n\nThe popularity of Mr Johnson in Britain, Donald Trump in the US and Vladimir Putin in Russia is a sad indictment of \"the dominance of the personality\" in politics, Lord Carey said.\n\nHe claimed: \"Some of the greatest leaders in recent history would not even shine in today's environment. Where would you place Roosevelt, Truman, Attlee, Churchill, who would find it difficult to stand out [even] with their impressive gifts?\"\n\nRemembering the Britain of his younger years, Lord Carey told an audience at the Oxford Literary Festival: \"Before television was as powerful as it is now, politicians [were] on our doorstep. The constituency MP was there in church halls, town halls, parish halls. Whilst this continues, it is a shadow of what it was because of the debates on television before vast audiences.\n\n\"And this led to the diminishing of debate and the rise of the charismatic individual. We look around and see personalities like Donald Trump in the States, Emmanuel Macron in France, Boris Johnson in the United Kingdom, Putin in Russia, Erdogan in Turkey, dominating the airwaves.\"\n\nReferring to a biography of Mr Johnson, which alleged that the Foreign Secretary had betrayed friends and colleagues, taken a mistress, lied during his journalistic career and \"winged it\" through his professional life, Lord Carey said: \"Yet Boris the showman, Boris the bounder, Boris the man who cheered up the Tories during their darkest decade, remains liked by millions who know him only by his Wooster-ish turns on television and tabloid tales of his rackety private life.\n\n\"This Wooster-ish character is strongly tipped for the highest political office in the United Kingdom.\"",

We only had 23.1 overs yesterday due to rain and the forecast is also bleak for today, so it could be another interrupted day's play. Although England fans might not mind that with their team in major trouble despite the time lost.\n\nEngland will need early wickets if they are any chance of clawing back into the contest. Play will start 30 minutes earlier - 12.30am GMT - if the weather holds.\n\n6:21PM What happened on day two?\n\nEngland were powerless to stop Kane Williamson registering a New Zealand record 18th Test century on a rain-wrecked second day of the pink-ball Test at Eden Park.\n\nWilliamson (102) completed his century, going one above team-mate Ross Taylor and Kiwi great Martin Crowe, before James Anderson saw him off with the second new ball.\n\nAfter England's miserable 58 all out in the first session of this series opener, the hosts consolidated adequately as they moved from 175 for three to 229 for four in the 23.1 overs possible.\n\nBritish pop singer Ed Sheeran, in town for a weekend concert, was out of luck as rain ruined his trip to the cricket. He did visit both dressing rooms between the downpours to have a quick chat, though, and was presented with a bat by Mark Wood.\n\nMuch the heaviest of several showers interrupted play midway through the second session and, despite a later improvement, conditions did not allow a resumption.\n\nThe New Zealand captain - who had resumed on 91 - moved to his hundred in 196 balls, having hit 11 fours and one six.\n\nAt just 27, he has time on his side to set New Zealand's run-making benchmark for the ages.\n\nHis third-wicket stand with Henry Nicholls ended on 83, though, when Anderson (three for 53) beat him with a touch of inswing as Williamson played outside the line to be lbw pushing forward.\n\nBy then, he had provided England's batsmen with an object lesson in the patience required to negate early lateral movement - of which the visiting attack found much less than New Zealand's Trent Boult and Tim Southee - before cashing in on a pitch of easy pace and true bounce.\n\nNicholls took Williamson's cue, in no hurry either and gradually accumulating low-risk runs to help consolidate New Zealand's yawning advantage.\n\nThe left-hander was just a single short of his 50, from 143 balls, with BJ Watling for company when bad weather intervened.\n\nEngland are therefore in a miserable spot, largely of their own making.\n\nBut so grim is the weekend forecast, it is not yet a forlorn hope that they could escape Auckland with an as yet undeserved stalemate.\n\nTristan Lavalette will be here from around midnight GMT to provide build up and over-by-over action on day three.",

                "body": "Investors dumped shares in industrial conglomerate Smiths Group on worries that it will not hit its growth targets after downbeat interim results on Friday.\n\nThe FTSE 100 company - which makes devices from airport security scanners and medical equipment to electrical connectors and hoses - said in the six months to the end of January underlying revenues were flat at £1.5bn.\n\nHowever, on a statutory measure they slipped 4pc, a decline attributed to foreign currency movements and a £126m boost from disposals last time round.\n\nHeadline pre-tax profit was 12pc lower at £217m, but crashed 42pc on a statutory basis to £199m.\n\nThe numbers caused alarm in the markets, with the shares dropping more than 10pc at one point - their largest fall in almost a decade - before recovering some lost ground later in the day. The stock closed 67.5p, or 4.3pc, down at £14.69, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.\n\nDespite the declines on statutory measures Andrew Reynolds Smith, chief executive, called the first half \"encouraging\" as the company focused on a restructuring designed to make it more sustainable, with a fresh focus on the research and development of new products.\n\nElsewhere, the British high street enjoyed a boost with retailers' shares rising across the board.\n\nNext led the FTSE 100 gainers for most of the day despite reporting a fall in pre-tax profit for the year, climbing 355p to £49.84. A brighter outlook for this year meant investors were keen to buy, despite the figures.\n\nMeanwhile, Marks & Spencer jumped 3.1p to 268.4p on the back of an announcement earlier in the week that supermarket industry veteran Stuart Machin would be joining to head up its food division.\n\nHis appointment suggests that boss Steve Rowe's shake-up of the senior management team is almost complete, boosting investor confidence.\n\nSolid retail trading figures for February, which were released on Thursday, boosted the sector into the end of the week with Pets At Home, Dunelm, Superdry, JD Sports and Dixons Carphone among the FTSE 250's top climbers on Friday. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes were up by 0.8pc last month - the first increase in sales in three months.\n\nTed Baker recovered some of its losses after reporting challenging trading conditions on Thursday, finishing the day 98p higher at £26.54.\n\nShares in pharmaceutical company Indivior fell by as much as 24pc after it lost a second legal case in recent months in its battle to protect the patent of its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone Film, a drug which generates 80pc of its revenues. The company finished the day 25.5p, or 6.2pc, lower at 382.8p.\n\nOverall, the FTSE 100 finished the week more than 242 points lower than its opening price on Monday at 6,921.94, while the FTSE 250 lost 485 points to finish at 19,319.48.",

                "title": "England manager revels     in giving youngsters free rein to 'play with freedom'",
                "body": "Gareth Southgate believes England's latest generation are proving they are ready to beat the fear factor at this summer's World Cup.\n\nJesse Lingard's first international goal secured victory over Holland in the first of England's four warm-up friendlies ahead of Russia. But it was the manner in which his young players are performing and the risks they are willing to take that has impressed manager Southgate.\n\n\"We have a different type of player coming through our academies to the past in terms of their ability to play as we did,\" said Southgate. \"We want them to express themselves, to play with freedom.\n\n\"They are capable of playing in a really composed way, which they showed. They think about the angles. Some of the angles the back players made were outstanding. They're intelligent footballers.\n\n\"I shouldn't be inhibiting the way they play. They have absolute belief in their ability. They will concede possession sometimes, but I enjoyed watching them play.\"\n\nSouthgate took a gamble by naming right-back Kyle Walker in his back three and also started with 20-year-old Joe Gomez, who was forced off through injury in just the 10th minute. \"In a back three, we knew the position would suit Joe Gomez when he played there in ­November, and it was the same for Kyle,\" said Southgate. \"You need to be able to be comfortable when you play in wide areas.\n\n\"His use of the ball is really composed as a full-back. His pace is a tremendous asset to the defence but, if you watch Manchester City play, that's where he ends up.\n\n\"He doesn't maraud forward as he did at Spurs. Their left-back moves wide and he tucks in. The added bonus is his relationship with John [Stones] at club level, where you could see the positions he took up and the belief in each other on the ball.\n\n\"I'm pleased if it surprised people but, for me, it wasn't a difficult decision. Sometimes you go to a World Cup taking two players for every position, but I don't want to take six centre-backs. So if we have people like Kyle and Eric [Dier] who can slot in, it may allow us to take more attacking players.\"\n\nAsked about the injury to Gomez and whether or not he will be fit to face Italy on Tuesday night at Wembley, Southgate added: \"Gomez seemed to take a knock in the air and landed awkwardly. We'll check.\"\n\nLeicester City defender Harry Maguire replaced Gomez, but he was also forced off late on.\n\n\"Maguire was a tight hamstring,\" said Southgate. \"We didn't want him to play that long tonight after extra time last Sunday and he hadn't trained with the group until Wednesday. But his performance was outstanding. He's a top player, a really good player. So a couple of things to check for us over the weekend.\"\n\nSouthgate will make changes for the Italy game, with Jamie Vardy and goalkeeper Jack Butland both expected to start at Wembley.",

                "body": "For the second time in three days, Miami's ticket holders found themselves bewildered. They had come to cheer Novak Djokovic, a six-time champion here. And yet, just like Serena Williams on Wednesday, Djokovic kept missing his cues. The serve that used to find its spots so unerringly was creaky and slow. The backhand - once seen by many as the most complete double-hander in the game - sprayed errors.\n\nBut perhaps the most bizarre aspect of this performance was the lack of urgency. Djokovic slouched around the court where he used to strut. His opponent, 47th-ranked Benoit Paire, is known as one of the flakiest players on the tour, but it was Paire who had the more businesslike head on as he swept to a 6-3, 6-4 victory in just 67 minutes.\n\nThis was Djokovic's third straight defeat - a statistic that we have not seen since 2007, when he was 20 years old. Afterwards, he sounded both confused and conflicted. \"I'm trying, but it's not working,\" he said. \"I felt I started the match well, first six games, then I just ran out of gas. I just wasn't able to break him down. It happened very fast.\n\n\"I'm not at the level that I used to be. I'm aware of that. I just have to obviously believe in myself and hopefully it will come.\"\n\nWe were expecting the next step on Djokovic's itinerary to be Monte Carlo, the millionaire's tax haven where he lives with his wife and young son. Yet he was reluctant to commit to the tournament on Friday night, saying \"That was the plan, but let's see what happens.\"\n\nWhile Djokovic claims that his right elbow is pain-free for the first time in years, he seems to have been gripped by an indefinable malaise. Ironically, a physical injury might be easier to treat.\n\nBritish No 1 Johanna Konta opened the defence of her most prestigious title with a solid 6-4, 6-3 victory over world No 71 Kirsten Flipkens. \"I really enjoyed being back out there,\" said Konta. \"There's definitely a lot of great memories, not just from last year but the year before. She [Flipkens] is quite tricky to play. She can be very handsy and uses her slice well.\"\n\nEarlier, British No 4 Liam Broady had gone down 6-3, 6-2 to world No 27 Filip Krajinovic.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lawn Tennis Association revealed that a selected shortlist of tennis centres that have applied for the new National Academy role. They are Stirling, Loughborough, Bath, Culford and Bisham Abbey.\n\nOne or perhaps two centres will be chosen to implement the programme, which will charge parents of children aged 14 and over no more than £5,000 per annum while delivering a tailored programme of coaching, fitness training and physiotherapy worth around £35,000.",

                "body": "Jackson Wray returns to London Stadium on business rather than pleasure on Saturday afternoon, but the Saracen might enjoy a less stressful experience during a sold-out Premiership fixture against Harlequins than he endured on his last visit to Stratford.\n\nAlongside another avid West Ham supporter, Saracens backs coach Kevin Sorrell, Wray attended the ill-fated 3-0 defeat to Burnley on March 10. The pair had joined a fans' forum event beforehand and were sitting in the stands above the board of directors as rioting broke out in the second half - ugly scenes they were hugely disappointed to see.\n\nWray reckons he has seen the venue \"at its best and at its worst\". Immense volume produced a \"phenomenal atmosphere\" for the 1-1 draw against Leicester in November. He offers a measured take on West Ham's overall situation.\n\n\"I was all for the move and I still am,\" says Wray, ahead of the first major sporting event held at London Stadium since the Premier League game that brought lifetime bans for five pitch invaders.\n\n\"Personally, I think we had to go. It was too good an opportunity. The problems are some of the promises that were made. It is not quite as good as they had shown us and told us it would be.\n\n\"The place as a whole is impressive and if they make the changes they said they are going to make and sort the problems out, it will be good going forward.\n\n\"Right now, I can see why [supporters] are not happy. Long-term I can see it will be good. I'm looking forward to this weekend. We don't see many [home wins] so hopefully we can celebrate in the home changing room for once.\"\n\nA double \"we\", referring to different teams, explains why he is poised for a special day. A fine marketing effort by Saracens has included a promotional video of the 27 year-old blowing bubbles in homage to West Ham's unveiling of Patrice Evra. He has copped fearful ribbing for his acting performance all week, but a a capacity crowd of 57,000 is expected.\n\nWe love this game! #ForEvraBlowingBubbles pic.twitter.com/UugpXaL6um -- West Ham United (@WestHamUtd)\n\nFebruary 7, 2018\n\nWith Channel 5 showing the match as well as BT Sport, it should reach a significant audience. When Harlequins beat his side 20-19 in December, Saracens coach Alex Sanderson remarked that John Kingston's team tends to \"grow a pair\" in these meetings. There is an enticing shop window for another exciting, tetchy meeting.\n\nEngland regulars will be reintegrated to both squads, too. Harlequins call upon Kyle Sinckler, Chris Robshaw, Danny Care and Mike Brown. Jamie George, Maro Itoje and Richard Wigglesworth are named in Saracens' starting line-up just one week after a stinging defeat to Ireland.\n\n\"It's been a different time for them to come back, on the back of some losses,\" explains Wray, who has featured in 16 of Saracens' 17 games in the Premiership and four of six in the Champions Cup.\n\n\"But a lot of our guys went really well in some difficult times. Getting those boys back is fantastic. They bring a voice, they bring energy, obviously quality but they are also good mates.\n\n\"It's been good to catch up with them, getting their feedback on the last few weeks and their thoughts on how we have been going [without them].\"\n\nDespite testing spells this campaign, Saracens remain third on the Premiership ladder - hopeful of forcing a home play-off - with a Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster to come next Sunday. Figures like Wray, wearing the number eight shirt this weekend, have been integral to their perseverance.\n\nReturning to football, the Essex-born back-rower ironically describes Burnley as a cohesive, hard-working outfit that share some of Saracens' traits. He also remembers highlights - Paolo Di Canio's stunning scissor-kick among other nights at Upton Park - and lowlights such as Liverpool's comeback to win the 2006 FA Cup final on penalties: \"I still can't believe Steven Gerrard scored that goal.\"\n\nPondering his relationship with West Ham as a whole, Wray inadvertently reveals a lesson that might have steeled Saracens for what Mark McCall has labelled the \"home straight\" of this season.\n\n\"It's been up and down, but it keeps you grounded. If you get used to winning too much, that's not a good thing.\"\n\nThis soundbite could just as easily be attached to Saracens. For all their success over the last few trophy-laden years, Wray and his teammates are taking nothing for granted.",

                "title": "Gareth Southgate's Dutch courage helps transitional England team make progress",
                "body": "England may be stuck in an experimental loop: bad news, given the proximity of the World Cup, but understandable in the context of manpower gaps across Gareth Southgate's squad.\n\nWhen the invasion of Russia ends, Southgate may even make a speech akin to Jose Mourinho's when Manchester United went out of the Champions League to Sevilla. You know the one. Paraphrased, it goes: surely you can see we lack the tools to actually win this tournament, but I could never have said so before it started. No England manager would dare say the side was in a transitional phase three months before a World Cup - but that was the inference from Southgate's team selection here.\n\nSometimes, a hunch turns out well, and hunches featuring Jesse Lingard have a habit of coming off for club and country. Lingard's talent for deadlock-breaking goals was apparent when he beat Holland's keeper, Jeroen Zoet, from the edge of the penalty box on 59 minutes: a reassuring payback for Southgate after his team-sheet had had been met with much puzzlement.\n\nThe old school way of approaching the first of four warm-up games would have been to pick the closest possible XI to the one that will start against Tunisia in Volgograd on 18 June, with everyone in their usual position.\n\nSouthgate had other ideas, moving Kyle Walker to centre-back, Marcus Rashford to centre-forward (in the absence of Harry Kane) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain into a central midfield role he appeared not to grasp - if grasping it meant helping out Jordan Henderson, who became a one-man pivot in front of England's back-three.\n\nViewed one way, Southgate was testing his second tier of players - and resting some possible/probable starters in Russia. Dele Alli, Eric Dier and Ashley Young all started on the bench. One of few certainties for the Tunisia game is that Kane and Alli will be England's most potent attacking duo, assuming Kane is fit. Four games out, Kane was unavailable and Alli was behind Jess Lingard in Southgate's thinking for the first-half against football's new sick man of Europe. The competition may do Alli good.\n\nThese were not random picks. Southgate is working to a larger plan of making England's senior team patient and comfortable in possession. He thinks there can be no escape from the dark age of tournament flame-outs until the basic language of international football is learned.\n\nWe can applaud him for that, but the reality on the ground can jump up and bite you. Moving Walker inside for example deprived England of their most potent wide player. And Henderson's loneliness in deep midfield was almost tear-jerking as Oxlade-Chamberlain left him to it. Picking four full-backs in the back five (if you include Joe Gomez) was also unexpected. Gomez lasted only nine minutes and was replaced by Harry Maguire, ahead of James Tarkowski and Alfie Mawson, who have surely graduated too late to be viewed as likely World Cup starters.\n\nAt last the 'front' of this England side bristles with potential game-changers. Heavy stress needs placing there on 'potential.' Kane will return with 52 years of history on his back. Rashford is a starlet hindered by Alexis Sanchez's arrival at Man Utd. Lingard has fared better than expected under Mourinho. Sterling, who has held his own in Guardiola's symphony orchestra, is the one who needs liberating by the England manager - certainly psychologically. Jamie Vardy is an obvious 'impact' sub for a team in need of pace and directness against tired defences while Danny Welbeck serves a purpose without always presenting a threat.\n\nSouthgate's reign can be set out in three parts: qualification (after the Sam Allardyce farce), the 'thinking time' of winter, and this run of four prep games, divided by the business end of the club season. This double header of friendlies, against Holland and Italy, feel like the end of the runway, because Nigeria (2 June) and Costa Rica (7 June) will be more like bonding exercises than auditions. Remarkably, Kane's absence means that the 'real' England team will not be seen in 2018 before the first World Cup fixture is 16 days away.\n\nSo, unresolved issues will follow England all the way into June. Goalkeeper - big question, with Jordan Pickford inching ahead in Amsterdam. The three centre-backs - still up in the air, with John Stones a certainty, and Maguire, Gomez, Phil Jones, Tarkowski, and Mawson in theory challenging (and Eric Dier an auxiliary option). Central midfield is hit and hope, with Henderson looking for a partner, and Dier's effectiveness at Spurs dipping.\n\nThese are the knotty problems, but there are plusses too. Southgate's calmness and intelligence seem to be playing well with the younger England players, who seem keen enough to give national service a proper go. We say this every time, of course. The fatalism sets in when things go wrong, and can sweep through England squads. Equally, Southgate has placed his bets on a back-three in Russia, and can build from there, in a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2.\n\nMost of all, the success of England's younger teams in international tournaments has revived the idea that 'development' is possible, and worth waiting for. The trouble is, nobody is in waiting mode when World Cups start. Southgate hardly answered all the questions in Amsterdam, but a mature performance looked like progress.",

                "title": "Lee Bowyer admits 'it's crazy' but is loving the challenge ahead after being named caretaker manager at Charlton",
                "body": "A year ago, Lee Bowyer was perfectly happy running a carp fishing lake in eastern France, putting 18 years of professional football behind him. Thoughts of entering the managerial world had barely entered his head, which is why he as much as anyone was surprised to find himself facing the media on Friday having been appointed caretaker at Charlton until the end of the season.\n\nHe is trying to pick up the pieces after Karl Robinson - the man who persuaded him to come back to his first club as a part-time coach - resigned to take over at Oxford, a decision which shows just how far Charlton have fallen in recent years.\n\nBowyer is a managerial novice and, having after walking away from the carp business some might say he is - excuse the pun - a fish out of water. But Bowyer is adamant that despite his interest in management being relatively recent his knowledge of the game will stand him in good stead.\n\n\"It's crazy the way I'm sitting here now, I literally came in at the end of last season two days a week just to help out the midfielders,\" he says.\n\n\"I had no intention of becoming a manager. I had no intention of being a coach. When I was finished playing football I had five years out, and I enjoyed that time. Then I went with Harry [Kewell] to Watford just for six weeks to help him out with his under-21 side, and that gave me the taste of that winning feeling and being in and around football again.\n\n\"I know what it's about. I've been in dressing rooms for 20 years, and being here with Karl I've learnt a lot. I don't need anybody to tell me.\n\n\"As long as I'm here I'll continue to keep passing on my knowledge and try to direct the team, not just from me as a player but from players that I played with or against. So if there's something that I couldn't cope with as a player which one of our midfielders can bring into their game that's going to make them a better player, then I'm going to pass on that knowledge.\"\n\nIf Bowyer can use that knowledge wisely then Charlton might just mount the unlikeliest of promotion pushes, one that takes place against a backdrop of chronic instability and fan unrest.\n\nBowyer is the ninth manager appointed since Roland Duchatalet bought the club in 2014, with relegation to League One and a boycott of the Valley by the club's supporters meaning the 41-year-old is taking over at a hugely uncertain time. There is speculation that Duchatelet's tenure could soon come to an end, with an Australian consortium headed by businessman Andrew Muir linked with a takeover.\n\nThat uncertainty - which Bowyer says is no excuse for the club's form - contributed to Robinson's departure for a team seven points and as many places below Charlton in the table.\n\n\"Of course I'm surprised, but I can't control what Karl does in his career, these things happen,\" said Bowyer, whose side host Plymouth on Saturday, when asked whether he was shocked at Robinson's decision.\n\n\"It's a challenge, but my whole career I've loved challenges, and I love to win. So in the time I'm here I'll be putting all my concentration and knowledge into doing so. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\n\"I am looking to win tomorrow. I'll be setting out that team to win, and I guarantee you everyone on that pitch whether they start or come on will be giving 100 per cent because I won't take nothing less than that.\"\n\nAnd Bowyer is not thinking long-term at a club where short-termism has taken priority in recent years.\n\n\"Ask me at the end of the season,\" says Bowyer when asked if he wants the job full-time. \"I know I can do it, it's just whether I want to do it.\"",

                "body": "Ryan Giggs revealed the advice of Eddie Jones, the head coach of the England rugby team, Antonio Conte, Chelsea manager, helped him get his tenure as Wales manager off to a winning start in China.\n\nGareth Bale's historic hat-trick moved him past Ian Rush and into the lead as Wales' record goal scorer as Giggs' first game in charge ended with a 6-0 thrashing of the host nation.\n\nThe rookie 44-year-old manager is making his first steps into full-time management and admits he is far from the finished product. Giggs' four-game stint as interim Manchester United manager in 2014 left its mark, leaving the Old Trafford winger to broaden his horizons in search of success.\n\n\"I learned a lot about how lonely it was when I was United manager. When you shut the door of your office and everyone else has gone home, you're on your own,\" Giggs said.\n\n\"It can be a lonely place. Ultimately you're the boss and you have to make the decisions.\"\n\nAfter serving as Louis van Gaal's assistant at United and then leaving the Premier League club in 2016, Giggs is now back coaching at the highest level.\n\nThis is a man who knows his weaknesses yet is determined to succeed.\n\n\"I spoke to a lot of managers in the time I was out of the game,\" said Giggs. \"I was in between Conte and Eddie at a charity dinner and I was constantly trying to talk to them.\n\n\"That was a nightmare actually as Eddie was trying to ask me questions about Sir Alex Ferguson and I wanted to get everything out of him! I have only known football since I left school and time away was good, but now it is the right time to go on my own.\"\n\nOn how he can get better as a manager, Giggs added: \"Just like a player you always want to improve and you look at the best.\n\n\"Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho are always looking to improve. Where do I? I am not a naturally out-going person. Everything just comes with that little bit of experience and reaching the next World Cup would an unbelievable achievement. Wales have not done it for over 60 years.\"\n\nWales will compete for the China Cup against Uruguay in Monday's final, with Bale set to go head-to-head with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani. Giggs has urged his best player to stay with Real Madrid and resist the overtures of his former side United.\n\nUnited manager Mourinho retains a strong interest in the 28-year-old, while Chelsea and Bale's former club Tottenham are also long-term admirers.\n\n\"It's Real Madrid. There are only a handful of clubs who have got that aura,\" Giggs said. \"Of course you would want to stay there. What's Gareth won, three Champions League titles? The proof is in that. When you are at clubs like Real, you are always going to win things.\n\n\"Gareth has the ability to score every type of goal and there are similarities with Cristiano Ronaldo. They both started out as wingers and they are now goal scorers.\"",

                "title": "Argentina 2 Italy 0: Late goals fail to make up for lack of stardust in Lionel Messi's absence",
                "body": "It was frustrating enough for the thousands who had come to the Etihad Stadium in anticipation of watching Lionel Messi in action to see the Argentina maestro stuck in a seat in the stands. That the largely turgid game that unfolded in his absence was crying out for a sprinkling of his stardust will only have deepened the acute disappointment felt by many inside the ground.\n\nArgentina did at least come alive in the closing stages with goals from Ever Banega, enjoying his return to the city only 10 days after the Sevilla midfielder helped dump Manchester United out of the Champions League, and West Ham's Manuel Lanzini but plenty had dozed off by then. England should not have too much to fear from Italy when the Azzurri visit Wembley on Tuesday.\n\nA smattering of boos greeted the final whistle and it hardly came as a surprise. There had twice been sustained chants of \"Messi, Messi, Messi\" during the second half, an airing more of frustration than any great expectation of the Barcelona forward vacating his seat next to Sergio Aguero in a box, de-robing and treating those present to the cameo they craved. Aguero, the local hero, was never going to play a part here, the Manchester City striker still recovering from a knee injury that should also keep him out of Tuesday's game against Spain, but Messi's absence was unexpected and most unwelcome.\n\nFootball may be a team game but the clamour to see arguably the greatest player in history in the flesh in these parts was understandably huge and, for once, he was readily accessible.\n\nGetting tickets for a Barcelona game, even if you could swallow the cost of a trip there, is easier said than done. Similarly, Champions League matches between Barcelona and the likes of City and United are not exactly frequent occurrences and, when they do come around, tickets are out of the reach of many.\n\nSo here was a rare chance for kids and parents in their thousands to come and watch Messi live and the promoters, OnSide, were not oblivious to that as they put the Barcelona maestro front stage and centre of their marketing campaign for the game.\n\nIt was the tantalising hook for many families to flock to the Etihad and fork out as much as £60 for an individual adult ticket and £30 for child in the Colin Bell stand on the day of the game.\n\nThe sense of anticipation will only have intensified when footage appeared of Messi beating half a dozen players in training at City's CFA base this week before scoring. No wonder so many felt short-changed then when news filtered through that Messi was not only not in the starting XI but not on the substitutes' bench either, despite his presence on the team sheet.\n\nNo one expects Messi to hawked around at the expense of his own well-being, least of all his paymasters, Barcelona. But having trained all week without any hint of an issue, it all felt a little lame to hear his absence being put down to \"muscle fatigue\" in the hours leading up to kick-off. It will feel more galling still if he ends up back training before Tuesday's game against Spain in Madrid.\n\nIt was not as if, in Messi's absence, the remaining cast members seemed desperate to put on a show. The Etihad was only half full and the game half-baked, and while no one should read much into such a friendly, it was not too hard to see why Argentina, despite their many attacking talents, made such heavy going of World Cup qualification and Italy failed to reach Russia altogether.\n\nA minute's silence was held before kick-off for Davide Astori, the former Fiorentina captain, who died earlier this month after suffering a heart attack. Italy's players wore shirts bearing the message \"Davide always with us\".\n\nGianluigi Buffon was called upon to make three good saves, notably from a thumping header from Nicolas Otamendi, the City and Argentina centre-half, and later from Gonzalo Higuain.\n\nIf anything encapsulated the low key mood and lack of edge here it was the sight of Argentina forward Angel Di Maria and Italy midfielder Marco Verratti - team-mates at Paris St-Germain - swapping shirts at half-time.\n\nA tepid first hour was summed up when Lorenzo Insigne shanked a glorious chance wide from close range from Ciro Immobile's pass although the pace slowly began to pick up thereafter and it was Argentina doing most of the running.\n\nThe first goal of the game eventually arrived 15 minutes from time when Banega exchanged a neat one-two with Diego Perotti after a lovely shuffle of the feet that bamboozled two Italy players before firing low into the corner.\n\nLanzini then claimed his first goal for Argentina when he rifled the ball into the top corner from Higuain's tee up. It was not enough to suppress the longing for Messi, though.\n\n\"I always feel like playing but there is still a long way to the World Cup,\" Messi said. \"I always want to play, but I come with discomfort.\"",

She has not yet been charged.\n\nZimbabwe is home to about 86,000 elephants, or the second largest population in Africa, according to a census published in 2016. That figure represented a 10 per cent drop in numbers since 2005.\n\nAlthough the population is considered healthy in the north-west of the country, losses have been heavy in other parts.\n\nAbout 900 elephants were lost to poachers between 2013 and 2016, nearly 250 of them poisoned with cyanide or shot.\n\nMrs Mugabe's name was linked to large-scale wildlife trafficking following a four-month investigation by Mr Steirn, who posed as a customer for contraband ivory in order to infiltrate the smuggling and poaching networks preying on the country's national parks.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Telegraph, Mr Steirn said he decided to launch the investigation after hearing rumours about Mrs Mugabe's complicity in trade during several years reporting on wildlife crime in Africa.\n\n\"For years I've been documenting the frontline poachers who end up serving 20 years for shooting a giraffe. Meanwhile, she was taking billions of dollars out of the country,\" he said.\n\n\"If they charge and arrest her, and she goes to jail for wildlife crimes, that will change the dynamic of the entire perception of wildlife trafficking across Africa,\" he said.\n\nUndercover footage filmed by Mr Steirn and seen by the Telegraph shows several sources, including suspected poachers and intelligence, wildlife and aviation officials, describing how Mrs Mugabe smuggled ivory poached in national parks or looted from government warehouses out of the country by exploiting an exemption from airport security screening as First Lady.\n\nThey include Fariken Madzinga, 48, a registered dealer of ivory who describes in the footage how he also runs a syndicate that handles both poached ivory and tusks stolen from the government's secure stockpiles of wildlife products on behalf of Mrs Mugabe.\n\nIn conversations with Mr Steirn recorded before his arrest, Mr Madzinga described how he relies on \"the president and first lady\" to get contraband tusks out of the country.\n\n\"In order for it to pass through customs, the goods of the First Lady were not searched. She had immunity from the government,\" he added. \"Even a cardboard box and is part of the first lady, there is nobody who is going to open this,\" he says.\n\nMr Madzinga and Tafadzwa Pamire, 36, were arrested in a police sting after trying to sell Mr Steirn tusks they said had been procured from poachers.\n\nThey were carrying six large tusks worth more than £16,000 as unprocessed ivory when they were apprehended while carrying out the sale on February 15, according to court documents.\n\nThey are due to appear in court on April 9 charged with illegal possession of raw tusks.\n\nMr Steirn, who will be the main state witness in the trial, said he has received death threats warning him not to testify.\n\nDocuments seen by the Telegraph suggest that an airport security loophole also extended to cargo shipments marked as assigned to the First Lady, allowing a much larger scale of traffic than would be possible in personal luggage.\n\nAn Airport Security Protocol (ASP), issued by the Mugabe government's Civil Aviation Authority, and printed on its letterhead, instructs the cargo department and all airport security not to scan or search any consignment connected to the first family or their entourage.\n\nWhile it is usual practice to exempt diplomats and heads of state, as well as immediate family members travelling with them, from searches, it is highly unusual to extend that waiver to unaccompanied cargo or beyond immediate family members.\n\nChristopher Mutsvangwa, a special adviser to Mr Mnangagwa, said the president was aware of the allegations and had sanctioned the investigation into high-profile figures including Mrs Mugabe based on the information revealed by Mr Steirn.\n\n\"We have commenced a full inquiry in addition to ongoing investigations into the recent seizure of a large quantity of ivory that was bound for an overseas destination,\" Mr Mutsvangwa, a former leader of Zimbabwe's powerful union of War Veterans and a long standing critic of Mrs Mugabe within the ruling Zanu PF party, told the Telegraph.\n\n\"The government of Zimbabwe will seek answers from all parties who have been implicated in this matter, including former First Lady Grace Mugabe and former Minister of Environment Saviour Kasukuwere,\" he said in an interview in Moscow, where he was an observer at last week's Russian presidential election.\n\nThe government of Zimbabwe will seek answers from all parties who have been implicated in this matterChristopher Mutsvangwa, special adviser to President Mnangagwa\n\nOppah Muchinguri, the minister of environment said in a statement: \"Earlier this month an investigative journalist brought to my attention allegations of corruption, fraud, mining in national parks, and illegal trafficking of ivory, horn, and other items being conducted by individuals associated with the former administration.\n\n\"The evidence was strong enough for me to raise it with President Mnangagwa. As a result the president took the step of dissolving the entire Zimparks board on 22 February,\" she added, referring to the agency responsible for managing the country's national parks.\n\nMr Mustvangwa said there is currently no suggestion that Mr Mugabe himself, who is now 94, is implicated in the smuggling ring.\n\nHowever, he added that there was mounting evidence that the gang included high-ranking members of Mr Mugabe's security apparatus and that the systemic smuggling also involved rhino horn, diamonds, and gold.\n\n\"Ivory is just one part of it,\" he said.\n\nIn his last five years in office, Mr Mugabe regularly travelled for medical treatment to Singapore using Air Zimbabwe's only long-haul aircraft, a Boeing 767. He was often accompanied by Mrs Mugabe.\n\nHe last visited the city state in December, a month after he left office. In the same day he flew out of Harare, on December 11, a consignment of 200kg of ivory destined for Kuala Lumpur was seized at Harare international airport.\n\nWhile Mrs Mugabe's alleged customers have not been named, Mr Mutswanga said the buyers are assumed to be organised criminal groups operating out of China and Malaysia.\n\nSuch gangs have been linked to multi-million dollar poaching operations across Africa and have a reputation for extreme violence.\n\nIn August last year Wayne Lotter, a South African conservationist investigating ivory smuggling networks, was shot dead in Tanzania. And last month Esmond Bradley Martin, an American environmentalist who was regarded as one of the world's leading experts on the illegal wildlife trade, was stabbed to death at his home in Nairobi.\n\nThe exposure of top Zimbabwean officials in the illegal wildlife trade will come as little surprise to conservationists, who say official corruption, including cooperating with major organised crime networks, has fuelled poaching across the continent.\n\n\"Corruption is key all along the supply chain,\" said Lucy Vigne, a leading researcher into the smuggling of illegal ivory and rhino horn from Africa.\n\n\"Officials may turn a blind eye for bribes or collude with the criminal traders in illegal wildlife trade activities themselves.\"\n\nInvestigators and campaigners with knowledge of anti-poaching operations said Mrs Mugabe's name began to crop up in an international effort to expose the powerful African political figures involved in ivory and rhino horn trafficking several months ago.\n\n\"There has been a concerted international effort to bring down the high-level trafficking networks of which Grace is an example,\" said Frank Pope, chief executive officer of Save The Elephants, a leading conservation charity.\n\n\"She is not alone in being a senior figure involved in ivory trafficking, not alone in this current crisis and not alone in the historical perspective of the ivory trade. There have been other senior figures who've lined their pockets substantially from the ivory trade.\"\n\nShe is not alone in being a senior figure in this kind of stuff, not alone in this current crisis and not alone in the historical perspective of the ivory tradeFrank Pope, chief executive officer of Save The Elephants\n\nMrs Mugabe did not respond to multiple requests to comment.\n\nFather Fidelis Mukonori, who is close to the Mugabe family and was a mediator during the coup last November, said he discussed the allegations with Mrs Mugabe and she said she was \"unconcerned. She said it doesn't matter.\"\n\nMrs Mugabe, 52, grew notorious for her profligate spending during her nearly 20 years as First Lady of Zimbabwe, despite having no obvious commensurate source of income.\n\nA Telegraph investigation last year found that she spent an estimated £10 million on a clutch of luxury properties in Zimbabwe and South Africa between 2014 and 2017. She has not explained how she funded the purchases.\n\nMr Mugabe's salary as president was about $20,000 a month. He and Mrs Mugabe still live at the Blue Roof, the palatial Harare residence they built while he was president.",

That should be their lot.Tam Fry, the National Obesity Forum\n\nThey come a fortnight ahead of the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy - dubbed the \"sugar tax\" - which imposes a tax on sodas, such as some Coca-Cola and Pepsi products, containing more than five grams of sugar per 100ml.\n\nFruit juices and milkshakes, however, are exempt.\n\nUnder the updated Nutrient Profiling Model, products which receive a negative score are banned from advertising during programming believed to attract an audience comprising 25 per cent or more children.\n\nThis includes advertisements on all broadcast media, print, social media and in cinemas.\n\nWhile specific product placement is not necessarily is banned within children's programmes themselves, the depiction of high fat, sugar or salt (HFSS) food or drink is not necessarily banned but must be \"editorially justified\", according to Ofcom.\n\nTam Fry, Chair of the National Obesity Forum, which campaigns for better regulation of unhealthy products, said: \"The fact that excessive fruit ads may be banned is good news.\n\n\"It demonstrates that PHE is starting to get real about the damage that too much juice can do to our children.\n\n\"150ml of juice, diluted and consumed with a meal, is acceptable and is recommended to parents in its healthy eating guidance.\n\n\"That should be their lot, so who needs ads?\"\n\nThe British Soft Drinks Association said the proposed changes to the framework would send \"mixed messages\" because fruit juice is still included as one of the Government-recommended five a day.\n\nLast October official data revealed the highest ever proportion of children in England leaving primary school obese - one in five.\n\nMeanwhile too much sugar in the diet is thought to be behind the increasing total of youngsters needing teeth removed in hospital, which is around 170 a day.\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, Chief Nutritionist at PHE, said the updated Nutrient Profiling Model, which was last altered in 2005, would reflect recent the \"most up-to-date dietary recommendations\".\n\nHowever, Gavin Partington, Director General of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: \"Given that PHE continue to recommend 150ml of fruit juice as one of the 5-a-day, we are disappointed at today's suggestion by government that fruit juice be put in the same category as other products high in fat, salt or sugar.\n\n\"The mixed-messages from government will be of no help to a population that is already falling short on 5-a-day consumption, and will place further restrictions on manufacturers when promoting PHE's 150ml guidance for fruit juice.\"",

Instead, between April and September 2016, Hope spent £75,000 pounds while on release, buying 42 bottles of prosecco from a supermarket, tickets to see the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a boxing match, and four tickets to watch pop star Rihanna in concert, the prosecution statement said.\n\nThe singer also featured in Hope's original case, after he bought a bottle of champagne for her table.\n\nHope pleaded guilty earlier this month to perverting the course of justice for trying to hide funds from regulators and investors he cheated instead of handing the money back as required by earlier rulings.\n\nOn Friday, Judge Deborah Taylor sentenced him, saying he would likely serve half of the term. Hope, dressed in a plain, grey sweater, didn't react to the sentence.\n\n\"Hope repeatedly misled the courts and the FCA, concealing monies that should have been used to compensate the victims of his crimes,\" Mark Steward, the Financial Conduct Authority's executive director of enforcement & market oversight, said in a statement.\n\n\"He has shown contempt not only to the court, but also those he has harmed.\"\n\nBefore his arrest in early 2012 at the age of 23, Hope lied about being a city trader and his experience in spread betting and foreign exchange trading, while taking funds from more than 100 investors.\n\nOperating from London's financial district in Canary Wharf, he splurged about £2 million of their money in just over a year, including £950,000 at casinos and £512,000 at clubs and bars, the FCA said at his 2014 trial.\n\nHe was found guilty of one count of fraud and jailed in January 2015.\n\nHe had nearly 20 months added to his seven-year sentence in 2016, after handing over just 1,000 pounds of the money he was ordered to repay.",

                "title": "Scotland 0 Costa Rica 1: Alex McLeish begins second reign with drab defeat",
                "body": "The dawn of Alex McLeish's second spell in charge of Scotland was a grey affair as Costa Rica reprised the scoreline that shocked the Tartan Army at the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990.\n\nThis time the blow was struck by Marcos Urena when the Los Angeles striker was allowed a free chance early in the match and, despite some encouraging football by the Scots, there was no joy for the home fans in a crowd of 20,488.\n\nMcLeish signalled a changing of the guard with his squad selection and confirmed his desire to assess new recruits with the opening line-up of his second spell in charge.\n\nScott McTominay was an expected starter, having turned declined an invitation from Gareth Southgate to sign up for England and, apart from the Manchester United midfielder, debuts were afforded to Aberdeen's Scott McKenna, Fulham's Kevin McDonald and Oliver McBurnie of Barnsley.\n\nMcLeish had indicated beforehand that he favoured a back three and would have played Kieran Tierney on the left. The Celtic's player's withdrawal through injury create the opportunity for McKenna, with Liverpool's Andrew Robertson in the left wing-back position and Callum Paterson of Cardiff City on the other flank.\n\nMcLeish and his Costa Rican counterpart, Oscar Ramirez, played against each other in the only other meeting of these sides and Ramirez emphasised the significance of that occasion when he said, in the build-up to this encounter, that \"winning that game was a surprise and an important kick-off point for our nation.\"\n\nSuch has been the teams' comparative fortunes since then that it was McLeish who hoped that this fixture would kick off a resurgence in Scotland's reputation. It took all of quarter of an hour for the ghost of 1990 to haunt Hampden.\n\nBryan Oviedo left Tom Cairney behind to outflank the Scottish rear guard on the Costa Rican left and his angled cutback found Urena on an unchecked tracking run into the penalty area to finish with a precise low drive beyond Allan McGregor.\n\nJose Mourinho, sitting between former Scotland manager, Craig Brown, and the SFA's director of development, Malky Mackay, looked unimpressed and his disapproval might have extended to McTominay, who could have been more alert to Urena's movement ahead of the goal. The Scots, though, almost equalised within a minute of falling behind, when Matt Ritchie's corner kick was met by Grant Hanley with a downward header which bounced just wide of the post.\n\nScotland stabilised and began to quarry a greater share of possession, much of which was channelled through Robertson, whose forays down the left flank produced tempting deliveries, one of which prompted McBurnie into a shot which Keylor Navas blocked but could not hold. The Real Madrid goalkeeper was duly relieved to see the ball booted clear of the danger area.\n\nDavid Guzman, meanwhile, had been booked for tripping McBurnie when McTominay set his colleague off towards Navas but, by the interval, Costa Rica had not had to exert themselves unduly to maintain their advantage.\n\nThe Scots came within a fraction of falling further behind just after the restart when Robertson unaccountably allowed Bryan Ruiz to get goal side of him for a tightly angled rising drive which clipped McGregor's crossbar on its way over. McTominay's appearance came to an end shortly before the hour mark when he and Cairney made way for the Celtic midfield pair of Stuart Armstrong and Callum McGregor.\n\nArmstrong had scarcely drawn breath when Matt Ritchie put him through one-on-one with Navas for an effort which was pushed over the crossbar by the keeper. Scotland came even closer to hauling themselves level when Robertson's energy once more resulted in a beckoning pass across the goalmouth which would have brought the equaliser had the straining McBurnie made any form of contact.\n\nThe striker departed soon afterwards to be replaced by Matt Phillips. Robertson, meanwhile, continued to work the left wing promisingly but, although his next cutback was met by Matt Ritchie, the ball spun tamely into Navas's grasp.\n\nRitchie had no more opportunity to change the destiny of the contest because he was the last player to head for the showers in order to give Jamie Murphy a brief run out as the clock ran down on a modestly encouraging win for Los Ticos.",

                "body": "Stock markets dived again on Friday as Donald Trump faced a barrage of criticism for launching a $60bn (£42bn) package of tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a global trade war.\n\nIn a day of condemnations, EU leaders meeting in Brussels accused Mr Trump of \"putting a gun\" to Europe's head, while the director general of the WTO in Geneva warned that the US ­administration's move had \"jeopardised\" a still-fragile global recovery.\n\nOn Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones index ended down 1.8pc at 23,533.2, which puts it back in correction territory some 11pc below the record high it reached in January.\n\nThe dollar fell towards a one-month low against major currencies while the Vix volatility index, known as the \"fear gauge\", jumped above 25, its highest since the market turmoil at the start of the year.\n\nAnalysts said fears of a trade war and geopolitical instability had sent investors scrambling for safe havens such as gold, which hit a one month high, and the Japanese yen, which is likely to benefit from a dispute.\n\nMarkets were apparently further ­unnerved by Mr Trump's decision to appoint John Bolton, the Republican foreign policy hawk, as his new ­national security adviser. Mr Bolton has recently called for pre-emptive strikes on North Korea, and US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn Europe, the news that Mr Trump had granted the EU a 40-day exemption on 25pc steel and 10pc aluminium tariffs that came into force last night appeared to have done little to diffuse simmering trade tensions.\n\nAustrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the EU did not want a trade war but would respond \"firmly\" if the president took \"the wrong decision\".\n\nCharles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, said that Washington was holding the threat of imposing tariffs over the EU in order to extract concessions.\n\n\"I have the impression that the US leader wants to negotiate with the ­European Union by putting a gun to our head,\" Mr Michel said as he arrived at the EU summit. \"That's a strange way to negotiate with an ally.\"\n\nIn the formal conclusions to the EU leaders' summit, the 28 leaders expressed \"regret\" about the US decision and repeated warnings that it will take counter-measures.\n\n\"Sector-wide protection in the U.S. is an inappropriate remedy for the real problems of overcapacity,\" the summit conclusions added.\n\nOfficials said that a list including Kentucky bourbon and Harley Davidson motorcycles - designed to hit key Trump marginal in the 2018 mid-term elections - has already been drawn up.\n\nCecilia Malmstrom, the EU trade commissioner, rejected the Trump administration's 40-day deadline, warning that the EU and US needed to work together to tackle over-capacity and unfair subsidies in the global economy.\n\n\"These discussions between allies and partners should not be subject to artificial deadlines,\" she said.\n\nIn Geneva the US faced a barrage of criticism at a meeting of the Word Trade Organisation called by Russia and China, which has announced provisional retaliatory measures.\n\nThe Chinese representatives said the tariffs were \"groundless\" and violated WTO rules. The US representative disagreed, sources told the Reuters news agency.\n\nLater, Roberto Azevedo, the WTO director-general, warned in a statement that an escalation of tit-for-tat sanctions \"could quickly lead to a less stable trading system\" and urged calm.\n\n\"Disrupting trade flows will jeopardise the global economy at a time when economic recovery, though fragile, has been increasingly evident around the world. I again call for restraint and urgent dialogue as the best path forward to resolve these problems.\"\n\nIn the formal conclusions to the EU gathering, the 28 leaders expressed \"regret\" about the US decision and repeated warnings that the bloc would take countermeasures.\n\n\"Sector-wide protection in the US is an inappropriate remedy for the real problems of overcapacity,\" the summit conclusions added.",

                "body": "House of Fraser's lenders have appointed an adviser to double-check the retailer's financials, as they seek to ward off yet another high street collapse.\n\nThe news of the appointment, first reported by Sky News, comes just over a month after the UK retailer, owned by China's Sanpower, bought in Rothschild to advise it on refinancing its £390m debt package.\n\nPrior to this, in January it agreed to sell the intellectual property rights to the fashion brands it culled last year to China's Guangzhou Sunrise Trading and last year received a £15m cash injection from Sanpower.\n\nIt is thought that the lenders have brought in EY to double-check all these investments amid mounting concern over the health of the retail sector, and House of Fraser itself.\n\nEarlier this year, reports emerged that House of Fraser had sought rent reductions at a number of its sites and, in December its credit rating was downgraded to Caa1 from B3 by Moody's, which cited the retailer's poor trading in the first three quarters of 2017.\n\nIts woes continued over the festive trading period, with sales slipping 4pc over the six weeks to Dec 23, due in a large part to weaker online sales, as House of Fraser attempted to protect profit margins by cutting down on online discounts.\n\nHowever, House of Fraser was not alone in posting a disappointing trading figures for the Christmas period, and that struggle to draw shoppers to the high street has triggered a string of collapses, including Maplin and Toys R Us.\n\nNext earlier todaytabled plans to seek rent reductions and shorter-term leases from landlords, and both New Look and Carpetright this week have signalled they could shutter stores.\n\nFurther details over House of Fraser's financial situation are likely to emerge at its bondholder meeting next month.\n\nThe meeting could also provide some clarity over the retailer's ownership, with confusion having arisen earlier this month when Chinese tourism group Wuji Wenhua announced it was buying a majority stake in House of Fraser from Sanpower.\n\nThe retailer's chief financial officer, though, later said no transaction had happened yet and that there were loopholes in the \"change of control\" clause.\n\nHouse of Fraser declined to comment, and its lenders and EY could not be reached for comment.",

                "title": "Rory McIlroy focused on bouncing back at Masters following early exit at WGC",
                "body": "Rory McIlroy's final event before the Masters came to a disappointing conclusion here at the WGC Dell Match Play on Friday, but by the look and sound of him the Ulsterman will simply be relieved to have the weekend off.\n\nThis was the sixth tournament McIlroy had played in the last seven weeks and after his heroics at last week's Arnold Palmer Invitational - his first win in 18 months - was very probably one competitive outing too many. Certainly, he appeared stale and weary in his 5&3 defeat to Brian Harman, which confirmed the 2015 champion's exit in the group stages.\n\n\"It was tiring and obviously going from winning on Sunday to traveling on Monday, and getting an early practice round on Tuesday to playing in the first match on Wednesday, I didn't have a lot of time to sort of recharge the batteries,\" he said. \"I wish I was hanging around for the weekend, but at least I'll get the chance rest up and get a little bit of work in before going to Augusta.\"\n\nMcIlroy will play practice rounds at Augusta on Wednesday and Thursday before returning home to Florida. He will then pitch up on the Monday to finish off his preparations for the season's first major, in which he will attempt to become just the sixth player in history to complete the career grand slam.\n\nAlongside him will be his bagman Harry Diamond, who has yet to caddie at Augusta, so will have his own crash course on one of the golf's most subtle layouts. McIlroy is clearly confident. \"I feel like my game is in good shape,\" he said. \"I got off to a bit of a scrappy start today. I was two-under on the back nine and trying to press, but Brian just played really, really well.\"\n\nIndeed, Harman has been inspired in his first matchplay event since he was an amateur at the Walker Cup nine years ago. The diminutive left-hander is one of the shortest-hitters on the circuit but what he lacks in brawn he makes up for in finesse, particularly on and around the greens, and, at seventh in the standings, he could be an extremely useful addition to Jim Furyk's US Ryder Cup team in Paris in September.\n\n\"Rory did not play his best golf today and I played extremely well, Harman, the world No 22, said. \"I'm proud of the way I came out. Rory is an intimidating guy, especially after what he did last week. I had this circled this week and I'm glad I played so well..\"\n\nHarman will face Bubba Watson in Saturday morning's round of 16 in the knockout stages and will again have to give up plenty of yards. But he believes he has already conquered the biggest hitter in the sport. \"Rory hits it a mile,\" Harman said. \"He is a freak, an absolute freak. No one hits it as far as that guy when he wants it, no-one that can carry it like Rory can carry it.\"\n\nPhil Mickelson joined the exodus of the big names - with world No 1 Dustin Johnson and world No 3 Jon Rahm having their fates sealed on Thursday - despite beating the Spaniard Rafael Cabrera Bello on the 18th. Charles Howell III ensured that Mickelson - who at 47 returned to winning ways at last month's WGC Mexico - was elimnated by winning his third match as he accounted for Japan's Satoshi Kodaira 2&1.\n\nMickelson will also visit Augusta this week as he plots to gain a fourth Green Jacket, but he will also play at the Houston Open \"I'm looking forward to getting to Houston,\" he said. \"I'm going to go up and see Augusta before and spend a couple of days, as well. I'm excited for this two-week stretch.\n\n\"I would have liked to move on here but It feels good to come back and win these last two matches, even though I'm not advancing. It goes back to the first day [when he lost to Howell]. You need to be ready to play from the get go.\"\n\nJustin Thomas and reigning Masters champion Sergio Garcia also went through with 100 percent records. Thomas will replace Johnson as world No 1 if he wins this title.",

Mr Bolton backs punitive sanctions on Russia and believes the Iraq War was justified, unlike Mr Trump.\n\nHis appointment split Washington as Democrats painted Mr Bolton as a warmonger and Republicans pointed to his years of foreign policy experience.\n\nChristopher Murphy, the Democrat senator for Connecticut, said: \"The person who will be first in first out of the Oval Office on national security matters passionately believes the U.S. should launch pre-emptive war against both Iran and North Korea with no authorization from Congress. My God.\"\n\nBut Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said: \"Selecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America's allies and bad news for America's enemies.\"\n\nMr Trump's decision to oust HR McMaster came after weeks of growing tensions and amid reports the pair had a troubled personal relationship as well as policy differences.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the president found Mr McMaster's delivery style in briefings grating and would tell him he understood an issue just \"to make him stop talking\".\n\nMr Trump initially considered Mr Bolton for a role in his administration before inauguration but was convinced otherwise - partly, it is said, because of Mr Bolton's handlebar mustache.\n\nHowever over recent weeks Mr Trump's frustration with his national security team and Mr Bolton's Fox News regular appearances eventually saw a change of heart.\n\nStories from Mr Bolton's past under Mr Bush have re-emerged as fierce debate broke out about the impact he would have on foreign policy direction.\n\nMr Bolton's appointment to UN ambassador in 2005 was rejected by the Senate - one ex-official dubbed him a \"kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\" - but pushed through by Mr Bush.\n\nHowever the pair later fell out, with Mr Bush dismissing Mr Bolton as not \"credible\" after the latter attacked the then-president's \"total intellectual collapse\" in 2008.\n\nMr Bolton's stint at the UN, which lasted a little more than a year, saw repeated clashes with foreign diplomats and a reluctance to give ground in negotiations.\n\nI am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nHe once said of the UN's 38-floor headquarters in New York: \"If it lost 10 stories it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\n\nMr Bolton, who studied law at Yale University, also offered a hint of his outlook in his memoir's title: \"Surrender Is Not an Option\".\n\nThe Republican hardliner also has links to senior Conservatives in Britain. He has visited the party's annual conference and knows Liam Fox, the International Development Secretary.\n\nLuke Coffey, the foreign policy director for the right-leaning think tank Heritage, told The Daily Telegraph the appointment could benefit the UK.\n\n\"I think it will be very positive for Britain, especially at this time of Brexit,\" said Mr Coffey, who was once an adviser to Mr Fox.\n\n\"Mr Bolton has expressed his concerns about the European Union. He is very Eurosceptic and a supporter of Brexit.\"\n\nMr Bolton's recent comments on policy, not least North Korea and Iran, have at times been even more hardline than Mr Trump's views.\n\nEarlier this year he said \"our goal should be regime change in Iran\" and wrote a piece outlining how a pre-emptive strike on North Korea would be \"perfectly legitimate\".\n\nSpeaking after his appointment, Mr Bolton told Sky News: \"Despite the view of many people at the end of the Cold War that we'd come to the end of history, unfortunately we haven't.\n\n\"It's important for the US to protect its civilian population, protect its alliances [and] protect its economy.\" He went one: \"There will be a lot of work to do.\" Few commentators or congressmen would doubt that.",

                "body": "Spain's Supreme Court on Friday opened rebellion prosecutions against 13 Catalan independence leaders, jailing the proposed successor to deposed president Carles Puigdemont hours ahead of his planned inauguration.\n\nJudge Pablo Llarena charged Mr Puigdemont and other separatist politicians with crimes that could see them sent to prison for up to 30 years over their role in October's banned referendum and declaration of independence.\n\nJordi Turull, the latest presidential candidate, was last night ordered into preventative prison along with four others, a move that will frustrate secessionists' efforts to have him inaugurated in a session scheduled for Saturday morning.\n\nMr Turull is pro-independence parties' \"Plan C\" to form an autonomous government and lift direct rule, after previous presidential candidates including Mr Puigdemont were blocked by the courts.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Turull lost a first round of voting after the abstention of hard line secessionist party the CUP, forcing today's second round at which he must be present.\n\nThe judge ruled that the five - who had previously been bailed while under investigation - posed a high risk of reoffending or fleeing the country.\n\nOpening the prosecutions, Mr Llarena accused the politicians of adopting a \"criminal design\" to procure an independent Catalan Republic, a drive which he judged they had not relinquished.\n\nAs well as former government members, rebellion charges were also brought against the two jailed protest leaders, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, the former parliamentary speaker Carmen Forcadell, and the secretary-general of the pro-independence party ERC, Marta Rovira.\n\nTwelve other secessionist politicians will be tried for lesser crimes of disobedience and misappropriation of public funds.\n\nMs Rovira refused to appear at Friday's hearing, instead becoming the seventh Catalan separatist to flee the country.\n\nIn a letter to Catalan media, she said she had chosen \"the path of exile\" as the only way to \"recover (her) political voice\" in the face of a government that \"is willing to violate the rule of law and civil liberties to achieve its political ends\".\n\nMs Rovira, who made no mention of her whereabouts, said fleeing was also the only way to continue being a mother to her daughter, Inés.\n\nMr Puigdemont, who left for Belgium along with four cabinet members in late October, said on a visit to Helsinki that he gave his \"total support\" to Ms Rovira, of whose plans he insisted he had had no knowledge.\n\nShe \"has a right to defend herself in a setting where rights are respected,\" he added.\n\nThe Spanish attorney general asked the Supreme Court to issue an international arrest warrant for Ms Rovira, as well as for the six other separatist leaders in exile in Belgium, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nCarlos Carrizosa, the Catalan parliamentary spokesman for the unionist party Ciudadanos, said that with the failure to approve Mr Turull as president on Thursday, it was clear the independence process was \"finished\". Ms Rovira's flight, he added, showed it was now \"every man for himself\".\n\nPro-independence groups called for demonstrations in front of town halls across Catalonia from 7pm UK time on Friday evening.",

                "body": "Joseph Parker accused heavyweight rival Anthony Joshua of lacking respect over his refusal to speak to media from New Zealand and Samoa this week and believes his rival and the ­British public are underestimating his chances when the two heavyweight champions meet Cardiff a week on Saturday.\n\n\"The public are underestimating myself and my team,\" said the unbeaten 26-year-old World Boxing Organisation heavyweight champion at his first public appearance since arriving in London a week ago. \"They're judging us on our past two or three fights, and I think they see Joshua as unbeatable.\n\n\"Everyone thinks it's going to be an easy win for him. That's motivation for us. We've had a great camp, done everything right. I just want to get in there and bash him.\"\n\nParker, dressed in a stylish flat cap and mustard gabardine coat, disclosing that he wanted \"to look the part\" and was a fan of the ­television series Peaky Blinders, also reacted to Joshua's assessment of him this week as a \"weird ­character\" who, along with his team, was \"two-faced\".\n\nParker commented: \"Great. He's stepped out of his comfort zone and said something interesting. He's been boring lately.\"\n\nParker, who aims to take Joshua's World Boxing Association and ­International Boxing Federation ­titles, also poured scorn on the ­Briton's treatment of his compatriots. \"It's disrespectful because they've travelled a long way to come and see him, and they respect him, as a fighter and what he's achieved. We were in camp in Vegas, we had a lot of British media come over and we were very friendly.\"\n\nChanging into his gym clothes to then conduct a workout in former heavyweight champion David Haye's gym in South London, and looking fast and lithe, Parker ­explained: \"We've been training with no injuries; this is the best camp we've had for a long time, and that's why we're so confident of putting on a great display and a great fight. I feel like I'm in the best shape I've been in.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the showdown ­between Londoner Dillian Whyte and unbeaten Australian Lucas Browne for the World Boxing Council Silver heavyweight crown takes place at The O2 in London ­on Saturday night, with the winner set to emerge as a potential opponent for World Boxing Council champion Deontay Wilder and, moreover, a stand-by opponent for Joshua this year if the two-belt world title holder comes through his ­unification contest with Parker.\n\nWhyte is hunting a showdown with Wilder, but heavy-handed Browne, unbeaten in 25 fights with 22 knockouts, plans to hijack the Croydon man's plans and move into the world title mix once again having held the \"regular\" WBA belt.\n\n\"This is a great fight and the ­biggest and most important in the division outside of the world ­heavyweight championships,\" said Matchroom Sport boxing promoter Eddie Hearn.\n\n\"Dillian has been working his way up the rankings and now sits pretty at WBC No 1 challenger. It's going to be an explosive, violent match-up with plenty of bad blood between the two.\"\n\nWhyte said: \"I'm in the best shape I have ever been in and I will show my improvements in this fight. If he wants to box, I'll box him. If he wants an all-out fight, I'll fight him, but I will do what it takes to get the all-important win.\"\n\nRicky Hatton, the former two-weight world champion who ­manages Browne, added: \"I think this is a genuine 50-50 fight. Lucas is a very dangerous puncher and Whyte has been very active. It promises to be a great fight, there is so much on the line.\"\n\nExpect Whyte to start cagily, be on his toes, and be wary of Browne's dangerous power early, especially his booming straight right hand, only to be drawn into a dog fight by the middle rounds. Browne has the power to finish this bout, but Whyte has shown improvements with every outing, and nine years younger at 29, is the marginal favourite to secure a points victory.\n\nDillian Whyte versus Lucas Browne is live on Sky Sports on Saturday night",

Officials speculated that he had keep his radical leanings very quiet or that he had suddenly become radicalised recently, perhaps via social media, as has been the case for several young men who have carried out attacks in France or attempted to do so.\n\nMr Collomb has previously said dozens of attacks have been thwarted by police as the government stepped up anti-terror measures.\n\nHe said on Friday that Lakdim had \"suddenly decided to act\" for unknown reasons. Since the January 2015 massacre at the office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris by two men claiming allegiance to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, more than 240 people have been killed in jihadist attacks in France.\n\nA few days after the Charlie Hebdo attack, another man stormed a Jewish supermarket in Paris, taking hostages and killing four people before being killed by police.\n\nAll three men had a history of extremism and were known to French intelligence.\n\nAbdelhamid Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam, who killed 130 in Paris in November 2015, had both previously served time in prison for robbery.",

                "body": "Mehmet Topal's sweetly-struck volley condemned a new-look Republic of Ireland to friendly defeat in Turkey as Martin O'Neill's new boys were given a lesson in international football.\n\nO'Neill handed senior debuts to Declan Rice, Scott Hogan and substitute Matt Doherty and first starts to Alan Browne and Sean Maguire in Antalya, but it was Fenerbahce midfielder Topal who ultimately won the day with a 52nd-minute strike to clinch a 1-0 win.\n\nWith the Republic trialling a 3-5-2 system, they were largely overrun in central midfield to leave Hogan, Maguire and later Shane Long starved of meaningful possession.\n\nHowever, there were positives with Rice turning in an assured performance on the left side of the defensive trio and later in midfield, and skipper Seamus Coleman getting 62 minutes under his belt a day short of a year since he suffered a horrific double leg fracture on international duty.\n\nThe Irish squad will reassemble in May for friendlies against France and the United States, and it remains to be seen which of O'Neill's understudies have done enough to warrant another call-up once his rested and injured senior players return.\n\nColeman and James McClean were asked to operate as wing-backs, but found themselves defending rather than attacking in the early stages as full-backs Hasan Ali Kaldirim and Gokhan Gonul pinned them inside their own half and Hakan Calhanoglu and Yusuf Yazici dictated the tempo behind lone striker Cenk Tosun.\n\nCalhanoglu and skipper Topal both sent long-range efforts high and wide as keeper Colin Doyle, winning his second Ireland cap 10 years and 304 days after his first, was largely untroubled despite the pressure.\n\nIndeed, the visitors might have taken an 18th-minute lead when Hogan ran on to Jeff Hendrick's pass and rounded keeper Volkan Babacan, only to fire into the side-netting as the angle narrowed prohibitively.\n\nThe home side's response was concerted and Doyle had to get down to parry Tosun's well-struck 28th-minute shot, although he could only look on in hope seconds later when central defender Shane Duffy got his head to Gonul's driven cross and almost diverted it into his own net.\n\nHowever, despite the Turks enjoying the better of the game, half-time arrived with the deadlock unbroken.\n\nThey needed just seven minutes of the second half to force their way in front when Calhanoglu and Yazici worked a short corner and the latter crossed for Topal to volley home expertly from close range.\n\nMaguire and McClean started to come to the fore as the Republic finally made their presence felt, although Doyle needed two attempts to claim Calhanoglu's skidding 67th-minute effort with Turkey still in the driving seat.\n\nO'Neill shuffled his pack as the game passed the hour-mark, in the process handing McClean a more accustomed midfield role, and he almost made an impact with 15 minutes remaining when he broke free down the left and fired in a dangerous cross which was thumped away by Okay Yokuslu.\n\nSubstitute Daryl Horgan curled an 85th-minute effort well wide with Ireland finishing on the front foot, but it was a case of too little, too late.",

Maybe there were a lot of doubts over us, coming here with an inexperienced squad, people might have thought that we would struggle against a strong Australian team.\n\n\"It's good to put that marker out there, but that's the nature of T20 cricket.

                "body": "The head of Comic Relief admits charities may lose money as a result of its move to stop celebrities fronting fundraising campaigns, amid concerns about white saviour stereotypes.\n\nLiz Warner, a former TV commissioning editor and executive who received awards for her commitment to diversity in the industry, said the change was in response to criticism over its fundraising videos.\n\nLast year one video starring singer Ed Sheeran was described as \"literally poverty tourism\" and was named \"most offensive\" campaign by an organisation which highlights cliched and stereotypical charity campaigns.\n\nLabour MP David Lammy also criticised Red Nose Day for being \"tired and patronising to Africans\".\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Ms Warner admitted that the new strategy was a risk as celebrity-fronted campaigns were a tried-and-tested way of raising funds.\n\nFormer charities minister Rob Wilson called the change \"very disappointing\".\n\nCelebrities very much help to reach audiences that normally wouldn't be reached. They can be very effective in that they have a huge amount of people who follow them on social media.\n\n\"Whilst I am no fan of the celebrity culture that has developed, I do recognise the impact they can have in helping to connect with the public in the UK - whatever their colour.\n\n\"Lenny Henry has done an outstanding job over many years fronting Comic Relief in the UK.\n\n\"Of course our biggest celebrities are the Royals and Prince Harry in particular has done an enormous amount to help charities operating in Africa,\" he said.\n\n\"Is Comic Relief really saying white people have nothing to say or contribute in providing a focus on these very real issues?\"\n\nAnother charity, the Disasters Emergency Committee, said it was considering changing its approach in its own videos after it was also criticised.\n\nTwo of its videos, which involved actors Tom Hardy and Eddie Redmayne appealing for donations to help with the Yemen crisis and East Africa famine appeal, were also nominated for the award, known as the \"Rusty Radiator\", last year.\n\nNicola Peckett, its communications director, told the Daily Telegraph: \"We did take the feedback from the Rusty Radiator nominations very seriously and we are talking to our broadcast partners about how we could do things differently in the future.\"\n\nShe said the organisation's videos were made on a very short timeframe of 72 hours by news teams at the BBC and ITN, and it made efforts to choose celebrities who were connected in some way to the subject matter of the appeal.\n\nExperts said celebrities were traditionally used by charities to reach out to lay audiences about emotive issues.\n\nJohn Baguley, chair of the international fundraising consultancy, which advises charities on how best to fundraise, said using \"the right kind of celebrities\" could raise more money than using \"the most popular celebrities available\".\n\n\"You can very often see the celebrities coming face-to-face with problems that they hadn't experienced before and the visceral impact of the kind of suffering that development charities deal with around the world has a very marked effect on those celebrities and one can feel, 'yes that is the way I would react'\".\n\nHe added: \"Celebrities very much help to reach audiences that normally wouldn't be reached. They can be very effective in that they have a huge amount of people who follow them on social media.\n\n\"They don't all have to be white celebrities, they can be celebrities of any sort.\"\n\nHe said the move would be positively received by a \"sophisticated, educated audience, that might look a bit askance at anything that smacks of imperialism\".\n\nA Charity Commission spokesman said that it could not comment on the plans by Comic Relief saying that \"it's not a regulatory matter.\"\n\nA source at the regulator added: \"It's up to charity trustees to make decisions about how best to run their charity which includes decisions on fundraising\".",

Mr Trump, who was elected to cut wasteful spending, said he was \"very unhappy\" with the bill and would never sign another one like it.\n\nThe bill, which the most fiscally conservative Republicans in Congress called \"grotesque,\" included only $1.6 billion towards the cost of Mr Trump's border wall.\n\nAt the White House Mr Trump, clearly irritated, said: \"As a matter of national security I've signed this bill. There's a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this bill, a lot of things we should have had in it, a lot of things that should not have been in it, but we were forced to if we want our military.\n\n\"I said to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's the second largest ever, President Obama had one larger, I'm sure he wasn't very happy about it.\n\n\"I looked very seriously at the veto but because of the incredible gains we've been able to make for the military, that over road it. My highest duty is to keep America safe.\"\n\nMr Trump alarmed many in Washington early on Friday by tweeting he was \"considering a VETO\" of the bill.\n\nHis decision to sign it brought to an end months of intense negotiations\n\nThe centerpiece of the bill was a big increase in US defence spending to $700 billion, up $61 billion, and a 10 per cent rise in domestic spending, which will go up to $591 billion.\n\nThe bill provided $1.6 billion for border security and construction or repair of nearly 100 miles of border fencing, but that was far less than Trump had been seeking.\n\nIt leaves intact funding for women's health provider Planned Parenthood, a target of relentless criticism from pro-life Republicans.\n\nBut in a major blow to Democrats it set aside the issue of the so-called \"Dreamers\" - hundreds of thousands of people who came to the US illegally as children - who are in legal limbo.\n\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus, which voted against the spending bill in the Congress, said they would have supported a presidential veto.\n\nBob Corker, a Republican senator, said: \"The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible.\"",

                "title": "Liam Broady shows flaw in LTA plans by revealing he will not play new hard-court Challengers",
                "body": "Liam Broady, the British No 4, highlighted a potential flaw in the Lawn Tennis Association's latest plans on Friday, when he revealed that he won't be playing the new hard-court Challengers because of a scheduling clash.\n\nHaving reached the second round of an ATP Masters event for the first time at the Miami Open, Broady's ranking will climb somewhere close to the 150-mark - a career high - despite his 6-3, 6-2 defeat at the hands of world No 27 Filip Krajinovic.\n\nHe is thus exactly the sort of person the LTA would have been thinking of when they announced the two new events - which will be held in Glasgow from April 28 and in Loughborough from May 19.\n\nBut Broady told reporters on Friday: \"I'm not going to play the British Challengers. I'd love to but the timing is tough because I will be doing six or seven weeks on the clay before the French Open.\n\n\"A lot of the players have wanted more Challengers for years,\" Broady added. \"I don't know what the reasoning is, I've never really asked. The timing's a shame but there are younger guys who will get the chance, and then I'll come back for the grass-court Challengers [which are held in Surbiton, Nottingham and Ilkley in June].\"\n\nWhen the announcement of these events was made a fortnight ago, Andy Murray was listed as one possible entrant, depending on how smoothly he makes the transition from the gym to the court after January's hip surgery. But the players that form the bulk of a Challenger field are not former grand-slam champions or Olympic gold medallists.\n\nWhen the LTA's director of events, Ollie Scadgell, was asked about the timing, he replied: \"Some of our British players will probably not choose to play qualifying [at the French Open, which clashes directly with the Loughborough tournament]. If they're on the margins. Challenger tournaments at $100,000 level on hard courts actually provide a decent transition opportunity from clay to grass.\n\n\"I know that Leon [Smith, the LTA's head of men's tennis] has been speaking to all relevant players around these two tournaments to understand what their current schedules are looking like,\" added Scadgell, \"and I know he's had some very positive responses.\"\n\nIn fact, Broady would have been more likely to stay in the UK for those weeks if it were not for the unexpectedly competitive clay-court performance that he delivered against Albert Ramos-Vinolas - the world No 22 - in the recent Davis Cup match in Marbella. To extend a former French Open quarter-finalist well past the two-hour mark in a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 defeat was an encouraging effort.\n\n\"It gives me a lot of confidence to go out and compete on the clay,\" Broady said, \"whereas maybe before Marbella I would have thought of going to Korea for the hard-court challengers and just playing two weeks before the French on the clay.\"\n\nAfter a week of rest, he plans to meet up with fellow Davis Cup players Kyle Edmund and Cameron Norrie for a clay-court training block at the National Tennis Centre in south-west London.\n\nMeanwhile, the LTA have announced a selected shortlist of tennis centres that have applied for the new National Academy role. They are Loughborough, Bath, Stirling, Culford and Bisham Abbey. One or perhaps two centres will be chosen to implement the new programme, which will charge parents of children aged 14 and over no more than £5,000 per annum while delivering a detailed programme of coaching, fitness training and physiotherapy worth around £35,000.",

                "title": "Former England Women manager Mark Sampson banned after intimidating female official with metal pole",
                "body": "Former England Women's manager Mark Sampson was being investigated for intimidating a female Uefa official with a metal pole at the 2017 European Championship before he was fired.\n\nUefa on Friday revealed the details of the disciplinary case that led to Sampson being banned for three games for \"insulting, aggressive and insistent actions,\" including profane abuse.\n\nUefa concluded its case on September 21, the day after the Football Association fired him for \"inappropriate and unacceptable behavior\" in a separate case focusing on relations with female players in a previous job. The FA declined to comment on Friday.\n\nSampson provided statements to Uefa on September 1 about the incidents after England's 3-0 defeat against Holland in the semi-finals on August 3.\n\nThe Uefa report included multiple expletives. An hour into the match, Uefa said Sampson was \"verbally abusive\" toward the venue director, telling her: \"You better sit down.\"\n\nSampson was then accused of confronting referee liaison officer Fijke Hoogendijk after the game outside the referee changing room. Sampson \"approached her and shouted aggressively at her and with aggressive body language,\" Uefa said.\n\nSummarising details of the case, Uefa said Sampson was shouting at Hoogendijk and calling her a \"disgrace.\"\n\nThe disciplinary report continued: \"He then picked up a metal pillar raising it above his head aggressively before throwing it down hard against the floor. Fijke was concerned he was going to strike her. ... Fijke felt intimidated and offended by his actions.\"\n\nThe FA denied that Sampson lifted the pole above his head, telling Uefa that it would have been impossible given its weight. Sampson apologized for his use of inappropriate language but denied saying he would shut the door in Hoogendijk's face.\n\nAccording to Uefa, the FA claimed that \"the build-up to the game had been particularly stressful with travel to the stadium disrupted and preparation time considerably reduced.\"\n\nBut Uefa's disciplinary body concluded that Sampson's conduct was of \"great concern\" as he \"threatened the integrity\" of an official.\n\n\"The language he used and his attitude grossly violated the basic rules of decent conduct and his behavior was insulting,\" Uefa said.\n\nThe seven-person panel was headed by Partl Thomas of Austria. \"It is without hesitation a cause of sorrow that persons deployed at matches who have no relation to the football performance of the teams are attacked in such an aggressive manner by team's officials,\" the panel said.\n\n\"Even accepting the statements of the coach in full it can't be permitted that Uefa officials like the venue director and the referee liaison officer endure the aggressive manners of others present at the match, let alone the head coach of one of the teams.\"\n\nIn October, the FA concluded its own investigation into Sampson's conduct while he was coaching the team and found that he had directed racially discriminating remarks at two of his players.\n\nSampson, who led the team to the 2015 Women's World Cup semi-finals, was replaced as England coach by former Manchester United player Phil Neville.",

There have been concerns about them and options are being looked at.\"\n\nBelgium last night (FRI) declined to say how many Russians were currently accredited to the EU or Nato headquarters in Brussels.\n\nIn 2015, Nato introduced a 30 person ceiling on \"partner missions\" in a move directly aimed at reducing the number of Russian officials and curtailing their intelligence-gathering at Nato headquarters.\n\nThe number of Russian's accredited to the European Union is believed to be far higher and more difficult to regulate.\n\nA Nato source said: \"If any member country wants to bring this to the attention of the council, they are certainly welcome to but this is not under discussion at the current time.\"\n\nA Nato official said the military alliance had 41 partners, along with growing relationships with a number of other countries. Under current guidelines, partner missions can have up to 30 staff. The guidelines apply to all partner missions.\n\n\"Partner nations select personnel to represent them at Nato headquarters. Security clearance is overseen by the Nato Office of Security.\"\n\nGerman leader Angela Merkel said the British case for Russian guilt was \"very solidly based\".\n\nShe said: \"Germany and France agree that additional steps, on top of the recall of the ambassador, are necessary,\" Merkel said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMr Macron called the attack \"unprecedented\" and said Europe must respond: \"It is an aggression against the security and sovereignty of an ally that is today a member of the European Union. It demands a reaction. This is clear.\"",

                "body": "How are Holland and Italy going to make it back from rock bottom? Ronald Koeman tasked with resuscitating a team and his career\n\nGood evening. England haven't beaten Holland in seven attempts since that inspiriting but ultimately deceptive 4-1 victory at Wembley during Euro 96. Even when Ruud van Nistelrooy and co were failing to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, England could not find the wherewithal to beat them and were outclassed at White Hart Lane in 2001 and needed a Darius Vassell equaliser to extricate themselves from a typical Sven-Goran Eriksson multi-substitute farce in Amsterdam a year later.\n\nThe Shearer-Sheringham victory was a rare moment of rapture against the Dutch, a team England have struggled to master since the game went professional in the Netherlands in 1954. It has often proved a chastening experience for the team and their manager.\n\nEven in 1970, Holland's first match at Wembley, neither England's status as world champions nor gratitude for Sir Alf Ramsey could stop the choruses of \"what a load of rubbish\" and bouts of slow hand-clapping castigating an experimental team's failure to pierce the opposition's defence during a goalless draw.\n\nThe old refrain rang out again seven years later, when Don Revie's England were humiliatingly outclassed at Wembley. The magnificent Dutch forward line of Johnny Rep, Johan Cruyff and Rob Rensenbrink mesmerised England's defenders with their intelligent use of space and the 2-0 scoreline flattered the bedraggled home side.\n\nAnyone who saw the 2-2 draw at Wembley in the spring of 1988 would not have been surprised in Dusseldorf three months later when Ruud Gullit set up two of Marco van Basten's three goals in the 3-1 victory at Euro 88 in Germany, only that he did not score himself.\n\nEngland played better than they had against the Republic of Ireland and fought back determinedly to equalise through Bryan Robson's typically indomitable surge but Gary Lineker, suffering from glandular fever, could not match Van Basten's predatory poise.\n\nIt was with the threat posed by Gullit specifically in mind that England finally abandoned the flat back four when the two met at Italia 90, opting for two markers and a very English style of libero, and together they largely kept him in check in a goalless draw.\n\nOrthodoxy returned under Graham Taylor and England paid the price in a 2-2 draw at Wembley during 1993 for Des Walker's loss of confidence following his transfer to Sampdoria. Taylor could justifiably claim he was abandoned by luck in Rotterdam during the return-game qualifier for the 1994 World Cup and he was understandably peeved when the referee failed to send tonight's Holland manager, Ronald Koeman, off. \"Linesman? Linesman?\" he famously asked. \"What sort of thing is happening here?\" But Holland could also have demanded to know why Frank Rijkaard's first-half \"goal\" was disallowed when he was a yard onside.\n\nEngland failed entirely to nullify Dennis Bergkamp, who ran at will at retreating midfielders and when Brian Moore's premonition of what Koeman would do from his retaken free-kick agonisingly came to pass, it delivered the coup de grâce to Taylor's three years in charge.\n\nA Holland team that failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and desperately in need of a fillip will not deliver a mortal blow to Gareth Southgate. He is manifestly decent, quietly impressive and the model of a modern coach, even down to the DH  Lawrence beard he is now sporting - cosmopolitan, flexible and cerebral. Yet there are echoes too of Malcolm Allison and Dave Sexton, whose undervalued toughness complemented their sprightly creativity and aptitude for teaching. England are in good hands.\n\nAuto update\n\nOn Off",

                "title": "Anti-gun campaigners declare 'major breakthrough' as US Congress opens the door research on gun violence",
                "body": "The US Congress has opened the door for America's public health institute to carry out research into mass shootings in what anti-gun campaigners declared a \"major breakthrough\".\n\nIt came as 500,000 people were set to descend on Washington today (Saturday) for a rally organised by survivors of the country's worst high school massacre, which took place in Florida last month.\n\nFor the last 22 years the $7 billion-a-year, publicly funded US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is home to the largest number of violence prevention experts in the world, has effectively been stopped from conducting research into gun safety.\n\nThe freeze followed the introduction of a 1996 law, the Dickey Amendment, which was inspired by the National Rifle Association. It said that none of the CDC's government funds could be used to \"advocate or promote gun control\".\n\nWhilst not banning research outright there was a chilling effect on gun research, and CDC funds were ploughed into other areas.\n\nAs a result there have been no nationwide studies done on issues such as who owns America's hundreds of millions of guns, how many homes have guns, how often they are stolen, if better training for users might improve safety, or whether concealed carry permits increase or decrease risk.\n\nBecause of the Dickey Amendment guns are not treated as a public health problem in the manner of cigarettes, HIV, or opioids.\n\nIn article for The Telegraph Mark Rosenberg, who headed CDC research into gun violence before the amendment, said there should be a similar response to that against road traffic accidents in the 1960s, when the US government started spending $200 million on research, saving 350,000 lives. There has been no such investment into gun violence.\n\nPoliticians have therefore lacked scientific studies on which to base proposals for gun control legislation.\n\n\"After every mass shooting we are cautioned to wait for the facts before we act. But because of the Dickey Amendment we don't have the facts,\" said Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat congressman from New Mexico, who is himself a gun owner.\n\nBut as Congress passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill on Friday it included a \"clarification\" to the Dickey Amendment.\n\nThe clarification consisted of comments made the day after the Florida shooting by Alex Azar, Donald Trump's health secretary.\n\nMr Azar was clear that the amendment should not prohibit the CDC researching gun violence. He said: \"My understanding is it does not in any way impede our ability to conduct our research mission.\"\n\nThe adoption of those comments into law, agreed by Democrats and Republicans, could now unlock the CDC to renew its research after two decades.\n\nStephanie Murphy, a congresswoman from Florida who introduced the clarification, said: \"It makes it clear the CDC can research gun violence. It's a victory for our country and children. Our work to stop gun violence will continue.\"\n\nThe Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said it could have a \"dramatic impact\" on research. The group said: \"We are no longer in the ice age when it comes to this.\"\n\nHowever, a spokeswoman for the NRA denied it changed anything. She said: \"I guess for folks who can't read or do not understand the English language, it helps them understand.\"\n\nThe Dickey Amendment was originally introduced by Jay Dickey, a congressman from Arkansas and leading NRA supporter. Since 1996 at least 600,000 people have been shot in America. More than 100 medical groups, including the American Medical Association, have called for Dickey to be overturned.\n\nMr Dickey himself later renounced his own law, saying he regretted being \"so reactionary,\" but it remains on the statute books.\n\nOne former CDC employee, who worked there at the time of the Sandy Hook massacre, told The Telegraph: \"Something I learned at the CDC was that people considered researching anything to do with guns a career-ender.\n\n\"If you read the language of Dickey it's not a ban, but it definitely felt like a ban. At the CDC it became 'You can't talk about guns'. They studied ladder safety, black lung, and all sorts of occupational health issues, but not gun violence.\"\n\nThere were fears that researching guns would lead to NRA supporters in Congress retaliating by cutting funding for other CDC research areas, the former employee said.\n\nWhile the clarification was being viewed as a victory by anti-gun campaigners others said it was a \"baby step\".\n\nMr Rosenberg, who headed CDC research into gun violence before the Dickey Amendment, said what was really needed was a funding commitment from Congress of $100 million, a similar level to what was spent on researching road safety decades ago.\n\nHe told The Telegraph: \"We need to do the same kind of science we did to reduce deaths on roads. Back then we researched cars and we made them safer with seat belts, air bags, collapsible steering columns. We made the roads safer with roundabouts and barriers down two-lane highways. And we did it all without actually getting rid of cars.\n\n\"But with solutions for gun violence now it's like allowing thalidomide without testing it. You need to carry out the research and to know it works before you do it.\"\n\nIn his article for the Telegraph Mr Rosenberg also revealed how he and his former \"mortal enemy\" Mr Dickey had become \"wonderful friends\".\n\nMr Dickey died last year.\n\nMr Rosenberg said: \"It would honour Congressman Dickey to know that this research will be born again.\"\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security",

                "body": "The seaside out of season can be as quiet as winter storms are wild - but that's why I like it. Selsey in West Sussex suffers somewhat from the curse of boring brown beer, with the honourable exception of long-standing real ale haven The Seal. New micropub The Crab Pot has added some much-needed colour.\n\nWe visited just after dark on a chilly Saturday evening, and found the place swinging as if it were high season. Landlord Edward Sye stepped forward to greet us and show us to our seats. His warm welcome instantly marked The Crab Pot out from the soulless wipe-clean template of the storefront micropub.\n\nThe beer list, or rather drinks list, edges the pub towards the status of \"gem\". Not only is there cask beer, but also lager, cider, wines and local spirits. I opted for a half of Downlands Brewery Resolution (5%), a big, piney American-style IPA; my brother chose a pint of Broken Bridge Brewing Broken Biscuit (4.2%), a porter fittingly reminiscent of chocolate digestives.\n\nNo money was requested at this stage: Edward simply wrote what we'd had on the slate hanging at the end of our table for payment on departure, which seems trusting, anachronistic and brilliant all at once.\n\nNo money was requested at this stage: the landlord just wrote what we'd had on a slate hanging at the end of our table\n\nAs we supped our beers, I took in the décor. Pictures of Selsey and its history included a large print of the old lifeboat station, which was pulled down last year to make way for updated facilities. It's nice to see it remembered here as it was such a part of the local landscape - and star of many postcards.\n\nDespite the risk of slipping further into nostalgia, I couldn't resist a gin and tonic. I've always been suspicious of those stemmed balloon glasses, but with a pink grapefruit garnish that complimented my Brilliant Gin perfectly, I was converted by the fragrance it delivered.\n\nMicropubs might mark a new step in the evolution - or devolution - of the traditional pub; but this one is a pleasing combination of modern attitude and old-fashioned hospitality.\n\nSophie blogs at AfemAleView.net\n\n145 High Street, Selsey, West Sussex PO20 0QB; 07834 226751",

                "body": "A teenage boy who took a shotgun to school in preparation for a mass shorting has had his six year sentence overturned after an appeal court judge said he is a \"model son\".\n\nThe 15-year-old boy was jailed last September after a court hear he had been \"moments away\" from carrying out a high school massacre after going to class with a shotgun, knife, balaclava and 200 rounds of ammunition.\n\nBut this week, Lady Justice Hallett said he had shown only a \"fleeting intention\" to use the gun at his Warwickshire school last June, before contacting police.\n\nShe agreed with social workers who said he should be freed under supervision. Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with two other senior judges at the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, acknowledged the boy quickly \"came to his senses\" after loading the gun and called police to the school himself.\n\n\"It was when he was putting on his ear protectors that he changed his mind and rang the police,\" she said.\n\nThe teenager, who had been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety at the time, had \"exhibited no aggressive or disruptive behaviour before this incident,\" she added.\n\nSocial workers recommended that the boy's release includes a rehabilitation package. \"We have concluded that this is a case in which the welfare of this child goes hand in hand with the protection of the public,\" Lady Justice Hallett said.\n\n\"We are satisfied that it would be appropriate, once we are informed the arrangements are in place, to follow the recommendations made.\"\n\nLast September, Warwick Justice Centre was told how the teenager armed himself with the intent of carrying out \"a shooting that would have taken a dreadful place in the history of truly wicked crimes\" committed in Britain - but had a last minute \"change of heart\".\n\nThe boy, who cannot be named, took the double-barrelled shotgun and 200 cartridges from his father's cabinet as well as a knife, balaclava and ear defenders.\n\nHe then spent his first lesson with the firearm concealed in his trousers at Higham Lane School, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire before excusing himself from class and going to a side room. As he was putting on ear protectors in preparation of his massacre he suddenly saw sense and phoned 999.\n\nJudge Andrew Lockhart QC told the youngster: \"The consequences of what might have occurred had you carried your plan into effect are too awful to contemplate. \"The event was, on your own admissions made at the time, just moments away.\n\n\"A moment in time separates the pupils and staff of this school from being the subject of a terrible event and a shooting that would have taken a dreadful place in the history of truly wicked crimes committed in this country.\"",

                "body": "Baselworld, which opened on Thursday, is the motherlode for news and gossip from the watch industry and is still the platform from which major brands such as Omega, Patek Philippe and Rolex launch their annual collections.\n\nSome of its lustre has come off over the last year or two as brands have pulled out, either moving to Geneva's rival fair, the SIHH, set up shop away from the official fair or simply pass the whole thing up as Bremont have done. But if stories about the show have cast a shadow on proceedings, that's only the case until the doors open and the brands and watches take the limelight.\n\nPatek Philippe and Rolex traditionally keep their cards closest, but this year Patek have dropped a little bomb by launching a new ladies' version of the company's pilot-style Travel Time on Instagram.\n\nPatek's first foray onto the platform is a jigsaw montage of the 7234R and has predictably gained followers and likes and speed - they'll be disappointed with less than six-figures by the end of the week.\n\nLaunched in 2015 with a white-gold case and blue dial, the Ref. 5524 Calatrava Pilot Travel Time has two time zones, home, local time and with local date. Now there is a new rose-gold version with a brown dial and a black gradation. #PatekTime #CalatravaPilotTravelTime #5524R\n\nA post shared by Patek Philippe (@patekphilippe) on Mar 18, 2018 at 10:38am PDT\n\nAs for Rolex, it seemed like the reveal would happen first thing Thursday morning as bloggers literally sprinted to the stand to get first images up adding to the nearly 17 million posts already up. You couldn't predict what they would find, though the rumour mills pointed to an updated movement for the Submariner Date and a new GMT Master as reasonably likely while simultaneously throwing up left field wishes such as the monochrome 'Polar'- dialled Explorer.\n\nNot to be outdone, Omega followers are making predictions too, but as the brand doesn't share the Rolex change through adjustment approach, there's less value in making predictions beyond the years when it's an Olympics or a Bond film is due out.\n\nOmega will, however, be showing a very smart, yellow-accented Speedmaster \"Dark Side of the Moon\". Cased in black ceramic, the dial has a moon surface texture and the watch has \"We'll see you on the other side\", Jim Lovell's words as his Apollo 8 made his pioneering orbit of the moon in 1968.\n\nBreitling have already run a worldwide roadshow to present the brand's new Navtimer 8 collection alongside the new strategy and identity, but have left a redesigned Navitimer 1 collection for Basel which is sure to make waves, not least the time only 38mm version.\n\nLVMH brands, Bvlgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith tend to be less coy, showing Basel watches right from the beginning of the year, two highlights being Zenith's 41mm Defy El Primero (existing versions are 44mm diameter) and a titanium and sapphire cased Octo Tourbillon from Bvlgari.\n\nThe Hublot machine rolls into town with a celebrity football match that will feature the likes of Maradona, Jose Mourinho, Usain Bolt, Stephane Chapuisat, Marcel Desailly, Roberto Carlos and Alan Shearer to mark the brand's sponsorship of the World Cup.\n\nMore serious watch action is to be found in \"Les Ateliers\" a section of messe Basel's vast halls dedicated to the independents which will feature the likes of MB&F (who are showing a fabulous blue/green Legacy Machine Perpetual in Titanium), Moritz Grossmann and Chanel collaborator, Romain Gauthier.",

                "body": "The idea that ultra luxury in interior design also has to be ultra serious is a silly one. Sadly it's too often the case that at the haute end, the stuff of life has to be a little bit, well... stuffy, if it's to be taken seriously. It is with great pleasure, then, that for spring, superyacht designer to the stars Achille Salvagni has taken a bold move in quite the other direction and transformed his Mayfair Atelier into a spaceship.\n\nWhat a vessel. In Salvagni's sumptuous retro-futuristic space capsule, inspired by set designs from iconic 1960s science fiction films, Stanley Kubrick's seminal 2001: A Space Odyssey has landed in Grafton Street. With three new pieces as well as a fine selection of works from the designer's classic collection, the playful exhibit shows that far from being kitsch, a little lightheartedness can go a long way.\n\nEspecially when it is as sharply tailored and as obsessively crafted as Salvagni's vision. Set against the gallery's all-white backdrop, paneled walls are dotted with a pair of portholes that look out into space. The earthy and metallic tones of Salvagni's signature pieces, crafted from natural materials such as onyx, 24K gold-plated bronze and European walnut, float weightlessly. Organic textures and soft curves are juxtaposed with geometric forms, exploring the harmony between past and future, tradition and innovation.\n\n\"I admire the ground-breaking production design of 2001: A Space Odyssey and the visionary atmospheres of 1960s science-fiction movies in general,\" says Salvagni, by way of explanation. \"As commercial space tourism takes shape, I created my own interpretation of a space capsule. I wanted to imagine a futuristic yet opulent interior with highly crafted pieces, design a personal response to the imminent exploration of this unchartered territory, another marvel soon to be revealed.\"\n\nSalvagni, who opened the London Atelier in 2015 but is himself based in Rome, has described his pieces as being \"closer to fine jewellery than furniture\" in their construction. Represented by Maison Gérard in New York, key works have also achieved notable results in recent auctions at Sotheby's and Piasa and now sit in the collections of luminaries and the likes including Michael Bloomberg, Paul Simon, and Gisele Bündchen.\n\nBack in the space capsule, the first room is dominated by his classic Spider chandelier in white patinated cast bronze and back lit onyx. Emerald and Menhir side tables, conversing with one another, become futuristic emblems, almost carved out of singular blocks of materials from outer space.\n\nThe softer, let's say slightly 'alien' Papillia armchairs, are a new version of Salvagni's successful dining chair, with delicate six-leg supports. New Bubbles wall sconces revisit the original design conceived for Jeff Koons, while a set of Brancaleone wall sconces are suspended in the space like celestial objects.

                "title": "Australia submit official complaint over 'disgraceful' verbal abuse from South Africa fans",
                "body": "Australia coach Darren Lehmann says his team have made an official complaint to South Africa's cricket body over what he calls the \"disgraceful\" behaviour of home fans at Newlands on the second day of the third Test between the two sides on Friday.\n\nLehmann said a number of Australian players were subjected to verbal abuse from fans, including references to players' families.\n\nThe issue was first highlighted when batsman David Warner was confronted by a fan and apparently verbally abused as he left the field after being dismissed.\n\nTelevision footage shows Warner stopping in his tracks and turning to face the man, who then appeared to continue making comments as Warner walked up the stairs toward the Australia dressing room.\n\nA security official tried to intervene but the man kept on speaking to Warner. After facing the man for a few moments, Warner continued up the stairs.\n\nThat incident was not the only one, Lehmann said. He complained his team had been subjected to abuse from the crowd in the first two Tests, but it reached a crescendo in Cape Town on Friday.\n\n\"It's been disgraceful,\" Lehmann said. \"You're talking about abuse of various players and their families and personal abuse. It's not on at a cricket ground anywhere around the world, not just here. It shouldn't happen.\n\n\"There's been various incidents throughout the Test series but this one has taken the cake.\"\n\nThe man who confronted and directed comments at Warner was thrown out of the ground. Newlands authorities also reportedly ejected other fans for what they deemed offensive actions, which included songs directed at Australia players and T-shirts with slogans.\n\nThe fan involved in the Warner incident was standing beside a small fence which separates an exclusive members' stand from the players' stairs. As Warner came off the field and went up the stairs on his side, the man also walked up on his side and continued making comments at Warner.\n\nThe fan had started by applauding Warner, sarcastically it seems, as the Australian approached. He then became abusive.\n\nWarner, a notoriously pugnacious player, has become a target for extra attention from home fans after his confrontation with South Africa's Quinton de Kock on a stadium staircase during the first Test in Durban.\n\nThat heated argument, which led to ICC disciplinary hearings and sanctions for both players, was sparked by Warner's prolonged on-field taunting of De Kock. It resulted in De Kock allegedly retorting with an unsavoury comment about Warner's wife, and Warner having to be physically restrained by team-mates.\n\nFans also attempted to taunt Warner during the second Test in Port Elizabeth by wearing masks with the face of New Zealand rugby player Sonny Bill Williams. It was in reference to a sexual encounter Warner's wife had with Williams years before she married the cricketer. Warner's wife, Candice Warner, and their two young daughters are traveling with him in South Africa.\n\nThe mask stunt had repercussions for South Africa's cricket body when two of its senior officials were photographed smiling with some of the fans wearing the masks. The two officials were suspended and face disciplinary procedures.",

                "title": "Five things landlords need to know in 2018",
                "body": "April will see the introduction of several changes that will affect owners of buy-to-let properties.\n\nThere are other things happening later in 2018 which may also impact on landlords. Here is our rundown of five of the most important things this year that buy-to-let landlords should be aware of.\n\n1. The amount of tax relief landlords can claim on mortgage interest is falling\n\nPrior to April 6, 2017, landlords could claim tax relief back on mortgage interest at their marginal tax rate. That meant basic, higher, and additional rate taxpayers were able to benefit from tax relief at 20%, 40% or 45% respectively.\n\nSince this date, however, the amount of tax relief landlords can claim on mortgage interest payments has fallen to 75%. Next tax year, which begins on April 6, 2018, landlords will only be permitted to offset 50% of their mortgage interest, reducing to 25% in 2019-20. From 2020-21 onwards, it will only be possible to reclaim tax relief at the basic rate, whatever rate of tax you pay.\n\n2. Properties must meet new minimum energy efficiency standards from April\n\nIt will be unlawful to let out a newly bought rental property which doesn't conform to the new Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard (MEES) from April 1. Only homes which have an energy performance certificate rating of E or above meet this standard. If your property has a rating lower than this, for example, F or G, you won't be able to renew or grant a tenancy on your property after the April 1. Landlords who continue letting homes with the lowest energy ratings risk fines of up to £4,000.\n\nIf you're not sure what the EPC rating on your rental property is, you can search the EPC register by postcode.\n\n3. Landlords may soon have to sign up to an ombudsman redress scheme\n\nUnder plans announced last October by Sajid Javid, the Communities and Local Government Secretary, it will become a legal requirement for buy-to-let landlords to sign up to a compulsory arbitration scheme. The scheme would provide tenants with a way to raise issues they may be having with their landlord and which cannot be resolved directly between them.\n\nA consultation into the new redress system was launched last month, with the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government seeking opinions on how best to improve the housing complaints process.\n\n4. You'll have to pay the 3% stamp duty surcharge if you want to add to your property portfolio\n\nA 3% stamp duty surcharge was introduced in April 2016 for anyone buying a property in addition to their main home, either to rent out, or to use as a holiday home. If you're considering adding to your rental property portfolio this year, you'll therefore need to factor the surcharge into your costs.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to purchase a property to rent out costing £250,000, the stamp duty bill would be £10,000, rising to £22,000 if you bought a rental property costing £400,000.\n\n5. Prepare for higher mortgage rates\n\nMany commentators are anticipating a base rate increase as early as May this year, so it makes sense to consider whether you're prepared for higher buy-to-let mortgage costs.\n\nLots of landlords are coming to the end of two-year fixed rate deals this April, having rushed to purchase properties ahead of the introduction of the stamp duty surcharge in 2016. If you're one of them and want to lock into another fixed rate mortgage deal when your existing contract ends, make sure you act sooner rather than later if you want to take advantage of current low rates. According to Moneyfacts.co.uk, latest figures show that the average five-year fixed buy-to-let rate has now returned to the record low last seen in October, sitting at 3.43%.\n\nPrepare for all of the mortgage changes due in April by making sure you get the best rate on a buy to let mortgage by comparing mortgage deals from our trusted partners L & C",

                "body": "A police inspector who strangled his wife and dumped her body in a lake after she discovered he had applied for a loan in her name has been found guilty of murder.\n\nDarren McKie, 43, admitted the manslaughter of Detective Constable Leanne McKie, nine days into his trial at Chester Crown Court, but on Friday a jury found him guilty of murder.\n\nHer body was found in Poynton Lake, Cheshire, on September 29 last year.\n\nIn a statement, her parents Ray and Ellen Dodd said: \"Justice has been served today. Our lives will never be the same again.\n\n\"There are no winners in this trial. We have lost our beautiful daughter and our grandchildren have lost their beloved mummy.\"\n\nThe court heard friends described the couple, who had three children, as the \"perfect family\" but they were more than £115,000 in debt and McKie had been applying for loans in his and his wife's names.\n\nThe jury was told they had spent £63,000 on renovations to their four-bedroom home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, in the months leading up to her death, including £3,500 on a granite kitchen worktop, and went on a £4,500 holiday to Portugal that summer.\n\nMrs McKie, who had an Instagram account documenting the house's transformation, was apparently unaware of the debt.\n\nOn the morning of her death she was at home when her passport and salary details, accessed from the police system by her husband, were returned after being used in an application for a £54,000 loan.\n\nThe court heard she sent text messages to her husband calling him a \"liar\" and asking: \"Are we in such a mess?\"\n\nMcKie left work early and returned home, arriving at the house in Burford Close by midday.\n\nTen minutes later he took a call from a surveyor due to value the house later that day.\n\nMrs McKie's car, a red Mini Countryman, was seen being driven away from the property shortly after and when surveyor Anthony Parker arrived, at about 1pm, he saw McKie walking back to the house.\n\nThe prosecution alleged Mrs McKie's body was in the boot of the car when it was driven a short distance away.\n\nMr Parker described McKie as \"perfectly normal\" and parents saw him laughing as he picked his children up from school later that day.\n\nAt 10.30pm, once the children were in bed, McKie left the property and the Mini was picked up by CCTV and automatic number plate recognition cameras driving towards Mobberley, where police later found Mrs McKie's phone, and then Poynton, where it was discovered the following morning.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning McKie was spotted twice by officers on patrol in the area and on the second occasion he was wearing no shoes.\n\nThe court heard his trainers were later found in a wheelie bin with traces of his wife's blood on.\n\nAt 3.45am the body of Mrs McKie was found in the lake in Poynton Park.\n\nPathologist Brian Rodgers said she had been strangled, with force equivalent to a karate chop, for a period of a minute or more.\n\nMcKie was arrested at 5am that day but in interviews denied any knowledge of her death, only admitting her killing six months later when he changed his plea moments before he was due to give evidence in his trial.",

In the Sixties and Seventies, with cascading curls and bare chest, wildly swinging his microphone as if it was a lethal weapon, he set a template for a very kind of masculine warrior idol. He was the ideal frontman for a band that always seemed on the verge of descending into mayhem or ascending to nirvana.\n\nHe still does the microphone lasso tricks but, at 74, Daltrey is a much more avuncular presence. As the patron of Teenage Cancer Trust, he has organised an annual week of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall since 2000, raising millions for the charity. So, he had the relaxed air of being among friends as he headlined his own show, doing his bit for a good cause, chatting with amiable humour between songs.\n\nHe was essentially backed by The Who's live band, and the set was filled with Who classics, intriguingly padded out with more obscure personal favourites from their catalogue, some of which had never been performed on stage before. Daltry jokingly dedicated Another Tricky Day (from Face Dances) and How Many Friends (from The Who by Numbers) to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: \"He's going to find out how many real friends he's got now.\"",

                "title": "Good policy requires good data. It's time to open the door to research on US gun violence",
                "body": "The Dickey Amendment that prohibits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from using US federal funds to advocate or promote gun control is confusing so it is no surprise that many people in Congress are trying to repeal it with the intent to fund gun violence prevention research.\n\nThe amendment emerged in 1996 in the heat of a battle between two formidable forces: the NRA-led members of Congress who wanted to protect and enlarge gun rights, and those who wanted more gun control.\n\nThis battle was personified in two formidable foes: Representative Jay Dickey, a Republican born-again Christian conservative, life-time NRA member, from rural Arkansas, and me, a liberal Jewish physician from the Northeast who was trying to establish a scientific research program to address gun violence from a public health perspective.\n\nWe started our work on gun violence at the CDC with the idea that if we could use research to answer four key questions about gun violence we could save as many lives as had been saved when the government initiated a research program to stop the epidemic of young lives being lost to motor vehicle crashes in the 1960s.\n\nThat initiative - the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - appropriated $200 million a year for research. It led to safer cars with front-end crash protection, side-impact protection, seat belts, and multiple airbags. It led to safer roads and safer drivers - all of which together saved more than 350,000 lives.\n\nAnd it was all done without banning cars.\n\nTo achieve similar results with firearm injuries, the four questions we needed to ask were:\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\nWho, what, where, and how are people being shot, with what types of weapons; what is the relationship between shooter and victim; and are these shootings increasing or decreasing? What are the causes?\n\nWhat is the role of gangs, alcohol and drugs, mental illness, domestic violence, and easy access to firearms? What's the impact on medical injuries from high capacity magazines and high velocity ammunition? What are the combinations of these factors that lead someone to pull the trigger? Why do more males than females use guns to kill themselves? Is there a connection between access to guns and depression or impulsivity? What works to prevent these injuries?\n\nDoes arming teachers or putting armed guards in all schools save lives or result in more children being injured? Does making it easier for people to carry concealed weapons make us safer or result in more shootings? Do waiting periods prevent suicides? How do you do it?\n\nHow do you scale up interventions that work and translate them into policy and legislation?\n\nThe NRA leadership adopted a strategy of zero tolerance. They told their members that it was all or none: either they could keep their guns or do the research but they could not have both. They wanted to stop this gun violence prevention research by abolishing the entire injury center at CDC.\n\nThe Dickey Amendment was a last minute compromise between the gun rights advocates and the gun control advocates that evolved in the House Appropriations committee in 1996. It stated: \"The bill contains a limitation to prohibit the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control from engaging in any activities to advocate or promote gun control.\n\nThe Dickey amendment started out as a threat to stop gun violence prevention research - but it has become the key to restarting it\n\n\"The CDC may need to collect data on the incidence of gun related violence, but the Committee does not believe that it is the role of the CDC to advocate or promote policies to advance gun control initiatives, or to discourage responsible private gun ownership.\n\n\"The Committee expects research in this area to be objective and grants to be awarded through an impartial peer review process.\"\n\nTechnically speaking, the amendment prohibited lobbying for specific gun control legislation without prohibiting research. But it was used as a shot across the bow to research scientists and federal bureaucrats warning them that if they undertook research in the area of gun violence prevention, Congress could make their lives miserable by forcing them to spend weeks to months answering congressional inquiries sent to the secretary of The Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) or the Director of the CDC accusing them of using government funds to promote or advocate gun control.\n\nA second shot across the bow was the zeroing out by Congress of the $2.6 million that the CDC had been using to support its gun violence research. A third shot came when the Director of CDC fired me, the person most closely identified with the CDC's gun violence research. As a result the gun violence prevention research that the CDC did fell off by more than 90 per cent.\n\nSince then, there has been some very productive research by a small number of academic researchers and we do certainly know some answers to the questions What's the Problem? and What are the Causes? But we are still ill-equipped to answer the most critical question of all: What works to prevent these injuries?\n\nWhen the Federally sponsored Task Force for Community Preventive Services reviewed the state of our knowledge about what works, they found that for every one of the principle ways to reduce gun violence - including limiting access to certain types of weapons, making it easier to carry concealed weapons, gun registration and licensing of gun owners - we could not say what works. For every one of these interventions we lacked sufficient data and evidence.\n\nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle appreciate having the evidence they need to make sound policy and the lack of evidence has hindered good policy making.\n\nAmerican society is polarised. The two sides don't want to hear each other... they want to beat the other down\n\nAfter the House appropriations committee hearing where Congressman Dickey effectively ambushed the Director of the CDC and me, I was told by my CDC handlers to be sure that I never, ever talk to Mr Dickey because I would only make things worse. It would be like throwing a lighted match on gasoline.\n\nSoon after that, however, we did start talking - at his invitation. And over the years we talked more and more. We came to know each other, to trust each other, to talk to each other and learn from each other. I taught him about the public health approach and the value of science in solving seemingly unsolvable problems.\n\nHe taught me that our research needed to have two objectives, not just one. We needed to find interventions that would both reduce gun violence and protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners. And we needed to make this clear to both sides. It was not, as the NRA leadership would have had us believe, a question of being either for reducing gun violence or protecting gun rights. Through research we could find things that would do both.\n\nJust like in cancer research where we need to find new therapies that will both stop the tumor and protect the patient's vital organs. In fact, research is the only way we make progress in fighting cancer, and it has produced immunotherapies which can both stop the cancer and keep the patient alive.\n\nJay Dickey and I started out as near-mortal enemies and we became wonderful friends. The Dickey amendment started out as a threat to stop gun violence prevention research but it has become the key to restarting it.\n\nAmerican society is polarised when it comes to guns. The two sides don't want to hear each other or learn from each other. They want to beat the other down. When we came together Jay and I realised that to restore the funding we would need bi-partisan support and we understood that science was the way to build a post-partisan common ground. Once we had the results, research could tell legislators what works, what is both safe and effective.\n\nIn the absence of knowledge and in this environment, common sense is not enough because what each side puts forth as common sense, the other sides calls lies and propaganda. Now the Dickey Amendment provides cover to legislators on both sides who are afraid of the NRA because it assures them that any money appropriated to the CDC for gun violence prevention research will be used for research, and not to lobby for gun control.\n\nA small appropriation of $20 million - one tenth the amount that was used to start federal research on motor vehicle injury prevention 50 years ago - will be enough to get this life-saving research going.\n\nThe cost of standing in opposite corners and approaching the issue as the ultimate fighting championship, is that our children will continue to be killed, and our mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers will shoot themselves or be shot by others.\n\nNo one wants that, not gun control advocates or NRA members. We don't need to continue down this path -- there is a clear path to making our homes, our schools and our communities safer. It's not the only path but it is one that leads to safety and protecting our second amendment rights.\n\nIt would honor Congressman Dickey to know that this research will be born again.\n\nThe author, Mark L. Rosenberg , is a physician and public health researcher who is the former president and CEO of the Task Force for Global Health.

                "title": "Great Escape: Exploring the ice floes and empty roads of northeastern Hokkaido",
                "body": "It's -11C on a February afternoon and my road trip along the northeastern corner of Japan's vast Hokkaido island has led me to the small coastal town of Utoro. On the edge of the remote Shiretoku Peninsula and the entryway to the UNESCO-protected Shiretoku National Park, this isolated stretch is known in the local Ainu language as 'the end of the world'. In front of me lies the Sea of Okhotsk, completely frozen over. Huge pieces of drift ice are caught in the grip of the frozen water. It almost feels like I can walk across to Russia, located somewhere over this stretch of seemingly solidified sea.\n\nDuring wintertime, these waters are almost impossible to navigate through because of huge ice floes drifting in from Siberia. Most international tourists fly from Tokyo to Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido Prefecture, to reach the western ski resort of Niseko. But I've come here to escape the crowds. At Sapporo I transfer to the regional Memanbetsu Airport, somewhere in the more remote and unknown parts of eastern Hokkaido.\n\nTypically, the only Western travellers to venture this far are birdwatchers looking for the red-crowned cranes who gather elegantly in the marshlands of Kushiro. I want to admire my surroundings more generally. As I travel through eastern Hokkaido, it so frequently feels as though I've stepped into a Japanese painting of a wintery landscape, a kakemono calligraphy drawing of valleys carpeted in pure, white snow; endless forests where bears still roam; frozen lakes where swans and cranes parade in the soft midwinter light; and small, dimly lit towns where you can retreat and reheat thanks to heart-warming onsen.\n\nIn Utoro one morning, a short guy dressed like a penguin waves and gestures for me to join him on the frozen sea. In my baggy drysuit, I walk, in true penguin style, on the slippery drift ice and wander away from the shore onto the Sea of Okhotsk, supplier of possibly the world's best king crab and more seafood delights like wonderful wild salmon.\n\nFrom my perch on the frozen bay, I try to visualise how the pure water from the Amur river in Russia transforms into huge pieces of ice when meeting these shallow waters, where fierce winds coming from Siberia freeze everything and everyone. The Japanese call it ryūhyō and the drift ice forms around the end of February and disappears completely around mid-April. Japanese tourists like to wander around on the drift ice, sometimes doing an ice-plunge with protected suits. They might see white-tailed eagles, gliding over the frozen water, while they're there.\n\nThe good thing about feeling cold in Japan is that there's always a toasty hot spring around the corner. In the evening I bed down in Utoro's aptly named Shiretoko Grand Hotel Kita Kobushi. If you want to experience true Japan, there are intimate and luxurious ryokans but staying in a grand, Japanese-style hotel and feeling the dynamics of local people on holiday is also quite an experience. Again in the hotel there are plenty of onsen with views over the ice-cold sea, as well as warm sake and steaming hot-pot dishes with freshly caught seafood. Afterwards there's karaoke. I enjoy all that's on offer, and then sleep like a baby in my snug, futon-style bed in a super-warm tatami-mat bedroom.\n\nFrom the drift ice near the national park and lakes of the Shiretoku Peninsula it is a short, easy drive to the dense woods near the town of Nemuro. Wearing snowshoes, I walk with a guide deep into a silent forest bordered by high cliffs and a steel-grey ocean. There's deer, eagles and foxes. The brown bears that inhabit this region should be fast asleep during this time of the year, but there's always a chance of an early bird. Armed with a whistle and bear spray, my guide leads me through the forest, stopping now and then to admire the views. It is peaceful and beautiful, so it seems discordant when at the end of the tour we suddenly find ourselves in a warm and cosy visitors' centre where souvenirs like fluffy gloves fashioned to look like bear claws are sold alongside hot matcha tea.\n\nDuring winter Hokkaido is completely snowed under, but I'm told that when spring arrives it transforms into a lush and fertile paradise. The prefecture's dairy farms supply the rest of Japan with fresh milk for ice cream, while in late June the fields surrounding the towns of Furano and Biei are carpeted in lavender - I'm told it feels like being in Provence. But that's hard to believe when the landscape is still sheathed in its winter cloak; to convince me that Hokkaido sparkles in every season, my guide arranges a stop at Attoko-Ito, a dairy farm that produces the prefecture's best ice cream. I try a huge cone, freshly made, pure-white, soft and creamy. It resembles the icy landscapes of this remote part of Hokkaido.\n\nOver the following days I proceed through this isolated landscape without seeing a single other Western tourist. Travelling from Utoro to another coastal town of Nemuro, I pass by Lake Furenko, where couples take selfies while swans in the background waddle on the frozen water, an immense brackish lake that is a birdwatcher's paradise. Eagles, kites and some 300 other kinds of wild birds can be seen here, but again there are only Japanese travellers.\n\nThe highlight of my visit to the frozen northeast of Japan is without doubt the Crane Sanctuary Tsurui and Itô Town in Kushiro-Shitsugen National Park, which lies almost 100 kilometres - about 90 minutes' drive - to the east of Lake Furenko. This is the fairy-tale place where over 200 red-crowned cranes gather in the snow. The birds were hunted almost to extinction but in recent decades have recovered significantly. The birds mate for life; at the sanctuary, an army of paparazzi-style photographers line up to snap the perfect photo of two cranes performing a graceful courtship dance. This sanctuary is located in the biggest marshland in Japan and is known by every committed birdwatcher in the world.\n\nIn true Japanese style, we end the day in Akan, a small town filled with shops, izakayas and hotels with onsen near Lake Akan, also called the happiness lake. The town and lake lie near Akan National Park, about 90 minutes from the Tsurui Crane Sanctuary. A string of hotels sits along the edge of this now-flooded caldera-type volcanic crater. The little town of Ainu Kotan is significant because it is a stronghold for Ainu culture. The Ainu people are the indigenous inhabitants of Hokkaido and are seen as the first people of Japan. But the most recent estimates suggest Hokkaido's Ainu population stands at just 25,000 people, and it was only in 2005 that the Ainu finally gained recognition from parliament as indigenous people with a \"distinct language, religion and culture\".\n\nWhile wandering through the snowy, slippery streets of Akan, I hear the sound of Ainu music coming from the small concert hall. The infectious tribal sounds of the tonkori, a plucked string instrument, and the mukkuri, a jaw harp, drift through the icy air. I can also decipher spirited voices imitating animal cries, bird songs and insect sounds. It sounds magical, distinctive and ethereal; it fits perfectly with my last evening in this snowed-in, remote corner of remarkable Hokkaido.\n\nGetting there\n\nANA flies from London to Tokyo Haneda, with return fares starting from £580 (economy class) £1,397 (business class); and £2,094 (business class). ANA offers daily flights from Tokyo Haneda to Kushiro, with return fares starting from £140. , from where there are daily flights to Kushiro in Hokkaido.\n\nAmpersand Travel can arrange self-drive trips or guided tours through Hokkaido throughout the year.\n\nJournalist Debbie Pappyn and photographer David De Vleeschauwer venture tirelessly to the most beautiful corners of the world.

Moscow, in sixth place, is one of the highest climbers, rising from 16th place last year. A weekend break costs £199.64 in the Russian capital.\n\nThe Post Office assessed 36 cities across Europe for its survey, calculating the cost of 12 key expenditures including entry to a top museum and art gallery, a three-course evening meal and two nights accommodation in a three-star hotel.\n\nAmsterdam was ranked the most expensive destination, followed by Oslo and Reykjavik.\n\n\"The exchange rate is definitely a factor to consider before booking a break,\" said Post Office Travel Money's Andrew Brown. \"Sterling has strengthened against several European currencies, which means even more expensive cities like Stockholm and Reykjavik are cheaper than a year ago.\n\n\"However, tourists looking for a bargain break should consider cities in Eastern Europe, especially those in Poland or the Baltic States.\"\n\nThe Post Office found that Riga, the Latvian capital, offered the cheapest accommodation, with two nights costing just £62, while Athens, the Greek capital, boasts the cheapest meals for two with wine at just £37.11, followed by Warsaw (£42.50).\n\nWhen it comes to culture, visits to a leading museum, gallery or heritage attraction costs the least in Vilnius, where travellers would pay just £4.53 for the three. Amsterdam had the dearest attractions, with the trio of tickets adding up to £46.61. Rome was the second most expensive, at £46.16.\n\nCloser to home, prices in London, the 25th most expensive break according to the Post Office, had fallen by 5.8 per cent, but still added up to £351.\n\nAnyone plotting a visit to Krakow can expect to find Rynek Glowny, Europe's largest medieval city square, as well as Wawel Hill and the Royal Castle, where Poland's most treasured work of art, Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine, is on display. The former-concentration camp of Auschwitz is not far from the city.",

                "title": "A brazen scooter gang targets BBC cameras along the route of the university boat race",
                "body": "As thefts go, a gang of scooter thieves could not have been more brazen. Armed with an angle grinder they calmly halted London's rush hour traffic and in broad daylight set about stealing BBC cameras fixed to bridges to film the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race.\n\nOn at least two occasions the gang roamed the route of the race targeting £100,000 television cameras attached to scaffolding and trained on the River Thames.\n\nThey first struck on Putney Bridge just after 5pm on Thursday, minutes after the Oxford and Cambridge crews had rehearsed the start of the race on the river below. The gang fled empty-handed when challenged by an off duty policeman and a crew from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.\n\nThe thieves then drove to Barnes Bridge where they outnumbered BBC security staff and cut down a BBC camera fixed to scaffolding. The gang fled and remains at large.\n\nRowena Chowdrey, a professional photographer who took photographs of the thieves on Putney Bridge, said she was astounded by how brazen they were.\n\n\"They were very intimidating because they were dressed all in black and had black balaclavas underneath their helmets. All you could see was their eyes,\" she said.\n\n\"They were big guys and very confident. It was the fact that they had the audacity to do this in the sunshine and in the middle of London's rush hour.\"\n\nMs Chowdrey had been photographing the flotilla of more than 10 boats on a practice run for today's race when she heard the screeching engines and brakes of the motorbikes.\n\n\"They did a recce first. I heard the revving of motorbikes behind me. They then disappeared. I thought they were just kids messing around. But, they were in fact checking out the camera near the lamppost.\n\n\"A few minutes later they were back. There were about five guys on three scooters, two of them on pillion. I could hear the angle grinder.\n\n\"A few of them had stopped traffic so they could get away easily. Meanwhile two others in the gang were literally hanging off Putney Bridge trying to get to the camera.\n\n\"They were challenged by two men whom I learned later were off-duty policemen. One of them technically broke the group up and stopped them using the angle grinder.\"\n\nMiss Chowdrey added: \"There were about 60 or 70 witnesses. There were people looking from a bus the thieves had stopped. Others filmed them on their mobile phones from their cars. Everyone was very scared and stayed in their vehicles. We didn't know if they had knives.\"\n\nThe RNLI on the river had spotted the thieves and turned it sirens and lights on to ward them off.\n\nA spokeswoman for the RNLI said: \"The umpire spotted a man interfering with a BBC camera on Putney Bridge. As the inshore lifeboat was only a few hundred yards away, it made for the location.\n\n\"They produced an angle grinder and attempted to cut through the scaffolding pole supporting the BBC camera.\n\n\"The RNLI boat went directly underneath the activity and lit up the sirens and blue lights.\"\n\nThe scooter gang drove off towards Barnes Bridge where they managed to remove a BBC camera.\n\nMore than five million people watch the annual 4.2 mile university boat race live on BBC television. The BBC is currently celebrating 80 years of coverage of the event. They use 30 cameras to film the race, one of the most challenging live broadcast the BBC faces each year.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said: \"We always ensure there is adequate security in place to protect our staff and equipment.

                "title": "Meet 'Godzilla': 6'10\" James Letten, the tallest man ever to row in the Boat Race",
                "body": "Years ago, as they watched their boy compete in swimming races and football matches, the parents of James Letten would often receive a tap on the shoulder. It would be the mother or father of one of the other kids, and they would have a question. \"They would ask my parents for birth certificates,\" Letten says. \"Or proof of identity.\"\n\nThe reason for the unusual requests was that young James was big. Very big. So big, in fact, that these onlookers simply could not believe what they were seeing. \"I was just massive,\" he says. \"Absolutely massive.\"\n\nTo put a figure on it, Letten was more than six feet tall by the time he was 11. He developed early, and just kept growing. Now, at the age of 24, he stands at a skyscraping 6ft 10in, and is the tallest man to ever compete in the Boat Race, in which Oxford and Cambridge meet this weekend for the 164th time.\n\nSaturday's duel on the Thames will be Letten's second in Cambridge colours. He hopes it will be his first victory but knows that, whatever the result, the attention will inevitably be drawn to his ginger hair and mountainous frame.\n\n\"It's something you live with,\" he says. \"In an odd way it is an interesting conversation starter because I always have something to talk about. Maybe it made life a little bit more difficult when I was younger but looking back, I think it has shaped my character.\n\n\"When you walk into a room and everyone looks at you, when all eyes are on you, it forces you to present yourself in a very positive way. I think it has actually had quite a positive effect on how I have grown up. You can't be anonymous.\"\n\nIt was clearly more difficult for the young Letten, growing up in Chicago, to find so many positives in his stature. He speaks of \"awkward childhood experiences\", and mentions how his nickname in school yearbooks was \"Godzilla\".\n\nAnd then there are the practical difficulties. More than a decade has passed since he was able to walk into a shop and buy a normal pair of shoes for his size 15 feet, and all of his clothes have to be bought online. \"There are not a lot of interesting styles for clothes that size,\" he says.\n\nFinding a bed can be equally tricky. Upon moving to Cambridge last year, he requested an extra long version but even that was too small. \"For the most part it's like a game of Tetris. You have to sleep diagonally, bring your legs in.\"\n\nWith a mother who stands at 6ft 2in, brothers who are all 6ft 6in or above and uncles who are 6ft 7in, it is evident that height runs in the Letten family. These are powerful genes, and they have provided him with the \"raw potential\" to thrive at various sports.\n\nChief among them was volleyball, and Letten spent much of his formative years dreaming of becoming a volleyball player before college choices and injuries forced him to pivot towards a different path at the age of 18.\n\nThat summer, before heading to college in Philadelphia, he watched The Social Network, a film based on the creation of Facebook. It featured a rowing scene set at Henley Royal Regatta, and Letten's interest was piqued. \"I figured I might as well try something new.\"\n\nNaturally, he picked it up quickly. Six years later, he now hopes that his ability, combined with everything he has learned under chief coach Steve Trapmore at Cambridge -- \"as close to a professional sports team as I have ever been a part of\" -- can carry him to the 2020 Olympics.\n\nWith his deep voice and thick American accent, Letten, who is reading classics, is quick to reject accusations that the Boat Race has been tarnished by the recruitment of too many foreign imports with minimal interest in academia.\n\n\"We are actively told not to discuss rowing in the application process,\" he says. \"We have had people who are extremely qualified candidates but they have couched their personal statements, interviews and references in rowing. The university takes issue with that. They want to protect the idea of Cambridge academia.\"\n\nThe balance between rowing and studying is \"50-50\" for most of the team, Letten adds, even if it may be \"51-49\" in favour of rowing for him. \"Colleges won't want to support rowing if we come in and disrupt things.\"\n\nEveryone at Cambridge is looking for a disruption of Oxford's form on the water, though. Oxford have won four of the past five men's races, and are just two behind in the overall standings, which Cambridge lead 82-80.\n\nFor Letten, his second appearance in the race will be markedly different from his first, and not just because of the added impetus provided by the imminent departure of Trapmore, who is leaving after eight years to join the GB Olympic Rowing programme.\n\n\"It's quite easy to get wrapped up in the spectacle of it all,\" says Letten, looking down from the clouds. \"I enjoyed that last year, but it is very much a business this time around.\"",

The hotel has a private beach, accessed by shaded steps over the road tunnel or an underground passage, which is in fact a sand-filled lido. On the patch of 'real' beach, a water-sports jetty offers ringo and the like, plus there's a independent scuba school; the water here is clean, with abundant sea-life (including a cuttlefish who scooted away from this writer, leaving only an ink-cloud).

But it's light and bright and the rooms which extend out the back have traveller's charm enough to intrigue curious kids. If you don't want to pay for a separate room, there's the possibility of adding beds to mum and dad's room - or, better yet, of booking a two-bedroom suite which guarantees everyone some privacy. There's plenty of outdoor space for reading or games - and a first-rate private pool beyond. All that, and the sea is but moments away. Few other St Tropez hotels are such a short walk from a beach - and the plage de la Bouillabaisse is one of the resort's best.

You need to go for the special Family package (\"Séjour en Famille\"). Well, you do if you're two parents with two kids up to the age of 12. If the youngsters sleep in mum and dad's room - on sofa beds but with proper mattresses - they stay free. If under six, breakfast is free, too; it's half price from six to 12 years old. And then there's free use of the heated indoor pool, gym and other fitness stuff - for the bairns. The pool is a particularly treat, overseen - as it is - by the bar. Thus older, wiser folk might sip their whisky while keeping an eye on the kids tiring themselves out in the pool. At other times, there are board games available at reception, and smaller games for their bedroom. The staff are maybe the most warmly welcoming of any big hotel on the Côte-d'Azur.

                "body": "In the mid-Nineties, Jim Carrey was one of the most famous actors in the world. Years on the stand-up circuit as an impressionist led him to television fame, and by 1994 he was the elastic-faced funnyman in blockbuster comedies Ace Ventura, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber.\n\nRecent years have been less kind to Canada's most amusing export: his last major release was Dumb and Dumber To in 2014, and was recently released from years of embittered legal wrangling with the parents of his late ex-girlfriend.\n\nBut perhaps we are overlooking Carrey's talents. While the star has been absent from our screens, he has been prolifically undertaking another pursuit: satirical art.\n\nCarrey has been creating and posting caricatures of political figures including Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan and Roy Moore, as well as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nWhat's remarkable about Carrey's creations is the speed with which he produces them: much like a newspaper cartoonist, he reacts to that day's events with a gaudy depiction of his opinions of them. For instance, shortly Russian election results were announced Carrey posted this:\n\nIf you liked my last cartoon you may also enjoy...\n\n\"THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST WING AND PUTIN'S FLYING MONKEYS\" pic.twitter.com/slBG7j1s8d -- Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey)\n\nMarch 19, 2018\n\nShortly before that, the actor shared a particularly unflattering portrait of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He was roundly condemned for mocking Huckabee's religion:\n\nThis is the portrait of a so-called Christian whose only purpose in life is to lie for the wicked. Monstrous! pic.twitter.com/MeYLTy1pqb -- Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey)\n\nMarch 17, 2018\n\nAnd one of Carrey's less scorn-filled offerings was made on the same day that Stephen Hawking died:\n\nCheers to you Stephen Hawking, the greatest mental athlete of our time. You are all that is! See you around, buddy! ;^) pic.twitter.com/LEqYnFn2rW -- Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey)\n\nMarch 14, 2018\n\nCarrey's recent work has also focussed on the victims of high school shootings and gun regulation:\n\nOh say, can't you see?! pic.twitter.com/SFAgo4MkgS -- Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey)\n\nFebruary 25, 2018\n\nGreat news! The President's answer to school shootings is to arm the glee club! ;^P pic.twitter.com/spSnwTo4Hz -- Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey)\n\nFebruary 23, 2018\n\nWhile current affairs have provided Carrey with ripe inspiration, art isn't a recent fad for the actor. Rather, he embraced painting seven years ago, and even put on an exhibition of his work in Las Vegas last year.\n\nSpeaking about his new-found passion to W magazine in 2017, Carrey said that he now practices art daily: \"There's not a day that goes by that I'm not covered in paint or something from doing sculptures.\"\n\n\"It's all about that for me now -- being completely involved, heart, mind, and soul. Sometimes it's art, sometimes it's performance, and sometimes it's just talking to someone.\"",

The semblance of India's first deputy prime minister, political and social leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, will stand at 182 metres tall - almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nImages of the early stages of construction show the statue's pedestal and base being laid as well as the installation of the central support pillars made from tons of cement and recycled iron. The structure is due to be completed in October this year.\n\nCosting £226.9million to build, the statue has been subject to much controversy. The cost of the memorial and alleged political motives behind it brought strong criticism from leading commentators.\n\nMohan Gurumurthy of the Centre for Policy Alternatives told the Telegraph in 2013 that Sardar Patel himself would have objected to money being spent in this way.\n\nThe Statue of Unity website has defended its project, claiming: \"As a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the statue will not only remind every individual of our great nation's freedom struggle but will also inspire the people of our country to inculcate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's visionary ideologies of unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance... a fully functional, purpose-serving tribute that will spur all round socio-economic development.\"\n\nThe statue will be set on a river island close to the Narmada Dam and connected by a bridge to an amusement park, 3-star hotel and garden in Sardar Patel's honour.\n\nIt is hoped the Statue of Unity will help bring revenue from tourism to the area, with a viewing gallery planned 150 metres of the way up the structure, offering panoramic views of the dam and surrounding landscape.",

                "body": "Labour MPs have demanded an answer from Jeremy Corbyn over his Facebook comments appearing to support an 'antisemitic' mural.\n\nThe mural, which depicts businessmen and bankers counting money, was painted on a property near Brick Lane in London's East End.\n\nIt was painted on private property, but removed after complaints from residents.\n\nWhen it was announced the artwork, by Kalen Ockerman, was to be removed, the Labour leader questioned this decision in a Facebook group.\n\nMr Corbyn wrote at the time, in 2012: \"Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Labour leader told The Telegraph that he has changed his view, and believes it should have been removed.\n\nI asked the Leader's Office for an explanation about this Facebook post first thing this morning. I'm still waiting for a response. pic.twitter.com/DL8ynBtES4 -- Luciana Berger (@lucianaberger)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nThey explained: \"In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. However, the mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed.\"\n\nMember of Parliament Luciana Berger said she had waited all day for an answer from the Leader's Office, but none had yet come.\n\nShe tweeted: \"I asked the Leader's Office for an explanation about this Facebook post first thing this morning. I'm still waiting for a response.\"\n\nIan Austin, Labour MP for Dudley, agreed, writing: \"Luciana won't be alone. I think lots of Labour members will want an explanation for this.\"\n\nWes Streeting, MP for Ilford, also asked for answers. He said: \"Luciana is not alone in asking for an explanation.\"\n\nThe piece of art, Freedom for Humanity, was criticised at the time by Lutfur Rahman, who was the mayor of Tower Hamlets.\n\nHe said \"the images of the bankers perpetuate antisemitic propaganda about conspiratorial Jewish domination of financial and political institutions\".\n\nI asked the Labour Party for a response on November 6, 2015, and I'm still waiting, too...https://t.co/yrgkJWonZe https://t.co/vTntqkXbpk -- Marcus Dysch (@MarcusDysch)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nBefore it was removed, Conservative councillor Peter Golds told the East London Advertiser he was \"horrified\" at the mural.\n\nHe said: \"It bears a similarity to anti-Semitic propaganda in pre-war Germany.\n\n\"As well as the anti Jewish overtones, there is even the quasi Masonic and dollar bill aspect to encourage conspiracy theory.\n\n\"The fact it has appeared over Yom Kippur and the Jewish New Year gives added menace. This is absolutely appalling.\"\n\nTower Hamlets Inter-Faith Forum also criticised the painting at the time.\n\nIts chairman, The Rev Alan Green, Church of England Area Dean and Rector of St John on Bethnal Green, said: \"This mural uses images that have for centuries been used to incite hatred and persecution against Jewish communities. There is no place for such incitement against any community in this borough.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn's office has been contacted for comment.",

                "title": "Volvo XC40: comfort and joy",
                "body": "Given my position within the Telegraph's Lifestyle section, I've become familiar with Scandinavian trends such as hygge and lykke. But a new one on me is lagom. It's a Swedish term to describe a concept of living broadly encompassing a taste for the good things in life, but not too much; a bit of luxury but not ostentation, if you like.\n\nVolvo has applied the concept of lagom to the launch of its XC40, which it thinks suits its new small SUV perfectly.\n\nRather than a traditional car launch, during which a bunch of testosterone-fuelled junior road-testers attempt to drive the wheels off a new model while the, er, more experienced hacks such as I take a more measured approach to assessing it, Volvo laid on a lifestyle launch centred on either food, fitness or grooming - all with a liberal smattering of lagom, naturally.\n\nI'm not a slob but it's fair to say that I'm not the world's most sartorially elegant fellow, so I plumped for the grooming option. Talking of sartorial, this element was overseen by the dapper Teo van den Broeke, Style Director for GQ.\n\nSo it was into one of 20 or so XC40s lined up outside to drive to the first assignment. As with its larger XC60 and XC90 siblings, the XC40 is good-looking in a discreet yet handsome way. First impressions are good, with plenty of space and a solidity that we expect from the Swedes.\n\nOur base was just outside the M25 to the north of London, so the trip to Alexandra Wood Tailoring in Bishops Stortford involved a lengthy run on Britain's most hated motorway, then up the M11.\n\nFortunately it was early on a Saturday, so the traffic was relatively light and gave me a chance to wind the car up to motorway cruising speed then maintain it for mile after mile - something I haven't been able to do for years.\n\nIt instantly showed the XC40 to be a fine cruiser, with a comfortable ride, even more comfortable seats and very little road noise filtering into the cabin. It was particularly impressive even on some of the M25's notoriously \"washboard\" concrete sections.\n\nAlexandra Wood is a purveyor of exquisite, bespoke and quintessentially English tailoring, based in Bishops Stortford and with an outlet in trendy Shoreditch, London. Alexandra and Teo were on hand to demonstrate how to pack a bag for a three-day trip. I'm one of those people who stuffs things in (and around the edges), so it's enlightening to see how careful planning - not to mention a selection of immaculate clothes - alters your perception of how to pack.\n\nI usually suffer from crumpled shirt and suit syndrome when attending events such as the recent Geneva motor show, so I was delighted to learn of an item called a shirt shuttle, which protects a freshly ironed shirt while it's in the case, as well as the necessity to use a proper suit hanger during travel.\n\nI was particularly drawn to an Alexandra Wood travel suit, a light, crease-resistant two-piece, so called because you can scrunch and crease it and it the fabric doesn't look second-hand.\n\nThen it was time for a good look around the car. Although it's compact, the XC40 is still far from small, meaning plenty of interior space, including in the rear. As usual with Volvos, the seats are excellent, with a good range of adjustment.\n\nThe overall impression is of thoughtful design - it's clear that many people have spent a lot of time thinking about how owners actually use their cars and designing the interior accordingly.\n\nWitness thoughtful touches such as a small removable rubbish bin and a hook on the glovebox lid on which you can hang a bag of shopping. Also, Volvo's designers raised the front speakers from low in the doors to near the window line, meaning that the door bins can be much larger to more easily accommodate the detritus of our daily lives.\n\nThe boot is equally practical, with a folding floor that allows you to divide the load space, along with a selection of hooks and retaining straps so your shopping won't spill all over the load area.\n\nThen it was back in the car to negotiate a plethora of Hertfordshire back lanes en route to the Henry Moore Foundation Studio & Gardens. This journey showed that although it's undoubtedly capable, the XC40 isn't a car that you'd take for a back-road spin just for the hell of it.\n\nIn the spirit of lagom, Swedish photographer Lowe H Seger provided a guided tour of the 20 or so impressive Moore bronzes in the sizeable gardens, along with an insight into how a professional views such monoliths when photographing them in varying light.\n\nThe Henry Moore Foundation studios and gardens re-open on March 30 after the winter - highly recommended.\n\nThen it was back to base on a mixture of back lanes and A-roads for some grooming tips in the Sequoia Spa at The Grove Hotel near Watford.\n\nMy hands are all manky from too many years spent tinkering with grubby old cars and bicycles, so I was looking forward to a manicure. I'm not sure what happened, but rather than a manicure we were offered male grooming tips. In a room full of nervous-looking blokes, I volunteered to go first.\n\nI have had pretty much the same haircut for years so hints and tips to vary my look were welcome. Even more useful was the discovery of facial scrub. For the uninitiated it's a gel that aids removal of the oldest, dead skin cells on your skin. Apply sparingly, rub it in gently and, voila, your skin feels rejuvenated and takes on a lustrous quality.\n\nIt really does work and my wife was astounded by the vitality of my skin when I returned home.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of care, the XC40 is the first Volvo to be offered with a rental plan called Care By Volvo. A flat fee covers rental of the car, plus insurance, servicing and roadside assistance, plus other benefits. It's currently limited to dealers within the M25 and, at more than £600 per month it's far from cheap, although Volvo believes that the peace of mind and convenience it offers will be attractive.\n\nThat remains to be seen, but what I can say right now is that the rave reviews the XC40 has had so far - not least it being voted the 2018 European Car of the Year - are well deserved.\n\nAfter driving it on a representative mix of motorways, A- and B-roads, its blend of overall comfort and practicality shine through. So much so that I've asked Volvo if the Telegraph can run one as a long-term test car.\n\nIt's not cheap - but then quality never is.\n\nFor tips and advice, visit our Advice section, or sign up to our newsletter here\n\nA-Z Car Finder",

                "title": "5 key pieces of legislation affecting UK SMEs in 2018",
                "body": "As a small or medium business, it can be hard to keep track of all of the changes in legislation that will affect your company. However, there are a huge number of vital updates to note this year, and plenty that needs to be done to prepare. Here are five of the most important 1 GDPR\n\nFor most companies, wide-ranging changes to data protection legislation will be one of the biggest issues. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), comes into force on 25 May this year, and requires every business to take a long look at the current way they deal with the data they hold.\n\nThe legislation is extensive, but one of the most important aspects of it is the fact that you will need \"opt-in consent\" for everyone whose data you hold on your mailing lists. This means that most businesses will need to contact everyone whose data they hold to ensure that they are operating correctly, especially since the potential fine for breaching the regulations is 4pc of turnover.\n\nThere's more information on the GDPR available at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) at ico.org.uk.\n\n2 National Living Wage increase\n\nThe National Living Wage will rise to £7.83 from £7.50 on 1 April 2018 as announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget. That's a 4.4pc increase. The National Minimum Wage, which applies at varying rates to employees aged under 25, will also rise. For those aged between 21 to 24 the new rate is between £7.05 and £7.38 per hour. For those aged between 18 and 20 the rate is between £5.60 and £5.90 per hour. For those aged between 16 and 17, the rate will rise from £4.05 to £4.20 per hour. The rate paid to apprentices will rise from £3.50 to £3.70 per hour.\n\nSmall and medium-sized business who do not pay the correct wage to their workers can be fined and named and shamed by the Government, and must pay any arrears immediately.[1]\n\n3 Publication of gender pay reports\n\nFrom 6 April 2018, it will become mandatory to publish information about the differences in pay between men and women. The information that you must publish is based on the gap between the two on 5 April 2017, and it is believed that that the Equality and Human Rights Commission could investigate employers who fail to publish the data.\n\nHowever, the smallest businesses are exempt from this, with those with fewer than 250 employees not required to publish data - although some business experts believe that this is still best practice.\n\nThe Government Equalities Office and ACAS have produced joint guidance on pay gap reporting and the Gender Pay Gap reporting website can be found here: gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk.\n\n4 Prohibition on corporate directors\n\nWhile the implementation date on this piece of legislation is not yet clear, the Government is due to ban corporate directors - company directors that are corporate entities - this year. Directors will need to be \"natural people\". Once the law comes into effect there will be a transitional period, expected to be a year, after which corporate directors will be banned.\n\n5 Brexit (EU Withdrawal Bill)\n\nHere's the big one. The EU Withdrawal Bill, which aims to ensure that EU law no longer applies in the UK after the UK leaves the European Union, will be scrutinised throughout 2018, together with its subordinate legislation. Almost every aspect of this legislation, from the free movement of people to tariffs and debates around the Customs Union, is likely to affect the way small businesses operate. Although the law doesn't come into force until March 2019, it is vital for small and medium-sized businesses to understand the implications and to get planning early.\n\nKia Fleet\n\nFor help with your fleet needs or to book a test drive, call the Kia Business Centre on 0800 975 0088\n\n[1] gov.uk/national-minimum-wage/employers-and-the-minimum-wage",

                "body": "Ski Sunday presenter Graham Bell, and ex-Olympic downhill ski racer, knows a great run when he skis one.\n\nThat's why Telegraph Ski and Snowboard asked him to pick stand out runs from around the world and talk us down each one - all the while filming himself navigating them on skis.\n\nFrom much-loved pistes to infamous off-piste routes, Bell selected only the finest runs. So far he's tackled a number of French favourites including the Grand Couloir run in Courchevel and the Face de Bellevarde (La Face) black run in Val d'Isère as well as Austria's steepest piste the Harakiri, the off-piste Valluga run in St Anton and of the most scenic runs in the Alps, the Lagazuoi in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nIn an adventurous twist to his search for the world's best ski runs Graham heads to Alagna, Italy, for a heli skiing trip with his trusty camera for company.\n\nGraham is part of a group of 16 who take a helicopter ride up to the Piramide Vincent peak that rises to 4,215m. It's the highest point in the Monte Rosa ski area, which is made up of the three resorts Alagna, Champoluc and Gressoney.\n\nAfter a short flight the group have a wide open off-piste run all to themselves from the summit, with crystal-clear views of the Italian Alps all around them. \"What a playground,\" says Graham.\n\nOnce he reaches the bottom of the glacier, after following his group down the steep slope, Graham looks back at what the group have just skied.\n\n\"When you get down and you look back at what you've skied and you look at the crevasse field you've come around, it's just one of the best feelings in the world. We've laid our tracks on that mountain,\" says the Ski Sunday presenter, before venturing off through a powder field down through the valley.\n\nSteep, deep and powdery, Graham certainly found it all on this, the latest addition to his search for the world's best ski runs.",

                "title": "World Superbike championship heads to Thailand: what to expect from the Chang International Circuit this weekend",
                "body": "For round two of the 2018 World Superbike championship the series heads to Thailand and the Chang International Circuit. And for the first time in 77 races the series has a new leader.\n\nItalian Marco Melandri on the Aruba.it Racing Ducati proudly sits atop the championship after taking both race wins at Phillip Island. Reigning world champion Jonathan Rea had, prior to the season opener, led the championship for 76 consecutive races on his way to three consecutive world championships.\n\nIf Melandri can claim victory in race one it will be only the second time in his WSBK career that he will have taken three consecutive race wins. The first and only time was in 2012 where the Italian took victory in race two at Aragon and followed that up by a double win in Brno. Last year Melandri took fourth and third in Chang and, following his performance in Australia last month, will be looking to improve on that this time around.\n\nThis is the fourth year the championship has visited Chang and to date the Kawasaki Racing Team have a 100% win record at the Thai circuit. Rea has the upper hand with four wins to team mate Sykes' two. Kawasaki has also claimed 11 of the 18 podiums over the three years of competition in Thailand.\n\nBased on results in Australia where in recent years Rea and Kawasaki had been similarly dominant 2018 could be the year that Kawasaki's vice-like grip at Chang could be broken. Chang is the only track in the calendar where Ducati are yet to win in WSBK, but both Melandri and team mate Chaz Davies have secured podiums at the circuit.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed from recent seasons after round one is the dominance of British riders. The five British riders competing the 2018 season are all in the top seven, with Melandri 1st, and Javier Fores 4th the only non Brits in the top seven. Dutchman Michael van der Mark riding for Yamaha completes the top eight, which is currently the preserve of four manufacturers, with each of Ducati, Kawasaki, Yamaha and Honda occupying two places each. One of those Hondas is ridden by former British Superbike champion Leon Camier who for 2018 has moved from the often unreliable MV Agusta. If the Honda is competitive as a package Camier should be challenging at the front and hopefully challenging the previous dominance of Kawasaki and Ducati.\n\nThe Supersport class got underway with echoes of the 2017 season. Last year Lucas Mahias took full advantage of the absence of the then reigning champion Kenan Sofuoglu taking the race win and a 25 point advantage over the hot favourite for the championship. Though Sofuoglu came back strongly, at one point claiming five wins from six races, Mahias held on to take the championship.\n\nThis year, while Sofuoglu raced in Phillip Island, he could only manage 13th place, leaving him 22 points behind Mahaias heading to Thailand. It has since been announced that Sofuoglu will miss round two. The Turkish rider originally injured himself at Magny Cours last season and a 150mph crash in free practice three in Australia has highlighted a bone fragility that needs more time to recover. The five-time Supersport champion has decided to sit out round two to allow the bone in question more time to heal, as well as to reduce the risk of further damage.\n\nMahias meantime will be keen to continue where he left off in Australia, knowing how strong a competitor a fully fit Sofuoglu can be. Last year he failed to take further advantage of Sofuoglu's absence, crashing out of the race in Thailand. This year Mahias has the confidence that being champion brings and will be well aware that any points will be better than no points. Whatever the outcome come Sunday should a fully fit Sofuoglu return for round three in Spain it could very much still be a case of game on such is his prowess on the 600cc machines.\n\nAfter round one it is very much Yamaha who are in the ascendancy taking the first four places in the championship. In fifth place is British rider Luke Stapleford on the triple cylinder Triumph, with another triple cylinder machine in sixth, this time of Italian origins with Raffael de Rosa on the MV Agusta.\n\nNo one has been dominant so far in Thailand with three riders and three different manufacturers taking the wins to date. Reigning champion Mahias is yet to win at the circuit, as is Sofuoglu. The latter will have to wait at least one more year if he is to change that particular statistic.",

Mr Javid also found that \"the proposal would not represent sustainable development\".\n\nDeveloper Banks Mining had said the mine would be a source of three million tonnes of coal over 10 years that would otherwise be imported, creating 100 jobs and generating £87m for the local area.\n\nBut campaigners argued that the mine would cause \"massive environmental destruction right next to one of Northumberland's most beautiful and loved beaches\".\n\nThe mine, which would have been the largest opencast site in the UK, was approved by Northumberland County Council and backed by planning inspector John Woolcock, before being called in for review by the secretary of state last year.\n\nWhile acknowledging the environmental impact of the mine, the inspector had noted \"a 'window' currently exists to use Highthorn coal\" before coal plants are phased out in 2025 under the Government's existing energy policy.\n\nGavin Styles, managing director at Banks, slammed the Government's \"absolutely perverse decision\".\n\n\"The UK is still dependant on coal for a number of purposes, and at a time of great economic uncertainty, we firmly believe that the importance of securing investment in North East England, creating dozens of high quality local jobs, and opening up opportunities for regional suppliers to win substantial contracts could not be any clearer,\" he added.\n\nMr Styles suggested Banks would appeal the ruling, saying it \"owed\" its staff and customers \"to not just leave things here\".\n\nLynne Gargett, spokeswoman for the Save Druridge campaign, said: \"The Save Druridge team is pleased that the secretary of state has understood the immense impact coal has had on climate change and also on communities which have had to live with opencast mines on their doorsteps.\"",

                "body": "Whether it's European touring or a city nipper, Kia has the perfect model for the road your company's on\n\nIt's not often that a range of cars can accurately boast the cliche of \"something for everyone\", but the new Kia range is extensive enough to make an impression on every fleet manager.\n\nKia Motors has a reputation for exceptional and innovative car design and this is reflected in the company's recent triple win at the prestigious 2018 iF Design Awards, one of the world's most celebrated design competitions. The recent wins bring Kia's total to 15.\n\nKia is able to support most business mobility needs with its ever-expanding range of vehicles, from urban runarounds and crossovers to executive cars and electrified powertrains, moving the brand from challenger to established fixture for the people buying Britain's next generation of company cars.\n\nEpic journeys\n\nThe latest entry to the competitive saloon space is the Kia Stinger Gran Turismo, styled by Gregory Guillaume at Kia's European design centre in Frankfurt and taking its inspiration from 1970s grand tourers. The Stinger melds classic gran turismo design with a spacious interior. Ideal for carrying four adults on a weighty continental road trip, the Stinger boasts high safety levels underpinned by an advanced high-strength steel body.\n\nWith an extensive range of advanced driver assistance systems available, the Stinger also comes with electronic stability control as standard. Its other standard safety features include autonomous emergency braking, a speed limit information function and hill-start assist control.\n\nThe Stinger's innovative driver attention warning system is designed to combat distracted driving by monitoring inputs from both vehicle and the driver and sounding a warning chime if it detects a dip in driver concentration; ideal for arduous journeys. The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) has also praised the Stinger for its passenger compartments remaining stable in the event of a collision, with high levels of protection for passengers of different statures in every seat.\n\nThe Stinger is available in rear-wheel drive and a range of petrol and diesel engines, and the high-performance 3.3-litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine makes it the most powerful and fastest-accelerating Kia ever.\n\nCompact driving\n\nThe Stonic compact crossover (also designed in Frankfurt) is Kia's most customisable car to date, with a huge choice of two-tone paint combinations and interior colours. Its sleek body is inspired by the company's larger SUVs and the car has already proved so popular it looks set to become one of Kia's best-sellers.\n\nAmong the Stonic's wide range of high-tech features is vehicle stability management, electronic stability control and six standard-fit airbags. Efficiency is key in the Stonic and it is powered by a range of Kia's most advanced petrol and diesel engines, all paired as standard with manual transmission.\n\nThe Stonic comes with Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ as standard, and if you opt for the First Edition Stonic, you'll get an in-built satnav too.\n\nCity driving\n\nA good city vehicle should be able to offer cheap motoring and reliability. Kia launched the Picanto in 2004 and has sold more than a million of them worldwide. Since then it's gone through a range of enhancements, making it a high performer on the agility, accuracy and reliability necessary for urban driving. But city driving doesn't always equal solo living and the third-generation Picanto (Kia's smallest European car but still one of the most spacious in its class) can easily accommodate family life with five doors and five seats.\n\nAs with all Kia models, these all come with the brand's unique seven-year/100,000 mile warranty.\n\nKia Fleet\n\nFor help with your fleet needs or to book a test drive, call the Kia Business Centre on 0800 975 0088",

                "title": "Alice Roberts - Oxford's youngest crew member mastering the balance between Boat Race training and student life",
                "body": "For a glimpse into the sacrifices made by the students competing in this weekend's Boat Race, look no further than the unusual life of Oxford's Alice Roberts, the 19-year-old undergraduate who wakes up for training as her housemates are stumbling home from nights out.\n\nRoberts is no foreign import to these shores, no hired gun drafted by the university to do little more than eat, sleep and win the Boat Race.\n\nShe is a bona fide student, the youngest in her crew, who spends much of her year trying to juggle six hours of daily training with working towards a degree in philosophy and linguistics. She is even from Oxford itself, having grown up there and attended a state school in the city.\n\nRather than joining her fellow undergrads on the traditional cycle of hangovers and deadlines, Roberts studies and rows, rows and studies. It is a balancing act, and it can be a battle.\n\n\"Sometimes you get the balance wrong,\" she says. \"But I'm learning. My housemates don't row, and sometimes I come downstairs and they have just got back in while I go off to train.\n\n\"I don't mind it so much, but there are definitely times when you do miss it, like when you are hanging out at home, sitting on the sofa, and then you look at your watch to see it's half past nine and you really should go to bed.\n\n\"You miss out on relationships, and it's not just when you are rowing. When you are not rowing, you need to be doing the work to catch up.\"\n\nThat commitment, and those sacrifices, are what makes defeat in the Boat Race so much harder to stomach. In her first race last year, Oxford's hopes of winning had sunk within the first few seconds as a dreadful start allowed Cambridge to immediately surge clear before eventually finishing in a record time of 18 minutes and 33 seconds.\n\nIt was \"devastating\", Roberts says. But it was easier for her, knowing she had possibly three more chances to make amends. \"I was very aware it was different for me than for other members of the team,\" she says. \"It's easy for me to look at the bigger picture.\"\n\nThat bigger picture shows that Roberts is the only returning member of last year's crew. It also shows that Cambridge leads the overall standings by 42 victories to Oxford's 30.\n\n\"If I looked back having lost four races, it would be frustrating,\" she says. \"But there is a reason you keep doing it. I don't believe there is anybody who does sport just to win. How can you do it every day if you don't like doing it?\"\n\nThere lies the crux. Yes, it's a harder life than she could be living. More stress, more pressure, less time. But it's a way of life on which a certain breed of person can thrive. \"It's a different kind of intensity, which I like. I am used to it, and I am kind of nervous for it to stop.\"",

                "body": "Expert guide to New York Overview Hotels Attractions Restaurants Free Nightlife\n\nThe best restaurants in New York, from Michelin-starred dining to budget options. By Douglas Rogers, Telegraph Travel's destination expert.\n\nEight million people from every country on Earth live in New York, so the range of culinary experiences is bewildering. The fine-dining scene changes amazingly fast, with new trends and movements springing up all the time.\n\nBest hotels in New York\n\nNew York chefs are always innovating. The artisanal and locavore (local food) movement is all the rage the world over, but what to do in a city of eight-lane traffic and skyscrapers? Easy: grow it on the roof. Richard Farnabe, the executive chef at the Soho Grand, has planted an organic garden on the 17-storey hotel, growing herbs, vegetables, micro greens - and more than 27 varieties of heirloom tomatoes.\n\nWhatever the trends, there are always the classics, and New York does them like no other. Don't miss the oysters at Grand Central Oyster Bar in the basement of the famous train terminal, going strong since 1913; or a Porterhouse steak at the venerable Brooklyn institution Peter Luger (established 1887) - for my money the world's finest steakhouse. Bring cash, though. Steak for two costs $85 (£53) - and they don't take credit cards\n\n£££ Eleven Madison Park\n\nEleven Madison Park was crowned the World's Best Restaurant in April 2017. Enough said. Swiss culinary genius Daniel Humm's soaring space above Madison Square Park is grand enough: skyscraper ceilings, towering tree arrangements, sky-box dining suites. But the endlessly reinvented food is what you come for. The diagram menu that made the space famous has been replaced with a tasting menu dedicated to all local New York farm and sea ingredients: oysters, scallops, lobster, duck, and aged beef. The foie gras terrine with plum and bitter almond is a delight, and the sturgeon presented as take on a New York City bagel is mesmerising. Call months in advance to get a table.\n\nAddress: 11 Madison Ave, 10010\n\nGetting there: N, R, 6 to 23rd St\n\nContact: 001 212 889 0905; elevenmadisonpark.com\n\nOpening times: Fri-Sun, noon-1pm, 5.30pm-10pm; Mon-Thu, 5.30pm-10pm\n\nPrice: tasting menu, $295 lunch and dinner (including gratuity)\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nThe Restaurant at the Mark\n\nFrench chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's fine dining temple located in the fabulously restored Mark Hotel is the ultimate blue chip Manhattan experience: exquisite cuisine combined with high-grade people-watching. At lunch, Upper East Side heiresses with dogs in their purses pick at salads, oysters and foie gras while their town cars idle outside; at dinner, Wall Street tycoons, Madison Avenue millionaires, and upscale auction house aficionados come for perfectly balanced Vongerichten specialities such as a tuna tartare and grilled black sea bass with fennel. The scene in the adjacent pink-lit bar area could have been choreographed by Vogue; take one of the cowhide chairs, sample a signature kumquat mojito, and check out the supermodels.\n\nAddress: 25 E 77th St., 10075\n\nGetting there: 6 to 77th St\n\nContact: 001 212 606 3030; themarkrestaurantnyc.com\n\nOpening times: daily, 7am-1am\n\nPrice: lunch around $55, dinner around $75\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nThe 21 Club\n\nOpened in 1922 as a Greenwich Village gin mill before moving to its current Midtown location in 1929, at the height of Prohibition, \"21\", as it is affectionately known, is the last of the original speakeasies. Don't let the \"Club\" in its name put you off. It's open to all - although there's always a uniformed doorman on duty, you can't get in with jeans or trainers, and they only recently allowed men to dine without ties. New chef Sylvain Delpique has helped attract a foodie crowd with standout dishes such as his surprisingly tasty Chicken Paillard, and a fancy cocktail menu. Try the classic Southside, made with Tanqueray gin and muddled mint.\n\nAddress: 21 W 52nd St, 10019\n\nGetting there: B, D, F, M to 47th-50th Sts-Rockefeller Center; E, M to Fifth Ave-53rd St\n\nContact: 001 212 582 7200; 21club.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Fri, noon-2.30pm, 5.30pm-10.30pm; Sat, noon-2.30pm, 5.30pm-11pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $65, dinner around $80\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nPeter Luger\n\nArguably the greatest steakhouse in America, this amber-lit, wood-panelled gem in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has been going strong since 1887. Frequently name-checked in The Sopranos, it has been owned by the Forman family of Brooklyn since 1950, and is famous for its rare, juicy porterhouse steaks (the owners always get the first choice of cuts from New York's meat markets). Take a seat in the brass-chandeliered front room, next to politicians, mobsters, celebrities and sports stars, and let one of the famously surly Teutonic waiters tell you what you're having. Sides to go for are creamed spinach and a plate of tomatoes. Warning: it's pricey, and bring cash: they do not accept credit cards.\n\nAddress: 178 Broadway, Brooklyn, 11211\n\nGetting there: J, M, Z to Marcy Ave\n\nContact: 001 718 387 7400; peterluger.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Thu, 11.45am-9.45pm; Fri, Sat, 11.45am-10.45pm; Sun, 12.45pm-9.45pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $60, dinner around $80\n\nPayment type: credit cards not accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nSardi's\n\nEvery tourist loves a Broadway show, and this venerable eatery just off the Great White Way is an essential pre- or post-theatre dinner stop. It's been going strong since 1927, and its red banquettes, ornate lampshades and hundreds of caricatures of showbiz celebrities - Liza Minnelli, Joan Rivers, Jackie Gleason - adorning the walls are as much part of the scene as the jumbo crab cakes. The Tony Awards - theatre's Oscars - were dreamed up in a booth there, and every night there's a special discounted menu for Screen Actors Guild (Equity) cardholders. Jumbo crab cakes aside, the Shrimp Sardi - sautéed shrimp in garlic sauce - is legendary.\n\nAddress: 234 W 44th St, 10036\n\nGetting there: 1, 2, 3, 7, N, Q, R, S to Times Square-42nd St\n\nContact: 001 212 221 8440; sardis.com\n\nOpening times: Tue-Sat, 11.30am-11.30pm; Sun, noon-7pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $40, dinner around $60\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nOld Homestead Steakhouse\n\nThe nondescript brick façade and kitschy sculpture of a cow outside claiming \"We're the King of Beef\" may not promise much, but this historic beef temple is carnivore heaven. This is the oldest steakhouse in the city: it was established by Harry Sherry in 1868 and is still run by the same family. Its clubby, carpeted interior consists of three narrow, wood-panelled, gold-leaf-ceilinged dining rooms set over two floors, and overseen by burly waiters with meat-slab forearms. Of the dozen cuts on offer, sliced at your table, opt for the Gotham rib steak, prime porterhouse or center cut sirloin, seasoned with their own herbs and spices. King of beef indeed. The epic wine menu is as heavy as a T-bone.\n\nAddress: 56 Ninth Ave, 10011\n\nGetting there: A, C, E to 14th St; L to Sixth Ave\n\nContact: 001 212 242 9040; theoldhomesteadsteakhouse.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Thu, noon-10.30pm; Fri, noon-11.30pm; Sat, 1pm-11.30pm; Sun 1pm-9.30pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $65, dinner around $75\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nBalthazar\n\nIn the heart of SoHo, this timeless French/American bistro from British-born restaurateur Keith McNally is a modern classic. Enter through the curtained doorway and you find yourself in a hallowed, gold-lit space of high ceilings, mirrored walls and tiled floors. Diners tuck into oysters and steak frites at cosy wood tables or red-leather booths in the main dining area, while designer-clad women and suited men wait their turn sipping cocktails and champagne at the elegant marble counter to the right. The raw bar is superb, as is the wine list, and don't be surprised to bump into Uma Thurman or Gwyneth Paltrow checking their make up in the bathroom. They do a great breakfast, and have a bakery, too, if you want to avoid the table hustle and grab a Parisian-quality baguette to go. Book well in advance.\n\nAddress: 80 Spring St, 10012\n\nGetting there: N, R to Prince St; 6 to Spring St; B, D, F, M to Broadway-Lafayette St\n\nContact: 001 212 965 1414; balthazarny.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Thu, 7.30am-midnight; Fri, 7.30am-1am; Sat, 8am-4pm, 6pm-1am; Sun, 8am-4pm, 5.30pm-midnight\n\nPrice: lunch around $45, dinner around $60\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nKeens Steakhouse\n\nWhen the actress Lillie Langtry was refused access to what was then a gentlemen's-only Midtown chophouse in 1905, she sued and won. She immediately marched in, feather boa around her neck, and ordered a mutton chop - a huge chunk of mature roast lamb that's still the most popular dish. Established in 1885, and now serving women, Keens is just as famous for its memorabilia as its meat. A warren of Victorian rooms with creaking wood floors and glowing chandeliers, it houses the world's largest clay pipe collection - 50,000 of them in the upstairs Pipe Room - and you can ask a waiter to show you the playbill Abraham Lincoln was carrying when he was assassinated.\n\nAddress: 72 W 36th St, 10018\n\nGetting there: B, D, F, M, N, Q, R to 34th St-Herald Square\n\nContact: 001 212 947 3636; keens.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Fri, 11.45am-10.30pm; Sat, 5pm-10.30pm; Sun, 5pm-9.30pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $65, dinner around $85\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nCasa Lever\n\nLa Dolce Vita is transplanted to Manhattan at this Milanese eatery in the modernist 1951 Lever House building that once housed the power-lunch hotspot of that name. The sumptuous interior - red carpets, curved wood counters, Warhol originals on the walls - is the theatrical prelude to a menu of Italian classics and Japanese-inspired fish and sushi. Dishes to look out for include the sea urchin linguine and the veal Milanese. If you're feeling really decadent, ask for the truffle menu. In summer, the rich and beautiful recline on couches on the al fresco terrace sipping prosecco and signature cocktails from head bartender Rebecca Applebaum. Fellini would approve.\n\nAddress: 390 Park Ave, 10022\n\nGetting there: E, M to Lexington Ave-53rd St\n\nContact: 001 212 888 2700; casalever.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Fri, 7am-11pm; Sat, 5.30pm-11pm\n\nPrice: Two-course lunch menu, $51, dinner around $85\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nPer Se\n\nMaster chef Thomas Keller's Per Se is the urban interpretation of his world-famous French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley, California. It's a hushed, earth-toned, glass-walled space on the restaurant concourse of the Time Warner Center, with stunning views of Central Park. Diners choose from one of two nine-course tasting menus - the Chef's Menu or the Tasting of Vegetables. All ingredients are locally sourced or foraged, and while the menus change all the time, typical dishes include: oysters and pearls (pearls being white sturgeon caviar); Hudson Valley moulard duck foie gras; and risotto with Castelmagno cheese and shaved white truffles. While you're there, ask for a tour of the state-of-the-art, $30 million kitchen. They also offer a five course tasting menu ($195) on a first-come-first-serve basis in the smaller Salon section of the restaurant.\n\nAddress: 10 Columbus Circus, 10019\n\nGetting there: 1, A, B, C, D to 59th St-Columbus Circle\n\nContact: 001 212 823 9335; perseny.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Thu, 5.30pm-10pm; Fri-Sun, 11.30am-1.30pm, 5.30pm-10pm\n\nPrice: Chef's nine-course tasting menu, $325\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nMomofuku Ko\n\nProbably the most celebrated of cult chef David Chang's New York empire, the two Michelin star Momofuku Ko is also the hardest to get into, even after it moved from its original bento box-sized East Village locale to this slightly larger space nearby. Those lucky enough to get in, join a handful of other disciples sampling a 12- to 15-course tasting menu containing typically obscure Chang creations such as egg yolk with caviar, varieties of pork belly, assorted kimchee and noodle creations, and possibly a deep-fried apple pie. It's a mad culinary journey. If you don't get in, they offer walk-ins at the six-seat bar with a five- or six-course tasting menu available. Alternatively, go to the equally impressive Momofuku Noodle Bar or Momofuku Ssäm Bar nearby.\n\nAddress: 8 Extra Pl, 10003\n\nGetting there: F, M to 2nd Ave; BDFM to Broadway-Lafayette; 6 to Bleecker St\n\nContact: momofuku.com\n\nOpening times: Tue-Thu, 5.30pm-midnight; Fri, Sat,12.30pm-3.30pm, 5.30pm-midnight; Sun, 12.30pm-3.30pm; Mon, closed\n\nPrice: lunch and dinner tasting menu $195\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nAtera\n\nIs it food or is it art? This is one of the most enduring of the spate of uber-fashionable tiny tasting rooms that appeared a few years back. Helmed by superstar Matthew Lightner, he earned his chops under foraging master René Redzepi at Noma in Copenhagen, and under Andoni Aduriz at Mugaritz in Spain, and their influence is evident here. The 18-course tasting menu (the only option) changes all the time, but expect to sample amazingly presented creations such as lobster roll on a meringue, fried lichen served on a box of pebbles, cured swordfish belly delivered on a piece of tree bark, and charred leek with hay ash and sheep's milk yogurt. Save room for a lump of chocolate 'charcoal' frozen in liquid nitrogen. What more to say?\n\nAddress: 77 Worth St, 10013\n\nGetting there: 1 to Franklin St\n\nContact: 001 212 226 1444; ateranyc.com\n\nOpening times: Tue-Sat, 6pm-9.30pm\n\nPrice: 18-course tasting menu, $275 for lunch and dinner (including service)\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: essential\n\nRao's\n\nPossibly the most exclusive restaurant in America, Rao's is a century-old, basement hole in the wall in a seedy part of East Harlem owned for decades by the late Frankie Pellegrino Sr: opera singer, Sopranos actor, and descendent of Charles Rao, who opened Rao's in 1896. The restaurant's dozen tables and booths are \"owned\" by the customers, and you can only eat here at their invitation. You can, however, come in unannounced, sip a martini at the bar, and watch Yankee stars, politicians, celebrities, admirals and mob bosses dine together on exquisite old-country Italian fare (there's no set menu) while wise guys stand guard outside. It's one of the few places on earth where you can put a Tony Bennett CD on the jukebox - and watch the great man eat.

But the only restaurant this side of the East River with three stars is the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare. An intimate, 18-seat corner kitchen in ultra-trendy Boreum Hill, on the edge of downtown, chef Cesar Ramirez does an intricate, 15 to 20-course prix-fixe tasting menu ($330pp plus tax but including service) that changes daily and is only determined hours before seating. That said, it usually includes Japanese-influenced delights prepared with French flair, such as needlefish with marinated onions, or Kumamoto oyster with crème fraîche.

The sleek space - lush floral arrangements; white banquettes; sumptuous wood-paneled lounge - has a la carte, prix-fixe, and tasting menu options, and while the pasta is sublime, the fish and meat entrees raise the bar. New York food critic Steve Cuozzo described the Astice (butter poached Nova Scotia Lobster with rutabaga and Château-Chalon sauce) as \"the greatest dish in the world\", and you can't go wrong with the Vitello - a succulent Amish veal chop.

That's how I am about Olmsted's Radish Top Gazpacho. A textural symphony from the pop of the trout roe to the silkiness of the soup and the crunch of the radishes, grown just meters away in the 900-square-metre back garden. I could rhapsodize about most the dishes on chef-owner Greg Baxtrom's seasonal menu: imaginative, experimental, and beautifully delivered. Hailing from the kitchens of Per Se, Atera, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Baxtrom partnered with horticulturist Ian Rotham to create this neighborhood spot with a dedicated sustainable ethos. Make sure to take a tour of the vegetable beds, admire the bird coop and fish pond, and take a pinch of the herbs garnishing the cocktail in your hand.\n\nAddress: 659 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238\n\nGetting there: B, Q at Seventh Ave.; 2, 3 at Grand Army Plaza\n\nContact: (718) 552-2610; olmstednyc.com\n\nOpening times: daily, 5pm-10.30pm\n\nPrice: main course, $15-$24\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: recommended\n\nTomoe Sushi\n\nThe lines outside this West Village gem say it all: don't be surprised to wait 30 minutes for a table. But what it lacks in swift seating, it makes up for with the freshest fish in town. The menu features everything from giant clams and tuna belly to succulent sea urchin, and a 16-piece plate of assorted sashimi perfectly prepared by Tomoe himself.

Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, of cult Italian-American restaurant Frankies Spuntino fame, outdid themselves with this Carroll Gardens opening: a gorgeous, wood-panelled, 19th-century-styled, German-American eatery. The Wagyu steak frites with Bernaise sauce and the hand-crafted sausages are out of this world, while bar staff in bow ties and braces mix cocktails such as the Applejack Sazerac or the Rubens Cooler.

Joining that list is the affordable and welcoming Locanda Verde - the latest Tribeca restaurant of area resident Robert De Niro, within his ultra-trendy Greenwich Hotel. While brunches are an exquisite selection of pastries, lemon ricotta pancakes and variations on Eggs Benedict, lunches and dinners are chef and co-owner Andrew Carmellini's soulful, modern riffs on Italian country cooking. Specialties include squid ink linguini with Manila clams, pomegranate-glazed duck with Tuscan kale and pancetta, and a fire-roasted garlic chicken (which is enough for two).\n\nAddress: 377 Greenwich St, 10013\n\nGetting there: 1 to Franklin St\n\nContact: 001 212 925 3797; locandaverdenyc.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Fri, 7am-11am, 11.30am-3pm, 5.30pm-11pm; Sat, Sun, 8am-3pm, 5.30pm-11pm\n\nPrice: brunch around $25, lunch around $40, dinner around $55\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: recommended\n\nMario's Restaurant\n\nForget Little Italy. Arthur Avenue, a narrow street south of the Bronx Zoo, lined with scores of Italian bakeries, restaurants, coffee bars and fine-food delis - note the rabbits hanging in the windows - is the real deal. There are several classic restaurants but Mario's, established in 1919, is the godfather. Indeed, Mario Puzo mentioned it in The Godfather, and Francis Ford Coppola asked if he could shoot a scene here. (The owners turned him down as it would have disturbed their regulars.) The style is over the top: romanesque white columns, paintings of the Old Country and waiters in tuxes humming Dean Martin tunes. The kitchen is famous for its Neapolitan fare, including stuffed clams and more varieties of veal than should be legal. Try the veal scaloppine alla pizzaiola with a glass of barolo.\n\nAddress: 2342 Arthur Ave, 10458\n\nGetting there: 4, B, D to Fordham Rd\n\nContact: 001 718 584 1100; mariosrestarthurave.com\n\nOpening times: Tue-Thu, Sun, noon-9.30pm; Fri, Sat, noon-10.30pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $25, dinner around $50\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: recommended\n\nFerdinando's Focacceria\n\nEnter this bare-brick hole in the wall in the Red Hook neighbourhood, and you're transported back to the time when the gangster Joey Gallo and his brothers ruled these streets. Martin Scorsese shot a scene from The Departed here - but the owners don't like to crow. Indeed, the service is so slow you almost feel as if you've stumbled into a Sicilian grandmother's kitchen only to find she's taking a nap upstairs. Founded in 1904 - it has a vintage awning and gorgeous white-tile floors - they serve small Sicilian plates such as the vastedda sandwich (spleen layered with ricotta and grated cheese) and pasta con sarde - sardines with wild fennel, pignoli, raisin and spices.\n\nAddress: 151 Union St, Brooklyn, 11231\n\nGetting there: F, G to Carroll St\n\nContact: 001 718 855 1545\n\nOpening times: Mon-Thu, 11am-8pm; Fri, Sat, 11am-10pm\n\nPrice: lunch around $15, dinner around $30\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: not necessary\n\nMarlow & Sons\n\nWilliamsburg went from Ground Zero of gritty New York hipsterdom to a stylish drinking and dining destination to rival Soho, and Marlow & Sons is one of its best spots. Down the road from world famous steakhouse Peter Luger, it's a jewel-box-sized, wood-panelled space with communal tables, that is coffee shop by day, restaurant and raw bar by night. The seasonal, locally-influenced menu offers small-plate appetizers (cheeses, charcuterie, oysters etc) and usually only three main courses, but there are always great daily specials such as wild leek and goat cheese tart. Of the regular main courses, opt for their signature Brick Chicken, cooked pizza-style in the restaurant's brick oven. Ask about Marlow Goods, the restaurant's trendy line of leather apparel.\n\nAddress: 81 Broadway, Brooklyn, 11249\n\nGetting there: L to Bedford Ave; J, M, Z to Marcy Ave\n\nContact: 001 718 384 1441; marlowandsons.com\n\nOpening times: daily, 8am-4pm, 5pm-midnight\n\nPrice: lunch around $20, dinner around $50\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: not possible\n\nFragole\n\nThis intimate, bare-brick Italian in Carroll Gardens is not as voguish as nearby Prime Meats or Battersby, but its homemade pastas, fresh sauces and Argentine wine list still draw in the foodie crowd. Classics such as fettucine al funghi and penne with broccoli rabe feature on the main menu. But opt for the daily specials written up on a chalk board, such as lobster ravioli with spicy pink sauce, gnocchi with pesto and mozzarella, and the mini buffalo ricotta cannoli for dessert. Al Capone was married in the church down the street from here and John Gotti hung out in the neighbourhood, and while Fragole is no standard 'red-sauce' mob joint, the venerable Italians who still live around here would approve of its authenticity.\n\nAddress: 394 Court St, Brooklyn, 11231\n\nGetting there: F, G to Carroll St\n\nContact: 001 718 522 7133; fragoleny.com\n\nOpening times: Mon, 4pm-11pm; Tue, Wed, Sun, noon-11pm; Fri, Sat, noon-11.30pm\n\nPrice: lunch and dinner around $35\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: recommended\n\nLucien\n\nPopular, Parisian-style brasserie in the East Village, a favourite haunt of writer Christopher Hitchens in his New York days. Following the mould of more celebrated brasseries Balthazar and Odeon, it has the décor and atmosphere down pat: black-and-white floor tiles, distressed mirrors, white-clothed wood tables, and intimate low light. A good-looking crowd of regulars come for French classics such as moules, escargots and steak frites, but I recommend opening with the house paté (duck liver with cornichons and pink pepper) followed by the grilled South Carolina quail, stuffed with wild mushroom risotto. There's an excellent wine list, and no shortage of cocktail bars nearby for a post-dinner drink. This is a good place for a romantic date.\n\nAddress: 14 First Ave, 10009\n\nGetting there: F to Second Ave\n\nContact: 001 212 260 6481; luciennyc.com\n\nOpening times: daily, 10am-2am\n\nPrice: lunch and dinner around $45\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: recommended\n\nLupa Osteria Romana\n\nSuperstar chef-restaurateur Mario Batali's loud, crowded Roman trattoria is a reminder of what Little Italy could be like. With its bare-brick walls, hanging salamis, and exposed meat-slicing machines, it's country-kitchen hip without being haughty. Regulars like to gather at the bar and order from an extensive all-Italian wine list, and salivate at the plates being ferried to tables. Meat and vegetarian antipasti are followed in traditional Roman style by a selection of 'primi' - the Bavette Cacio & Pepe is perfectly executed - while main courses have American twists on Italian fare.\n\nAddress: 170 Thompson St, 10012\n\nGetting there: B, D, F, M to Broadway-Lafayette St\n\nContact: 001 212 982 5089; luparestaurant.com\n\nOpening times: lunch and dinner around $55\n\nPrice: Mon-Thu, Sun, 11.30am-11pm; Fri, Sat, 11.30am-midnight\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: recommended\n\nGrand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant\n\nThere's more to the 1913 Beaux-Arts masterpiece that is Grand Central Terminal than catching trains. The lower concourse is an underground food world of some 20 restaurants and delis, the highlight being this glorious museum piece of a restaurant, as old as the station itself. Join commuters and dedicated oyster fans at the long bar counter or at spacious booths, and order from dozens of varieties of oysters, mussels and clams flown in fresh from across the US. Venerable staff know their Prince Edward Islands from their Maine oysters, and the vaulted and tiled Rafael Guastavino-designed ceiling sparkles overhead with hundreds of incandescent light bulbs as you eat.

Sit back, chat to your neighbours over closely-set candlelit tables, and pretend you've been invited into someone's home.

Designed to resemble a wine cellar, the space includes a main dining room with a communal seat charcuterie bar where you can sample cured meats and terrines (try the cognac-infused country pâté), while the main menu features modish twists on bistro classics such as moules and steak frites. The dish to go for is the Frenchie Burger - Black Angus beef, pork belly confit, roasted tomato and raclette cheese. Superb.

Except, that is, for Sripraphai. Pronounced \"see-pra-pie\", the cult eatery of enterprising former electric store owner Sripraphai Tipmanee is easily the best Thai restaurant in the city, so popular that a second location has opened in Williston Park. Food wise, pad Thai and Panang curries are all very well, but branch out with Mrs. Tipmanee's more exotic creations: the sea trout with Thai eggplant or crispy catfish salad.

Officially it's the standby for those unable to get in the tiny Michelin starred Contra next-door, but helmed by the same two hot young chefs - Fabián von Hauske and Jeremiah Stone - Wildair feels like its less cerebral little sister with just as much flair and originality. You sit at high communal tables giving it the air of a family meal, casually discussing each dish as it comes - the perfect steak tartare with smoked cheddar or the littlegem lettuce with ground pistachios. The bread and butter in itself is remarkable.

When the hot honey-buttered chips came out at the end, I almost insisted we ordered a second so I didn't have to share.

The duck carnitas is the star of the show; served family style, get your fingers dirty constructing your own tacos from the juicy duck meat and salsa.

Order the lobster lo mein if it's on the specials, as well as the pork-stuffed Shanghai soup dumplings - these qualify as a secret menu item, which they'll bring out upon request. Everything comes with their own soy sauce, made to order and dispensed on tap.

You're given a ticket at the entrance and line up at glass counters to order basic deli fare: pickles, knockwurst, salami, frankfurters, potato salad and all manner of juicy pastrami, Reubens and beef brisket sandwiches.

Hoi Thawt - cripsy crêpe filled with mussels, egg, garlic and chives. Try the second outlet at 137 Rivington Street in the Lower East Side if Brooklyn is too much of a haul. They do not take reservations.\n\nAddress: 117 Columbia St, 11231\n\nGetting there: F, G to Bergen St\n\nContact: 001 718 923 9322; pokpokny.com\n\nOpening times: Mon-Fri, 5.30pm-10pm; Sat, Sun, noon-10pm\n\nPrice: lunch and dinner around $35\n\nPayment type: credit cards accepted\n\nReservations: not possible\n\nHometown Bar-B-Que\n\nThis is exactly how I like my barbecue; Texas-style, served by the weight and slapped unceremoniously on a silver tray to be eaten with my hands. Hometown is made up of two adjoining barns decorated with American flags and vintage beer signs, with a small stage where bluegrass bands play in the evening. Grab a craft beer from the bar so you can drink while you queue for the meat counter, and then seat yourself. The brisket is perfectly succulent with a caramelized \"bark\"; the beef ribs are mighty, falling away from the bone; and the Korean sticky ribs are the surprise hit. In short, eat everything. Twice. Located in the quirky enclave of Red Hook, with its cobbled streets and artist studios, there's no subway here, but it's worth the journey.

                "body": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he is ready to win silverware with Los Angeles Galaxy after a full-page advert in Friday's LA Times confirmed his move to the MLS club from Manchester United.\n\nThe advert, in which Ibrahimovic was pictured in the white Galaxy kit, carried a message from the 36-year-old saying \"Dear Los Angeles, you're welcome\".\n\nHe becomes the latest high-profile player to move to the MLS in the latter part of his career -- following the likes of David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Thierry Henry and Frank Lampard.\n\nFormer England captain Beckham won the MLS Cup twice after joining Galaxy in 2007 and became an iconic figure for the growth of the game in a country hooked on more traditional American sports like NFL and baseball.\n\nIbrahimovic, while in the latter stages of a glittering career, could have a similar impact.\n\nThe Swede left United on Thursday when the Premier League club agreed to terminate his contract and said the move is about writing another chapter in a storied career in which he won league titles in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and France.\n\n\"After being in Europe, winning 33 trophies, playing in the best teams in the world, playing with the best players in the world, I wanted to come to the U.S. and play my game there,\" Ibrahimovic said in an interview in the LA Times.\n\n\"I wanted people to enjoy my game there and to win. And I chose the Galaxy to do that.\n\nDan Beckerman, the president of entertainment giant AEG, the Galaxy's parent organisation, said Ibrahimovic would become one of the biggest stars in the Hollywood city.\n\n\"He's giving up a lot to come here,\" Beckerman told the LA Times. He's made it clear he's coming here to win championships. It's not about the money.\n\n\"L.A. is a place for stars, and he's going to be one of the brightest stars that's ever played in this market. In any sport.\"\n\nIbrahimovic, who scored 62 goals in 116 games for Sweden and played for some of Europe's biggest clubs including Inter Milan, AC Milan, Barcelona and Paris St Germain, is reported to have accepted $3 million over two season to play for Galaxy, a huge wage cut from his United salary.\n\nIbrahimovic justified United's outlay when he scored 28 times in all competitions in his first season at Old Trafford.\n\nBut after a knee injury sustained nearly a year ago he has managed only seven appearances this season.\n\nDespite that Ibrahimovic, who boasts nearly five million Twitter followers and owns a clothing brand, said he was ready for action.\n\n\"I am ready to go now,\" Ibrahimovic said. \"First of all, I'm there to play football. I'm not there for something else. My first objective is to play football and do what I'm good at.\n\n\"I'm excited to come over and to get the experience with the Galaxy and to explore how the football is there. I want to be part of it and make it better.\"\n\nIbrahimovic's first action for Galaxy could even come against city rivals Los Angeles Football Club on March 31.",

He went across Europe last summer (he's big in Bergen); his vaguely Asiatic features (a source of confusion even among his family) were greeted with admiration in Hong Kong (\"I knew they fancied me because they were lowering their pollution masks to flirt\"); South Africa has just received him; they whooped him up in New York; and after his extensive UK tour, he'll get to go back to Australia.",

Her first sitcom, The Maria Bamford Show, was recorded alone in her bedroom. Her 2012 live show was filmed in front of an audience of two - her parents.",

                "body": "Megan Brownrigg wins £250 for her account of a how a bumpy bus ride led to a snapshot of rush-hour hospitality.\n\nAsking everyone to sing on a speeding bus in a foreign land was always going to be ambitious. But this was Sri Lanka, where smiles and spontaneity seemed standard currency. A song should be a piece of cake.\n\nWe weren't meant to be on a bus. We were meant to be driving a tuk-tuk - 932 miles (1,500km) in 10 days. Considering that we'd not yet made it to a checkpoint before nightfall, getting on a bus heading in the wrong direction was an indulgent detour. But as part of our expedition we'd been challenged to learn a local song. Our taskmaster would spot shortcutting a mile off, so it was time to get creative and pool resources: five idiots in two tuk-tuks.\n\n\"How about catching a bus and asking them to teach us a song?\" Dave suggested. On an isolated road, with no idea if there were any buses, we agreed; it was a great idea. Twenty minutes later, three of us were surf-balancing in the corridor of a hurtling bus; the other two were in the tuk-tuks in hot pursuit.\n\nWe quickly clocked we weren't the crowd-pleasers we'd envisaged. If our fellow passengers did understand our broken Sinhalese, they were doing a stellar job of pretending they didn't. One woman spoke English, but her wary eyes persuaded a silent pact between us; I couldn't expose her bilingual talents. Commuting, as it turns out, is a universally miserable activity.\n\nAs we alighted the bus in the next town, Sri Lanka's magic returned in the shape of an afternoon monsoon. Glints of light danced across umbrellas and saris, in a tango of jewel colours. Through raindrops, we watched an afternoon rush forced into slow-motion.\n\nBut when we returned to our trusty tuk-tuks, my heart sank. My unzipped rucksack revealed the nook where my camera should be. The white noise of panic soon overwhelmed the beauty of the shower.\n\nRyan insisted we retrace our steps. We scoured the spot of our flying departure. Nothing. We trundled back to town in silence as I tried not to be just a sulky traveller who'd lost a gadget.\n\nRyan's voice splintered my sulk; \"You're joking? We'll be five minutes.\" He wasn't talking to me. He was on the phone. In the sweaty, euphoric confusion that followed, I met the Sri Lankan man who took the trouble to return something to a stranger in rush-hour. He would take nothing but a selfie as a thank you.\n\nBy jumping on a bus and flinging a camera out of a tuk-tuk, we gained a true snapshot of Sri Lanka; the people who live there.\n\nA while later, we pulled up by a roadside shack. In the jungle dusk, the girls generously paused to teach us a local song. We sang it aloud in our tuk-tuk, long into the night after we'd lost our map.\n\nSome things are better not found.\n\nHow to enter the next round of Just Back\n\nEmail your entry in 500 words (with the text in the body of the email), to justback@telegraph.co.uk.

                "title": "How to ski as a family of five",
                "body": "Taking the family to the slopes is hard enough when you have one or two children. Even ski fanatics the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have only managed one long ski weekend as a family since becoming parents. But add a third child into the mix - as the Royal couple will this April - and a whole new set of organisational and monetary headaches comes in to play.\n\nFrom holiday packages and hotel rooms to lift-pass deals and high-speed quad chairlifts, family ski holidays are set up for foursomes. As a mother of three myself, my own bugbear is that few hotels cater for families with more than two children.\n\nEven self-driving is more challenging - when a family room sleeps only four and you're forced to pay for two rooms, that cheap overnight stop to break the journey to the Alps may seem an unjustifiable expense.\n\nWe've been known to stretch the truth by saying our youngest is still in a cot (he's seven), then smuggling him in with an airbed after check-in.\n\nQuite apart from the cost, which admittedly may not be an issue for William and Kate, there's the ski resort logistics. Two of you, three littlies - the maths doesn't work on the hill. Who goes solo on a two-person chairlift? Who copes alone on the T-bar? Who has to toboggan by themselves?\n\nAfter two ski holidays à cinq, we've done the research. Here's what you need to know if you're taking the tribe.\n\n1. Book early\n\nFamily and connecting rooms in hotels and chalets are like gold dust during peak ski season; if you don't want to split the family in two, booking early is essential for five. Not only will you bag the biggest rooms, you'll usually get the best price. Flights are nearly always cheapest when booked early too. Sign up for alerts from airlines to get the heads up as soon as flights are released.\n\n2. Consider self-catering\n\nIf that third child is threatening to price your family out of the ski holiday market, self-catering could bring the price back within reach. My quick search in March for three-star packages to snow-sure Tignes in France during Christmas week 2018 (including flights and transfers) found a self-catering option at around £400 cheaper per person than a catered chalet, and £500 cheaper than a hotel.\n\nPlan meals ahead to save stress when you get there. If driving, fill every space with breakfast essentials, on-mountain snacks and frozen meals for the first few hectic days (do not refreeze!).\n\n3. Or, let chalet hosts take the strain\n\nIf the thought of cooking and cleaning on top of everything else threatens to tip you over the edge, do it the Royal way and let someone else look after you - the cost may be well worth it for the added holiday freedom. Staying in a chalet or chalet-hotel makes for a lower-hassle holiday and, if you go with family specialists such as Esprit, Mark Warner or Ski Famille, there's access to child care.\n\nEven simple services like collecting the youngest from lessons helps when you can't be in three places at once. Cooked breakfast, afternoon tea and a three-course dinner is included, often with unlimited wine. Inclusive packages also help you budget by taking the guesswork out of how much you'll spend in resort.\n\n4. Train them well\n\nParental juggling on the ski hill is similar to the juggling families of five have to do at theme parks, where one adult/one child ratios are the norm. Manage expectations when skiing together, making sure children understand they need to be patient, stay together and allow for differing abilities. Pick wide cruisy pistes, ensuring the kids are in front of you so you can keep an eye on everyone. For après activities it's best to steer clear of those that need a one adult to one child ratio, like tobogganing, unless you can rope in an extra adult.\n\n5. Take grandparents/friends/the nanny\n\nWhen there are two of you and three of them, evening up the numbers by holidaying with another adult - or two - helps lighten the load, especially if (like the Royals) the kids are all under five, or the whole family are ski virgins.\n\n6. Make sure you sit together on flights\n\nDon't assume that because you're a family, you'll be seated together. If the plane is busy - and let's face it they usually are in school holidays - it's quite possible you'll be split up. And when your family isn't divisible by two, it's even more likely someone could end up alone. Minimise the risk by checking in early or pay extra to pre-book seats.\n\n7. Make the most of the baggage allowance\n\nYou may have a lot of kit to take with three kids - but you don't have to pay for an extra bag. On most airlines, children from age two have the same free checked baggage and hand baggage allowance as adults, so forget cute mini backpacks for the littlies and make the most of it.\n\n8. Get in the car\n\nOnce your youngest hits two, you'll be paying full whack on flights for five. If you're willing to take the pain of a long drive to the mountains, you'll not only save some cash but can stuff the car full of kid-paraphernalia and food as well as your ski kit.\n\n9. Get the best hotel deal\n\nOnce your youngest is out of a cot, most hotels won't allow more than four in a room, no matter how willing you are to sleep the youngest top-to-toe or bring an airbed. Forking out for two rooms can double the cost of an overnight stay and, unless kids are older, most families don't want to be split up anyway.\n\nSmuggling one of them in isn't great for sticking to fire regulations, and big family rooms are rare, so the best bet is to look for discounts on the second room. At Sofitel most suites only accommodate a family of four but some hotels in the chain knock 50 per cent off a second room over a weekend. Novotel offers 50 per cent off a second room for two children.\n\n10. Factor in lift passes\n\nLift passes for five make up a large chunk of the cost of a winter holiday, so choosing a resort with good deals can save a lot. Children may ski free up to ages four or five - but in some resorts (such as Zermatt in Switzerland) it's up to age nine. Most places offer reduced rates for younger children, but some also give discounts for teenagers.\n\nFamily passes are most common in France and can work out well, with everyone in the group, including adults, paying a child rate. They're usually based on a family of four, so for a family of five, always plan to get a separate pass for the youngest, as it will be the cheapest.\n\nThe family pass offered in the Trois Vallées resorts in France (Courchevel, Méribel, Val Thorens) is a notable exception - it's available to families with up to seven children.\n\nThe International Ski Federation (FIS) keeps track of global prices for lift passes. Compare prices and discounts at snowkidz.com.\n\n11. Get ahead with mountain navigation\n\nLeading the gang around the mountain is stressful if you don't know where you're going. Lessons will help the children even they're competent skiers or snowboarders, and leave you free to spend a morning doing reconnaissance, getting to know which pistes you'll enjoy together and which lifts to avoid for example, without the worry of keeping tabs on everyone as you do it.\n\n12. Ask for help on lifts\n\nWhen you need an extra pair of hands, to watch out for your child on a chairlift for example, don't be afraid ask other adults - most people don't mind in our experience. On drag and chairlifts shout ahead to the lift operators when approaching the top as they will slow down the lift to avoid mishaps.\n\n13. Holiday with another family\n\nGoing as a group (especially if your friends have fewer children) will bring costs down, keep the kids entertained and mean there are extra adults to help. Airport transfers may work out cheaper and easier when you travel in a large party, their children may be able to share bedrooms with yours, and you're likely to get a better per person price on accommodation.\n\n14. Shave £££ off the food bill\n\nMountain restaurants can be expensive when there are two of you, let alone five. Thankfully, more resorts now have easy access picnic rooms where you can eat your own food (which could be shop- or chalet-bought sandwiches if you don't want to make them) without shivering on the slopes. Swanky Le Lodge in Val d'Isère, France, which opened for the 2016/17 ski season, up the mountain near the nursery slopes is a good example of how resorts are upping their game.\n\nAlternatively, heading down to the resort village for lunch can shave a little off the lunch bill, as can venturing out of resort central to cheaper eateries in the evening. Order savvy and choose dishes to share tapas-style to avoid wasting food.",

                "title": "Bank of England policymaker adds to speculation of rate rise in May",
                "body": "A top policymaker at the Bank of England has added to speculation of an interest rate hike in May in a speech on Friday.\n\nGertjan Vlieghe, widely regarded as a dovish member of the central bank's rate setting committee, told an audience of businesses in Birmingham that he believed a tighter labour market would soon require a rate rise.\n\nMr Vlieghe said that unemployment was still an important measure of likely wage inflation. As such, provided signs carried on suggesting \"that a tight labour market is actually pushing up domestic inflationary pressures\", interest rates would need to be raised.\n\nThe economist made similar signals on rates in a speech given last September ahead of the Bank raising interest rates last November. He compared his reading of present data with that seen before the Autumn rate rise.\n\n\"Since then, the data have shifted further in the direction that warrants a continuation of the removal of monetary stimulus over the forecast period,\" he said. He added that two or three quarter-of-a-percentage point rises over this period were justified based on the current outlook for the economy.\n\nHowever, Mr Vlieghe reaffirmed his cautious approach to rate hikes warning that, as rates were already so low, there was \"less room to respond to downside risk than to upside risk, which means that patience is warranted when tightening policy\".\n\nThe policymaker also analysed recent movements in unemployment levels and wages in his speech. The link between wage growth and unemployment levels referred to by economists as the Philips Curve was still strong, he argued.\n\nReasons to doubt this link in recent years were most likely due high levels of under-employment - when workers are employed but keen to have additional hours - and the public sector pay cap. Employees have been less able to switch to public sector roles, which are restricted to 1pc growth per year, in order to boost their salaries. As a result the case for a private sector pay raise had been harder to make.\n\nThe future outlook for wages was more positive, with many sectors of the economy showing that workers were managing to win raises. If inflation was kept at close to 2pc, and unemployment remained low, workers could expect wage growth of between 3-3.5pc, according to Mr Vlieghe. If productivity were to improve, earnings would also pick up at a greater pace.\n\nRecent minutes from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meeting showed that two policymakers voted to raise rates from 0.5pc to 0.75pc immediately.",

                "title": "Troy Townsend: Black players avoid social media because of racial abuse - they must be given a platform to speak about it",
                "body": "The anti-racism educator Troy Townsend, who stunned Gareth Southgate with a presentation on the racist abuse leading black footballers experience on social media, says that the comments the England manager referred to this week are \"par for the course\".\n\nTownsend, education manager at equality organisation Kick It Out, said it is an open secret many leading black players avoid social media interaction because of the racial abuse, and the comments that he showed Southgate during a presentation at St George's Park were just a small sample of a major problem. Townsend called on the social media companies to do more to regulate users and also said that he hoped black players could come together to speak out about the effect the abuse has on them.\n\nSpeaking in Amsterdam on Thursday at his press conference ahead of the friendly against Holland, Southgate said that English football should get its own house in order before criticising other nations for racism, including World Cup finals hosts Russia. Southgate described the racist responses to Steven Gerrard's Instagram post in December 2015 congratulating the England Under-16s on beating Brazil as \"disgusting\".\n\nTownsend, father of Crystal Palace winger Andros, made his presentation to leading figures at the FA including Southgate, women's senior team manager Phil Neville; technical director Dan Ashworth; Under-17s World Cup-winning coach Steve Cooper and women's coach Mo Marley. Townsend said: \"I included some of the comments in the presentation to show the impact of winning the game but also what the players have to deal with when they are active on social media.\n\n\"In the picture were seven black players and four white players. The comments included, 'Is this the England squad or the Senegal squad?'; 'It looks like Nigeria's team'; 'Everyone else sees four white players, I see seven black players'; 'Seven out of 11 are non-English, what's happening to this country?'; 'Where are the English lads?'\n\n\"These kinds of comments are absolutely par for the course. Everyone keeps asking why are our players not interacting on social media. Because they are being driven away from it. You get the players saying, 'Oh, we don't read the criticism'. But there's a bit of our nature that will always read the comments. One week you've scored a goal and everyone loves you. Next week you have a bad game and say sorry to the fans, and that's often when the negative comments come on the back of it.\"\n\nSouthgate has said he wants his coaches to be aware of the abuse that players are suffering on social media and be able to support and empathise with them. Townsend visits clubs all across the football hierarchy and runs workshops introducing academy boys and professionals to diversity and equality across race, gender and sexuality. He has worked closely with Liverpool before and after their recent trip to Spartak Moscow where Rhian Brewster was racially abused in Uefa Youth League tie.\n\nTownsend says that the problem needs the help of social media companies to regulate. He also thinks it would have an effect if black players were given a platform to speak about the abuse they suffer. \"We need to use the power of the players' voice,\" he said. \"I don't think we use it enough. I know Yaya Toure has spoken up a bit and I have a video of him talking about the impact that abuse had on him. I would love to see a powerful video made by players about the hatred being spouted towards them. Ultimately the power is with the social media companies.\"",

                "body": "Credit Suisse is risking another shareholder backlash after unveiling plans to hike total pay for top bosses including chief executive Tidjane Thiam, despite posting a loss for 2017.\n\nThe Switzerland-based bank, which employs around 5,500 people in London, today proposed boosting pay and potential bonuses for 12 executives by 5.5pc more than a scheme it ditched last year in the face of investor opposition.\n\nOverall pay for the dozen bosses fell 4pc last year to SFR69.9m (£52.3m), while Mr Thiam took home 5pc less at SFR9.7m francs.\n\nCredit Suisse made a SFR983m loss last year. It would have made a profit were it not for a SFR2.7bn one-off hit on US tax reforms.\n\nUnder the new plans the executives stand to earn more in long-term bonuses, if they hit targets such as significantly increasing earnings.\n\nCredit Suisse was forced to hastily ditch its plans to increase executive pay last year after shareholders voiced their opposition.\n\nAhead of this year's AGM, Credit Suisse has met with 27 top investors to try and explain the planned new pay increases in the hope of avoiding a repeat this year.\n\nCredit Suisse argued the proposed changes placed more emphasis on hitting longer term goals - similar to pay structuring at UK banks - and the calculations had been made more transparent for investors.\n\nMr Thiam is under pressure to turn around the bank's fortunes, including from an activist investor - Swiss hedge fund RBR - which took a stake last year and is pressing for a break-up of the bank.\n\nIn 2017 the bank's wealth management business grew strongly, helping offset tough trading at its investment bank.",

                "title": "A gourmet food guide to Malta",
                "body": "You might think of gallant Malta (awarded the George Cross in 1940), historical Malta (remembering the Knights of St John and the Great Siege of 1565), naval Malta (in recognition of the island's deepwater ports), or even Game of Thrones Malta (some of the epic's most memorable scenes were filmed there). But culinary Malta (with a gastronomic capital)? Surely not.\n\nFood may not be the first thing that springs to mind when someone suggests Malta as a holiday destination - but for a tiny island measuring just over 16 miles (26km) long and 14 miles (23km) wide, with a population of around 450,000, Malta packs a weighty culinary punch. Its name probably derives from the Greek word \"meli\", meaning honey (to this day, one of the island's treasured products).\n\nBecause of its strategic position at the marine crossroads of the Mediterranean, its cuisine has been moulded by waves of colonisers, among them Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians and the Knights of St John, as well as we British. Walk around the streets of Valletta today, and you can't escape the signs of military struggle - the bastions, battlements, keeps and corbelling that kept invaders out, all built in the island's distinctive honey-cream sandstone.\n\nFrom Auberge de Castille, now the office of the prime minister, to Auberge de Provence in Republic Street and Auberge d'Italie in Merchants Street, the names of the buildings reflect the island's cosmopolitan past. They manage to be both modest and imposing at the same time - and they appear to be in pristine condition, no doubt helped by the fact that Valletta is one of the 2018 European Capitals of Culture.\n\nMalta's culinary culture is an extension of its chequered history. Dishes and ingredients point north, south, east and west. There is pasta from Italy - hardly surprising, given the country's proximity. But then there is also qassatat, a pie that looks like a small, round pastry bomb, with a distinctly Arabic name; and pastizz, a flaky pastry shaped like an almond, which sounds quite Italian. Both, it seems, can be stuffed with ricotta (also Italian) and/or mushed peas that come from... well, who knows?\n\nThe island boasts a fulsome range of sweet as well as savoury pastries, such as qagħaq tal-għasel (honey rings), torta tal-lewz (almond cake), qagħaq tal-ħmira (a soft, sweet bagel-shaped cake), imqaret (a deep-fried, diamond-shaped date pastry) and kannoli tal-irkotta (deep-fried pastry tubes filled with ricotta). Many of these pastries show how profound the Arab influence has been on the cooking of much of the Mediterranean.\n\nSome have a drift of spice in them that harks back to the days when the spice traders would stop off at Malta on their way back to Genoa and Venice. You might expect a shoal of fish dishes, given that Malta is surrounded by the pristine waters of the Med, but fish wasn't favoured by the Knights of St John - except, of course, on Fridays and holy days.\n\nThey preferred meat: kid, lamb, pig and rabbit in particular. In fact, if Malta can be said to have a national dish, it is Maltese rabbit. It comes in two forms, one fried - fenek moqli - and the other braised or stewed - stuffat tal-fenek. As with most Mediterranean dishes, every household and restaurant has its own particular variation on the basic combination of rabbit, tomatoes, onions, garlic and white wine. One version uses marrowfat peas, which presumably points to the recent British influence.\n\nWhile there is plenty of traditional food still to be found, both in restaurants and in Maltese homes, you can't say the Maltese culinary scene is stuck in the past. There are few more dependable signs that a place is on the up than the number of ambitious restaurants opening up. These are some of my favourites.\n\nSeven great Maltese food finds 1. San Niklaw Winery\n\nThis, one of Malta's finest wineries, has no restaurant but teams up with the crew from Rock Salt to serve sophisticated food in the tasting room. The chef at Rock Salt, Tor Holmedal, is Norwegian, and combines a Scandinavian clarity with classic techniques to create modern dishes based on global ingredients.\n\nThere was foie gras mousse on crisp brioche with apple, apple juice and toasted pumpkin seeds; Scottish scallop with pear, dusted with powdered dill and champagne butter sauce studded with salmon eggs; lobster tails and lobster croquettes with cauliflower purée and lobster bisque; and duck breast with Jerusalem artichoke purée, salsify, beetroot and black truffle.\n\nThe winery is owned and run by the Cauchi family. John Cauchi must one of the few paediatric surgeons in the world also making wines, in this case Contrada ta Fanġu (syrah), Despatch (sangiovese), Kappella San Nikola (mourvedre) and Neptunus (vermentino), all of which have serious heft, balance and subtlety.\n\nSan Niklaw Estate, Triq Strejnu, Zejtun (00356 7964 5529; sanniklaw.com). By appointment only.\n\nRock Salt, Telghet San Giljan, St Julian's (00356 2133 6226; shoprocksalt.com).\n\n2. Hammett's at Cugo Gran Macina\n\nHammett's occupies the ground floor of a building used for refitting ships in the 16th century - now a luxurious boutique hotel. The restaurant looks out over the harbour in the fortified town of Senglea. The interior is the model of modern cool and manages to be both smart and relaxed.\n\nIt wasn't fully open when I visited, so the menu - \"fish and chips\" (carpaccio of amberjack with peas, lime mayonnaise and potato puffs); lemon granita; lamb rump with couscous, aubergine, carrot and red wine jus - had some of the hesitancy I'd expect of a kitchen that wasn't at full stretch yet. However, there was enough about the dishes I ate, the fish and chips especially, which suggested that in future the food would be as sophisticated as the interior.\n\nMacina, Triq il-31 ta' Marzu, Senglea (00356 7945 1513; cugogranmalta.com).\n\n3. Risette\n\nThe dining room here is as sleek as a stealth bomber, with slate-grey walls, black-and-white marble flooring, and tables topped with streaked marble. Andrew Borg, the restaurant's chef, had previously been chef/patron of the highly-rated Black Pig restaurant, also in Valletta. His menu shows a fine awareness of contemporary culinary tropes, but brings to them a highly individual sensibility.\n\nAmong the most successful dishes was a classic soft, sexy foie-gras parfait with some rabbit liver, bolstered by Williams pear and a brilliantly effective ravigote sauce (vegetable or meat broth with herbs). Braised spelt with mussels, buttered leeks, smoked haddock and avruga caviar proved to be a rich and surprisingly effective combination. Smoked eel might not be the first thing you'd think of pairing with suckling pig, but with beetroot as a bridge between the two it was subtle and persuasive. Hazelnut millefeuille with milk chocolate ice cream was an absurdly fulsome and enjoyable end.\n\nCasa Ellul, 81 Old Theatre Street, Valletta (00356 2122 4821; risette.com.mt).\n\n4. Panorama\n\nAs the name suggests, the restaurant has a spectacular view over the harbour. The dining room has the \"smooth chic\" feel that's in keeping with the times, and the menu has a similar contemporary sheen aimed at the international traveller - venison tartar; raviolacci (large ravioli stuffed with minced prawn and scallop); porkcheek with apple purée and cranberry-infused jus; and pistachio crème brûlée. There is something seductive about the latter, the rime of caramel giving way to the creamy softness underneath in a dish that blends comfortable memories of home with the waft of somewhere exotic.\n\n267 St Ursula Street, Valletta (00356 7987 7980; panorama.com.mt).\n\n5. Noni\n\nThe restaurant takes its moniker from the nickname of the chef/proprietor, Jonathan Brincat, which is lightly outlined on a board above the door, obscuring the name of the previous occupants - Xmunborg & Sons, bakers and confectioners. This neatly pays homage to Valletta's past, as well as making a statement about its future, and Brincat's cooking has a parallel respect for past and present. It reflects the multiple influences that help make Malta so culturally curious.\n\nDotted around the menu you'll find pasta, risotto, Cantabrian anchovies, preserved lemons, salt-baked beetroot, Israeli couscous and octopus tagine, triple-cooked chips and sticky date pudding, as well as two rabbit dishes and guanciale (cured pork), fried with slow-cooked rabbit loin, roasted vegetables and onion gravy. Noni is distinctly relaxed, and full of raffish delight and Mediterranean charm.\n\n211 Republic Street, Valletta (00356 2122 1441; noni.com.mt).\n\n6. Townhouse No 3\n\nIn Rabat, hard by the exquisite walled town of Mdina, Malcolm Bartolo runs a brilliant operation celebrating everything that is Maltese: a broad bean paste to spread on bread; sparkling cured swordfish in wafer-thin slices with peeled raw prawns, fennel, prawn mayonnaise and edible flowers; plump, silky ravioli filled with mushrooms; succulent pork collar that had been cured in sugar and steamed for eight hours, with a sweetish local sausage.\n\nOur lunch was finished off with beignets as fragile as powder puffs, filled with sweet ricotta flecked with shards of dark chocolate. This was dazzling cooking. Bartolo takes as much care with sourcing his wines as he does his ingredients, with similarly spectacular results.\n\nNo 3 and No 4 Republic Street, Rabat (00356 7900 4123).\n\n7. Ta' Qali Market\n\nTwice a week a farmers' market operates in a sprawling development, not far from Mdina, which used to be an RAF base. The stalls are rigorously policed to make sure only genuine smallholders have stalls. It is a showcase for scintillating local produce - purple aubergines, violet aubergines, small, cigar-shaped aubergines; fennel bulbs the size of small cannon balls; creamy cauliflowers the size of large ones; lemons, leeks, peppers the size of bricks; clusters of onions; tomatoes of every size; lettuces, courgettes, spiky artichokes and chard with rainbow stalks.\n\nContemplating this shimmering sea of vegetables sets the mouth watering - but it's not all vegetarian. There are a few stalls selling pork and chicken eggs, too. In short, temptation is all around. It's not the place to go just before you head off to catch your plane home.\n\nTa' Qali Crafts Village, Ta' Qali. Open Tuesdays 4pm-7pm, Saturdays 9am-5pm.",

                "body": "I'm interested in growing herbs to improve my cooking and for their under-appreciated ornamental value. The cooling, aromatic foliage adds a real sense of sophistication to outdoor spaces.\n\nI have an easy and beautiful evergreen combo outside my front door in blasting hot sunshine. A large 16in (40cm) pot contains upright rosemary and leafy sage, with tall, fluffy fennel behind and low-growing thyme at the front. I snuck in a lavender for my favourite cocktail, too.\n\nThis selection from the Mediterranean enjoys drier soil, perfect for the forgetful waterer (guilty). I went to embarrassing lengths to find white-flowered varieties, but you don't have to waste your time.\n\nMy biggest mistake has been growing herbs in small quantities. One tricolore salad and they're gone. Thrust aside those gift pots emblazoned with \"Herbs\", they're too small. You need a football-sized leaf mass per herb, minimum. Buy large plants from pepperpotherbplants.co.uk or your local nursery. Supermarket plants are just guaranteed to die - it's not you, it's them.\n\nSome, like basil and parsley, are best grown from seed en masse (you'll need five-10 plants). Basil can be pernickety, but sown this week indoors it will be happy outside later in sun and soil that doesn't dry out. Allow each plant 12in (30cm), and pinch growing tips to encourage bushiness. Alternate plants when picking so that they recover.\n\nOn my allotment I'm designing a three metre bed that will hold more herbs than a Jamie Oliver recipe. It has room for taste tests, including three basils: 'Sweet Green', 'Purple Ruffles' and 'Queen of Sheba' (chilternseeds.co.uk). To counter such culinary thrills I'll grow camomile and mint for calming teas.\n\nPlant herbs this weekend for super fresh seasoning and instant chef-chic.\n\nJack blogs at jackwallington.com.

                "title": "British knight suspended by Order of Malta for writing highly critical book about Pope Francis",
                "body": "A British member of the Order of Malta, the chivalric organisation which dates back to the Crusades, has been suspended after writing a highly critical book about Pope Francis that was condemned as a \"vile attack\".\n\nHenry Sire, an Oxford-educated historian and a knight in the ancient order for nearly two decades, has been castigated for his inflammatory book The Dictator Pope, which describes the Argentinian pontiff as \"authoritarian and manipulative\".\n\nThe book claims to be \"the inside story of the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of modern times.\"\n\n\"When the television cameras aren't rolling, Pope Francis transforms into another person: arrogant, stand-offish with people, vulgar in his language and famous for his violent outbursts of anger that are known to all, from cardinals to car drivers,\" the historian wrote.\n\nThe book claims that Francis was elected thanks to the help of a \"mafia\" of progressive cardinals.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Mr Sire described the Pope as \"the monster occupying the papal throne\".\n\nThe row is the latest skirmish in a much wider battle between those who support Pope Francis and conservatives who are bitterly opposed to his populist touch and reform agenda, some of whom have gone as far as to accuse him of heresy.\n\nThey have been incensed by his suggestion that divorcees who remarry in civil ceremonies should be allowed to take Holy Communion.\n\nMr Sire, who has been a knight since 2001, was contracted to write a history of the order and lived from 2013 until 2017 in its palatial headquarters in Rome.\n\nThe book was duly published in 2016, but he then wrote a second book, without the knowledge of the knights, on Francis and his controversial papacy.\n\nIt was initially published under a pen name, Marcantonio Colonna, an Italian nobleman who fought at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, in which a European naval force inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Empire off the coast of Greece.\n\nMr Sire, a Catholic arch-conservative who has questioned the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, was revealed to be the author of the book earlier this week by his publishers.\n\nAfter being unmasked, the knights took the decision to suspend him.\n\nIn a statement, the order said it \"strongly condemns the vile attack against the Pope.\"\n\n\"The Order of Malta dissociates itself from the positions conveyed and considers the content of the book a grave offence to His Holiness, Pope Francis.\"\n\nAn internal investigation has been launched and Mr Sire could be expelled from the order, a spokesperson told The Telegraph.\n\nIn his book, Mr Sire also wrote about a damaging crisis within the order in 2016 which led to the downfall of its British head, Matthew Festing.\n\nMr Festing, a Cambridge-educated former Guards officer, resigned as the Prince and Grand Master of the knights in January last year after a highly public clash with the Holy See over his dismissal of a senior deputy.\n\nHe had accused Albrecht von Boeselager of condoning the distribution of condoms in an aid project in South-east Asia, in contravention of the Catholic order's opposition to artificial contraception.\n\nBut after weeks of mud-slinging, which drew in the Vatican, German-born Mr von Boeselager, whose title is Grand Chancellor, was reinstated, in what was seen as a defeat for Mr Festing. He was then asked to step down by the Pope.\n\nThe row, which dragged on for months, tarnished the reputation of the Order, a Catholic charity which provides hospices, clinics and other relief for people in conflict zones and areas struck by natural disasters.\n\n\"Sire never had an official role in the order and he was not involved in any of the decision-making (during the crisis),\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Dictator Pope was initially published as an e-book but a hard copy will be released on April 23, a week before the order meets in Rome to elect a new leader to replace the current acting head, Giacomo Dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto, an Italian academic.\n\nMr Sire, 68, who was born in Barcelona and has French ancestry, was educated at Stonyhurst College in Lancs and then read history at Exeter College, Oxford.\n\nHe put out a statement claiming that his suspension was unlawful.\n\n\"The proceeding against me is wholly illegal,\" he said, claiming that the way in which it was conducted breached the order's own rules.\n\nFounded in the 11th century to protect pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta has around 25,000 paid employees and more than 80,000 volunteers around the world.\n\nIt is a sovereign entity which has observer status at the United Nations and maintains diplomatic links with more than 100 countries.",

                "body": "British drugmaker Indivior has suffered another setback in its battle to protect the patents on its top-selling US treatment for opioid addiction, hitting the company's shares.\n\nA US district court ruled American rival Alvogen had not infringed Indivior's patents with a planned copycat version of Suboxone, a dissolvable film that weans people off opioids including high-strength painkillers and illicit drugs such as heroin.\n\nIndivior is pursuing a number of lawsuits against rivals planning generic rival products, including Actavis, Par, Tava and Dr Reddy's. It has warned any launch by a competitor could severely eat into its sales.\n\nThe FTSE 250 company's shares fell as much as 22pc in early trading before paring back some of its losses, down 6pc at 389.50p by lunchtime.\n\nIndivior said it believed it had grounds to appeal the Alvogen ruling, which could take up to 18 months. However Alvogen may still risk launching a product during that period.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies described the dip in shares as a \"market over-reaction\", adding that Dr Reddy's was the competitor most likely to launch a Suboxone copycat first.\n\nIndivior launched a long-lasting treatment for opioid addiction - the injection Sublocade - last month, which it hopes will in time help make up for any lost sales on its older product. It believes Sublocade could be a potential blockbuster drug with sales over $1bn.\n\nDemand for opioid addiction treatments is on the rise in the States, with president Donald Trump describing the opioid crisis as a \"national emergency\".\n\nInvidior says that 12 million Americans abuse opoids and the drugs result in four fatal overdoses every hour of the day.\n\nUS deaths from opioid overdoses increased 21pc to 63,000 in 2016, according to official figures.",

                "title": "Meghan Markle carries a new handbag by Charlotte Elizabeth, a designer supported by The Prince's Trust",
                "body": "When Meghan Markle and Prince Harry arrived in Belfast this morning, making their first official visit to Northern Ireland, there were several things to note about the soon-to-be-Duchess's outfit.\n\nFirstly, the choice of colours; her Greta Constantine skirt was in a patriotic emerald green, and her Mackage coat in a spring-ready pastel pink. Secondly, her Victoria Beckham jumper; Beckham is thought to now be a personal friend of Ms Markle's and is a name in the running (albeit at the back of the pack of pacemakers) to perhaps design the dress.\n\nBut the biggest talking point that Markle wanted us to be aware of today was her handbag. She made sure it was unmissable, holding it front and centre in almost every photo as she and Harry arrived in Lisburn, and there is, naturally, a story behind it.\n\nThe bag is a brand new, not-yet-available-to-buy Bloomsbury case, from British brand Charlotte Elizabeth. It can be worn as a satchel or carried by the top-handle, Markle-style.\n\nCharlotte Elizabeth Jones, a 23-year-old from Hertfordshire, is the designer of her namesake label (it is by pure coincidence that she shares a name with Princess Charlotte of Cambridge), which she launched in 2016 with support from The Prince's Trust.\n\nIn 2014, when she was 19, Charlotte had attended a four-day course in entrepreneurship run by the organisation (which is headed up by Markle's father-in-law to-be, Prince Charles) and had learned how to set up a fashion business. She had left school at the age of 16 due to heart complications, and this course gave her the valuable skills she needed to set up shop, however two weeks after the training, she suddenly became paralysed.\n\n\"I had a heart operation in 2012 and I had to leave school at 16 because of it,\" Jones previously told The Telegraph. \"I couldn't get A Levels or go to uni, and it was hard to find employment because of my physical health conditions.\"\n\n\"I suddenly just collapsed,\" she recalled of the day her situation worsened in June 2014. \"I had had flu-like symptoms for nine months before, but had been told everything was fine. I had a heart arrhythmia that was never supposed to come back after my heart operation, so it was a freak episode. I collapsed and basically lost all muscle ability within seconds.\"\n\nJones was paralysed for months before making a recovery and was able to start gradually working on her brand again.\n\n\"Because I lost the ability to use my hands and muscles, I couldn't draw, so I was trying but it was very childlike,\" she said of her initial attempts. \"My sister's boyfriend is a designer so he drew more specialised sketches so people would know how to make them.\"\n\nCharlotte Elizabeth Jones with her new-edition Bloomsbury bag, available to pre-order for £175 from charlottelizabeth.com.\n\nJones has done a phenomenal job of starting her label - something that many recovering from such difficulties with their health might not have attempted - and with support from The Prince's Trust, she has developed her product line, made with leathers sourced at a British tannery, and stitched in Buckinghamshire.\n\n\"I had such a clear a vision of what I wanted it to be,\" she says of her design ethos. \"Very clean cut, minimal and inspired by classic 50s handbags, when it was an experience to have a handbag.\"\n\nJones has had a long journey to get to this point and, as Markle's endorsement today will undoubtedly launch her label into a different league, it feels like a reward that was worth the wait. Her thoughts on it all? Simply, \"It is wonderful.\"",

                "body": "Up to 1,400 restaurant workers are set to lose their jobs as troubled Italian chain Prezzo moves to close 94 sites in a bid to keep the company trading.\n\nThe move has been agreed by nearly 90pc of creditors as part of a Company Voluntary Agreement, a form of insolvency which allows a business to keep trading and avoids it going bust.\n\nPrezzo, which has roughly 300 sites, is the latest casualty in the restaurant sector and the rescue deal further exposes the huge pressures the industry has found itself under at a time when business rates and other costs are rising and consumers are increasingly watching what they spend.\n\nSome restaurants set for the axe operate under other brands. Private equity owner TPG runs various casual dining concepts through Prezzo's parent company, including Mexican eateries Chimichanga and MEXIco and chicken, ribs and burger chain Cleaver. Besides the closures, which are likely to happen in April and May, a total of 57 sites will pay between reduced rent of between a quarter and a half of current rates for up to two years.\n\nA host of other restaurant chains including Jamie's Italian, Byron and Strada have all been forced to close sites and secure lower rents on others to avoid disappearing altogether.\n\nJon Hendry-Pickup, Prezzo's chief executive, said: \"While we continue to be profitable, the pressures on our industry have been well documented. Despite this being a tough decision, the support given today by our creditors shows that they believe we have the right approach to transforming Prezzo in the eyes of teams, customers and stakeholders.\n\n\"It has been a challenging time during the CVA process,\" he added.\n\nTPG paid £300m for the business in 2014 and funded a huge expansion, which has now come back to haunt it.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph revealed earlier this month Prezzo owed its banks and suppliers almost £220m, split between Barclays Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as scores of unsecured creditors.\n\nA spokesman for Prezzo said at the time, while the company owed money to the banks and trade creditors, it was paying them back as normal.",

                "title": "Gareth Bale will only get better, insists Ian Rush after his Wales goal record is broken",
                "body": "Ian Rush says his only regret after losing his Welsh goalscoring record to Gareth Bale is he was not in China to see it.\n\nBale's 29th international goal in his country's 6-0 win on Thursday took him one ahead of the legendary Liverpool striker.\n\nRush - who is currently Elite Performance Director for the Welsh Football Trust - believes Bale will elevate Welsh football to greater heights after giving the Ryan Giggs era the perfect start.\n\n\"Gareth was always going to break the record, it was just a question of when,\" said Rush, who held his country's goal record for 22 years.\n\n\"In an ideal world I would have loved to have been there to see him do it. I think it says everything about Gareth that he travelled 6000 miles to do and show his commitment to his country - and it was his daughter's birthday too, so I could not be happier for him.\n\n\"People often ask me if Gareth is one of the all time greats and I would always say judge him when he has finished his career because he can get better. Going to Real Madrid has helped his career and because of that it has helped Welsh football.\"\n\nRush could not be in China because he is participating in a charity fixture on behalf of the Liverpool FC foundation, the Kop legends meeting Bayern Munich.\n\nBut - speaking at the event to promote this weekend's Anfield fixture - he said he is planning to speak to Bale to pass on his personal congratulation.\n\n\"I've not had a chance to speak to Gareth yet because of the time difference in China, but I hope to soon,\" said Rush.\n\n\"I managed to speak to Giggsy after the game to pass on my congratulations for his first win as manager. To win your first game, have Gareth break the record and see a youngster like Harry Wilson score his first goal could not have made it a more positive start.\n\n\"It is all part of a new era, with my record going and Chris Gunter beating the appearance record for an outfield player. It shows Welsh football is going in the right direction.\"\n\nRush is in danger of losing several of his goal records for club and country in a matter of weeks.\n\nIt seemed inconceivable any current player could threaten Rush's 47-goal haul for Liverpool in the 1983-84 season, but Mo Salah trails by just 11. At the very least, the Egyptian is threatening to go beyond the 32 league goals Rush struck that year.\n\nBut Rush insists that it was the trophies those goals won rather than the individual accolade that matter most to him.\n\n\"After Watford there is no reason why Salah can't get to 40 goals,\" said Rush.\n\n\"The best thing about Salah is how unselfish he is. Twice in the Watford game he tried to help Danny Ings to score. He seemed desperate for that to happen. What I really like about him is whenever he scores his first move is towards the player who helped create it. I hate it when players score and just run to the crowd to show their own name on their back. You can't do it by yourself. Salah is so down to earth.\n\n\"But the most important thing about the season when I scored 47 goals is we won three trophies that season. It is special to score so many, but it means more when you win something.\n\n\"It's the same for Gareth. What he will want more is for the goals to take Wales to more major tournaments.\"",

                "title": "Rock's best frenemies: a history of Rod Stewart and Elton John insulting each other",
                "body": "While the rest of the music world has reserved a dignified silence on Elton John's January announcement that he would be retiring from live performance, fellow heritage rocker Rod Stewart has not held back in giving his tuppence.\n\nJohn will embark on one more mammoth tour before hanging up his sequinned blazer (although one suspects he wears those off-stage, too), playing 300 dates of the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour across the globe.\n\nSuch an endeavour has been sniffed at by the Maggie May singer, however, who at 73 - three years John's senior - has never hinted at retirement. \"It stinks of selling tickets\", Stewart told US broadcaster Andy Cohen on chat show Watch What Happens Live, adding that the tour was a \"dishonest\" ploy to earn money that \"stinks of selling tickets\". Stewart finished off by delivering the damning verdict that by making a literal song and dance of his retirement, John was \"not rock and roll\".\n\nStewart could never be accused of being two-faced in his approach, however. He also let John know his feelings when the news first broke. \"I did email her [Elton] and say: 'What, again dear?'\", he told Cohen. \"And I didn't hear anything back.\"\n\nSuch correspondence, however, is nothing new between Rod and Elton. In fact, the pair have long nurtured a affectionate relationship which is bolstered by public bickering. Their friendship formed in the early Seventies, when they were relative neighbours - John lived with a then-boyfriend near Stewart, and became so close that mutual friend John Baldry, the blues singer, christened them Phyllis and Sharon. The stars adopted the names, Stewart wrote in 2012: \"and that's what we were to each other: Phyllis and Sharon. Or just 'dear'.\"\n\nIn 1983 both Stewart and John were interviewed together about their friendship. As John said at the time: \"We try and publicise the fact that we always have a go at each other in the papers, but in fact we do that for reasons only known to us, really. We're actually very good friends.\"\n\nPerhaps such public ribaldry is down to the fact that both are also major rivals. It's easy to see a grain of truth lying under John's quip at the time: \"We're alright until we both get in the Top 10\". Such friendly rivalry has, over the past three decades, fuelled a delightful array of public stunts that make the Twitter slanging matches of today's chart-toppers (looking at you, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj) look all the more vindictive and petty.\n\nStewart's Blondes 'Ave More Fun tour in 1978 took Da Ya Think I'm Sexy? from Oslo to Osaka. It was also followed by a sign conjured up by John that read: \"But Brunettes Make More Money\". In 1985, Stewart publicised his Earls Court concerts by floating \"massive footballs, the size of blimps\" above Earls Court. As Stewart recalled in his 2012 book, Rod: The Autobiography: \"Elton hired a sniper to shoot them down with an air rifle\".\n\nAs the years went on, the pair perhaps became too preoccupied with wives, ex-wives, husbands, and children to create such ceremony, but continued to keep checks on one another. In 2016, Stewart told Alan Carr: \"Our albums came out at more or less the same time and we have been comparing how the sales are... I'm winning.\"\n\nAsked if they were still as competitive as in their younger days, Stewart said: \"We still are. We text back and forth with each other - how many albums I've sold and how many albums he has sold.\" A similar contest exists between who sold the most tickets during their Las Vegas residency years. Stewart maintains he did - \"whatever Elton may tells his audience from the stage\".\n\nThe competition between them doesn't just extend to sales, but gag gifts, too. And on a rock star salary, such things can be entertainingly outrageous. For a while, John started innocuously enough, merely showing Stewart in ludicrously fancy presents: \"lavish, thickly jewelled [watch] engraved 'From Elt'\", and a Steinway piano for Stewart's first wife Alan.\n\nThis, however, just brought a new level of competition to the friendship. As Stewart recalled: \"What do you get the man who has bought himself everything?\" He settled on a £300 novelty portable fridge, which Stewart \"thought was enough\". John returned the gesture with \"A f------- Rembrandt!\" Stewart recalled. \"I felt pretty small - although not as small as Elton presumably wanted me to feel when he later referred tartly to my present as \"an ice bucket.\" It was not an ice bucket. It was a novelty portable fridge.\"\n\nWhen John turned 50, Stewart celebrated by buying him \"a full-size, sit-under hairdryer like the ones you see in women's hair salons.\"\n\nJohn's generosity wasn't indefatigable, though. When Stewart married his third wife, Rachel Hunter, the Rocket Man singer had clearly tired of buying wedding presents: \"He marked my marriage to Rachel with a £10 voucher from Boots. On the card he wrote, 'Get yourself something nice for the house.'\"",

                "body": "Eighteen months ago, Dragon's Den star Jenny Campbell sold ATM business YourCash for £50m. She had bought it, turned it round and had a 75 per cent controlling stake, but after a career in banking that started with counting cash in Natwest at 16, she still gets mistaken for the wife of someone more important.\n\n\"I think culturally, subconscious bias still massively exists. I have a Swedish friend in the banking system over there, and the balance between couples, especially in business is so different. In this country the woman says, 'have you had a hard day dear? Here's your slippers and I've made your dinner.\" \"I notice it when I have business meetings. If I'm there with one of my male colleagues, who might be an operations director or finance director and we turn around to introduce ourselves, people assume I'm the wife of the man standing next to me, not that I'm the chief and his boss. It's just a different mindset.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph ahead of the launch of our Women Mean Business campaign to boost female entrepreneurship in the UK, Campbell says that problems with the perception of females in business run right to the top.\n\nDragon's Den is one of the BBC's flagship shows, putting entrepreneurialism on prime-time television. Why then, in 15 series, have there been 11 men and just six women in the chairs?\n\n\"When I went for my Dragon's Den screening test, the BBC producer told me he finds it so much harder to find potential new female dragons than he does male dragons. He couldn't give a reason why though, he just said it was incredibly difficult.\"\n\nCampbell has laid down a challenge to the BBC: \"When the next male dragon steps down, we should be three women and two men. The Irish version of the show was the first to do it, and I have told the producers that I am going to help them find the new dragon.\"\n\nIn the current series, Campbell says she saw 110 pitches, and the dragons made a record 26 investments between then. The BBC declined to give out the gender breakdown of the investments and the pitches, but said in a statement that they \"work hard to put as many female entrepreneurs in the Den as possible.\" Campbell said: \"Coupled with the stats from the Telegraph's campaign, my own experiences tell me that there is certainly a lack of gender diversity in entrepreneurship and Britain's startup community. In the last series of Dragons' Den, I made eight investments, six were male entrepreneurs, one investment was a couple and only one was a female. However, I have never and will never invest on gender. For me it's about the entrepreneur's character. There certainly needs to be greater support for encouraging women to start up and sustain businesses.\"\n\nHighlighted in our Women Mean Business campaign, figures from the entrepreneurs network show that men are 85 per cent more likely than women to secure venture capital funding and 56 per cent more likely to secure angel investment. Why do women find it so difficult getting finance?\n\n\"It's an interesting discussion,\" says Campbell. \"I think women are more creative and therefore less formal about things. You get a lot of women in creative and marketing industries and they are more comfortable with creative ways of getting money, like crowdfunding, whereas men are men and more traditional and go to banks.\"\n\nA global report released last year by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP and The Crowdfunding Centre showed that women were 32% more successful than men at raising money via crowdfunding.\n\n\"I think it's also the types of businesses that women run. I happened to be judging a business awards five years ago and noticed that there were 10 finalists, 6 men 4 women, and they came up and pitched their ideas to the panel. What you noticed is that the women all had businesses that were more 'female' if you want to put it that way.\n\n\"The one that won was a florist business the others were to do with caring, and there was a divorce lawyer, but they were all akin to female businesses. The men would come up and talk about tech or chemistry or construction businesses. We're going back to the boys play with action men and girls play with dollies and it's almost like businesses were aligned with that as well, and that probably is the same with finance, where women go down these creative online routes. Is the type of business that a bank lends to more akin to a female business or a mens business? I think there's a lot more that has to be found out to reach conclusions.\"\n\nCampbell was born in Cheshire in 1961, and went to Manchester High School for Girls, where she achieved 9 GCSE's. At 16, she dropped out of school and started counting cash for Natwest. She spent 32 years at the bank, rising up the company and played an integral role in the integration of NatWest into RBS. In 2006, Campbell was made head of cash machine company Hanco ATM Systems, which was owned by RBS. Within four years, the company went from losing £7 million a year to making £7 million a year. Campbell spearheaded a management buy-out of Hanco and rebranded it as YourCash. She had a 75% controlling stake and the company was sold to US business Euronet for £50 million in 2016. She joined Dragon's Den for season 15 and sits alongside longtime dragons Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden, as well as Tej Lalvani and Touker Souleman.\n\nIn 2014, Campbell was given the Businesswoman of the Year award, then sponsored by Vitalise. Four years later and she has just been appointed to the board where she is already bringing change. \"I'm looking to raise the profile of the awards, and to bring in double the sponsorship. We already have a bank and a law firm, now I'm working on an accountancy firm and a car manufacturer. If I can land both of those we'll double the sponsorship. There has also been a chat about what charities we are going to support. In the past we have talked about breast cancer, but this has to be business related. This is about getting girls into business, so the charities that receive the money should be business related. We have just agreed that the princess trust women supporting women initiative will be one of the beneficiaries of the funds that are raised.\" The nominations will be announced in the House of Lords on March 26, and the winner will also join the board for a year.\n\nWomen on boards has been something that Campbell has long wrestled with. \"For years I was against quotas for women on boards of companies. Really against quotas. I believed that we've got to fight on our own merit to get parity. But I have slowly come round to the thought that if you can't do things naturally then there has to be some form of intervention.\" Does the 30% club go far enough? \"That's just a club. There has to be a legal and regulatory requirement for your board to be 30% women, simple as that. I really would have been against that three or four years ago but I get disappointed with such little progress in such a long time. I even saw a tweet from RBS, and I'm fiercely proud of my ex-employer, but I saw a tweet that said it put their commitment to increase their proportion of women, and I wrote back saying 'I went on a springboard course in the 1990's which was all about achieving that.' We are now 20-odd years on and they are still making these public statements about improving things. The progress is so disappointing. So disappointing.\"\n\nGetting women into business is a key aim for Campbell. \"I think it starts at a much younger age. It starts at school, but not when you're 14 and choosing your GCSE options but at 10 and 12. We should get into those schools and talk to those girls about the possibilities of what they might become before they chose their options. Parents are still a huge influence on what you choose to do. I did a speech to my old school, Manchester High School for girls, and one of the things I said was 'let the girls choose their future.' Please do not say to the girls 'you need to be a doctor, you need to be a lawyer, or an accountant. One British-Asian girl came up to me at a school in Milton Keynes and said 'before I got involved with young enterprise my parents told me I was going into medicine. Now I know I absolutely want to be a businesswoman.'\"\n\nThe government announced its first ever review into the funding gap facing females going into business just one day after the Telegraph's campaign launch and Campbell was one of the 200 signatories of the letter that was sent to the Secretaries of State.\n\n\"I am absolutely thrilled that there is a revolution around British and UK entrepreneurship. It's fantastic because we need to get back to building and producing things ourselves. Campbell, who described herself as a \"cautious remainer\" before the vote said: \"I was a cautious remainer only because I thought we would be better off negotiating a better deal rather than throwing everything up in the air and seeing how it fell down. That said, we are British and we'll make a fist of it one way or another. There's no point bleating about it, we'll get through one way or another.\"",

We call BS!\"\n\nI believe Emma Gonzalez is the most inspiring female of 2018 with her pure, raw speech that started a movement & she deserves special mention this #IWD2018 https://t.co/VOpfZYaU8S -- Johnny Boy (@GeeForce77)\n\nMarch 8, 2018\n\n\"We are going to be the last mass shooting,\" the buzzcut senior announced in the speech that has subsequently been watched by millions on social media.\n\nGonzalez, who hid at the back of the school's auditorium during the gunman's rampage, also co-founded the Never Again movement and has won praise for her mature cross examination of NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch in a live TV debate.\n\nGood Morning!

He invited friends to his house after the shooting to discuss what they could do to make a meaningful difference on gun control.\n\nThe 17-year-old junior has given more than 50 interviews since the shooting and asked Senator Marco Rubio live on CNN: \"Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?\"\n\nWATCH & SHARE\n\nStoneman Douglas Student Cameron Kasky asks Marco Rubio whether he will pledge not to take any more NRA money #CNNTownHall #StudentsStandUp #NoNRAMoney #AMJoy pic.twitter.com/yYEdYRjGan -- #LaquanMcDonald (@ifuaskmee)\n\nFebruary 24, 2018\n\nSenator Rubio responded: \"I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda.\"\n\nIn an op-ed for CNN, Kasky wrote: \"We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking -no, demanding - we take action now.\"\n\nAlex Wind\n\nAlex Wind joined Kasky at his home in the hours following the shooting where they founded the Never Again movement.\n\nHe urged Mr Trump to \"make stricter gun control laws\" on Twitter after the president offered \"prayers and condolences\" to families of the victims.\n\nMake stricter gun control laws then https://t.co/UH9VGlX8XK -- Alex Wind (@al3xw1nd)\n\nFebruary 14, 2018\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Wind admitted he was \"terrified\" of returning to school following the tragedy.\n\n\"I want change to happen so badly, I don't want to feel unsafe in my own school,\" he said.\n\nMarch For Our Lives\n\nThe students will be leading the March For Our Lives protests on 24 March, as protesters take to the streets of Washington DC to demand action to end gun violence and mass shootings in schools.\n\nTens of thousands of students will also be campaigning in cities across the US and in six continents this weekend.\n\n\"People are saying that it's not time to talk about gun control, and we can respect that,\" said Kasky announcing the march. \"Here's a time: March 24, in every single city marching together as students begging for our lives.\"\n\nMiley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Demi Lovato and Common are due to be among performers at Saturday's main march.",

I had fun with the guys, they were very welcoming,\" Bolt said in a quote on Dortmund's official Twitter account.\n\nA bumper crowd of 1,409 turned up at BVB's training centre located in Dortmund-Brackel while there was unsurprisingly an increased media presence to see the 31-year-old put through his paces.\n\nBolt emerged at the forefront of the pack, wearing UB09 on his Dortmund tracksuit, to a fine reception and there appeared plenty of bonhomie as he interacted with the team before the warm-ups on a grey day in western Germany.\n\nHis first touch was noticeably errant during the practice match - although he made up for this on one occasion by nutmegging Italy Under-19 right-back Dario Scuderi to the delight of those watching.\n\nPlaying alongside the likes of Christian Pulisic and Gotze, Bolt was largely in a forward role and capped his game with a terrific header into the corner of the net to a chorus of cheers.\n\nHowever, he did fluff one more chance, chipping well wide when clean through.\n\nBolt, who once hit a six off Chris Gayle before bowling the then West Indies captain in a charity cricket match in October 2009, was on his haunches at the end of the half-hour game and visibly fatigued.\n\nThe self-confessed Manchester United fan recovered to confidently dispatch a left-foot penalty into the top right corner of the net as the training session was brought to a close.\n\nHe finished by shaking hands and taking photos with several of the team before signing autographs for some of those in attendance.",

                "body": "Aviva has backtracked on a controversial decision to cancel its high-dividend preference shares after receiving \"strong criticism\" from investors.\n\nThe City was furious after the FTSE 100 group said earlier this month that it had the right to cancel the shares, which tumbled on the announcement and led to a paper loss of around £1bn for investors.\n\nThe so-called 'prefs' pay a fixed dividend and were sold as irredeemable by the insurer. Aviva sparked outrage among investors - many of whom are pensioners - when it said it wanted to ditch the shares to save money.\n\nMounting pressure led to a change of heart on Friday when the company said it \"has listened\" to the criticisms of investors and would take no action.\n\n\"The reputation of Aviva, and the trust people have in us, is paramount,\" said chief executive Mark Wilson. \"The board and I have a duty to consider not just the financial implications of our actions. We must consider the impact to Aviva's wider reputation. I hope our decision today goes some way to restoring that trust.\"\n\nThe embarrassing debacle even reached the attention of MPs and the Financial Conduct Authority, which today welcomed the announcement for providing \"welcome certainty to the market\".\n\nAviva defended its review of the shares on Friday by saying it had a \"duty to examine what is right for the business\" and \"needed to address the issue of the preference shares given regulatory capital considerations and their cost\".\n\nNevertheless, its reference that it had the ability to cancel the shares in its annual accounts came as a surprise to shareholders. As noted by The Telegraph earlier this month, Aviva's own website appeared to contradict itself - it refers to the shares as \"irredeemable\" but said a few lines later they \"cannot be redeemed without approval by shareholders [preference and ordinary]\".\n\nPressure on the company to U-turn on its plans had intensified in recent days, with Treasury chair Nicky Morgan writing to FCA boss Andrew Bailey earlier this week demanding answers after receiving a \"large volume of correspondence\" about the issue.\n\nJason Hollands, a managing director at Tilney Investment Management, said shareholders were right to be livid and the incident had left the company \"licking its reputational wounds\".\n\nShareholder and businessman Philip Meadowcroft told The Telegraph he had contacted Mr Wilson to warn him the company needed to \"clear the air\". He said: \"The reputational damage self-inflicted on the company and its branding has been devastating, let alone the preference share market as a whole.\"",

                "body": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have received a rapturous reception from the young people of Northern Ireland as they began a whirlwind visit.\n\nMeghan and Harry's unannounced trip to Northern Ireland will see them learn the history of the doomed Titanic, when they visit a Belfast visitor attraction telling the passenger ship's story, and sit down to a lunch in the city's most iconic pub.\n\nThe prince and Ms Markle began their day-long visit at the former Maze paramilitary prison outside Lisburn where around 2,500 young people from both sides of the Irish border gathered for a peace-building event.\n\nThey received a hugely warm welcome from teenagers when they entered an enormous performance arena before watching some of the children deliver their \"peace pledges\".\n\nThe cross-community gathering at the Eikon Centre, which is built on the site of the old Maze prison, saw teenagers share their hopes and dreams of a peaceful and reconciled future on the island.\n\nPeter Sheridan, chief executive of event host Cooperation Ireland, welcomed the special visitors and said the youth-led initiative was \"integral to the development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland\".\n\n\"To have so many young people in one place proactively speaking out in favour of peace and committing to living their lives through peaceful means can only bode well for society, and to have the royal family here to witness it makes it even more powerful,\" he said.\n\nThe couple are on the latest leg of a tour of the UK that has already taken them to major centres like Edinburgh, Cardiff and Birmingham.\n\nKensington Palace said: \"Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle are visiting Belfast today for their first official joint visit to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Throughout the day, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will have the opportunity to meet members of the public, to learn how young people are shaping the future of Northern Ireland, and to visit some of the city's most loved sites.\"\n\nWhen the couple first arrived they were greeted by Londonderry students Amber Hamilton, from Foyle College, and Ryan McCallion, from St Joseph's Boys school, both 17, before meeting a number of dignitaries including Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable George Hamilton.\n\nMs Markle looked stylish in a cream coat and top with a green skirt.\n\nLater, the couple will have lunch at the Crown Liquor Saloon, Belfast's atmospheric Victorian gin palace which is filled with a wealth of architectural features and is a major tourist attraction.\n\nAfter dining they will go on a walkabout outside the building to meet the people of Belfast.\n\nAt the nearby campus of Northern Ireland's next generation science park, Catalyst Inc, Ms Markle and Harry will meet some of Ulster's brightest young entrepreneurs and innovators.\n\nTheir day will end with a tour of Titanic Belfast which tells the story of the famous ship, from her conception in Belfast in the early 1900s, through her construction and launch, to the vessel's maiden voyage and tragic sinking with the loss of 1,500 lives in April 1912.\n\nMeghan and Harry have been touring Britain ahead of their May wedding and the prince will introduce his fiance to Ulster during a series of events.\n\nHarry and Meghan's official wedding china goes on sale\n\nThe official range of commemorative china celebrating Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding has gone on sale.\n\nCornflower blue with white detailing, the collection features a gold monogram of the couple's initials side by side, tied together with a white ribbon and surmounted by Harry's coronet.\n\nThe decorative border on each piece is inspired by the couple's wedding venue.\n\nIt is based on the stylised tree ironwork of the 13th century Gilebertus door of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, where the couple will marry on May 19.\n\nWhen Harry and Ms Markle's choice of wedding venue was announced, the prince's communications secretary described Windsor as a \"very special place\" for Harry, and said that the couple had regularly spent time there together during their whirlwind romance.\n\nHarry and his American fiancee will have approved the fine bone china range by the Royal Collection Trust which includes a miniature coffee mug costing £19.95, a standard coffee mug for £25, a pillbox at £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate at £49.\n\nThe Gilebertus door is rarely used, though hundreds of tourists and visitors to the chapel pass by it every day.\n\nThe Queen and other members of the royal family use it to enter the chapel when attending some services at St George's, such as at Easter.\n\nIts ironwork is in the form of a stylised tree and, unusually for a work of its time, bears a name +GILEBERTVS.\n\nThe door is one of the few surviving parts of the earliest chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe official china, which is finished in 22 carat gold, has been hand made in Stoke-on-Trent using 250-year-old methods and techniques.\n\nAll profits from sales go to The Royal Collection Trust, the registered charity responsible for the care and conservation of the Royal Collection.\n\nThe souvenirs are presented in a cornflower blue gift box with a special card explaining the significance of the design.\n\nNuala McGourty, Royal Collection Trust's retail director, said: \"Royal Collection Trust is delighted to offer the official range of commemorative china to celebrate this happy occasion.\n\n\"We are pleased to continue our support of the potteries of Stoke-on-Trent, who have manufactured our previous commemorative wares to celebrate royal birthdays, anniversaries and weddings.\"\n\nThe china can be purchased from royalcollection.org.uk/shop and in Royal Collection Trust shops at The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\nThe big wedding secret I couldn't tell my mother: The young woman tasked with creating 600 invitations\n\nIt is one of the best-kept secrets in Britain: who will be the lucky few invited to share Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding day from the comfort of a Windsor Castle pew? On Friday, the answer will come, in the form of a thick envelope bearing the mark of the Palace\n\nAs a final guest list was drawn up by the couple and their inner circle, it emerged one young woman has been party to the full guest list, and entrusted with keeping it strictly private.\n\nLottie Small, a 24-year-old former intern at a Royal Warrant-holding printing company, has the duty of creating 600 invitations for the Prince and his bride-to-be. And the hardest part? Not even being allowed to tell her mother.\n\nMiss Small, who said she \"squealed a little bit\" when she was asked to take on the all-important job, only recently finished her apprenticeship with Barnard & Westwood, a printing firm that holds Royal Warrants from the Queen and the Prince of Wales.\n\nMiss Small, one of only a handful to know the details before Friday, made 600 die-stamped, embossed invitations for the St George's Chapel service, which will begin landing on doormats from Friday morning.\n\n\"Unbelievably excited\" to be entrusted with the job, she was banned from telling anyone, working alone to perfect the invitations.\n\n\"The worst thing is keeping it from Mum,\" she said. \"With anything else, she'd be the first person I would call and she'd share in my excitement.\"\n\nThe announcement will fire the starting gun on speculation about royal \"snubs\", with the couple expected to focus on family and friends over international dignitaries and statesmen.\n\nWhile Prince William and the then Kate Middleton invited world leaders and diplomatic figures to their Westminster Abbey state wedding, Prince Harry, currently the fifth-in-line, will endure less pressure to be formal.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama have been widely predicted to be invited due to a blossoming friendship with the couple, along with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, and his wife, while President Trump, whom the former actress has previously criticised, is unlikely to attend.\n\nA wide circle of friends will make up one of the most extraordinary congregations in St George's Chapel history, from the Prince's military friends to Ms Markle's fellow actors.\n\nFrom Friday morning, that inner circle of trusted accomplices will expand to include the postmen and women of Britain, who will deliver the unmistakable envelopes to their recipients. Kensington Palace yesterday confirmed that 600 guests will be invited to the Windsor Castle service on May 19, followed by an afternoon reception in St George's Hall thrown by the Queen.\n\nIn the evening, 200 close friends and family will attend Frogmore House for a party thrown by the Prince of Wales.\n\nPrinted using machinery from the Thirties, the die-cast embossed white card has been issued under the Prince of Wales's name and bears his heraldic feathers embossed in gold at the top. A to tradition for a couple better known for their modern approach, the invitations are printed in American ink on English paper.\n\nMiss Small's work is likely to meet the approval of the Prince of Wales, with a shared attitude to the preservation of traditional skills and crafts. Originally an intern at the printing company, founded after the First World War by an injured soldier, Miss Small joined the apprentice scheme after gaining a BA Hons in hand embroidery at the Royal School of Needlework.\n\nUsing American ink on English card, the invitations are printed in gold and black, then burnished to bring out the shine, and gilded around the edge. pic.twitter.com/gQpC6tDot0 -- Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nLatest news about plans for Royal wedding\n\nHarry, the fifth in line to the throne, and Ms Markle, the US actress, will wed on Saturday, May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nThe couple, who announced their engagement in November, are planning their own wedding celebration that \"reflects the characters of the bride and groom\"\n\nFrom flowers to seating plans, the pair are taking charge of a ceremony designed to incorporate both families, their wide circle of friends, and welcome the public into their lives.\n\nClick here for the latest news about plans for their big day.\n\nAll the stars were aligned': How the couple met\n\nAfter announcing their engagement, the couple gave an insight into their 16-month romance in a BBC interview - and described how they met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.\n\nMs Markle told how she could not wait to say \"yes\" to the prince when Harry got down on one knee a few weeks ago as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace.\n\nIndicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, Prince Harry said: \"The fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly was sort of confirmation to me that everything, all the stars were aligned, everything was just perfect.\n\n\"It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.\"\n\nFull interview: Harry and Meghan reveal engagement joy\n\nA few months into the relationship, Harry said he had to have \"some pretty frank conversations\" with Meghan about how her life may change when she entered the royal family.\n\nHe added: \"But I know that at the end of the day she chooses me, and I choose her, and therefore whatever we have to tackle together or individually we'll always be us together as a team, so I think she's capable... she's capable of anything.\"",

                "title": "Dillian Whyte vs Lucas Brown winner will be eyeing potential fight with Deontay Wilder or Anthony Joshua",
                "body": "The showdown between Londoner Dillian Whyte and unbeaten Australian Lucas Browne for the World Boxing Council Silver heavyweight crown at The O2 in London on Saturday means so much more than just bragging rights between two huge men who have a clear dislike for each other. The winner emerges as a potential opponent for WBC champion Deontay Wilder and, moreover, a stand-by opponent for Anthony Joshua later this year if the two-belt world title holder comes successfully through his unification contest with New Zealander Joseph Parker in Cardiff next weekend.\n\nWhyte, ranked number one challenger by the WBC, is hunting a showdown with WBC king Wilder but heavy-handed Browne, unbeaten in 25 fights with twenty-two knockouts, plans to hijack the Croydon man's plans and move into the world title mix once again having held the 'Regular' World Boxing Association belt.\n\nThe heavyweight rivals, who raised the stakes in the build-up with strong words at the press conference and hostile exchanges on social media, have been nothing but focused this week as the event draws near, a mouth-watering apperitif before the action moves to Wales next weekend.\n\n\"This is a great fight and the biggest and most important in the division outside of the world heavyweight championships,\" said Matchroom Sport boxing promoter Eddie Hearn. \"Dillian has been working his way up the rankings and now sits pretty at WBC number one - we expect the winner of this fight to be in position for a mandatory shot at Wilder. It's going to be an explosive, violent match up with plenty of bad blood between the two.\"\n\nWhyte said yesterday: \"I'm in the best shape I have ever been and I will show my improvements in this fight. If he wants to box, I'll box him. If he wants an all-out fight, I'll fight him, but I will do what it takes to get the all-important win.\"\n\nRicky Hatton, the former two-weight world champion who manages Browne, added: \"I think this is a genuine 50/50 fight. Lucas is a very dangerous puncher and Whyte has been very active. It promises to be a great fight, and for both men, there is so much on the line.\"\n\nExpect Whyte to start cagily, be on his toes, and be wary of Browne's dangerous power early, especially his booming straight right hand, only to be drawn into a dog fight by the middle rounds. Browne has the power to finish this bout, but Whyte has shown improvements with every outing, and nine years younger at 29, is the marginal favourite to secure a points victory.\n\nDillian Whyte versus Lucas Browne is live on Sky Sports",

                "title": "Cate Blanchett denies 'staying silent' on #MeToo while working with Woody Allen",
                "body": "Cate Blanchett has become the latest major Hollywood star to discuss her time working with Woody Allen in the wake of #MeToo.\n\nBlanchett won a Best Actress Oscar after starring in the Allen-directed Blue Jasmine in 2013, a few weeks after Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter in The New York Times about her alleged abuse at the hands of her father. Farrow also said that her \"torment was made worse by Hollywood\", and directed questioned stars including Blanchett, writing: \"What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett?\"\n\nA fresh light has been shone on Farrow's claims since allegations of rape and sexual assault were made about Harvey Weinstein in October last year, sparking other allegations of assault from other high-powered men in Hollywood. Allen has always vehemently denied Farrow's claims.\n\nAsked why she had remained silent about Allen by US news channel CNN, Blanchett said: \"I don't think I've stayed silent at all. At the time that I worked with Woody Allen, I knew nothing of the allegations. At the time, I said it's a very painful and complicated situation for the family, which I hope they have the ability to resolve.\"\n\nThe actress also maintained that allegations such as Farrow's should be made and resolved through the legal system. \"If these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they've been through court, then I'm a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents,\" she said. \"If the case needs to be reopened, I am absolutely, wholeheartedly in support of that.\"\n\nBlanchett added that victims of assault are better protected through the courts: \"I feel that these things need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted and so someone who is not in the shiny industry that I am can use that legal precedent to protect themselves,\" she commented.\n\n\"Always, in my industry or any other industry, they're preyed upon because they're vulnerable.\"\n\nOther actors who have previously worked with Allen have turned their backs on him in recent months, including Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Timothee Chalamet, Mira Sorvino and Greta Gerwig.",

                "title": "'A refuge from the city': Casa da Comporta, the beautiful beachside villa an hour from Lisbon",
                "body": "Pego is one of Comporta's best beaches: a hip, under-the-radar stretch of the unspoilt Alentejo coast, an hour south of Lisbon. Wild and backed by grass-tufted sand dunes, it is just 300 metres away from Casa da Comporta, a villa so tranquil that pop stars retreat here to recuperate after shows in the capital. With proximity to the sea rare in these parts, thanks to strict planning regulations, this 10-person villa is a super find.\n\nA beautifully imagined, single-storey slab of polished concrete and glass, this casa from casa makes the most of its situation, with a wooden decked terrace that spans the front of the property and looks out across reed beds towards the coast. While the dunes prevent any sea views, it is a tranquil place to sit, in grown-up but ultra-slouchy Adico deck chairs, while watching the sun set and listening to the sound of crashing Atlantic waves.\n\n\"We wanted a refuge from the city,\" the owner Joao, a father of three children told me. \"And a place where we can share great moments with our closest friends.\"\n\nIt's clear that the villa has been lovingly decorated over some years, with most of the pieces in the house coming from the owner's frequent trips around the world, and visitors will immediately notice the property's homely feel. A selection of masks from Mozambique welcomes visitors in the lobby, while handicrafts and other indigenous pieces from North Africa and South America are dotted about the place. Varnished driftwood furniture, bought in Bali, makes a few appearances, with a tall bench in the hall and an impressive bowl-shaped coffee table in the lounge.\n\nJoao refers to the style as \"ethnic chic\", but elsewhere the house is resolutely sleek and modern. The vast, floor-to-ceiling windows here are protected by stylish, slatted sliding doors that add privacy after darkness but also help keep flies and mosquitos at bay. Light floods in from all angles of the house thanks to the nearly 360-degree glass walls that surround the property.\n\nThe kitchen manages to feel fairly rustic, despite its industrial-like work surfaces, thanks to the scattered rattan baskets that we borrowed one day to collect shells from the beach. It's stocked with a coffee machine and everything else you might need.\n\nIn the sitting room, a distressed metal dining table is accompanied by mismatched leather chairs, an oversized lamp and a cow-hide rug. A telescope for stargazing above the serene, undeveloped landscape stands next to the front terrace, while nearby woven baskets contain tartan throws for cosy sunset-watching.\n\nWe found ourselves thinking of the property as a sophisticated cave-like beach house that might appeal to bohemian Europeans. Cool inside and with smooth stone walls, the space is soothing despite all that exposed concrete. The building also features a peaceful courtyard and dining space that makes art of a young olive tree and tall papyrus grass.\n\nSurrounding the villa is a sandy landscaped garden, with pathways curving through lavender beds and clumps of prairie flowers, past a roughly hewn children's playground and up to a statement rooftop pool.\n\nHere, a long, shaft of blue water cuts a streak across the roof in the direction of the sea. (Disappointingly, we didn't realise it is only heated on request - guests will need to pay an additional €195 a week for the service, and should give the owners at least a couple of days notice to ensure it's arranged in time.) A lawn, Weber barbecue, outdoor poufs and sun loungers are also found on the specially designed sundeck, which shares views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nIt's likely guests will spend their days enjoying Casa da Comporta's grounds and exploring the surrounding beaches and seaside restaurants, but the property again comes into its own come nightfall. The snug has a television, DVDs and a log fire for curling up beside after a wind-swept day at the beach, perhaps having borrowed the villa's own boogie boards or bicycles.\n\nThere are five bedrooms in total (two with en suites). The master reveals a unique four-poster bed, the top of which is crafted to resemble the asymmetrical branches of the pine trees outside. The quilts in the other rooms are decorated in delicate florals that - what with all the bare concrete - look cool rather than chintzy.\n\nWith a good beachside restaurant, Sal, also just a short walk away, you have all the ingredients here for a blissful holiday. \"Pego and Comporta are quiet and full of charm but also have so many things to do,\" the owner added, and we found this to be true. \"We have the best beaches in the world but also amazing countryside to discover. It is very hard to put a label on the area. It is pretty much unique.\"\n\nCasa da Comporta sleeps 10 from €2,950 a week in low season.\n\nFor more on what to do in the region, see our feature on why Comporta is Portugal's chicest beach retreat.",

We live in whirligig of deliciousness.\n\nExcept for those times when it goes a bit wonky; when we eat things without knowing why. Things we don't like. Things we would normally avoid. When a space, time, emotional and circumstantial continuum leads us to dive into mistakes such as:\n\nLeftover chinese\n\nLast night was a sofa orgy of MSG. We felt dirty, but in such a good way.\n\nWe know in our hearts that the chilli beef is so fatty that it has gone solid in the fridge, that the noodles have become one mass of matter (studded with those weird little cubes of garlic), and that the prawn crackers have aged overnight to acquire that curious fabric-y texture, so the leftovers will give us a far less pleasurable feeling of filth... But, nonetheless, we're going in.\n\nBombay mix\n\nWhy does this taste stale the moment it comes out of the packet?\n\nPerhaps because it was made in the '70s and no one bought it because it's so heinous. But if we have itchy nibble-fingers and a few too many wines before dinner then we munch on it joylessly, until our hands and teeth are coated in chickpea flour and our souls are coated in shame.\n\nPetrol station pasties\n\nEaten when we're so, so hungry and cold, and both geographically and emotionally in the nowhere place. The lardy pastry is bad enough but the innards... Oh dear Lord, the gluey innards. It's enough to put you off peas. PEAS.\n\nJellied chicken\n\nThat thing where you go all cavewoman and assault a refrigerated chicken carcass without even bothering to take the plate out of the fridge.\n\nAnd - what fresh hell is this? - you find the inside of your mouth, and your hands, arms and face all covered with chicken jelly, which is basically dog food. This is probably the worst textural experience of your life. But you savage away at it and then you need a shower.\n\nFruit that's been chopped with an onion-y knife\n\nWhat's that taste sensation? It's not good.\n\nBut we can't waste these strawberries and this mango and surely a bit of onion juice on a peach is OK. Maybe if you add yogurt it will make everything better. (Reader, it did not make everything better.)\n\nCold tea\n\nYou are just furious with yourself for never remembering to drink your tea in a timely fashion.\n\nAnd so you vow - as a kind of pointless penance - that you will sit there, madam, until that tea is drunk. No matter that there is a terrible milky film on top and the mug looks like the Turin Shroud.\n\nSoft apples\n\nWe know before we even take the first bite and yet we proceed.\n\nThat cotton-woolly texture that makes our teeth itch and our ears ache. The tiny grains of juiceless substance. But to take one bite and then walk away feels sinful and so we plough on, feeling sadder and sadder.\n\nStilton\n\nThis may be controversial but it's visibly off.\n\nIt wears its mouldy disgustingness like a badge of honour. It actively attacks our tastebuds with its festering tang. And yet, please pass the Carr's... Or we could make it worse and have it with a slice of soft apple.\n\nv\n\nthemidult.com",

                "title": "Monkeypox outbreak baffles experts",
                "body": "A rise in the number of cases of a rare virus across Africa is baffling experts.\n\nMonkeypox, which is closely related to smallpox, has spread throughout west and central Africa over the last 10 years, with six countries reporting cases, compared to just two countries 20 years ago.\n\nNigeria, whose last reported case was in 1978, is experiencing a particularly virulent outbreak with 89 people infected and six deaths since 2017.\n\nMonkeypox starts with a high fever before turning into a painful rash with open sores. One in 10 people who catch the disease die, with those with suppressed immune systems particularly at risk. If the disease infects the eye it can lead to scarring of the cornea and, in some cases, blindness.\n\nBut scientists are still unsure what is behind the rise in the number of cases, said Andrea McCollum, epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an expert in pox viruses.\n\nShe said it could be due to better detection and surveillance of outbreaks in west Africa.\n\n\"Another component could be from changes in terms of the environment or ecology of the animal reservoir,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the problems is that there are no experts in these countries because there has been a lapse in the number of cases over the last 30 to 40 years. A lot of the experts from the smallpox era are just not around any more,\" she added.\n\nMonkeypox was first observed in the 1960s in monkeys brought to Europe from Africa, with the first human case diagnosed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970. However, scientists are still unsure if the disease is actually transmitted by monkeys - rats or other rodents maybe the culprits, said Dr McCollum.\n\nAs well as improving countries' ability to detect the disease another priority is development of a vaccine, with researchers from CDC and Kinshasa University currently trialling a smallpox vaccine in the DRC.\n\n\"We know it performs well in the laboratory and in animals but we don't know if it performs well in an area like the DRC where people are exposed to the naturally occurring virus,\" she said.\n\nAn outbreak of monkeypox in the US in 2003, which infected 47 people, was traced to the import of small animals from Africa.\n\nDr McCollum said the movement of bushmeat out of Africa was also a potential driver for outbreaks in other parts of the world.\n\n\"There's a lot of illegal movement of animal product out of Africa to all regions of the world. It's astounding,\" she said.\n\nAccording to figures from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) 6,900kg of bushmeat from west Africa was seized by border officials in 2015-16, compared to 6,200kg in 2014-15.\n\nThe majority of this meat is brought in by individuals for family occasions or as a taste of home, Defra said.\n\nIt is important to understand what animal is spreading the disease, said Dr McCollum, as the consumption of bushmeat is common in west and central Africa.\n\n\"These communities, particularly in central Africa, that live in the bush are dependent on wild animals for protein sources. Their backyard is the forest and they hunt these animals. We're trying to put out scientifically accurate communication about the risk,\" she said.\n\nBut she acknowledged this was difficult. \"People tell us if they don't hunt their family will suffer,\" she said.\n\nSupported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

His Ireland teammate Conor Murray was second with 18.2 per cent, just edging fellow Irishman Jonathan Sexton into third on 18 per cent.\n\nAnother Ireland winger took fourth place with Keith Earls garnering 14.5 per cent of the votes, followed by Italy's rising star, Matteo Minozzi, who earned 13.2 per cent.

                "title": "Late-season skiing: everything you need to know",
                "body": "The 2017/18 ski season has been one to remember, from Team GB's inspiring performance at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang to the record-breaking snowfall to have blessed many resorts with the best winter they've seen in years - but it's not all over yet.\n\nWith many resorts open well into April (and into May) and operators cutting prices on last-minute bookings it looks set to be a triumphant end to the season. If you're tempted to make the most of it, here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhat will there be enough snow?\n\nMention the words spring skiing and many skiers and snowboarders might picture sunny blue skies above over-worked slopes turning slowly to slush beneath their feet. But the reality is there is often fresh snowfall late season, and what's more, snow still freezes overnight. There's usually a point in the day when a shallow layer of softening snow feels luxurious under ski.\n\nBut things are different this year - in the past week forecasts have revealed that as well as more snow to come in the Alps and North America, temperatures will remain below freezing, even at low elevations. Resorts are expecting up to half a metre more of the white stuff in some areas before the mercury eventually starts to rise and spring arrives in the mountains.\n\nThat said, the weather in the mountains can change quickly and it's uncertain how long these wintery conditions will last - keep an eye on the forecast with our snow reports for resorts around the world, in association with Crystal Ski Holidays.\n\nIs it still safe to head off piste?\n\nThis year the snow pack in the Alps is relatively stable because of the vast amounts of snow fall, and it will get more and more predictable as it melts and refreezes towards the end of the season. Off-piste snow depths are currently the deepest they've been in 40 years in some areas of the Alps, but the stability changes every day.\n\nAs with any other time in the season it's always advisable to venture off piste with a local mountain guide, who will know the best spots of hidden powder (of which there are still many) and know where is safer and where most risky. Dangerous weak layers in the snowpack are less likely this season, but they still exist in certain areas.\n\nBefore heading out into unpatrolled terrain it's always best to scrub up on the top tips on how to avoid avalanches, what to do if you get caught in one and the essential kit to take when heading off piste.\n\nIf heading to any of the popular French resorts, including Courchevel, Méribel, Val Thorens, Val d'Isère and La Plagne, in the Savoie region, check out our regular avalanche reports supplied by expert Henry Schneiwind from Henry's Avalanche Talk.\n\nWhich resorts are best at this time of year?\n\nMany resorts, including low-altitude villages, are still revelling in fantastic snow depths and on-piste conditions, but as the weather starts to change and temperatures rise putting a snow-sure destination, with opening dates that last well into April, at the top of your hit list is the best option.\n\nIn a high-altitude resort good snow is almost guaranteed, even if temperatures are up at lower elevations.\n\nMany resorts host special events and festivals at the end of the season, as the days are longer and the warmer conditions make outdoor après more appealing.\n\nThe late-season sunshine is a popular backdrop for some of the best ski and snowboard festivals, which offer the chance to experience everything from world-famous music acts and comedy to pond skimming competitions and igloo parties.\n\nCrazy events and races don't only happy at the festivals though - check out some of the world's wackiest end-of-season celebrations here.\n\nMost resorts are open until at least mid April, some into May, and what's more there are some fantastic deals available from tour operators. If there was ever a season to book a last-minute trip this is it, because who knows when the mountains will be blessed with such fantastic conditions again.\n\nWhat do I need to pack?\n\nWhile more snow is on its way, sunnier skies are just around the corner as spring arrives - meaning there's a chance to ditch the extra layers and plan for a week of sunning yourself on a high-altitude terrace.\n\nIf you're struggling with what to pack for your late-season trip, our pick of the best outfits for the slopes can help as well as the top ski and snowboard t-shirts and boots for your après sessions. Don't forget all the other essentials though, including a jacket, goggles, helmet and gloves.\n\nIf you do lose the layers and expose yourself to the sun (bikini-skiing optional) make sure to stock up on sun cream and understand which are best to help you avoid that dreaded bright red face or accentuated by white goggle-shaped marks.",

                "body": "Founder of Ancient Greek Sandals, Christina Martini, relays a life in luxury as her daisy-strewn collaboration with Louis Vuitton's head shoe designer, Fabrizio Viti, is finally released.\n\nWhat does luxury mean to you?\n\nFor me, time is luxury. I'm so busy that often I wish I could clone myself so I'd have time for leisure and to travel.\n\nWhich Greek brands do you find exciting right now?\n\nThere are so many to look out for: for clothes - Zeus & Dione; for skincare - Apivita and for jewellery - either Lito or Lalaounis, the latter often worn by Jackie O and Elizabeth Taylor. We collaborated a few years ago on a collection of 9ct-gold plated sandals.\n\nDescribe the process behind your most recent collaboration with Fabrizio Viti.\n\nIt was so easy - Fabrizio and I didn't meet up once but communicated everything through Whatsapp! We were colleagues at Louis Vuitton so we're very attuned to how the other works. I didn't direct him. He wanted to do daisies, I wanted to do traditional sandals: it was a good moment for both of us.\n\nThe inspiration?\n\nDolls. Fabrizio's obsessed with dolls and has a vast collection from all over the world. During our Vuitton days, I remember spending hours of a Japanese research trip traipsing around porcelain doll shops. He has the first Barbie - the first ever Barbie - and a collection of over 1,000 dolls.\n\nDo you collect anything?\n\nShoes, predictably. I have a lot of quite crazy, precious one-offs from when I worked for Louis Vuitton. They're sadly in a warehouse in Athens at the moment but I've always wanted to build a glass-fronted shoe library at home in Corfu - stay tuned.\n\nAnything else?\n\nIt's not much of a collection but I have a pair of Rolexes - one, an Oyster Perpetual Rolex, given to me by my father when I first started working, and the other by my mother-in-law - which I alternate. So I never have any excuse for lateness.\n\nYour favourite place to holiday?\n\nSorrento. One of my favourite hotels there is the stunning Parco dei Principi which was the 1960's brainchild of Italian architect, Gio Ponti. The interiors of the hotel - which lurches over the sea - are completely blue throughout. It's really amazing. I'm hoping to visit again in a few months.\n\nBest hotel ever?\n\nEither Parco dei Principi or La Pause, an eco-lodge I visited in the Marrakech desert a few months ago. It was very disconnected which I loved.\n\nWho would design your dream house?\n\nI would ask the late John Lautner. His 'atomic age' buildings, which are these sweeping glass and cement structures, were revolutionary for the 1950's. Contemporary architecture doesn't interest me but I'm a long-time fan of Bauhaus style.\n\nMost delicious meal you've ever eaten?\n\nNothing beats authentic Japanese sushi, except maybe the sashimi served at Dining's in London.\n\nLast order at the bar?\n\nI usually go for a gin and tonic or Tsipouro on the rocks - you can take the girl out of Greece...",

                "body": "On a good day, Steven Soderbergh's oft-threatened retirement sounds like a royal waste, except for the degree to which it's not to be taken seriously in the least. Unsane, the director's scratchy little doodle of a psychothriller, was shot on an iPhone, and feels like the work of a man who can't decide whether to retire or not. It's rough, to say the least, and that's not just a matter of hasty visuals: the whole thing feels provisional and half-hearted, like a scrunched-up charcoal sketch.\n\nThe best case for the film's existence is Claire Foy, whose performance as a captive inmate at a mental institution is impressively committed, in every sense. It's 10 minutes before her character, the wackily named Sawyer Valentini, winds up in this sterile hospice, following a regular day at her office job and a Tinder date that goes weird.\n\nShe's halfway to sex with some guy in her apartment, then suddenly freaks out and locks herself in the bathroom, remembering a stalker from her past whose impact on her fragile psyche clearly isn't over.\n\nThe next day, she checks in for an experimental therapy session, and before you know it, she's under lock and key, having unwittingly signed away her freedom to a bunch of wholly untrustworthy psychiatrists, one of whom, played under a non-reassuring beard by Joshua Leonard, may or may not be her erstwhile nemesis.",

Hypermisophoniac is a track on Jack White's third and most audacious solo album, a startling sliver of a song that gradually assembles around an irritating synth alarm and teeth-grating percussion. It is as if White has dared himself to build a groove from the least attractive elements available. \"Ain't no fun in robbing a bank,\" shriek varispeed vocals, a teasing comment on the plagiarism that underpins so much pop music.\n\nBoarding House Reach is White's most free-form, experimental offering in a career spanning 15 albums and three fantastic rock bands: the Raconteurs, the Dead Weather and, most notably, garage blues duo the White Stripes. With the latter, White boiled rock down to its basics but, at 42, he is in expansive mood, belatedly embracing hip hop, synthesisers, vocoders and contemporary digital editing techniques.",

                "title": "Being Brunel: inside the new Bristol museum charting the life of the renowned engineer",
                "body": "A giant eight-metre head gazes over one of the galleries at the new Being Brunel museum in Bristol. Complete with stovepipe hat and ubiquitous cigar, it's a fitting image of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a man whose grand ambitions encapsulated the Victorian era and whose mind and extraordinary achievements are celebrated at this immersive attraction.\n\nThe £7.2 million opening on Bristol harbourside is housed in a reconstruction of an 1840s store house and lies hard by one of Brunel's greatest creations - the now beautifully restored SS Great Britain. It boasts an interior recalling the look of the 1851 Great Exhibition, for which Brunel was on the design committee.\n\nThe aim of Being Brunel is to evoke the sense of wonder and invention associated with this brilliant engineer - \"the man who built modern Britain\" - but also to discover what made him so good, the mistakes he made and how his work is interpreted today.\n\nWalking around these imaginatively crafted spaces you soon understand why Brunel was second only to Churchill in the BBC's 2002 series on 100 Greatest Britons. The breadth of his achievements is vast, from railways and ships (he had visions of a seamless journey from London to New York) to bridges, tunnels and stations.\n\nThe museum comprises various rooms that touch on his world, beginning with a recreation of the dining room at his home in London's Duke Street. The walls depict paintings commissioned by Brunel of scenes from Shakespeare's plays (he was a big admirer); the room was where Brunel and his wife, Mary, entertained family, friends and influential acquaintances who could help Brunel get his projects off the ground. \"Talking\" family heads give further insights into the man, while one of the most telling exhibits is an almost perfect drawing of a rocking horse done by Brunel when his was just six years old.\n\nEvident too is Brunel's relationship with his hugely influential, French-born engineer father Marc and his early desire to be the leading creator of his generation.\n\nOther rooms tackle his numerous projects, entrepreneurial capabilities and, importantly, his skill as artistic designer. There are links to the hugely ambitious Thames Tunnel (which Isambard engineered with his father) to his design for a new wider railway gauge to make train travel less shaky. Brunel's frustration that the rattling steam engines obstructed his famed ability to draw a perfect circle fuelled his determination that his Great Western Railway project would offer a smoother ride. One interactive exhibit allows visitors to try and draw on a circle on a rocking carriage.\n\nAnd then dominating everything is that huge head which visitors can enter for an audio-visual experience that offers an imagined interpretation of Brunel's mind - what he was seeing and thinking at certain times.\n\nElsewhere there are designs for the beautiful Egyptian-influenced Clifton Suspension Bridge, the SS Great Britain (highlighting why a late decision over how it was propelled prompted a row with investors) and, his final project, The Great Eastern (one of its funnels is on display). All are detailed and chronicled at the museum that also incorporates the structurally restored Great Western Steamship Company's dock office in Bristol where Brunel once worked.\n\nEqually intriguing though is the section on Brunel the Celebrity. By the 1850s he was a star and the British public were fascinated by him and his projects; newspapers reported every detail of his work and thousands of souvenirs, some on display here, were produced to commemorate his works.\n\nPart genius part showman, Brunel would work 20 hours a day and smoke 48 cigars (his daily cigar box is on display), while further insights come from his technical instruments, note- and sketchbooks and private diaries. In almost illegible handwriting, these reveal his ambitions, dreams, self-belief and can-do spirit (nil disperandum was his motto), but also his doubts and fears. One entry says: \"I am always building castles in the air, what time I waste.\"\n\nHe also seemed to become much tougher emotionally. The loss of 100 men during the building of Box Tunnel on the Great Western Railway was regarded as a \"small list considering the very heavy works and the immense of (gun)powder used.\"\n\nAt the museum's entrance is the defining image of the man as Brunel poses in front of the immense chains of the Great Eastern. It is a snapshot of the Industrial Revolution and a diminutive genius with a huge legacy. Architect Norman Foster suggests of Brunel (in a quote at the museum): \"[He] believed in the future and who saw technology in a tradition of making that future better.\"\n\nBeing Brunel (ssgreatbritain.org/about-us/being-brunel) opens on March 23; adults £16.50; children (5-16) £9.50.",

The final few steps when you are climbing Everest are the hardest and that is when you can lose people along the way.\n\n\"I think the defeat to USA was a bit of a reality check and shows how much work we still to have to do, but it has been a good start and I've really enjoyed it.\"\n\nEngland's next game is a World Cup qualifier against Wales at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium on Friday April 6th with the FA confident the stadium will have a capacity crowd of more than 30,000 people.",

                "body": "Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel with the inauguration on Thursday of an Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv.\n\nAir India 139 landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport after a flight of over 7-1/2 hours, marking a diplomatic shift for Riyadh that Israel says was fuelled by shared concern over Iranian influence in the region.\n\n\"This is a really historic day that follows two years of very, very intensive work,\" Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said in a radio interview, adding that using Saudi airspace cut travel time to India by around two hours and would reduce ticket prices.\n\nSaudi Arabia - birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest shrines - does not recognise Israel.\n\nRiyadh has not formally confirmed granting the Air India plane overflight rights. While the move ended a 70-year-old ban on planes flying to or from Israel through Saudi airspace, there is as yet no indication that it will be applied for any Israeli airline.\n\nThe Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner entered Saudi airspace at around 1645 GMT and overflew the kingdom at 40,000 feet for about three hours, coming within 60 km (37 miles) of the capital Riyadh, according to the Flightradar monitoring app. It then crossed over Jordan and the occupied West Bank into Israel.\n\nThe airliner had earlier flown over Oman, according to Flightradar. Officials from Oman, which also does not recognise Israel, could not be reached for comment.\n\nIsrael's flag carrier El Al, excluded from the Saudi route, says its Indian competitor now has an unfair advantage.\n\nEl Al currently flies four times a week to the Indian city of Mumbai. Those flights take around 7 hours and 40 minutes, following a Red Sea route that swings toward Ethiopia to avoid Saudi airspace.\n\nIf El Al planes were to fly on to New Delhi, a destination El Al has said it might be interested in, they would require another two hours - and significantly more fuel.\n\nInterviewed on Israel's Army Radio, Levin voiced confidence that El Al would eventually be allowed to use Saudi airspace.\n\n\"You know, they said the Saudis wouldn't let any flight pass. So here, the Saudis are permitting it. It is a process, I think. Ultimately this (El Al overflights) will happen too,\" he said.\n\nAsked if any other foreign airlines might follow Air India by opening routes to Tel Aviv over Saudi Arabia, Levin said he has been in negotiations with Singapore Airlines and a carrier from the Philippines, which he did not name.\n\n\"They are certainly showing readiness and desire to fly to Israel, and I don't know if they will also receive permission like the Indian airline,\" he said.\n\nSingapore Airlines did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Saudi officials could not immediately be reached.",

                "title": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic should be remembered at Man Utd for reintroducing a winner's mentality",
                "body": "It tends to be pretty obvious when a player is delivering platitudes and going through the motions in the interests of diplomacy but there was nothing contrived about Marcus Rashford's answer as he waited eagerly to interject. The subject had turned to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the young Manchester United striker's eyes had widened as he began to discuss the Swede's impact at Old Trafford.\n\n\"What I have learnt from him is irreplaceable,\" Rashford said. \"You will see the benefits in years to come. No other forward in the world could have come in and been able to pass on so much. There is nobody else that we could have learnt that much about football - and mentally - from. For me, it's the mentality he's brought with him that's the biggest thing I'm going to take from what he's offered us. His mentality alone is what puts him head ahead of the game. Before he's even kicked a ball on the pitch, in his mind he's already ahead of everyone else, and that's a massive mentality to have.\"\n\nRashford was talking in April last year, a few days after Ibrahimovic had succumbed to a cruciate knee ligament injury against Anderlecht in the Europa League that would bring a premature end to a debut United campaign which had yielded 28 goals. It was an injury that would also mark his last meaningful contribution in a red shirt, an unfortunate end for a player whose contribution at Old Trafford may ultimately be measured as much for what he brought off the field as on it.\n\nThere was a sad inevitability about the news on Thursday that United had released Ibrahimovic from his contract, which still had over three months to run, in order to allow him to join Los Angeles Galaxy as he prepares for a career swansong in Major League Soccer in the US following that brief, aborted comeback. It also raises some questions about the wisdom of United offering a new 12-month deal last August to a then 35-year-old who had suffered such a serious injury.\n\nIt felt very much like sentimental indulgence and so it has proved but, whatever the rights and wrongs of that particular move, Ibrahimovic's time at United will remembered for those first 12 months when he led by example and reintroduced a winner's mentality to a meek, cowed dressing room far removed from the uncompromising place it once was.\n\nIndeed, to truly gauge Ibrahimovic's impact is to recognise just how far standards had fallen at a club once synonymous with character, resilience, big, forceful personalities and iron will. Jose Mourinho's thinking may appear more muddled now but even before the manager was in situ at United he had established very clearly that the dressing room lacked leaders and natural born winners. Ibrahimovic's signing served to address that problem head on.\n\nThey laugh about it now but it became very apparent to some when they first witnessed this supposed veteran strip down to the waist in pre-season and start striding around the dressing room in full voice, a rippling six-pack the feature of a towering, muscular 6ft 5in frame, that this was a player who would not tolerate any drop in standards. It was intimidating, especially at first. Ibrahimovic would be incredibly exacting and demanding in training, rebuking team-mates for misplaced passes or dropping off in the closing stages of sessions. More often than not, though, he would not need to say anything.\n\n\"You'd just get that withering stare,\" one source said. \"The fans have probably seen it in matches - the one where he looks disgusted at what he's just witnessed.\"\n\nJuan Mata encapsulated Ibrahimovic's impact quite neatly midway through last season. \"He has brought a lot of things to the team, not just his mentality, but his way of understanding football, his way of behaving with the players in the dressing room,\" he said. \"He is always pushing buttons in the right moment and in the right way trying to motivate everyone.\"\n\nGreat things also come to an end and it is time to move on after two fantastic seasons with Manchester United. Thank you to the club, the fans, the team, the coach, the staff and everybody who shared with me this part of my history. #foreverred pic.twitter.com/vo1Gs3SUHL -- Zlatan Ibrahimović (@Ibra_official)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nAccusations of insufferable arrogance are invariably misplaced. Ibrahimovic is arrogant but in the best sense and playful with it. It is no secret he would strut around the club pretending he was God but always with a twinkle in his eye. Staff say he will be missed not least because he was so funny, that lofty glare masking a very sharp sense of humour. He would encourage the self-proclaimed \"lion\" persona and parody himself in the process.\n\n\"I bet you wish your husband looked like this\" Ibrahimovic told one female member of staff before erupting into laughter. Asked to do social media for the club, Ibrahimovic replied, deadpan: \"Why, do you want me to increase your following?\"\n\nMourinho had claimed Ibrahimovic would be a \"gift\" for Rashford and Rashford agreed but it was not only the England striker who benefited. Ibrahimovic was generous with his time with the young players, and always ready to speak his mind when he saw something he did not like. When Anthony Martial's representative, Philippe Lamboley, claimed publicly that they were exploring the option of a move to Sevilla in January last year, Ibrahimovic waded in and pulled the France forward aside, bluntly telling him to park such talk, buckle down and focus on making a success of things at United.\n\nIt was a measure of the significance Mourinho placed on Ibrahimovic that, when the manager spotted the Swede's wife, Helena Segar, a very strong character herself, as he walked past the players' lounge at Old Trafford after one game, he stopped to tell her: \"Thank you for keeping your man happy here. It's really important.\"\n\nAnd no one could underplay Ibrahimovic's significance on the pitch. Yes, he missed some big chances in some big games that would prove costly and in the weeks leading up to that ruptured anterior cruciate the impact of being asked to play so many games had begun to take its toll but there were times when he carried the team.\n\nEleven goals in 11 matches between Nov 27 and Jan 15 of that first season featured numerous decisive moments. Then again in the February it was Ibrahimovic who kept rising to the occasion, a hat-trick in a Europa League game against St-Etienne followed by a late winner in a difficult FA Cup tie against Blackburn Rovers and then, most memorably, two goals in the League Cup final against Southampton at Wembley, including a dramatic 87th minute winner.\n\nIt was certainly interesting to talk to Ibrahimovic after the game. He has an acute sense of theatre, Ibrahimovic, and he was well and truly playing to the crowd as he fielded questions from reporters about his form and future. One exchange was particularly amusing. Reporter: \"You've said you're like a lion, how ...\". Ibrahimovic, interrupting: \"Like a lion? I'm not like a lion. I am a lion. I don't want to be a lion. The lion is born a lion. It means I'm a lion!\" Suffice to say, Matteo Darmian does not talk this way but then few do.\n\nThere were signs before the injury of Ibrahimovic getting restless, though. He had won the title in nine of his previous ten seasons with Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris St-Germain and to see United so cut adrift and with so much work to do frustrated him. At one stage, he even suggested the club needed to prove they were willing to match his own ambition if he was to stay on.\n\n\"Everything depends on what you want and what the club wants, what the vision of the club is because I said from day one I didn't come here to waste time, I came here to win. If you want to win bigger then you have to create bigger.\"\n\nHis comeback in November, only 212 days after sustaining that injury against Anderlecht, seemed too good to be true and that was born out over 187 minutes of laboured football before Ibrahimovic concluded that he was not up to it. It was no disgrace. It can take another six to nine months following a lengthy rehabilitation process for much younger players to get fully back up to speed after a cruciate injury. The problem was, at 36, the luxury of time was not something Ibrahimovic had at United.\n\nIt was certainly a disappointment that supporters did not get to see a fit Ibrahimovic for a second season but it will have been of more disappointment to many of them that he did not come to the club several years before.",

Live-gaming\n\nMichelle Henry, managing director, HNS signs\n\nOne of our best team-building activities was a live gaming experience at Grange Live Gaming, which runs laser tag and airsoft games.\n\nIt cost us £60 per person and we paid for it through a trade swap.\n\nJust before we did this activity, we were struggling with communication: messages from clients were not being passed on and I was not being updated on progress. We couldn't explain why it was happening, but it was causing problems and this activity really\n\nhelped.\n\nWe were split into three separate teams of four in a live-action experience where we were trapped in a research facility that had been overrun by zombies, and our combined goal was to eliminate them.\n\nWe all had individual tasks, such as using medical kits if someone was caught, or keeping the zombies at bay with pistols.\n\nIf one of us failed, then we all did. It made us plan and devise strategies and improved how we communicated.\n\nAfter the experience, we discussed what we learnt and how we\n\ncould put it into practice at work. We found that it helped us avoid any unnecessary waffling and get right to the point. We're now always clear, concise and consistent.\n\nLearn to play an instrument\n\nAndy Cockburn, chief executive, Mention Me\n\nWe run surprise team-building events every quarter, one of which involved learning how to play the ukulele and writing our own anthem at Power of Uke.\n\nIt costs £1,500 for 20 people, which, with a 35-strong team, is not cheap, but having sustained some very positive team morale recently and doubled our headcount over the past year, it's worth it.\n\nEveryone worked with people whom they didn't know and built new relationshipsRebecca Newenham, Get Ahead VA\n\nThe ukulele event was one of the first times that the whole company had worked on one project together. It was great for showing what we could achieve in a\n\nshort time-frame; we wrote and learnt to play a song in two hours.\n\nIt also helped us to think about what we want our business to look like and how we work together in a creative environment.\n\nThe workshops showed that learning a new skill together, breaking down barriers and not taking ourselves too seriously results in happier people back at the office.\n\nHost a workshop\n\nRebecca Newenham, founder, Get Ahead VA\n\nWe're a virtual team, so I run workshops every quarter to get together physically and work on our personal and business development.\n\nThe workshop that we do is called Nuggets of Learning and it costs £300, which is a discounted price because I'm a regular client.\n\nI plan the cost of a year's workshops at the start of the year.\n\nOur most recent one was on the topic of brand influence and the central question was: what shadow do you cast as an employee and what shadow do we cast as a business?\n\nEach of us had to describe their own personal brand, then\n\nchoose a logo that appealed to them, such as Volvo or Starbucks, describe why they chose it and what it meant to them. Then we were split into two groups, chosen at random, to work on the company's own brand.\n\nWe had to approach a horse, take it by its rein and lead it around barrelsJames Ray, Armadillo CRM\n\nEveryone worked with people whom they didn't know and built new relationships.\n\nImportantly, staff learned about the impact that they have on the business, because although we work remotely, we still represent the wider brand, and what each of us do makes a difference to how people perceive the firm.\n\nIt also created a more close-knit team; beforehand, the team would communicate mostly through me, but now they feel more comfortable picking up the phone or emailing each other directly.\n\nTrain with a horse\n\nJames Ray, chief executive, Armadillo CRM\n\nWe recently completed a management buyout, so it was important\n\nfor our leadership team to stop, reset and refocus as we started a totally new chapter.\n\nWe work with executive coach Jude Jennison, who runs\n\nLeaders by Nature, a training company that uses horses to help senior teams improve their leadership skills. It was £1,500, but the cost depends on the type of training.\n\nIt was a unique experience. We had to approach a horse, take it by its rein and lead it around two barrels and back again.\n\nIf the horse sensed that you didn't believe that it would follow\n\nyou, it didn't move, but when approached with confidence and a clear sense of purpose, it walked straight away.\n\nIt taught us that leadership is as much about the the heart and body as it is about the mind.\n\nWe also learnt that it's easy to lead and engage people who want to be led, but there's work to be done in encouraging everyone to get behind you, so we have since started regular working lunch sessions with small groups of staff to ensure that everyone feels invested in\n\nour direction.",

However, on a statutory measure they slipped 4pc, a decline attributed foreign currency movements.\n\nHeadline pre-tax profit was 12pc lower at £217m, but crashed 42pc on a statutory basis to £199m. The numbers caused alarm, with the shares dropping 10pc.\n\nAndrew Reynolds-Smith, chief executive, played down the results, calling the first half \"encouraging\" as the company focuses on a restructuring designed to make it more sustainable, with a fresh focus on R&D to develop new products.\n\n\"Over the medium-term, we are confident that we will achieve organic revenue growth above our chosen markets, which in aggregate are growing 3pc to 4pc annually,\" Mr Reynolds-Smith said.\n\nHowever, analysts questioned whether the results were the basis for longer-term growth.\n\nSandy Morris at Jefferies said it would be \"churlish\" not to call the performance a \"step forward\". However, he cautioned that \"even growth in the second half may not prove the group's strategy is working as end markets are likely to be more helpful in some years than others\".\n\n\"There is a risk that the goalposts will move so that 2pc to 4pc organic growth is perceived as merely adequate rather than transformational.\"\n\nSmiths has proposed an interim dividend of 13.8p, up 1.8pc.",

                "body": "Some investors have too much tax relief in their pension pots, and will now have to repay the money with interest.\n\nAccountancy firm RSM said it had seen a rising number of pension schemes that had claimed too much tax relief on behalf of individuals, meaning that not all the £8bn handed out in pension tax relief each year was correct.\n\nThe issue affects employees who pay their pension by \"salary sacrifice\". This means pension contributions are taken before tax and National Insurance are applied, saving the employee money.\n\nHowever, because the deduction has been made before any tax was taken, the contribution is not eligible for the pension tax relief handed out by the Government.\n\nRSM said it had seen evidence where incorrect information between the company and pension scheme had resulted in the scheme wrongly claiming Government tax relief.\n\nThe error means that individuals' pension pots will be larger than they should be, and projections of pension income that individuals use to plan their retirement will turn out to be badly overstated.\n\nIn addition, those who are already drawing their pension could face a cut to their income.\n\nHMRC issued guidance earlier this month on the problem. It has introduced a penalty charge for those who do not pay back the money soon enough, which will be effective from April 6 this year.\n\nPension schemes - not individuals - must pay back the overclaimed tax relief within 90 days of finding the error. If they fail to do so they must pay 3pc interest on the money. Previously there was no penalty for schemes.\n\nRachel de Souza, of RSM, said the biggest hurdle was spotting that the error had happened in the first place. She said: \"Any individual won't have a clue there is anything untoward. They will likely get a pension statement from their provider, look at it and think they have no idea what it's talking about - rather than spotting overclaimed tax relief.\n\n\"Until somebody goes in and looks, neither side knows they've got a problem. The pension scheme thinks all is OK, the company thinks it's OK and the individual is none the wiser. It's one of those really unfortunate situations where something has gone horribly wrong, and at the end of the day it is likely to be the individual employee who actually suffers.\"\n\nAn HMRC spokesman said: \"Where tax relief has been claimed in error, we work closely with schemes to ensure the overpaid tax relief is repaid. The repayment is made by the fund.\"",

                "body": "The 787 Dreamliner is said to afford its passengers more space. It boasts larger windows helping create a lighter, more pleasant cabin experience, while its new, quieter, fuel efficient engines promise a peaceful flight. It even has a special air filter system that reduces dry eyes and jet lag.\n\nNo wonder passengers booked to travel on Boeing's newest model are pretty pumped.\n\nSo what happens when an airline switches the plane at the last minute, for one that doesn't even have innovative fade-out window blinds?\n\nThis scenario has been playing out recently aftar low-cost, long-haul airline Norwegian, which boasts 27 of the \"most technologically advanced aircraft in the skies today\", had to lease older aircraft on its London to New York route.\n\nThe carrier, which is understood to be replacing the engines on some of its Dreamliners, said it was swapping the 787 out for an Airbus A330 courtesy of Portuguese charter airline Hi-Fly.\n\nCue a few irritated passengers.\n\n\"Everybody avoid [Norwegian]. They'll stick you on an eight-hour flight with no entertainment!\" wrote Hannah Cooper on Twitter. Oh and leg room and seats are crap. Booked a Norwegian Airways [sic] flight, then it got changed to Hi-Fly.\"\n\nEverybody avoid @Fly_Norwegian. They'll stick you on an 8 hour flight with no entertainment! Oh and leg room and seats are crap... Booked a Norwegian Airways flight, then it got changed to Hi-Fly. Turn up at the airport and it's Wamos? Such a joke. pic.twitter.com/cL7opEndHA -- Hannah Cooper ⚡️ (@hmcooperx)\n\nMarch 7, 2018\n\nAnother, Ellie Smith, said: \"Not impressed that our outbound LGW-JFK was operated by someone called Hi-Fly. Non-existent entertainment and awful food. Not what I signed up for and has ruined your reputation as a good value airline.\"\n\nFlew back from JFK to LGW on the 13th March. It was subcontracted out to Hi-fly. Not happy as there was no running water, no hot drinks, half the toilets not working. Very disappointed. @Fly_Norwegian -- ♥Teresa♥ (@teresa1974)\n\nMarch 17, 2018\n\nWhy do airlines fly other airlines' flights?\n\nA spokesperson for Norwegian told us: \"We would only hire the services of another carrier where necessary to avoid cancelling flights and causing inconvenience to our customers.\"\n\nNorwegian are by no means the only carrier to use third-party aircraft for their routes.\n\nCodeshares are the most common instances, when one airline operates a flight on behalf of another because they have a contract together or are in the same airline alliance, such as Sky Team.\n\nFor example, Virgin Atlantic and Delta share a number of flights, running each other's services to a number of US cities. British Airways and American, as well as Finnair and Iberia, do the same across the Atlantic, while BA joins forces with Japan Airlines for flights heading east.\n\nThe benefit to the passenger is they have more choice of routes and services when viewing one airline's website, and connecting flights between friendly carriers are aligned for smooth onward journeys. Airlines, meanwhile, enjoy extending their reach to destinations they would not otherwise serve.\n\nPassengers keen to know who is actually running their flight should check their booking site carefully. It will normally say along with details of date and timings, \"operated by...\".\n\nIn addition to codeshares, leased aircraft might be used on a more short-term basis for operational reasons. Most noticeable is a wet lease, when one airline hires another's liveried plane complete with crew.\n\nBudget airlines might use wet leasing to cope with spikes in demand over the summer, without needing to purchase new aircraft. Last year, EasyJet signed a deal with Latvian carrier SmartLynx Airlines to run a number of services between April and October.\n\nBritish Airways leased nine Qatar Airways A320s and their crews last year to handle its services when its own staff were striking.\n\nFor political reasons, EgyptAir's flights to Israel are operated by Air Sinai.\n\nCan I guarantee what aircraft I will be on?\n\nWe're afraid not. Even if your flight is run by the original airline, the aircraft might be changed.\n\nThe A380, the world's largest passenger plane, seems to be particularly popular with travellers, who vent their fury when it is replaced by a Boeing 747 or 777.\n\n\"Damn. Singapore Airlines swapped my A380 for a 747. Oh well, maybe the next leg,\" wrote Giles White on Twitter.\n\n\"It now turns out my [British Airways] flight that was due to be an A380 has been swapped to a 747,\" wrote Andy Taylor. \"As much as I love them I planned my route out to get a ride on an A380.\"\n\nBA told Mr Taylor: \"We can never guarantee a specific aircraft due to operational reasons. We can look at changing your booking but there would be a charge for this.\"\n\nCan I claim compensation?\n\nAgain, sadly not.\n\nNorwegian's spokesperson said: \"The operator of our flights are visible to customers throughout the booking process on Norwegian.com.\n\n\"If customers had originally booked on to a Norwegian operated service and it changes to a wet leased aircraft, we would contact passengers in advance and offer a free rebooking or refund if they no longer wish to travel.\"\n\nGuidance from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says airlines must tell passengers \"at point of sale\" who will be operating the flight. Airlines have an obligation to tell passengers who will be conducting their flight.\n\nThe CAA says passengers check the terms and conditions of their booking thoroughly before parting with their money.",

                "body": "Gaby Wood talks to friends of Bernadette McNulty, the much-loved former Telegraph music editor who died this month\n\n\"When I think of Bernadette, what comes to mind are a million different acts of kindness,\" remembers Bernadette McNulty's school friend Sarah Smyth. Bernadette, who was an editor and writer at the Telegraph for 11 years, died on March 2 while on holiday in Oman. An obituary was published last week; you can read more about her life and her worldview there. Here, we'd like to try to conjure the texture of her presence, and some of the particular ways in which she mattered to those of us who miss her.\n\nMany have mentioned the number of friends Bernadette had. That is true, yet the span was less significant than her attentiveness to each. Her close friends have said, independently of one another, that she knew them better than they knew themselves. In remembering her, a curious inversion emerges: she was in large part about others.\n\nWhich is not to say she was a soft touch. Trish Onderdonck-Young, who went to nursery school with her, recalls that Bernadette had high standards early on. The day a fire engine visited Weoley Hill Play School in Birmingham, Bernadette, already advanced in the art of scepticism, appeared puzzled that the rest of the class was so easily impressed. Much later, when the pair were in secondary school, Bernadette's gift for discussion and debate blossomed. \"At times it seemed that she wanted to argue for argument's sake, but of course she was simply developing her art,\" her friend points out fondly.\n\nHer wit was dry but never merciless. One colleague reflects that it was \"the precision of the piss-taking\" that impressed him. Her irony contained insight and indulgence: because she cared to know the worst, her exposure of your foibles felt somehow celebratory. \"Please lie down in the grass for five minutes,\" she once advised a panicky friend - a characteristic instruction, both tree-hugging and Jean Brodie. \"I was lucky to have her as an ally,\" says Neil McCormick, who as this paper's rock critic spoke to her almost daily for years. Bernadette used to refer to a friend's young daughter as a \"loving warrior queen\"; the phrase contains much of her own compassion and fierceness and resilience.\n\nAll of this, though, was barely a match for constancy of another kind. Often, she behaved as though she were older than her older friends. This was remarked on even in primary school. In adulthood, when someone joked about her being a certain colleague's \"office wife\", she replied: \"Sometimes I feel like I'm his mum.\"\n\nHer own mother, a nurse, died of cancer the year Bernadette took her GCSEs, and Bernadette, whose father had been disabled in an industrial accident, had taken time out to look after her. Onderdonck-Young points out that \"the impact this had never left her\". Her friend Helen Brown thinks that it was perhaps because of her sorrow that \"she really knew how to treasure fun. It was hard won\".\n\nIn the matter of fun, Bernadette was contagiously anarchic. Smyth remembers hitchhiking with her as a teenager: at one point Bernadette leaned out the window of a moving truck to pass a lighter to a man in another moving truck. Her hunger for vintage clothing was almost unquenchable, and her ability to wear it well without peer. She loved music and all the different ways it could make you feel - in your heart or your dancing feet. When she wrote about it, for this paper and others, she could make you feel it, too. Listening to the Ramones, she wrote, \"you can almost feel the scorching New York pavements through your sneakers\". She was always the first on the dance floor. One ex-partner refers to dancing as \"her superpower\", and a friend and former colleague, picturing her dancing at his wedding, calls it \"dancing as a public service\".\n\nBernadette was diagnosed when young with scoliosis, a condition that curved her spine into a question mark. Refusing the rod offered by surgeons, she answered the question with swimming and yoga. She was devoted to both - swimming was her passion, and offered the chance, as she put it, to \"fly weightlessly\". Recently she was contemplating becoming a yoga instructor, but worried that she wouldn't be able to demonstrate certain poses because of her spine. Her teacher and friend Debbie Blunden felt the reverse was true. \"She was very inspiring to watch. She had learned to align herself so that when she did a headstand she was able to become straight.\" Blunden adds: \"I don't think she ever saw the beauty in her own practice.\"\n\nThat could stand for much of what Bernadette didn't know she had, or didn't know she gave. Many of us can see it still.",
