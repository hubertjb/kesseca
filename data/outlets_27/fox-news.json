                "body": "Officials are doing their best to combat the \"ongoing problem.\" (iStock)\n\nVisiting America's national parks will forever change you. The remarkable beauty that these vast areas have to offer is almost impossible to truly describe -- which is why people are often tempted to take a piece of the park home with them in the form of a plant, rock, or something more precious. But it should go without saying you should never, ever vandalize or steal from a national park.\n\nSome people, it seems, didn't get that memo. And it's become such an issue that rangers at Saguaro National Park in Arizona have been forced to put microchips in some of the park's famed Saguaros, a variety of cactus that is capable of growing more than 40 feet tall and can live upwards of 200 years.\n\n\"It's ironic that we set aside great places like Saguaro National Park and people think that they can just come take the iconic cactus for which the park is named,\" Kevin Dahl, a program manager for the National Park Conservation Association in Arizona, told KTAR News. Dahl added that stealing the plants has become a lucrative business as a Saguaro can be sold for as much as $100 per foot.\n\nAccording to officials, a number of the cactus plants have been microchipped. However, they note that while the chips can identify a stolen plant, they cannot track them. But they are hopeful this new technique will deter thieves in the future.\n\nAnd though officials don't have an exact count on how many of the plants have been stolen, they know the impact has been significant.\n\n\"It's not a problem that's happening every day, but it's an ongoing problem,\" Ray O'Neil, chief ranger at the park, said. \"Our biggest hope is that it's a deterrent; that people recognize that if they steal cacti from Saguaro National Park, that there's a chance that we're going to be able to identify that the cactus came from the park.\"",

In Kuala Lumpur, darkness fell on the Petronas Towers.\n\nIt lasts for just an hour and its power is purely symbolic. But in countries around the world, at 8:30 p.m. local time, people were switching off the lights Saturday for Earth Hour, a global call for international unity on the importance of climate change.\n\nSince beginning in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has spread to more than 180 countries, with tens of millions of people joining in, from turning off the porch lights to letting the Opera House go dark.\n\nThose 60 minutes are \"an opportunity to adopt a shifting of the consumption culture, and behavior change towards sustainability,\" Indian Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a statement.\n\nMany people, of course, barely notice. Around India Gate, New Delhi's monument to the Indian dead in World War I, thousands of people continued Saturday with the city's nightly warm-weather ritual. They bought ice cream and cheap plastic trinkets. They flirted. Young children rode in electric carts that their parents rented for a few minutes at a stretch.\n\nBut for an hour the arch stayed dark, a silent call for change.\n\nIn Jordan, the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature arranged 11,440 candles on a hilltop in the capital of Amman, establishing a Guinness World Record for the largest candle mosaic.\n\nThe candles spelled the Earth Hour motto of \"60+.\" However, attempts to light the candles largely failed because of wind on the hilltop, which is close to the city's landmark, the Amman Citadel.",

                "title": "AP Explains: Trump's policy on transgender troops",
                "body": "PALM BEACH, Fla. - President Donald Trump has issued an order supporting his push to ban most transgender troops from serving in the U.S. military except under \"limited circumstances.\" But the decision is expected to be the subject of an ongoing legal fight in the months ahead.\n\nThe White House announced the decision late Friday, shortly after the president arrived at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, completing a process that followed Trump's surprise announcement on Twitter last year that he would reverse an Obama administration plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly.\n\nIn a memo to the president, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pointed to \"substantial risks\" with allowing military personnel who seek to undertake a treatment to change their gender or who question their gender identity.\n\nMattis also said exempting those in the military from \"well-established mental health, physical health and sex-based standards\" applying to all service members could hurt \"military effectiveness and lethality.\" But the policy includes narrow exemptions allowing some transgender members to serve.\n\nThe Pentagon has not released data on the number of transgender people serving, but a Rand Corp. study previously estimated between 1,320 and 6,630, out of 1.3 million active-duty troops.\n\nSeveral legal challenges have blocked Trump's efforts to enact a ban, and four federal courts have already ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\nCivil rights advocates said they would continue the legal fight, which could eventually reach the Supreme Court.\n\nBefore the policy was announced on Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said it would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nHOW THE POLICY WORKS\n\nMattis wrote in the 48-page memo that U.S. troops who require or have already had gender reassignment surgery should be disqualified from military service.\n\nService members with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria,\" or those with discomfort with their biological sex, would also be banned -- but with some exceptions.\n\nCurrent transgender service members who have not yet undergone reassignment surgery are allowed to remain in the military, as long as they have been medically stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before joining the military and are able to deploy across the globe.\n\nIt also allows currently serving service members to remain if they were diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the Obama administration's policy took effect and prior to the start of the new Trump policy. Those service members are allowed to serve in their preferred gender and receive medical treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nTHE PATHWAY TO THE DECISION\n\nDuring President Barack Obama's final year in office, the Pentagon announced it would allow transgender individuals to serve openly in the military and service members could not be discharged solely based on their gender identity.\n\nThe process was still under final review when Trump took office. Mattis announced in June 2017 that he would delay enacting the policy for six months while the military studied the issue.\n\nTrump in July 2017 declared on Twitter that the U.S. would not \"accept or allow ... transgender individuals to serve in any capacity\" in the military. The tweets caught the Pentagon off guard and were followed by the review of the policies.\n\nThe president received recommendations from Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military, leading to Friday's announcement.\n\nLEGAL CHALLENGES\n\nSeveral legal challenges to Trump's proposed ban are ongoing. At least four federal judges have refused to allow the ban to go into effect. Because of the injunctions, the Pentagon has been allowing transgender individuals to enlist since January.\n\nOne of the forefronts of the legal fight is in California, where a federal judge rejected a Trump administration attempt to throw out a lawsuit asking for the ban to be voided. California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said Friday the state would \"continue to vigorously defend the rights of transgender individuals.\"\n\nLambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN, meanwhile, said they would seek a permanent injunction on Tuesday before a federal judge in Seattle.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement late Friday that it would defend the Pentagon's authority to \"implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation\" and would ask the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions.\n\nREACTION TO TRUMP'S PLAN\n\nThe response to the White House announcement has largely fallen along partisan lines, with Democrats and civil rights groups opposing the plan and Republicans and conservatives approving of it.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called it a \"hateful ban\" aimed at humiliating transgender members of the military.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the conservative group Family Research Council, said Trump had kept his pledge to \"end the Obama era of social experimentation in our nation's military\" and the policy would move the military away from \"political correctness.\"\n\n__\n\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",

                "title": "Trump, GOP leaders face backlash over $1.3 trillion spending package",
                "body": "President Trump signed $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill despite threatening to veto the legislation; Congressman Dave Brat reacts on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nPresident Trump faces losing support from his base in the wake of his decision Friday to sign a controversial and much-derided $1.3 trillion spending bill -- over not only its size but its failure to fund his campaign promise of a wall on the U.S. southern border.\n\nTrump briefly threatened to veto the legislation, voted through the House and Senate on Thursday and early Friday in order to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nConservatives balked at the $1.3 trillion price tag, as well as the failure to promote Republican causes such as the defunding of Planned Parenthood and the funding of the wall on the southern border in particular. While the legislation served up $1.6 billion for border security, it mainly consisted of repairs and additions to already existing fencing.\n\nCongressional leaders and the White House noted that it increased funding for the military, infrastructure and also grants to fight the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nTrump blindsided White House aides and lawmakers when he tweeted Friday morning that he was considering vetoing the legislation over it's failure to include funding for the border wall as well as a fix for the expiring Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that grants protection to illegal immigrants brought to the country as children.\n\nBut Trump eventually signed the mammoth legislation reluctantly, saying in remarks to the press with other members of the administration that, in order to secure a necessary increase in military spending, he had to give money to Democratic projects that he derided as a \"wasted sum of money.\"\n\n\"It's not right, and it's very bad for our country,\" he said.\n\nBut he said military spending was vital and it was that concern that overrode his thoughts about vetoing the legislation.\n\nTRUMP SIGNS $1.3 TRILLION SPENDING BILL, DESPITE EARLIER THREAT TO VETO\n\n\"Therefore, as a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this bill...But I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again,\" he said.\n\nYet despite his distancing himself from it, the very act of him signing it enraged his base. A White House official told Axios that the reaction to the signing \"is the hardest I've ever seen the base turn on Trump over anything.\"\n\n\"A big reason why people voted for him was because of his apparent willingness to stand up to the entrenched political class in both parties,\" the official said. \"Voters wanted a fighter who wouldn't back down to 'the swamp' like a 'typical politician.'\"\n\nConservative commentator Ann Coulter, who in 2016 wrote a book called \"In Trump we Trust,\" told Fox News Radio's Tom Shillue that the ramifications will hit the GOP in the midterms, particularly in the House.\n\n\"The House will definitely flip, why would anyone vote Republican?\" she said.\n\nOn Twitter, she also congratulated \"President Schumer\" and agreed with Trump that he won't sign another bill like that, but added that was because a Democratic House would impeach him.\n\n\"The president was really sold a bill of goods here,\" Christopher Ruddy, Newsmax's chief executive, who is regularly in touch with Trump, told The Washington Post. \"Conservatives look at this omnibus bill and say, 'This is not why they elected Donald Trump. This is not a good bill for him to sign.' \"\n\nCommentator Michelle Malkin told Fox and Friends that she was \"disgusted\" with the legislation, but aimed most of her anger at congressional leadership.\n\n\"I'm beyond disappointed; I'm disgusted,\" Malkin said. \"I'm disgusted with the so-called GOP leadership. This falls squarely on the shoulders of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. It is business as usual.\"\n\nEven in Congress, there was significant opposition to the legislation. The conservative House Freedom Caucus had encouraged Trump ahead of the signing to veto the bill, while budget hawk Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., repeatedly slammed the bill, later saying: \"Maybe the GOP holding hands Democrats isn't such a great idea.\"\n\nThe Trump team continued to point the blame at Congress, with Trump campaign advisor Katrina Pierson tweeting back to Paul: \"It would be more helpful to change out your leadership instead of doing everything possible to keep them in place.\"\n\nBut other advisers were less supportive of the president.\n\n\"This was the worst day since the 2016 win. Signing that Bush/Obama budget was a kick in the gut,\" a conservative advisor to Trump, but not in the White House, told Fox News. \"I still love this President but, wow, hard to swallow this bitter pill. Funded Planned Parenthood and not a wall. What did we fight so hard for?\"",

                "body": "Students speak out about why the decided to join the demonstrations.\n\nAs hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against gun violence Saturday in Washington and other American cities, there were other signs as well across the nation of new worries about our safety.\n\nKids are wearing clear backpacks to school. This is not a fashion trend or the latest must-have item, but rather a safety requirement following the recent school shooting in Florida that claimed 17 lives. All this is heartbreaking and, as a parent, a challenge to navigate.\n\nWhat do we say when our kids ask why? What do we say to the littlest ones - who are excited to paint, learn to read and try their hands at addition and subtraction - but who are also scared of something they can't possibly understand?\n\nWhat do we say to the high school student who is eager to round out his or her college application by participating in afterschool activities, but is too scared to stay at school for any length of time beyond the required hours?\n\nMiddle schoolers face the most awkward years of their lives and now - in addition to trying to figure out who they are and how to navigate those uncomfortable years - they are also faced with the fear that saying or doing the wrong thing could land them on someone's literal hit list.\n\nIt is no wonder anxiety in children is at an all-time high. I would venture to guess the numbers will continue to rise.\n\nI have four kids and I lead an organization devoted to strengthening marriages and families, but when children are being shot in their schools, fear can easily take root, even for me.\n\nSo, what can parents do? I believe it starts in the earliest years. Even with our toddlers we can be committed to authenticity. We can allow our own emotions to show and we can model real life to our kids.\n\nAs they watch us navigate the toughest realities of life, our children will gain the confidence to do it too. We can acknowledge their feelings and help them understand and name what they are experiencing.\n\nAs followers of Jesus, my wife and I teach our kids about a loving God who cares about their pain and desires to know and offer full acceptance of them in Christ. We do this by walking out our own faith in their view. As they hear the earnest prayers of our hearts, they understand what it means to live and experience the ups and downs of life.\n\nIf we build a foundation of support and understanding at home when things are going well then, when the tough stuff comes - as it undoubtedly will - our children will recognize that not only are their parents in their corner, but the God of the universe is as well, and they will know how to lean on the faith they've seen modeled.\n\nFear is an unavoidable part of the human experience, but so too are joy, compassion, frustration, anger, happiness, excitement, sadness and more. Fear is just one way to feel out of a whole host of feelings, but Christians can approach fear with a different sort of confidence.\n\nWhat I hope and pray for my kids is that they will have the ability to recognize what they are experiencing so we can work together to find a way through. Even though there are legitimate things to fear, we must not allow fear to control us.\n\nIf the fear of a potential attack takes away our willingness to live, then evil has already won. The horror is real. The devastation and shocking potential for human depravity are real. But we cannot allow these possibilities to steal our opportunity for a rich and joyful life.\n\nThe younger generation must learn, as each generation before has learned, to continue to live despite the potential for harm.\n\nBecause our faith is such an integral part of our life as a family, I often wonder how a parent possibly walks through the challenges of life without a strong faith tradition. If our only hope comes from the expectation of positive news headlines, we will surely grow faint and give in to the temptation to give up.\n\nI simply cannot imagine facing life with nothing but my own strength.\n\nAt FamilyLife, the organization I head that provides biblically based help for people at every stage of marriage and family life, we are committed to helping parents replace fear and uncertainty with hope, and equipping them to guide their children with confidence, even in the most tumultuous times.\n\nThere are no easy answers to the hard questions facing our society and our children today. But, when I am unsure of what to do, I start by studying Scripture and leaning into the wisdom of the generations. I hope to teach my children to do the same - even when the world requires clear backpacks.",

For Pamplona, pain is beauty, and all the effort is worth it.\n\n\"I think I will still feel confident doing naked shoots into my old age, I did all of my surgeries to remain beautiful - whether I'm 30, 60, 70 I'll still be beautiful, with age comes beauty too,\" she said. \"When you're not happy with yourself, feeling upset and not great, you're not going to succeed, now I love myself and I feel happy looking in the mirror.\"\n\n\"If I had to, I definitely would do it all again, all of the surgeries and procedures, but for now I know it's time to focus more on my career, life and business,\" she admitted.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S LATEST HAIRSTYLE BROKE ROYAL TRADITION, AGAIN\n\nPamplona hopes that her looks can inspire other women to realize that they can be both attractive and successful, and has recently launched a perfume and chocolate line, the Daily Mail reports.\n\n\"This is part of the reasoning behind why I like Kim Kardashian so much, she's really beautiful, very sexy, very smart and a savvy business woman,\" she said.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThough she has been criticized for her extensive surgeries, Pamplona says she wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\"People say I'm stupid, but I have achieved a lot,\" she says. \"I came from a poor Brazilian village . . .

The AP saw a widely destroyed and empty town.\n\nTurkey launched a ground and air offensive on Jan. 20 codenamed Olive Branch to oust the main Syrian Kurdish militia known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, from Afrin. Turkey considers the YPG a terror group and an extension of Kurdish rebels waging an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials and the country's state media said the Turkish offensive displaced more than 200,000 people from their homes.\n\nIn Afrin's town center, captured Sunday, allied Syrian forces patrolled the streets as Turkish tanks and armored personnel carriers drove past.\n\nIsmail Montaser Billah, a Syrian fighter, said the YPG withdrew from Afrin after resisting the offensive. \"They had left mines but thank God we took (the town) and we will step on their heads God willing,\" he said. Turkish and Syrian opposition flags were flying in the area.\n\nCivilians, including women and children, were out and about in central Afrin. Abdul-Rahman Mohammed, a civilian, said the YPG mistreated locals who did not cooperate with them. \"We are suffering because of a lack of food and water,\" he added.\n\nThe Turkish Red Crescent distributed food and aid in Afrin. Kerem Kinik, the organization's president, said some 100,000 civilians remained in and around Afrin.",

                "title": "Newt Gingrich: The future is amazing -- Here's an incredible glimpse of what awaits us",
                "body": "I had the opportunity to glimpse a large part of the future this week. I think you will find it as amazing as I did.\n\nDr. Kiron Skinner, a remarkable scholar, hosted me at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n\nAccording to the U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Colleges\" rankings, Carnegie Mellon has the nation's top graduate level artificial intelligence (AI) program and one of the top five undergraduate computer engineering programs. On Wednesday, the people at Carnegie Mellon showed me a few of the reasons they are held in such high regard.\n\nBefore I get into what I saw this week, let me better explain what I mean by seeing a glimpse of the future.\n\nEvery aspect of government procurement will have to be replaced (not just reformed - replaced) given the speed of new capabilities inherent in the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nYears ago, while serving as commanding general of the Training and Doctrine Command for the U.S. Army, Gen. Fred Franks told me he looked for \"glimmerings\" of the future. He said \"glimmerings\" were ideas, events or developments that were not yet clear but might evolve into something important.\n\nI was intrigued with glimmerings because of two earlier developments in my life.\n\nFirst, in 1965, as an undergraduate student at Emory University, I began working with Pete Jensen at what would later become the Rich Computer Center at Georgia Tech. Pete was one of the great pioneers of computing and in a few years introduced me to ideas (glimmerings), which evolved over the next half century into the Internet and modern computing. My own activities had been dramatically enriched by Pete's ideas and teaching.\n\nSecond, I had been privileged to work with Alvin and Heidi Toffler as their thinking evolved from their bestselling book, \"Future Shock,\" to their even more important book, \"The Third Wave.\" The observations and insights they developed for \"The Third Wave\" are still valid over three decades later. They gave me an entirely different perspective on the scale of change our civilization was going through. The Tofflers and their work were very influential in the thinking that led to the Contract with America in 1994.\n\nWith this background, I have always been looking for the breakthroughs that will dramatically change our way of doing things. Starting in 2001, I began looking at nanoscale science and technology, quantum computing and the revolution these two systems would bring about - a revolution that is still only in its infancy.\n\nAround 2007, I began talking with oil and gas experts about the revolutionary breakthroughs in fracking, and their inevitable impact on our ability to produce oil and gas. In 2008 that led me, in collaboration with my former colleague Vince Haley and Sean Hannity, to launch \"Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less.\"\n\nMy wife Callista and I also made a documentary, \"We Have the Power.\" The left, led by President Obama, ridiculed the whole idea of using America's resources to become energy independent.\n\nInfluenced by the growth of fracking, in 2012 I wrote the book, \"$2.50 a Gallon.\" Again, President Obama singled it out and attacked me as a demagogue who was suggesting the impossible. Of course, he was totally wrong, and the fracking revolution has made America dramatically better off.\n\nOn Wednesday, in Pittsburgh, I saw another powerful glimmering of technologies that will change our world. The ability to develop intelligent systems that can learn and adjust is rapidly evolving. These systems will give us new capabilities and new insights in ways we have never imagined.\n\nIn a few brief hours at Carnegie Mellon, I saw a voice analysis system that could be combined with cellphone technology to enable remote medical analysis of virtually everyone on the planet. It would create an extraordinary new approach to early diagnostics and constant monitoring at an astonishingly low cost.\n\nI watched a robotic assistant reduce the invasiveness of heart surgery so that instead of patients taking 14 days to recover, they could leave the hospital after one day.\n\nAnd the potential for 3-D printing and robotics, combined with reusable rockets, will totally change how we think about space. This is just astonishing.\n\nEvery aspect of government procurement will have to be replaced (not just reformed - replaced) given the speed of new capabilities inherent in the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nWe will also have to rethink adult education.\n\nArtificial intelligence will displace many traditional service jobs, while also creating new jobs. The challenge will be helping adults make the transition from outdated skills to the new, higher-paying and more interesting skills made possible by artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, during this development, we must constantly work to improve these systems to make sure they are safe. This constant development in itself will require advancements in both human and machine learning.\n\nWe must learn from and continuously work to prevent tragic accidents like the one this week in Tempe, Arizona where a woman was struck and killed by an autonomous car.\n\nIt is also clear that we have to invest heavily in artificial intelligence if we are going to maintain our competitive and national security advantages in the face of massive Chinese investment in the artificial intelligence field. We already know Chinese companies are working to build a huge fleet of self-driving vehicles. You can bet they will use and apply everything they learn in this endeavor in their military programs.\n\nAs I learn more over the next few months I will report on additional exciting new developments.\n\nThe future is going to be amazing, and we should be optimistic that as a free people we can lead the world into that future - just as we led the world with new developments in cars, airplanes, computers and the Internet.",

                "body": "Children between the age of 3 and 9 will qualify for a free dining package when their parents book a Magic Your Way package. (iStock)\n\nBudget-savvy families are always looking for ways to cut costs on a Walt Disney World vacation, and now Disney has announced a new offer that seems to offer monetary relief. According to Disney Food Blog, families who book a trip from May 28 through August 30 may be able to get free dining for their kids.\n\nChildren between the age of 3 and 9 will qualify for a free dining package when their parents book a Magic Your Way package, which includes a room at a Disney resort, a three-day theme park ticket, and the Disney Dining Plan for the adults. There are, of course, exceptions. There are a few blackout dates, and villas, suites, and various other types of rooms (such as The Little Mermaid rooms at The Art of Animation) are not eligible for the offer. There are also only limited numbers of this offer even available, and the package must be booked by August 1.\n\nBut is this deal as good as it sounds?\n\nThe free kids dining applies to all three tiers of the Disney Dining Plan: Quick Service ($21.75 per night per child; $52.49 per adult), Standard ($25.80 per child; $75.40 per adult), and Deluxe ($39.90 per child; $116.24 per adult). So, if you choose the Deluxe Dining Plan, you could save $119.70 per child over the three-night stay, but you're spending $350 on food for each adult. That's a hefty fee.\n\nDisney has traditionally offered free dining for all guests during the fall. It's yet to be seen whether or not this free kids dining is replacing all free dining or not. But it could be worth waiting to book your vacation to see if you can get a better free dining offer for 2018.\n\nThere are also other ways to save money at Disney beyond free kids dining. For instance, Disney is offering a discounted room price offer at select resorts for roughly the same time frame (June 11 through August 1). You could book a discounted room, buy tickets from a third-party vendor, and budget your food wisely, and wind up saving even more.\n\nWhether or not the free dining for kids option is right for you and your family is up to you.",

On Friday, 23 British diplomats were expelled from Moscow in retaliation.\n\n\"The United States stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia's outrageous action,\" White House spokesman Raj Shah said Saturday. \"The president is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities.\"\n\nAt the same time, State Department official Heather Nauert made a similar statement, making it clear that the administration would not announce any action Saturday on the matter.\n\n\"The United States is considering a range of options to respond to Russia's outrageous actions in the U.K., both to demonstrate our solidarity with our ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements,\" said Nauert.\n\nThe Trump administration's remarks come a day after several European Union countries said they may follow Britain in expelling Russian diplomats.\n\nAt a summit in Brussels on Friday, the 28 EU leaders agreed with British Prime Minister Theresa May that it is \"highly likely\" the Kremlin is responsible for the attack on the Skripals.\n\nThe White House's National Security Council has reportedly advised Trump to expel Russian diplomats. Trump critics have repeatedly said the president is too supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin's leadership style.\n\nTrump earlier this week congratulated Putin on his successful reelection, despite purportedly being advised not to make the call. The federal government is also investigating whether the 2016 Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russia.\n\nPreviously, Trump joined May and the leaders of France and Germany in condemning the attack.\n\n\"It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and any such use by a State party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all,\" they said in a rare joint statement.\n\nThe quartet wrote \"there is no plausible alternative explanation\" except Russian responsibility for the attack on British soil, and the Kremlin's failure to respond to a \"legitimate request\" for an explanation \"further underlines its responsibility.\"\n\n\"We call on Russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security,\" the statement said.\n\nRussia has fiercely denied any involvement in the poisoning, saying that it had destroyed its chemical weapons and had no motive to kill Skripal, who was convicted of spying for Britain but released in a 2010 spy swap.",

Certain nations want to disrupt.\"\n\nIn the halls and offices of this secretive agency, Bailey explained targeting goes beyond government computer networks to weapons systems.\n\n\"So think of aircraft carriers, planes, tanks, ships, all of those things are part of the national security systems that we worry about,\" she said. \"We provide codes, keys, crypto. We provide keying for all NC2 nuclear command and control for the nation.\"\n\nThat also includes the infamous black suitcase - also nicknamed the \"nuclear football\" - which is always near the president and allows the commander in chief to authorize a nuclear attack.\n\nAsked if she was trying to ensure its security, Bailey said, \"Absolutely, everything, all nuclear devices.\"\n\nShe said the suitcase is an attractive target for hackers going after weapons and nuclear systems.\n\n\"Here is nothing that is off the plate,\" Baily said.\n\nWhen there is a major cybersecurity event, targeting U.S. government and military networks, the NSA is either called in, or dispatches, teams of specialists to limit the damage and identify the hackers.\n\n\"Cyber never sleeps, no weekend in cyber,\" said 28-year-old Charles Hobson, who is part of the NSA's red team - essentially a cyber-SWAT team. The members rarely speak publicly about their work.\n\n\"While we catch these guys in our networks, we want to tell the story of how they got in so we can prevent them from having future success,\" he said.\n\nAs Bailey put it, \"I want people to know that NSA is working very hard. NSA is an organization that has people that are experts in these fields.\"\n\nWith an ever-evolving threat, the work demands a team in place to anticipate and confront the myriad challenges.\n\nBailey emphasized that a new integrated cyber center is being built on the agency's west campus, where \"we're bringing together our partners across the government like DHS, FBI and DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency].\"\n\n\"We're bringing together our top allies that we partner with to sit in there so we're all seeing this data in real time and we have very robust information sharing,\" she said.",

                "body": "Students are demanding action in response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Griff Jenkins reports from Washington D.C.\n\nThe deadly school shooting that claimed 17 lives in Parkland, Florida, last month has highlighted the need for major reforms and improvements to the safety and security at our nation's schools. The massive March for Our Lives in Washington on Saturday and smaller demonstrations around the country demanded action to reduce gun deaths.\n\nEvery child has the right to walk into a classroom and feel safe and encouraged to learn, not scared of violence. This week in Great Mills, Maryland, we saw the benefits of having school safety measures and resources in place, when a school resource officer fatally shot a 17-year-old gunman who had shot two other students - including a 16-year-old girl who later tragically died of her wounds.\n\nWe have also seen the terrible consequences when precautions, protocols and coordination with law enforcement are not in place or are not followed and school shootings end with greater numbers of students dead and wounded.\n\nThat's why Republican Main Street members have taken the lead to prioritize legislation and funding in Congress to keep our schools safe. We started the Republican Main Street Caucus School Safety Working Group to identify ways Congress can help and continue to make this issue a national priority. We have been working closely with leadership in the House to ensure we can follow through on these promises.\n\nLast week the House began its effort to provide the necessary infrastructure and resources for students nationwide by overwhelmingly passing a bill led by one of us, Working Group member and former sheriff Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla. The STOP School Violence Act strengthens several vital layers of security and improves school safety by providing funding to give students, law enforcement, teachers, and school officials the tools and training they need to identify signs of violence or suicide and prevent events before they happen.\n\nThe STOP School Violence Act also provides schools with resources for technology and equipment to aid in the prevention of violent events. This includes anonymous reporting systems, the development of mobile security apps, and developing local hotlines to report warning signs. The funding can also be used for physical equipment to keep students safe, like metal detectors or locks.\n\nA key provision authored by another one of us, Working Group member and former first responder Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., helps more schools install panic buttons to directly signal law enforcement during a crisis. Nationwide, our banks, office buildings, and even most retail locations, have panic buttons - our schools should have the same ability to contact law enforcement when faced with an emergency. Lastly, the STOP School Violence Act also provides funding to support coordination between our schools and local law enforcement.\n\nThese efforts are needed NOW. That's why another one of us, Main Street Chair Rodney Davis, R-Ill., along with many members of Main Street, called on leadership to fund school safety grants immediately by including them in this year's must-pass funding bill.\n\nMain Street members were pleased to see our voice make a difference this week, when the must-pass 2018 funding bill not only included the STOP School Violence Act to authorize future school safety programs, but also designated funds for critical school safety grants so we can help schools improve their security systems and protocols immediately.\n\nThe legislation passed this week also includes critical funding for other important programs within the Department of Justice, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human Services that address mental health, student safety and well-being, and fund critical law enforcement programs. Members of Main Street, under the leadership of another one of us - Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., head of the School Safety Working Group - will continue to find ways we can stop violence in our schools.\n\nOne bill we have already identified is sponsored by Rep. Steve Knight, R-Calif., called the School Training, Equipment, and Protection (STEP) Act. Before coming to Congress, Rep. Knight was a Los Angeles Police Department officer for 18 years.\n\nThe STEP Act was crafted following extensive discussions with law enforcement professionals about improving school safety. This bill would designate $50 million of an existing Department of Education grant program to be used for more physical security measures, like barricade technology, to enable faculty to quickly strengthen doors and windows in the event of an active threat situation.\n\nThe safety of our students, teachers and school personnel should be paramount. While there are many facets to this problem and more solutions needed to put an end to this devastating violence, equipping our schools with adequate safety measures is a critical first step. We will continue to work with our partners in Congress, as well as with school officials and law enforcement, to ensure the next generation of students can learn in schools free from violence.",

Martha McSally made clear Saturday that she's kidding about building a border wall with California but argued that dangerous policies in the neighboring state allowing \"violent, criminal\" illegal immigrants to go largely unchecked is a \"very serious\" concern.\n\n\"The left has gone hysterical as usual, and it seem like they can't take a joke. But the issue is very serious,\" McSally told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" after mentioning the border wall at a White House conference on so-called \"sanctuary city\" policies earlier this week.\n\nSuch policies, which allow state and local law-enforcement authorities to protect illegal immigrants from federal immigration law, have been in place for decade, with California leading the way.\n\nEarlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration is suing California, citing a series of state laws that he says are unconstitutional and violate common sense.\n\n\"I can't sit by idly while the lawful authority of federal officers are being blocked by legislative acts and politicians,\" Sessions said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Sacramento and argues three state laws intentionally undermine federal immigration law -- including barring police from asking people about their immigration status or participating in federal immigration enforcement activities. Another law offers protection against workplace raids.\n\n\"These dangerous policies out of California are choosing to let violent, criminal aliens be released from jail and not contact the feds,\" McSally, a former Air Force fighter running for Senate, said Saturday. \"That's not just impacting California communities. This has the opportunity to impact safety and security across the country, not just in Arizona.\"\n\nMcSally, who represents a congressional district near the Mexican border, said she voted earlier this week in support of the roughly $1.3 trillion spending bill signed into law despite it giving President Trump just $1.6 billion toward a U.S.-Mexico border wall because it provided much needed money for the military and its troops.",

                "body": "Two very different events will take place from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Saturday, local time, around the world.\n\nParticipants in Earth Hour will turn off the lights during the hour in a demonstration of \"solidarity\" with the \"planet we love.\" Organizers hope to create a giant stadium wave of darkness sweeping across the globe from one time zone to the next.\n\nWe at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank, modestly propose a better idea: the Human Achievement Hour, an event taking place at the same time as Earth Hour that pays tribute to human ingenuity and advancements in every field from health care and energy to communications and transportation.\n\nWe think our celebration, in which we hope you all will participate, is easily described as more enlightened.\n\nMaking an entire planet fall into darkness, after all, is an odd way of expressing love - a return of the Dark Ages, anyone? Earth Hour protestors nonetheless believe the world will be a better place if governments drive fossil fuels out of the marketplace - or simply force energy companies to keep coal, natural gas and oil \"in the ground.\"\n\nSuch thinking is wrongheaded for many reasons.\n\nAbundant, affordable, and reliable energy is a blessing, not a curse. Commercial energy, the vast majority of which still comes from fossil fuels, literally gives superhuman power to ordinary people.\n\nWealth and technologies supported by fossil fuels are what enable billions of people to live longer and healthier lives, in cleaner environments, and with greater access to information than even the most powerful elites of previous generations.\n\nThese blessings are still by no means universal. More than 1 billion people in developing countries still have no access to electricity and billions more have too little to eradicate poverty. We know very well by now that cheap, abundant energy is a key to bringing those people into our healthier and more comfortable world.\n\nRecent decades have seen substantial gains in global indicators of well-being: life expectancy, per capita income, child mortality rates, hunger rates, poverty rates, malaria incidence, literacy, and access to safe drinking water. All owe a great deal to fossil energy.\n\nNor is it true that fossil-fueled civilization is making the climate less \"livable.\" Since the 1920s, the vast majority of industrial-era carbon dioxide emissions entered the atmosphere and the world warmed by 0.08 degrees centigrade. At the same time, global deaths and death rates related to extreme weather declined by 93 percent and 98 percent, respectively.\n\nScary-sounding climate change forecasts come from models that predict two-to-three times as much global warming as has actually occurred since the late 1970s. Climate scientist Patrick Michaels reports, on the other hand, that there is only one model that accurately tracks the real warming trends.\n\nWhen this model is run with a realistic emission scenario (where natural gas continues to replace coal), the predicted 21st century warming is about 1.5 degrees centigrade. That means the world is already on track to meet the Paris climate treaty's maximum goal, but without new taxes and regulations, and without turning off anyone's lights.\n\nThe climate policies popular with the Earth Hour crowd are either a costly exercise in futility or a cure worse than the disease.\n\nPick any climate policy on the books today, and you will find an abysmal benefit-cost ratio. For example, the Obama administration's so-called Clean Power Plan, if implemented, could cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet it would avert less than 0.02 degrees centigrade of global warming 80 years from now, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's own climate model.\n\nMore importantly, developing countries already account for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving the United Nations-sponsored Paris climate treaty's mid-century goal of cutting global emissions by 50 percent or more would require developing countries to make substantial reductions in their consumption of fossil fuels, leading to slower growth and fewer opportunities for struggling people.\n\nBesides, since when has collective darkness been the image of a virtuous society?\n\nLook at a nighttime satellite photo of the Korean Peninsula. South Korea, now one of the world's strongest economies, is lit up like a Christmas tree. Communist North Korea is plunged in darkness.\n\nIn North Korea, every hour is Earth Hour. Not because the people strive for \"sustainability,\" but because the regime is a benighted tyranny.\n\nEarth Hour originated in 2007. The Competitive Enterprise Institute held its first Human Achievement Hour in 2009. Rather than ascribe mankind's progress to energy folly, we prefer to pay tribute to the wonders of human inventiveness, enterprise, and collaboration that provide our well-being and enable us to overcome our challenges.\n\nSo, come one and come all! Celebrants can also have a laugh at the backwards ideology that equates a dark world with a good one. Hence the acronym for our cheery occasion: HAH!\n\nJust use the hashtag #HAH2018 to tweet your best examples and photos of human achievement to @ceidotorg.",

                "title": "March for Our Lives: Gun control ideas sound good, but are deeply flawed and won't save lives",
                "body": "Students are demanding action in response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Griff Jenkins reports from Washington D.C.\n\nAmerica continues to mourn the 17 people killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last month. There is an understandable emotional desire to \"do something\" in response - but without evaluating what the \"something\" will actually accomplish. This is the driving force behind the March for Our Lives taking place Saturday in Washington.\n\nThe motivations of many people taking part in the Washington event and other demonstrations around the country are sincere. But before we \"do something,\" we need to stop and think: what is the most sensible thing we should do? What will actually save lives and make us safer?\n\nIt's important to understand that the debate isn't between those who want to end violence and those who support gun rights. Both sides want to end violence. The debate is simply over how best to keep Americans safe.\n\nSupporting gun control is now the \"in thing.\" Stars such as Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus tweet their support. Time and Teen Vogue magazines run cover stories glorifying people working to put stricter controls on guns and ban some weapons. The New England Patriots used their team plane to fly students and families from Parkland, Florida, to Washington for Saturday's gun control rally.\n\nYou would be unlikely to know it from the media coverage of the Washington demonstration, but only 47 percent of Americans between 13 and 17 believe that more gun control could reduce mass public shootings.\n\nBritain's Guardian newspaper asked students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for their ideas on how to end violence. The ideas sound good at first glance and are certainly well-meaning. But in reality, the policies being proposed will either have no effect or even cause harm.\n\nHere are four of those ideas, and a look at their actual impact:\n\n1. Ban semi-automatic weapons that fire high-velocity rounds.\n\nGun control advocates say semi-automatic rifles are designed to kill people, not for hunting, target practice or self-protection. They say only members of our military need these guns.\n\nBut looks can be deceiving. An AR-15 rifle shoots the same bullets as a small game-hunting rifle. Both guns fire one bullet at a time, and with the same velocity. The guns merely look different on the outside. AR-15s may resemble military weapons but they aren't the same weapons used by soldiers.\n\nSemi-automatic rifles don't just take lives, they also deter criminal attacks and save lives. In 95 percent of defensive gun uses, no shots are fired. But if you do have to open fire, having a semi-automatic weapon means that you won't have to take the time to manually reload the gun. This additional time for the victim may make the difference between life and death.\n\nBanning all semi-automatic guns would endanger lives. So gun control advocates find it easier just to call for bans on the more scary-looking guns.\n\n2. Require national registration of guns.\n\nGun control advocates have long claimed that gun registration will help solve crimes. Their reasoning is straightforward: A registered gun left at a crime scene can be used to identify the criminal.\n\nUnfortunately, it rarely works out this way. Criminals almost never leave behind guns that are registered to them. In the few cases where guns are left at the scene, it is because the criminals were killed or injured. And these guns are virtually never registered to the person who committed the crime. Many are stolen.\n\nDuring a 2013 deposition, the Washington, D.C., police chief said that she could not \"recall any specific instance where registration records were used to determine who committed a crime.\"\n\nWhen I testified before the Hawaii State Senate in 2000, the Honolulu chief of police also stated that he couldn't find any crimes that had been solved due to registration and licensing.\n\nThe chief also said that his officers spent about 50,000 hours each year on registering and licensing guns. This time is being taken away from traditional, time-tested law enforcement activities.\n\nCanada and other parts of the U.S. haven't had any better luck. TV shows depict gun registration as an effective crime-fighting tool, but this isn't how things work in real life.\n\n3. Institute universal background checks and close gun show and secondhand sales loopholes.\n\nThese are actually different words for the same thing. Background checks on private transfers of guns is the first policy gun control advocates call for after each mass public shooting. But such background checks would not have prevented a single mass public shooting in this century.\n\nIn addition, over the years from 2000 to 2015, states that had universal background checks had twice the rate of mass public shootings as those that didn't have that law.\n\n4. Raise the firearm purchase age to 21.\n\nLet's not forget about the law-abiding young citizens who arm themselves for self-defense. What about the 20-year-old woman who is being stalked by a potential rapist or killer? Research shows that having a gun is by far the most effective way for young women to defend themselves.\n\nOf the 64 U.S. mass public shootings since 1998, 10 attacks were carried out by people under age 21 - five by people who were already too young to legally purchase their guns and five where increasing the age limit could make a difference. Even in the five cases where raising the age limit might have conceivably had an impact, it is likely that the shooters could have illegally obtained a weapon, just as many other attackers do.\n\nPrior to 1994, while some states had an age limit, there was no federal age requirement for buying a rifle. The only peer-reviewed study on this change was conducted by Thomas Marvell in the Journal of Law and Economics.\n\nMarvell concluded: \"Where the 1994 laws seem to have an impact, the suggestion is almost always that crime increases; thus, there is no evidence that these bans had their intended effect.\" In fact, Marvell found that the law was associated with a 6 percent increase in firearm homicides.\n\nHere's a better idea\n\nSo if the above ideas all have big problems, what can be done to more effectively protect children in school?\n\nHaving more armed law enforcement officers and security guards in schools would be useful - but only if governments came up with additional money so that no other school programs are cut.\n\nLetting well-trained teachers and other school staff members carry concealed handguns if they wish is a much less expensive alternative. There are currently 18 states that have at least some schools where staff and teachers carry.\n\nThere have been no problems or increases in insurance premiums at the schools with armed staff members. \"From what I've seen in Utah, (school insurance) rates have not gone up because of guns being allowed,\" says Curt Oda, former president of the Utah Association of Independent Insurance Agents. Nor has a survey of other states shown any increase in insurance costs.\n\nArmed school staff would be a final line of defense against school shooters. Importantly, they would also be a deterrent. They wouldn't stop every school shooting, but they would most certainly save lives.\n\nHere's the bottom line: We all want to save lives, but being well-meaning isn't enough. The media's one-sided coverage of the gun control debate gives the false impression that only one side cares about saving lives and that virtually everyone agrees that the solution to gun violence is the strictest gun controls possible.\n\nSome have even called for banning all guns and eliminating people's ability to defend their families and themselves. That would be a truly radical and extremely unwise step.\n\nToo much is at stake for politically correct decisions that sound good but are not sound policy.",

Griff Jenkins reports from Washington D.C.\n\nAs Americans rally across the country on Saturday for increased gun control in the March for Our Lives movement, one unifying accessory is making headlines: evil eye gloves.\n\nThe sartorial protest was dreamt up by Kristina Suh, who spearheaded the distribution of the famed pink hats at the 2017 Women's March. Suh worked to collect 438 pairs of evil eye gloves to distribute at the Washington, D.C. march to honor the 438 individuals killed or injured in school shootings since 2014, according to her website.\n\nSTUDENT CHALLENGES DRESS CODE AFTER BEING PUNISHED FOR NOT WEARING A DRESS TO SCHOOL\n\nImages of the gloves are currently trending across Twitter and Instagram as protesters everywhere sport the powerful symbol.\n\nNearly every major ancient culture from Eastern Europe through the Middle East believed in the \"gaze of malice\" at one point or another in their history, respecting the \"protective talismans\" as a form of empowerment, Racked reports.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S LATEST HAIRSTYLE BROKE ROYAL TRADITION, AGAIN\n\n\"At its heart, fear of the evil eye has a lot to do with consent, or the lack thereof. When you wear an evil eye charm, you lay down a boundary between you and those who would do you harm,\" the outlet states. \"It's an appealing concept, especially when some in our society... still struggle to accept the seriousness of consent.\"\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nFor her part, Suh couldn't agree more.\n\n\"The evil eye is the symbol of protection. These eyes are meant to show that people are watching -- history is watching -- what Congress will do next. I think it's really powerful, Suh told USA Today in a March 23 interview.\n\n\"Clothing items are symbolic, but they're also a gateway to larger action. It's important to let people know they're not alone -- that they don't have to work in a vacuum when other people are visible and brave enough to show themselves.\"",

(AP)\n\nThe French police officer who died after offering himself up in exchange for a hostage in a deadly supermarket siege on Friday served in Iraq in 2005 and was also a member of the presidential guard, among other notable achievements.\n\nThe officer, identified as Lt. Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, died of his injuries after he took the place of a female hostage when a gunman went on a rampage at a Super U supermarket in the southern French town of Trebes.\n\nHis death brings the death toll to four. Authorities said that 15 others were injured in the attack.\n\nBeltrame, who traded himself up unarmed, secretly left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was going on inside the store. When they heard gunshots, they stormed the supermarket, killing the 25-year-old gunman who was later identified as Moroccan-born Radouane Lakdim.\n\nBeltrame was fatally wounded and later died of his injuries.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nRead on for a look at who Beltrame was.\n\nBeltrame, who was married with no children, graduated from a top military academy in France in 1999, the BBC reported. A few years later, he joined an elite police special forces group.\n\nIn 2005, he served in Iraq. Upon his return, according to a statement released by President Macron, Beltrame served as a member of the presidential guard.\n\nHe also received an award for bravery in 2007, CNN reported, and earned the Order of Merit -- one of France's highest honors -- in 2012.\n\nPrior to his death, Beltrame had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for a similar type of hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to the Depeche du Midi newspaper.\n\nCedric Beltrame, the officer's brother, told RTL radio Saturday that his brother died \"a hero.\"\n\n\"He was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing,\" Cedric Beltrame said.\n\nBeltrame's mother also told the radio station that, for her son,\"to defend the homeland\" was \"his reason to live.\"\n\n\"He would have said to me, 'I'm doing my job, Mom, nothing more,'\" she said.",

The family's cause of death was not immediately known but the department was awaiting autopsy reports.\n\n\"There appears to be no signs of trauma,\" Ver Meer said.\n\nFamily members became worried about the family after they were supposed to return Wednesday from the trip but did not return. Ashli Peterson, a family member, said the Sharps notified family members that they made it to Mexico safely but that was the last time they heard from them.\n\nIOWA FAMILY OF FOUR THAT WENT MISSING IN MEXICO FOUND DEAD\n\nPeterson said the family filed a missing persons' report via the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. They also tried to locate the family by tracing their cell phones but found there was \"no movement on their phones.\" The family's social media accounts were also at a standstill.\n\nAmy's mother, Beth Fry, told the Des Moines Register that \"half my family is gone.\"\n\n\"We're determined. We have love and support and family and friends and we will get through this. One way or another, we will,\" Fry said.\n\nA number of relatives and friends gathered at Fry's home to mourn the loss of the family they knew and loved.\n\nFamily members said Kevin was a beer distributor for his family's company Southwest Distributing Co. He was also a stock car racer. Amy was a dental-claims specialist and the two children were very active.\n\nRenee Hoyt, Amy's sister, told the Des Moines Register that Adrianna was \"our fashion stylist\" and Sterling was very into sports.\n\nThe Sharp family were big fans of the Southwestern Community College's sports teams. Fry said the family often welcomed the team's basketball players into their home for dinner and holidays.\n\nThe coach of the Spartans, the basketball team, Todd Lorensen told the Des Moines Register that the family would follow them to watch games.\n\n\"I consider them friends,\" Lorensen said. \"They were to be here watching us play. This family is an instrumental part of our Southwestern family, and we are all grieving their loss.\"\n\nMAN ARRESTED IN STRING OF ROBBERIES, SEX ASSAULTS IN IOWA\n\nFry described the family as living \"life on the fly.\"\n\nShe said her daughter and Kevin were married for more than 16 years and got together after a weekend to a St. Louis Cardinals baseball game. The two were friends before getting together.\n\nThe cause of the family's death was not immediately known and autopsies were being conducted in Mexico. The Quintana Roo state prosecutor's office said there were \"no signs of violence were found on the bodies or in the room.\"\n\nThe Omaha World-Herald reported Mexican officials were investigating reports of a gas leak but that was not immediately confirmed.\n\nThe family's funeral is slated for late next week at the college. Hundreds of people are expected to attend.",

                "body": "Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, brought up Syria during a Security Council meeting regarding Libya. (UN)\n\nRussia's dogged defense of Syria at the United Nations Security Council has resulted in an ongoing diplomatic game of chess between Russia and US council allies. Russian has used its veto 11 times to protect the Assad regime since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.\n\nThe latest Russian move came at a Security Council meeting on Libya earlier in the week when Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia chose to bring up Syria and publicize a documentary showing civilians leaving war-torn areas.\n\nOne Security Council diplomat told Fox News, \"Russia hijacking an open meeting to push their own propaganda on an entirely different subject was absurd. Russia would have had a fit if any other Council member had pulled what they pulled. It's yet another clear abuse of their status as a permanent member of the Council.\"\n\nAt the end of that meeting on Libya, Ambassador Nebenzia publicized a documentary showing civilians leaving besieged areas of Eastern Ghouta and also read two press reports.\n\nNebenzia gave his reason for the Syria update saying his remarks were made to show that resolution 2401 was being implemented by Russia.\n\nHe said, \"As regards a documentary it is a documentary, not a fiction film - the documentary gives you the real picture of what took place in the recent days in that enclave under Damascus and I hope that members of the Security Council will find the time to watch the film.\"\n\nResolution 2401 demanded an immediate 30-day cessation of hostilities so that humanitarian aid could reach the hardest hit areas of Syria. Several members of the council including the US, France, and the UK have accused Russia of blatantly violating it.\n\nHugh Dugan, a former US diplomat at the United Nations who served as an advisor to 11 US ambassadors, said the Dutch president of the Security Council handled the Russian move on Syria smartly. He said, \"The Netherlands opted to let it pass, thinking that otherwise the Russian's might have extended the meeting on procedural grounds bringing even more publicity to their point.\"\n\nDugan, who is the director of UN Engagement at Seton Hall University School of Diplomacy in New Jersey, said the Russians are well aware of how the system works. \"We know they exploit the procedures and the atmospherics, and it's always a matter of not playing into their hands any further than what is inevitable.\"\n\nTwo days before the Libya meeting the Russian delegation placed the council in check again when it won a procedural vote at the Security Council that led to a planned briefing by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation in Syria being stopped. But the US and its allies did not let it go unanswered.\n\nA US diplomat told Fox News, \"Russia's vetoes and procedural moves, they're all designed to delay and distract - particularly on Syria, where Russia seems to stop at nothing to defend the Assad regime. But what happened on Monday is a good example of how quick and creative thinking can work around Russia's obstruction.\"\n\nThe US diplomat continued, \"When Russia hid behind a procedural vote to block the Council from hearing a briefing on the human rights situation in Syria, Russia once again proved that it cares more about protecting the atrocities of the Assad regime than about the suffering of innocent Syrians. But they were not successful. Other members of the Council came together - quickly - to continue the conversation at an Arria-formula meeting (informal) and allowed High Commissioner Zeid to give his briefing to a full room of member states, press, and NGOs.\n\nAnother Security Council diplomat told Fox News that, \"It's difficult to deal with Russia on Syria.\" The diplomat continued, \"We have different agendas, that's why it's difficult. We see it time and again.\"\n\nLast month Ambassador Nebenzia complained to Fox News of continued efforts to defame his country. \"We were invited by the legitimate Syrian government to help defend terrorists, which we did since 2015, while the US was never invited to Syria. Who is the aggressor tell me?\"\n\nHe went on to say that as soon as any progress is made on the political front, there are new reports and accusations against Russia regarding questions on Syria's use of chemical weapons.\n\n\"These reports are a shame. Again these chemical episodes happen, intensify and start to happen out of the blue when something is going on positively on the political front that is clear for us as well. That's the other side of the same coin.\"\n\nRussia vetoed a Joint Investigation Mechanism of the Security Council and the OPCW on investigating the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria last November. The so-called JIM had accused the Assad regime of using chemical weapons on its citizens.\n\nIt has been exactly a month since the UN Security Council passed a watered-down resolution to get Russia on board to push forward with a humanitarian ceasefire.\n\nAccording to figures from the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), and given to Fox News by the Syrian American Council, since the adoption of resolution 2401 the number of dead now stands at 1,366, with nearly 6,000 injured.\n\nJonathan Wachtel, the former director of communications and spokesperson for the US Mission under Ambassador Nikki Haley, told Fox News that while there have been some moments of cooperation it remains a problem.\n\nHe said, \"The last years have seen Russia undermining US policy on major crises of our time. From insisting that North Korea had not tested ICBMs to refusing to hold the Syrian government accountable for chemical weapons attacks on civilians, Moscow has far too often chosen denial and spin to avoid taking a moral stance.\"",

He also sent along three gifts: a sword and scabbard, a photograph of the king with one of his daughters, and an impressive pair of elephant tusks.\n\nHe addressed the letters to then-President James Buchanan \"or whomever would become president\" with elaborate paragraph-long salutations.\n\nLincoln was already president by the time the letters arrived a year later. He penned a reply, addressing the king simply as \"Great and Good Friend.\"\n\nThe offer of elephants did not neglect practical details. Mongkut stated, \"On this account, we desire to procure and send elephants to be let loose to increase and multiply in the continent of America.\" But Thailand -- then called Siam -- did not have a large enough vessel to transport them, the letter said.\n\nIt continued: \"In reference to this opinion of ours if the President of the United States and Congress who conjointly with him rule the country see fit to approve, let them provide a large vessel loaded with hay and other food suitable for elephants on the voyage, with tanks holding a sufficiency of fresh water, and arranged with stalls so that the elephants can both stand and lie down in the ship -- and send it to receive them. We on our part will procure young male and female elephants and forward them one or two pairs at a time.\"\n\nMongkut then in his letter directs that the elephants should be kept away from the cold and under the sun, and to also \"let them with all haste be turned out to run wild in some jungle suitable for them not confining them any length of time.\"\n\n\"If these means can be done we trust that the elephants will propagate their species hereafter in the continent of America,\" the letter said.\n\nThai monarchy expert Tongthong Chandransu said the offer of elephants reveals that Mongkut wanted to be part of building the young United States.\n\n\"You have to consider that 200 years ago, elephants were an important means of transportation and helped a lot with our work, not to mention warfare, but also the building of homes and cities,\" Tongthong said.\n\nThe ever-practical Lincoln rejected the offer to send wild elephants running through American forests, saying the country \"does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant.\" He said in his 1862 letter that \"steam on land, as well as on water, has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce.\"\n\nThe exhibition runs until June 30.",

(Facebook)\n\nAn aspiring actress who mysteriously disappeared from her Hollywood apartment last month is believed to be dead, and the man she was romantically involved with committed suicide Thursday after a police pursuit.\n\nAdea Shabani, 25, a native of Macedonia, came to the United States fewer than two years ago to pursue a career in acting. She had been living in Los Angeles when she was last seen Friday, Feb. 23, 2018, near her home. Police confirmed to FOX11 that family and friends believe Shabani is dead.\n\nChris Spotz, 33, who is also an aspiring actor, was linked to Shabani romantically. KTLA reported Shabani and Spotz met at acting school.\n\nASPIRING ACTRESS DISAPPEARS FROM HOLLLYWOOD HOME PROMPTING FEARS FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\nThe Riverside County Sheriff's Office said Spotz led officers on a police chase in a stolen truck on Thursday. Spotz reportedly had a passenger in the stolen vehicle but stopped to let the person out before continuing the pursuit. The driver shot himself in the head as officers tried to deploy a felony traffic stop.\n\nAuthorities told NBC Los Angeles the vehicle might have been used in a homicide. Further details on the homicide were not immediately available.\n\nPolice believe Shabani was killed in the region between Hollywood and Sacramento. Officers have asked anyone with information to come forward.\n\nIOWA FAMILY OF FOUR THAT WENT MISSING IN MEXICO FOUND DEAD\n\nPolice are continuing to search for Shabani's body and her mysterious disappearance. The young woman's mother hired a private investigator to help in the search. She also flew in from Macedonia to aid with the search.\n\nFamily and friends became worried about Shabani after she was not active on social media and was not returning phone calls.\n\n\"This is not her, this is not her,\" Emma Joe, a friend of Shabani's, told KTLA earlier this month. \"Something is going on with her, we don't know where she is. It's just so sad, we're just hoping she's alive.\"",

                "body": "Casey Neistat opened up about his failed tenure at Jeff Zucker's CNN when speaking to The Verge.\n\nDigital wunderkind Casey Neistat, once hailed as CNN's bridge to the future, slammed his former employer this week, calling the network an \"old-school media company\" devoid of entrepreneurial or innovative thinking.\n\nNeistat's denunciation of the news giant follows CNN abruptly cutting ties with him after reportedly paying more than $20 million for his video sharing startup, Beme.\n\n\"Top-heaviness is not something that is conducive to a startup environment,\" he said on the Verge's \"Vergecast\" podcast, calling CNN \"a case study for the innovator's dilemma.\"\n\nCNN signed Neistat to great fanfare in 2016 -- reportedly on the advice of CNN boss Jeff Zucker's teenage son. The network put a major publicity push behind their acquisition of Neistat and his app. In March 2017, Neistat appeared on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter with Zucker and three of the network's biggest stars: Jake Tapper, Anthony Bourdain and W. Kamau Bell.\n\n\"Jeff says to me, 'You know, we have a huge news operation here; it's a global enterprise... But my son says that you're the only person who matters in media,'\" Neistat told the magazine at the time.\n\nBut the marriage was barely consummated before a swift divorce. After years of spending big on flashy digital projects that garnered great publicity but few real results, CNN is now cutting back mercilessly, ending ties with Neistat, shuttering other digital initiatives, and laying off dozens of staff. BuzzFeed reported that, last year alone, CNN's digital unit was \"facing a $20 million budget shortfall.\"\n\nWhen it came to Beme, \"I think what I wanted it to be and what they wanted it to be didn't exactly look the same,\" Neistat said about creative difference he had with CNN brass.\n\nNeistat told the Verge he feels that CNN should have focused on \"bootstrapping,\" to go beyond its comfort zone. \"That is where real innovative spirit comes from,\" he said.\n\n\"I wanted it to be about technology and that's why I started Beme,\" Neistat said. \"With CNN and them expressing what their desires were in the tech space, you know they have an app and some interesting tech but they don't have anything that I would describe as outside of the realm of what you'd expect from a news media company.\"\n\nCNN did not immediately respond when asked for comments.\n\nZucker, a legacy media executive, came to CNN after a long career at NBC, and the executives he's hired at CNN have largely come from ABC News, another old-school operation.\n\nNeistat said that because he didn't feel CNN had innovative technology, he saw an opportunity for forward-thinking software products. He explained that he wanted to leverage CNN's resources to develop cutting-edge apps, with a built-in media component, but the company wasn't up to the task.\n\n\"That kind of entrepreneurial thinking... that kind of innovator's thinking, just doesn't really mesh necessarily with a larger entity like a [CNN parent company] Turner,\" Neistat said. \"That was where a lot of the struggles came from.\"\n\nNeistat feels CNN's dearth of innovation stems from lacking \"the kind of nimble thinking that enables startups to operate and disrupt\" and that company executives were concerned that digital content would outshine television. During the revealing conversation, Neistat said he had to be careful because CNN was a \"fantastic\" partner aside from the lack of innovation.\n\nNeistat ultimately said it wasn't his decision to split with CNN but the company's executives essentially wanted to cut their losses.\n\nIndustry insiders have been abuzz that CNN's digital operation could face more layoffs this year -- with cuts coming from New York-based, staff-heavy units that aren't drawing sufficient traffic or revenue. In a recent restructuring, CNN reduced the responsibilities of some embattled New York executives and centralized editorial control in Atlanta, where CNN.com has its roots.\n\n\"It's time to stop spending money and giving interviews about yourself,\" a CNN insider told Fox News.\n\nFurther dialing down of flashy, expensive initiatives and a focus on core competencies is expected, CNN insiders told Fox News.",

It was my wedding day.\n\nThe church where I got married was beautiful, but it was located in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood where there is very little parking. What's worse is that the minimal parking that is available is parallel parking -- except for this one spot.\n\nAbout 20 yards from the church is this space that's not only conveniently located, it's all by itself. I needed that space because I had rented a nice, sporty car and I didn't want to get it scratched by D.C. drivers, who have no problem bumping into other cars in order to squeeze into spaces. So I prayed for that parking spot just before going to sleep.\n\nThe next day, I woke up a little late, got dressed in my tux, picked up the rental car and drove to the church to take photos. When I turned the corner onto the street where the church was located, there was the coveted parking space, waiting just for me.\n\n\"Thank You, God,\" I said, smiling. \"I knew You'd do it.\"\n\nIt's interesting how people react to this story when I tell it. A few people are genuinely touched by it. Some smile and offer a listless, \"wow.\" I've had others who politely offer their opinion and tell me that it's inappropriate to ask God for things like parking spots and help with finding lost keys. I don't agree.\n\nAs Romans 8:28 says, \"All things work together for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose.\" If all things work together for our good, then I suppose all things matter, including whether I get a good parking spot on my wedding day.\n\nI know a lot of people will say that we should nonetheless focus our energies on praying for single mothers and hungry children. I do agree that those requests should be the top priority, but I still think God has plenty of time for the seemingly minor things we need.\n\nMatthew 17:27 tells a story about a time when Peter came to Jesus needing something really basic: tax money. Jesus said, \"[G]o down to the lake and throw in a line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a large silver coin. Take it and pay the tax for both of us.\" Peter obeyed, caught a fish, and found the tax money in the fish's mouth, just as Jesus had said (you've got to wonder how God pulled that one off).\n\nSo I say go ahead, definitely pray for single moms and hungry children. God will be eager to answer those prayers. But in the meantime, we can ask Him for relatively minor things like parking spaces, lost keys and money to pay taxes. His ability to give is limitless, so we might as well offer Him as many opportunities to provide as possible.",

The league, made up of of juvenile and criminal justice advocates, artists and experts, and formerly incarcerated individuals, presented the list in response to the failure of a Staten Island Grand Jury to indict police officer Daniel Pantaleo for the chokehold death of Eric Garner. (Reuters)\n\nRussell Simmons is facing another rape allegation and a $10 million lawsuit.\n\nIn court documents filed and obtained by Page Six on Friday, a woman accused the disgraced hip-hop mogul, 60, of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room and threatening to rape her son if she didn't comply.\n\nThe woman, referred to only as Jane Doe in the suit, says she and her elementary school-aged son were attending a concert in Sacramento for an artist who worked with the Def Jam founder, when he invited them to go backstage. She then accompanied Simmons to his hotel bar and a nightclub after dropping off her son with a babysitter.\n\nThe woman claims she later returned with Simmons -- who has been at the center of sexual assault accusations for months -- to his hotel, but says he assured her he wasn't interested in having sex with her, as he was in a relationship with a \"well-known\" model. But after \"reluctantly\" joining him in his room, she claims he shut the door and told her, \"I am going to f-k you.\"\n\n\"[The] Plaintiff said she had no intention of having sexual relations with Simmons -- but he replied 'I am going to f-k you or I'm going to f-k your son. You decide,'\" according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nShe alleges that he threw her on the bed and raped her. She is now seeking at least $10 million in damages over allegations of forcible rape and emotional distress.\n\n\"As a father of a young daughter, I am grateful to my client and the other women who have had the courage to bring these cases that will help make the world safer for women everywhere,\" the woman's lawyer, Douglas Mastroianni, told Page Six on Friday.\n\nSimmons denied the accusations in a statement to Page Six on Friday.\n\n\"I vehemently deny all the allegations made against me,\" he said. \"They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women.\"\n\n\"I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests,\" Simmons' statement continued. \"I denied forced sex and sexual harassment allegations brought against me in each test; I also answered no to the question, 'Have you ever physically forced any woman to have sexual intercourse?' I passed all of the lie detector tests.\"\n\nThe famed music producer -- a father of three who was once married to Kimora Lee Simmons -- has faced sexual misconduct allegations since the fall of 2017, including an accusation of attempted rape by PR guru Kelly Cutrone.",

(REUTERS/Leah Millis)\n\nEarlier this week, I visited students in Iowa at the Waukee Innovation and Learning Center. It was incredible to see firsthand how high school juniors and seniors are solving real-world challenges while learning how to code, program robots, develop electrical and plumbing systems, and pioneer innovations in bioscience.\n\nThe students who attend the Waukee Innovation and Learning Center enter the workforce equipped with the skills they need to secure good-paying jobs and succeed in our modern economy.\n\nSkill-based education is crucial to putting more Americans on a path to promising careers - and filling the jobs of the future, as well as those that are vacant today. Yet for too long, we have failed to recognize the importance of practical, skill-based learning.\n\nThe Trump administration is committed to expanding 21 century opportunities through affordable workforce development programs.\n\nIn addition to the many administrative actions we have taken to advance workforce development, the president's recent infrastructure proposal, sent to Congress last month, would greatly amplify and expand this effort.\n\nCurrently, there are 6.3 million unfilled job openings in our country - the highest number on record. Of these, 250,000 are in construction; 427,000 in manufacturing; and more than 500,000 in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). These are among the most critical industries in rebuilding our country's crumbling infrastructure.\n\nNot only would our infrastructure plan generate new projects that directly increase employment in construction and other affected industries, it would also break down barriers for American workers to get the training they need to be successful in the jobs we need filled.\n\nOur infrastructure plan calls on Congress to refine and reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act; expand Pell Grant eligibility to high-quality, short-term programs; and reform licensing requirements for individuals seeking an infrastructure project job.\n\nFurther, our plan seeks to improve the Federal Work-Study Program by better distributing funds to the schools and students who need them most, and by creating more opportunities for participants to obtain relevant workplace experience that will place them on a better path to meet their career goals.\n\nThe talent, grit and spirit of the American worker have always defined our nation and enabled us to compete and lead in the global economy.\n\nWith the goal of growing the American economy through pro-business policies and job creation, the Trump administration's robust plan aims to deliver education to Americans across the country that is better skills-focused and often debt-free.\n\nNow Congress must follow through and invest in our nation's most important resource: our people.",

                "body": "National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin and chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge on President Trump tapping the Fox News contributor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to replace H.R. McMaster as national security adviser.\n\nPresident Trump made a shift to the right this week and the media treated it like he was all wrong. The president announced he will replaced National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster with former Ambassador and Fox news contributor John Bolton - a move loved by conservatives and despised by the media.\n\nThe New York Times called Bolton, \"an Undiplomatic Voice for American Might\" and mockingly said he \"Joins the Trump Cast.\" HuffPost called him \"As Dangerous As You Remembered.\" Far left Splinter News actually headlined: \"Trump Hires Bush Administration Demon John Bolton as New National Security Advisor.\"\n\nThe devil you say.\n\nThe news media soon dubbed Bolton's joining the Trump administration as the hiring of a \"hawk.\" NPR let fly with its assessment of the pick: \"Bolton Brings Hawkish Perspective To North Korea, Iran Strategy.\" The Atlantic took said of the choice: \"McMaster Is Out, an Even Bigger North Korea Hawk Is In.\" The New York Times envisioned him as \"a hawk among hawks.\"\n\nThere was so much use of the word \"hawk\" that the news started to sound like the Discovery channel. Or perhaps a conference of birdwatchers.\n\nMSNBC's Chris Matthews' comments were for the birds, calling Bolton the \"biggest hawk there's ever been.\" Matthews found almost no end to his lofty hyperbole. \"He wants war with Iraq. He pushed and pushed and pushed and wanted to go to war with Syria. Name a country in the Middle East he didn't want to go to war with,\" he whined.\n\nThe choice of Bolton spoiled one liberal narrative. Alternet's question: \"Is John Bolton Too Tough on Russia for Donald Trump?\" It might be good for Alternet to remember how many Russian mercenaries the U.S. has killed under Trump.\n\n2. Trump's Forbidden Words: President Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin for his victory in the sham elections held in his country. The result sent the news media into a tizzy.\n\nNBC reporter Peter Alexander clearly didn't like it. \"The president congratulating Vladimir Putin on his re-election, despite specific warnings from his national security advisers not to,\" he told the \"Today\" audience.\n\nCNN national security reporter Zachary Cohen took a sarcastic approach. \"Both Trump and Kim Jong Un have now congratulated Putin on his election win,\" he tweeted. Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey went on CNN to complain about Trump congratulating \"leaders who are not democratically elected.\"\n\nMSNBC's Rachel Maddow described the leak of that congratulations call as a sign of a \"national security problem.\"\n\nOf course, NBC was the only one of the big three networks to mention a huge point - that President Obama had done the same thing, congratulating Putin in 2012. Even left-wing Snopes agreed that it was true. So it's OK when President Obama congratulates the leader of Russia, but bad when President Trump takes the identical action.\n\n3. It's Spring, Time to Bash Trump: Trump Hunting Season seems to never end. In just one week, the media compared President Trump's actions to interning Japanese-Americans in World War II and to the death of a young woman in a car driven by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\nBoth of those actions were taken by Democrats, not President Trump. In the Washington Post review of American \"fascism\" images, it never even mentioned President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, just Trump. That article made clear comparisons of deporting illegal aliens with interning people who broke no laws.\n\nThen there's the new movie about Kennedy's accident titled simply \"Chappaquiddick.\" In theory, it's about how Kennedy's actions resulted in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne. At the Post, talk of that scandal leads us to ... \"what resonance does this movie have for a Trump presidency and the current political climate?\" Because everything in the Post ties back to Trump.\n\n4. Just Beat It! President Trump and presidential wannabe Joe Biden traded insults and physical threats this week in what the Washington Post described as a \"Septuagenarian smackdown.\" Of course, some in the media were siding with the contender.\n\n\"The View,\" fresh off of Joy Behar's apology for attacking Christians, now wants someone to assault the president. Co-host Sunny Hostin asked a bizarre question on Thursday: \"Why hasn't anybody taken (Trump) out back and kicked his little butt?\" The lone conservative on the show, Meghan McCain, called the question \"not reality.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's Matt Lewis handed the win to Biden in a knockout. \"Joe Biden Could Beat Trump in a Fight -- and an Election.\"\n\nIn one of the strangest hot takes of the week, Kurt Bardella wrote an opinion piece for NBC saying: \"Trump and Joe Biden's Twitter feud proves how threatened Trump is by men who can cry.\" Bardella has gone from a right-wing worldview to concocting clickbait opinion that bashes conservatives. Still, this is odd even for him.\n\nTo his credit, TheRoot.com Politics Editor Jason Johnson said of Biden's threat to Trump, \"that's not the kind of public discourse that we want anymore from anybody who ever might run for office again.\"\n\n5. Bunnies and Trolls: The left will attack anyone tied to President Trump, even Vice President's Mike Pence's daughter. Comedian John Oliver tried to make a mockery out of her and her dad in a bunny book battle, but she had the last laugh.\n\nThe New York Times described the younger Pence's book \"'Marlon Bundo's Day in the Life of the Vice President\"' as \"a picture book written by Mr. Pence's daughter Charlotte that focuses on the bunny's observations of the vice president, with illustrations by his wife, Karen.\"\n\nOliver decided to make fun of Charlotte's book with a children's book of his own - about two gay bunnies tormented by an evil stink bug, drawn as a bug-like Mike Pence.\n\nOf course, the media loved Oliver's book. And they were all set to belittle Charlotte as well. Only she caught them off guard by admitting she had bought Oliver's book, too. Why? Because, \"his book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind.\"\n\nSuddenly, The Daily Beast declared: \"Charlotte Pence Is Surprisingly Cool With John Oliver Trolling Her Bunny Book.\" Vanity Fair said, \"Mike Pence's Daughters Seem Cool.\"\n\nCool enough to even beat John Oliver at his own game.\n\n6. Americans Are Sick of Politics: The media are obsessed with politics - jamming it into to everything from an NFL game to nightly sitcoms. Turns out, Americans don't agree.\n\nAccording to new a poll from a McLaughlin & Associates/Media Research Center, 75 percent of likely voters say they watch entertainment and sports to get away from politics. But politics keep intruding. Just this week, The Sporting News was highlighting an interview that compared college basketball to \"slavery.\"\n\nThe poll results are telling; 44 percent of those interviewed said they are less likely to watch entertainment and sports because of political statements. Given the lousy ratings for the Oscars, that says a ton. But Hollywood never listens. It just lectures more.\n\n7. MSNBC Gets Graphic: It's 3 a.m. and your Poli Sci 101 course report needs a graph and you throw together something that looks nice but is utterly inane. That's what it looked like when \"MSNBC aired the saddest graph ever,\" wrote Daily Caller's Amber Athey.\n\nShe was calling out the network for an exercise in graphic violence created for MSNBC's \"The Beat.\" Some poor designer created a graph of the number of times Trump tweeted about Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The chart, titled \"Trump Tweets Mentioning Mueller By Name.\" runs from May 2017 to March 2018. Every month has the graph at 0. Then in March, it takes a huge leap ... to 2.\n\nThis is why you should believe it when you hear commentators say Trump has driven the media crazy. Here's proof.",

                "body": "In nearly 3,000 protests nationwide, students across the country walked out of their classrooms to take a stand against gun violence one month after the Parkland, Florida shooting.\n\nJust days after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people, students-turned-activists echoed the words \"never again\" and \"not one more,\" pushing lawmakers for increased gun control and better school safety.\n\nMany of the Parkland students, who have primarily taken to social media to champion these issues, have met with President Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., among others to demand action.\n\nOne shooting survivor Cameron Kasky, a junior at the high school, wrote an op-ed about his experience, demanding Congress to take action.\n\nOther Parkland shooting survivors have organized events.\n\nIn addition to the 17-minute National School Walkout on March 14, which honored those killed in the massacre and protested gun violence, student activists planned a march in Washington, D.C. called a \"March for Our Lives.\"\n\nAhead of the event, here's what you need to know.\n\nThe march is slated to take place on Saturday, March 24, around 12 p.m., organizers said.\n\nThe primary march will take place in Washington, D.C. on Pennsylvania Avenue between 3rd and 12th street NW, according to the March for Our Lives website.\n\nInitially, organizers wanted to hold the event on the National Mall, but were forced to choose another location because their request conflicted with a film crew's permit, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMany other cities -- such as Portland, Oregon; Boise, Idaho; Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, Dallas and Chicago, among hundreds of other places -- are holding \"sister marches.\" Overall, there are more than 800 sibling marches across the country, organizers said.\n\n\"This is such a unifying experience, it's truly nonpartisan\" said Ellie Boan, 19, a freshman at the University of South Carolina. She plans to attend a sister march in Columbia on March 24.\n\n\"Not everyone necessarily agrees how [gun reform] should happen. But different viewpoints are coming together and all agree that no American child should feel unsafe in school,\" she said.\n\nFor Boan, who has been working with local high schools and student organizations on her campus to help organize the event, the shooting itself \"doesn't get anymore close to home.\"\n\nBoan is originally from Parkland, Fla. While she didn't attend Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, her older brother did. On top of that, her parents' home is \"just five minutes away from the school\" where the Valentine's Day mass shooting unfolded.\n\n\"I was on the phone with my mom during the shooting,\" she said, adding that helicopters heading toward the high school could be heard in the call's background.\n\n\"[Parkland] was the last place in America I ever expected for this to happen,\" she said. Once known for its picturesque golf courses and safety, Boan added, the city will now be remembered as the site of one of the \"biggest mass shootings in U.S. history.\"\n\nShortly after the suspected shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was identified, Boan had a chilling realization: She knew him, albeit not well.\n\n\"His name sounded familiar, even though I didn't want it to,\" she said.\n\nAt that moment, Boan realized that she and he had attended the same middle school.\n\n\"He even had a presence back then,\" she said.\n\nComing to that realization was the \"most difficult thing to deal with,\" Boan said. \"I knew someone who was capable to inflict that kind of damage.\"\n\nBut Boan has since channeled her emotions -- which have ranged from sadness to fear to anger -- into activism.\n\n\"I wanted to do something even though I couldn't be there [Parkland],\" she said.\n\nParticipating in the march later this month is the \"most effective way to process what I was going through,\" she added. \"Students are directly telling legislators what they want to be done. I hope that continues.\"\n\nAdults are listening\n\nPerry Bradley, founder and executive director of Building Better Communities, a community outreach organization in South Carolina, is helping organize the sister march in Columbia that will end on the steps of the city's statehouse.\n\nStudents, local lawmakers and state representatives are slated to speak at the event.\n\n\"Parkland opened our eyes,\" Bradley told Fox News. \"Adults are embracing what kids have to say [about gun reform].\"\n\nA bipartisan cause\n\n\"I think that we have finally reached a breaking point in America,\" 21-year-old Antwon Stephens, who plans to participate in a sister march in Atlanta, told Fox News. \"Both sides are tired of the answer being nothing.\"\n\nStephens, who said he comes from a family who \"firmly believes in the Second Amendment,\" echoed Boan -- he also thinks the March for Our Lives movement presents an opportunity for unity, adding that both sides of the political aisle should work in a \"non-partisan way\" to understand \"why things like this keep happening.\"\n\n\"I think it is going to take a whole lot of elbow grease to keep this movement going strong,\" he said. \"But this movement is most powerful because it's led by students.\"\n\nFor family and the future\n\n\"I was numb. I was in shock for three days after I heard about the shooting,\" said Jennia Taylor, a senior at Spelman College who also plans to attend a sister march in Atlanta.\n\nHailing from Parkland, Florida, the shooting greatly impacted Taylor not only because it occured in her hometown, but also because the 21-year-old is a 2014 graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, she told Fox News.\n\n\"[Stoneman Douglas] is a big family; it was like hearing that someone invaded your home,\" Taylor said, who added that she first found out about the massacre through her family's group chat.\n\n\"I lived there in high school,\" she said. \"I saw my teachers and coaches more than I saw my parents.\"\n\nThe day of the shooting, hearing about students and faculty who had been injured or killed affected Taylor the most, she said. It was also unnerving, she added, because Taylor's younger cousin is a freshman at the school.\n\nShe was also worried for her former classmates as well, as many of them have younger siblings or family members who are current students at the high school, she said.\n\n\"We all kind of know each other, she said. \"It's so intertwined, it's kind of crazy.\"\n\nTaylor's heart sank when she heard that Aaron Feis, a beloved football coach at Stoneman Douglas, had been shot and killed shielding students from a rain of bullets.\n\nTaylor's two brothers, also graduates of Stoneman Douglas, played football at the school and her family was well acquainted with Feis. As a result, the loss hit her hard.\n\n\"It's really hard for my family knowing him, and knowing his family,\" she said.\n\nAs for her participation in the March for Our Lives, Taylor said she's excited to \"see people from all walks of life who have been affected by gun violence come together and march for a purpose,\" she said. \"[They're] putting opinions aside to make sure we have a safe community and safe society.\"\n\n\"I'm going to grow up and have kids. I don't want to fear that every time they leave they're going to get shot,\" she said. \"After it happened in my hometown, I realized that it's time to take action.\"\n\nThe National Park Service told the Washington Post that at least 500,000 people are expected to attend the march in D.C. alone.\n\nThe event, which is being organized and led by Stoneman Douglas students and shooting survivors Emma González, Cameron Kasky, among others, is mainly funded through donations.\n\nKasky created a GoFundMe page to help pay for the event, raising more than $3.3 million in a month.\n\n\"Half of the funds raised on this GoFundMe will go toward the March For Our Lives Action Fund,\" Kasky explained on the fundraising page. \"The other half of the funding raised on this GoFundMe will provide relief and financial support to the victims and families of the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School via the Broward Education Foundation.\"\n\nCelebrities such as George and Amal Clooney and Oprah have donated $500,000 to the event, as have Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Deadline reported.\n\nJack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, announced on March 9 that he also donated $500,000 to March for Our Lives.\n\n\"I'm so inspired by all the conversations the Stoneman Douglas students are leading!\" he tweeted.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, and Giffords, an anti-gun violence group that was started by former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, among other national organizations, are also working with march organizers -- either through donations or planning and logistics.\n\n\"Students are making history and demanding that our elected officials protect them. Everytown is proud to help them make their voices heard on March 24, and we look forward to more Americans following their lead to forge meaningful change to our country's gun laws,\" John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown, said in a statement after the organization announced its $2.5 million grant to support sister marches around the country.\n\nThe ride-hailing company Lyft also announced that it will offer free rides to Stoneman Douglas students participating in the march.\n\nAdditionally, many celebrities are supporting the event by performing at the march in D.C. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato, among others, are slated to perform at the rally.\n\nThe event is not a political one, organizers claim.\n\n\"School safety is not a political issue,\" a mission statement on the organization's website reads. \"There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing.\"\n\nWhile the activists \"support the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms, as set forth in the United States Constitution,\" they also have a list of demands, urging members of Congress to pass laws to end the sale of high-capacity magazines, improve background checks and more safety measures.",

                "title": "7 clever ways to use that USB drive again",
                "body": "Here are some new uses for that old USB drive you have laying around. (Credit: REUTERS/Thomas Peter)\n\nThumb drives used to be so cool. They came in every shape and material, from little plastic rectangles to rubber wristbands, novelty animals, and pens sporting a built-in USB-drive. We used to marvel at the data they contained, easily dragged and dropped into a special icon. They were simple and portable, and yes, about the size of a human thumb.\n\nThose days are over. Cloud technology has made USB drives redundant and worse, a liability since they could easily get lost. Most of them have vanished into junk drawers, exiled with old cell phones and various chargers, forgotten.\n\nThere are some rituals no longer necessary in high-tech households such as folding a map or memorizing a phone number. Teenagers may shrug, but if you're 30 years or older, you'll probably smile with nostalgia at this list of 20 things we don't do anymore because of technology.\n\nUnlike other outdated tech, such as CDs and Palm Pilots, the thumb drive is still useful, and not just for storing and transporting information. It's time to give thumb drives a new lease on their electronic lives.\n\nCheck out these seven handy, fun and downright helpful ways to use USB thumb drives.\n\n1. Run your own Google Chrome on other computers\n\nMany of us get nervous about sharing web browsers. There are lots of personal settings, and private search histories, that we would rather not share with each other. Portable Apps, a site that collects apps that can run on USB drives, offers up Google Chrome Portable, a version of Chrome that lives on a flash drive.\n\nPortable records your settings and extensions, so when you find yourself in front of a borrowed computer pop the thumb drive into the USB port. This is especially handy for travelers, who may find themselves an internet cafe or hotel business center. The Portable software is both familiar and efficient, and it won't impact any version of Chrome that's already on the machine.\n\n2. Go incognito\n\nThe Tails operating system has an intriguing tagline: \"Privacy for anyone anywhere.\" You can run Tails from a USB drive on a computer, and it will keep your activity private and anonymous by acting as an independent OS.\n\nYou will need two USB drives for the initial Tails setup and it can seem a little involved, but the Tails site will walk you through the process.\n\nTails is one way to protect your privacy when using public computers or a computer you don't trust. It can also be a way to hide your tracks if you're shopping for birthday or holiday gifts on a computer you share with your family.\n\nClick here to learn more about Tails operating system and get the direct download links.\n\n3. Use it as the key to your computer\n\nYou can turn a USB drive into a key that unlocks your Windows computer. Download and install Predator on your PC and a flash drive. Once it's set up, the computer will only work when the USB drive is plugged in.\n\nPull it out and the display goes dark, and the keyboard and mouse are disabled. Plug it back in to get back to work.\n\nPredator can be used on multiple computers, so that the same flash drive can unlock more than one machine.\n\nYou can also have several flash drives as keys for the same computer, so everyone in your family (or only certain members) can unlock a particular PC. Predator starts at $10 for the home edition.\n\nClick here to learn more about Predator and get the direct download links.\n\n4. Scan for viruses\n\nIf you know or suspect a computer has been compromised by a virus, you can use a USB drive to scan and remove the offending software. PortableApps offers several options, including ClamWin Portable, McAfee Stinger Portable, and Spybot-Search & Destroy Portable. Install these on the drive, plug it into the computer, and run them to check and clean the machine.\n\n5. Make a Dead Drop\n\nThis is a novel one: a \"dead drop\" is spy-speak for a method of passing secret information. Historically, agents would leave secrets messages in a wastebasket or behind a loose brick. Berlin artist Aram Bartholl started a trend of USB flash drive \"Dead Drops,\" which have attracted a cult following around the world.\n\nParticipants leave USB drives in public, perhaps cemented into a wall or tied to a tree. Dead Drop users are encouraged to share their favorite files, whether it's photography, a poem, or some other creation.\n\nYou can find out how to participate on Bartholl's Dead Drops site.\n\nJust remember that attaching your computer to an unknown USB drive comes with plenty of potential security risks, so you might want to use a secondary computer for your Dead Drop activities.\n\n6. Boost your Windows experience\n\nMicrosoft has long offered a little-known Windows feature called ReadyBoost. It's meant to speed up certain processes on computers that use standard hard drives. While it may offer a benefit to some computers running Windows 10, people with older machines and those using earlier Windows operating systems are the most likely to see a speed improvement.\n\nIt does not work for computers with solid-state drives like those often found in higher-end laptops.\n\nReadyBoost turns an external flash drive into a hard disk cache. Microsoft gives instructions for setting up a ReadyBoost drive for Windows 7, but this also works on more recent versions of the operating system. It's worth a try if your computer feels poky.\n\n7. Create a Windows recovery drive\n\nDon't wait until your Windows PC unexpectedly melts down. Prepare yourself by turning a spare USB stick into a recovery drive. This drive lets you run troubleshooting tools if your Windows machine is having problems, even if it won't start up properly.\n\nFollow Microsoft's directions to create the drive. You may need at least a 16 GB USB drive if you choose the option to back up your system files, but this will let you reinstall Windows if necessary.\n\nOnce you have the drive finished, label the thumb drive and store it where you'll be able to access it easily if your computer starts acting up.\n\nWhat questions do you have?

                "body": "CHICAGO - It's hard to tell who is more popular: The Loyola University Chicago men's basketball team, or their biggest fan Sister Jean Schmidt.\n\nThe 98-year-old nun and basketball fanatic has become an international superstar during the 2018 NCAA basketball tournament, for both her bracket and her prayers that God appears to listen to intently.\n\nBut the impact she's had in the last couple weeks at the tournament is the norm, according to students and staff at the school.\n\n\"I think that her biggest ministry on campus is being present to the students. And when students see her or when faculty see her, they just know that this person is filled with love,\" said Michael Martinez, a student and Jesuit Scholastic.\n\nAs one student put it, everyone on campus has a Sister Jean story. James Prehn has many, but shared with Fox News how she reacted in the hospital room after breaking her hip.\n\n\"Even from the hospital she was giving me to do lists. Students to check up on, when I would come back after visiting with her,\" said Prehn.\n\nThe sister's popularity on the campus is nothing new. The school made her an official bobble head seven years ago. It's currently sold out but more are on the way. The school newspaper also wrote an op-ed titled - \"An Open Letter To Pope Francis: Please Make Sister Jean a Saint\". The piece described how she performed the two miracles required for sainthood, during the first two games of the tournament.\n\n\"She is definitely a very big superstar on campus. She would walk, and now wheel around campus. Everyone stops and says high or takes a selfie. She really is a campus celebrity,\" said Henry Redman, the sports editor for the Loyola Phoenix who wrote to the Pope.\n\nSister Jean lives on an all-girls floor in a small dormitory on campus. She's the chaplain for both the dorm and the basketball team. Before each game, she prays with the team and gives them a scouting report.\n\n\"If there's anyone who can help the students keep their sense of calm, she has that about herself, and I think that radiates into the players,\" said Lisa Reiter, director of Campus Ministry.\n\nTo add icing on the cake, she even has a great sense of humor.\n\n\"How are the eyes tonight?\" she joked to a referee.\n\n\"If they're not working I'm going to borrow your glasses,\" he replied.",

                "title": "Greenland is literally cracking apart and flooding the world",
                "body": "Greenland's lakes are draining away in hours, thanks to a vast network of fissures hidden on the ice sheet below. (Credit: Timo Lieber)\n\nVisit Greenland on the right summer day, and you could see a 12-billion-gallon lake disappear before your very eyes.\n\nGlaciologists saw this happen for the first time in 2006, when a 2.2-square-mile (5.6 square kilometers) lake of melted ice drained away into nothing in less than 2 hours. Researchers now see such events as a regular part of Greenland's increasingly hot summer routine; every year, thousands of temporary lakes pop up on Greenland's surface as the surrounding ice melts, sit around for a few weeks or months, and then suddenly drain away through cracks in the ice sheet underneath. [Images of Melt: Earth's Vanishing Ice]\n\nOn a recent expedition, however, researchers saw an alarming new pattern behind Greenland's mysterious disappearing lakes: They're starting to drain farther and farther inland. According to a new paper published today (March 14) in the journal Nature Communications, that's because the summer lakes of Greenland drain in a \"cascading\" chain reaction enabled by a vast, interconnected web of cracks below the ice -- and as temperatures climb, the web is getting wider.\n\n\"Lakes that drain in one area produce fractures that cause more lakes to drain somewhere elsewhere,\" co-author Marion Bougamont, a glaciologist at the University of Cambridge's Scott Polar Research Institute, said in a statement. \"It all adds up when you look at the pathways of water underneath the ice.\"\n\nIn the new paper, Bougamont and her colleagues used 3D ice-flow models and satellite images of the Greenland Ice Sheet to study this chain reaction. The authors found that when warming weather causes a single lake to drain into the underlying ice sheet, the ice flow below that lake can accelerate dramatically -- up to 400 percent faster than in winter months.\n\nAs the draining water surges away from the original lake, it can destabilize other nearby ice beds. Fresh cracks form, new lakes drain and the reaction intensifies day by day. In one incident, the researchers observed 124 lakes drain in just five days. Even lakes that formed hundreds of kilometers inland, which were previously thought to be too far removed from the ice bed to drain into it, proved vulnerable to the chain-drain-reaction as new fissures in the ice formed.\n\nThis all amounts to billions of gallons of melted ice plunging below Greenland's surface every few days. Some of this water remains trapped in the ice sheet; much of it pours into the surrounding ocean.\n\n\"This ice sheet, which covers 1.7 million square kilometers [650,000 square miles], was relatively stable 25 years ago, but now loses one billion tons [900 million metric tons] of ice every day,\" lead author Poul Christoffersen, also from Cambridge's Scott Polar Research Institute, said in the statement. \"This causes one millimeter of global sea level rise per year, a rate which is much faster than what was predicted only a few years ago.\"\n\nAccording to a 2017 report, ice loss in Greenland was responsible for about 25 percent of global sea level rise in 2014 -- up from just 5 percent in 1993.\n\nIf Greenland melts completely, it could result in a global sea-level rise of about 20 feet (6 meters). According to the Cambridge researchers, a total loss of Greenland's ice is \"extremely unlikely in this century\" -- but even minor increases in sea level could have severe consequences around the world, the authors noted. According to a recent report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), if sea levels rise half a meter (1.6 feet) by 2100, many American coastal cities will experience high-tide flooding \"every other day\" or more.",

No peace!\" Some reportedly climbed atop and pounded on parked patrol vehicles while others tried to prevent tensions from escalating.\n\nAt least one protester was arrested for allegedly breaking a window on a commuter bus, FOX 40 reported.\n\nA candlelight vigil was held to commemorate the death of Clark, who died in a hail of police gunshots Sunday night in the darkened backyard of the home where he had been staying with his grandparents. Police say they thought he was pointing a handgun but they found only a cellphone nearby.\n\nBy midnight the protests had largely fizzled out and police reopened streets. Some of the protesters reportedly cheered as the police drove away.",

He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.",

(Associated Press)\n\nInvestigators said Friday that they are stumped as to why a man drove a flaming minivan -- carrying propane tanks and gasoline containers -- into Travis Air Force Base in Northern California this week, and they see no evidence of terrorism.\n\nA man identified as Hafiz Kazi, 51, from Sausalito, Calif., died in the Kia minivan Wednesday after veering through the main gate at Travis and crashing, FBI Sacramento agent Sean Ragan said.\n\n\"Why did this individual end up at the front gate of Travis Air Base on fire and now deceased?\" Ragan said. \"We don't have the answers to that.\"\n\n\"Why did this individual end up at the front gate of Travis Air Base on fire and now deceased? We don't have the answers to that.\"\n\n- FBI Sacramento agent Sean Ragan\n\nLocal emergency teams, including fire, police and medical personnel, responded to the crash, Fox 40 Sacramento reported. An Explosive Ordnance Disposal team was also called to the scene.\n\nKazi had no known links to terrorism, did not leave behind a manifesto or any threats or explanation, and a video found on a cellphone provided no clue.\n\nInvestigators know of no one else associated with the incident nor any threats to the air base or surrounding community. Kazi also never served in the military and has no known ties to the air base, Ragan said.\n\nNo shots were fired as he entered the base, and it was only after the fire was out and responders broke through the locked minivan doors to aid Kazi that they realized the vehicle was loaded with five propane tanks, three gallon-size gasoline cans and several cigarette lighters, Ragan said. Also found was a gym bag with personal effects and three cellphones.\n\nKazi's body was so badly burned that he had to be identified by fingerprints.\n\n\"The investigation that we're doing right now is trying to piece together his life, trying to piece together what led up to this event, and attempt to determine why he was there and why he had those items in his vehicle,\" Ragan said.\n\nHe said Kazi was a native of India who has lived in the U.S. since 1993 and was a permanent legal resident. Ragan said investigators have been unable to find any of Kazi's family living in the U.S., but a family member in India has been notified of Kazi's death.\n\nHe said Kazi appeared to work as a cab driver in the past, but investigators haven't determined if he was currently employed. It was not clear if he owned the minivan.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence of any religious affiliation or anything at this point,\" Ragan said. \"As of right now, we know of no other associates.\"\n\nInvestigators have interviewed some of Kazi's acquaintances and are working on some search warrants, he said. They are also scouring social media, so far without result.\n\nCalls to several numbers associated with Kazi were not returned Friday.\n\nAbout 10,000 people live and work on the major air force base, about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud of how our first responders addressed the situation with the goal of keeping Travis and the local community out of harm's way,\" Col. John Klein, 60th Air Mobility Wing commander told the San Franscisco Chronicle.",

                "title": "Advice for Trump: Don't fire Robert Muller -- He will clear you in the end",
                "body": "The president's criticism raises speculation that he may seek to have the special counsel fired; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports.\n\nWill he or won't he? Rumors continue to swirl and speculation abounds about whether President Trump will order the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in our 2016 presidential election and alleged misconduct by the Trump campaign and the president.\n\nPresident Trump is a high-risk, high-reward player and he often wins. He's a man of action who is impatient with delays. But in this case, he needs patience. He needs to let the Mueller probe finish on its own time, politically and legally, because that's the only way for the president to shut down all the speculation and be cleared of doing anything wrong.\n\nSo firing Mueller should be off the table - something President Trump doesn't even consider. The president needs to focus on his job, do his best to serve the American people, and just hit pause and stop being preoccupied by the Mueller probe. Talking about it and tweeting about it again and again, day after day, simply creates more news coverage and more public concern about the investigation.\n\nPresident Trump needs vindication from Mueller to push legislation through Congress, manage international affairs with proper authority, protect America's national security without distraction, and guide America through these complex times. He also needs vindication to win a second term. So waiting for Mueller to wind up his investigation, even if it goes on for several more months, is in the president's best interest.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the president is frustrated. Who wouldn't be? The \"Russia collusion\" story is at a dead end. In terms of what is on the public record, the claims of collusion don't add up. Indeed, the facts known to the public point toward illegal collusion among top Obama administration officials who apparently aimed to stop Donald Trump from becoming president, or hobble him if he won.\n\nStill, the Mueller probe continues on and on and on.\n\nOn the public record, we know that senior FBI and intelligence officials were apoplectic - texting with adolescent anxiety, fear and fury - in their determination to assure that Trump was defeated by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe devotion of these federal employees to Clinton remains peculiar, almost religious. Perhaps it was fed by fear of the inexperienced, conservative, and irreverently tweeting candidate Trump.\n\nWhile federal employees have First Amendment rights to an opinion, what is now obvious is that some abused their positions and power and engaged in a conspiracy to bend the law to serve their opinions. That is not acceptable or excusable, regardless of whether it is directed against a Democratic or Republican candidate.\n\nWhat is also obvious is that the conspiracy to undermine President Trump both before and after he took office was undertaken without compunction, with gloves-off zeal and continued into 2017.\n\nAndrew McCabe, former No. 2 official at the FBI, was recently fired for substantive, non-political reasons. His self-defense was breathtaking. He wrapped himself in the American flag and in the FBI's reputation for integrity. But he failed to rebut nonpartisan infractions detailed by the Justice Department Inspector General's Office, the department's Office of Professional Responsibility and Justice Department leadership.\n\nDistilled from an array of 2016 election-focused investigations - some already completed, some ongoing -- here are some key facts:\n\n· The largest cache of Hillary Clinton recovered emails - a topic we are all sick of talking about - cast the Democratic presidential candidate in a very negative light. McCabe and others chose not to release the emails when they were found in September 2016. That is unforgivable.\n\n· The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (ACT) court, meant to protect all Americans from abuse by a politically twisted Justice Department, was tricked. The FBI's McCabe, Director James Comey and others knowingly sought and gained an invasive warrant to surveil members of the Trump campaign by using information paid for by the Clinton campaign. Without that information, the surveillance warrant - by their own admission - would not have been granted. That is unforgivable.\n\n· Increasingly, it looks like the zealous effort to first stop candidate Trump and then undermine President Trump had appendages. One reason McCabe was summarily let go, without his full pension, is that he was allegedly untruthful under oath multiple times about leaking anti-Trump material to the media.\n\n· Curiously, Comey, who knowingly reverted to calling the Clinton \"investigation\" a \"matter\" during the election campaign when directed by Obama's attorney general, reportedly leaked sensitive law enforcement information to the media.\n\n· Likewise, one reason former British spy Christopher Steele of dossier fame was let go by the FBI, which had mysteriously contracted with him to provide information about Trump, was that Steele had also been briefing the media on anti-Trump material.\n\nThese are just some of the holes in the anti-Trump narrative alleging misconduct by the candidate and his campaign. Put it all together and so far - as far as we know from what's public - and the accusations just don't add up.\n\nThe biggest take-away is this: If collusion is a bad thing - and for undermining the integrity of any federal election it is - the white-hot spotlight belongs elsewhere, and seems to be moving that way.\n\nWhy, then, should the Mueller probe continue?\n\nThe reason is simple, legal and is why our impatient president and his supporters - including all those unfairly accused, unjustifiably hobbled, and frustratingly made to wait - should take a deep breath, stop being preoccupied by the probe and simply let it finish.\n\nThe reports that special counsels and prosecutors typically issue at the end of their inquiries - on average after 22 months of investigation - are usually thorough. Sometimes a prosecutor \"colors outside the lines,\" nabbing side players for singular acts of obstruction, perjury without a predicate act, or for unrelated misconduct discovered in the course of an investigation. But generally they focus on the mission and don't go too far afield.\n\nIn this case, reams of exculpatory information have found their way into the media, chiefly by way of congressional investigators and private sources, validating President Trump's contention of innocence.\n\nAdditionally, this information shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin's government is a bad actor - no surprise - and that all Americans, regardless of political party, have a right to be unsettled, indignant, and on guard against Russian meddling in our elections.\n\nBut none of this implicates President Trump in any wrongdoing. In fact, Mueller's probe is helping protect America by ferreting out how pervasive, invasive and invidious the Russian intentions are.\n\nSo, in the end, the president and his team have a right to that clean bill of health, whether he answers more questions or lets the record speak for itself. He needs a timely conclusion to the Mueller probe, in order to best serve America's domestic, international and national interests - to do his job unencumbered by this pasty, perfidious fiction, propagated by misguided former federal officials.\n\nLet Mueller reach that conclusion without interference, and the president and our country will be better off.",

Their witness is worth remembering, especially in this political moment.\n\nLast Saturday's feast of St. Patrick, the patron saint of our cathedral and archdiocese, reminded me of Archbishop John Hughes. As the first archbishop of New York (1842-64), \"Dagger John\" displayed dramatic reverence for the dignity of Irish immigrants. Thousands arrived daily in New York -- penniless, starving and sometimes ill -- only to be met with hostility, bigotry and injustice.\n\nAn immigrant himself, Hughes prophetically and vigorously defended their dignity. Because the schools at the time were hostile to these immigrants, he initiated Catholic schools to provide children with a good education sensitive to their religion and to prepare them as responsible, patriotic citizens. The schools worked. Many remain open to this day, their mission unchanged.\n\nThe second event was the recent funeral of a great African-American woman, Dolores Grier. A convert to Catholicism, she was named vice chancellor of the archdiocese three decades ago by Cardinal John O'Connor; she was the first layperson and first woman to hold the prestigious position. Grier was passionate about civil rights, especially the right to life of babies in the womb. She never missed an opportunity to defend, lovingly but forcefully, their right to life.",

                "body": "Fox411: The former 'Duck Dynasty' star tells Fox News how she conquered fear by putting her trust in God.\n\nIn the process of telling the truth about what you feel or what you see, each of us has to get in touch with himself or herself in a really deep, serious way.\n\n-June Jordan\n\nHave you ever had a time in your life when you just felt ugly? Maybe it was because you had a breakout, or you got a bad haircut, or that outfit you thought would look so good on you doesn't really look good on you at all.\n\nWe all know the kinds of ugly I'm talking about. Once, when I was in high school, I got the worst haircut ever. I didn't like the way my hair fell in my eyes as I ran up and down the basketball court, so I called my hairdresser to ask for a quick trim. She couldn't do it, and neither could anyone else I knew. Our team was scheduled to start a tournament the next day, and I thought I had to have a trim. So I went to the hair salon in a big discount store thinking, How bad could it be? It's just a little trim to get my hair out of my eyes.\n\nWhen you feel ugly on the outside, you can clear up the breakout, let your hair grow, or exchange an outfit that doesn't look good for one that does. When you feel ugly on the inside, none of those strategies will work.\n\nLet me tell you, it was bad. On one side of my head, the girl took off one inch of my hair. On the other side, she cut four inches! It looked horrible, and I cried the entire rest of the day. You know that old saying, \"You get what you pay for\"? Well, the total price of the haircut was five dollars. I learned the hard way what five dollars will get you in a hair salon -- and it's not pretty!\n\nI've had plenty of other experiences that made me feel ugly on the outside, and perhaps you have too. But in this chapter, I'm talking about a different kind of ugly -- the kind you feel when it's happening on the inside. I'm talking about fear, anger, resentment, jealousy -- all those negative emotions that cause you to think you're weak, unimportant -- and yes, ugly --and that you have no future.\n\nThe thing about all of this is that when something is ugly on the outside, people can see it and we're embarrassed about it. But when the ugly is on the inside, no one can see it and we're alone with it. We are more likely to deal with ugly on the outside because we want others to stop looking at it. The embarrassment we feel motivates us to fix the problem. But when we think we are the only ones who can see the ugly on the inside, we're easily tempted to let it sit in the dark places inside of us, where it grows and gets worse. It's a lot better to be embarrassed about ugly on the outside than it is to be alone wrestling with something ugly on the inside.\n\nWhen you feel ugly on the outside, you can clear up the breakout, let your hair grow, or exchange an outfit that doesn't look good for one that does. When you feel ugly on the inside, none of those strategies will work. When the problem is on the inside, the solution has to start on the inside too. You have to do what I call \"exhale your ugly.\"\n\nI've had a lot of practice exhaling my ugly. Not long before I started writing my book, \"Live Fearless: A Call to Power, Passion, and Purpose\" I went through about a two-year season of ugly. And I can assure you, it took a lot of exhaling to get all that ugly out!\n\nLet me explain what I mean by \"exhaling your ugly.\" Think about the way you breathe. You take air into your body when you inhale, and when you exhale, you let it out. You release the air you've been holding inside. So when I say, \"Exhale your ugly,\" I'm talking about letting go of negative emotions like fear, disappointment, and all the things that make you feel ugly and unworthy. You just release all of that pain and roll it over to God.\n\nIt's just like 1 Peter 5:7 says, \"Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you\" (nlt).\n\nTaken from \"Live Fearless: A Call to Power, Passion, and Purpose\" by Sadie Robertson Copyright © by Used by permission of Thomas Nelson. www.thomasnelson.com.",

                "body": "New fallout over White House school safety plan which doesn't raise age limit for rifle purchases.\n\nOnce again the country is dealing with the aftermath of another mass shooting and in the midst of a national debate about the best way to keep children safe at school. At the forefront of our national consciousness are mass shootings like the one last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that led survivors of the shooting to organize Saturday's March for Our Lives, a nationwide protest.\n\nIn Parkland, a former student shot and killed 17 people on campus on Valentine's Day. Since 1996 there have been eight mass shootings at schools, defined as incidents involving more than four deaths, excluding the assailant.\n\nWhile the focus on mass shootings is warranted, it may eclipse the more common forms of violence students face. Every year about three out of four public schools report at least one incident of serious violence such as a fight or physical attack. One in five students is bullied, one in 12 has been in a physical fight and one in 20 has carried a weapon onto school property.\n\nIt's obvious that when it comes to keeping kids safe at school, the country is failing. But how can the U.S. do better?\n\nCongress is currently considering school safety legislation that would improve school security infrastructure and set up school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams, among other measures. It is part of a wide range of proposals being introduced or developed in local, state, and federal governments. Many proposals promote technology such as metal detectors and video cameras to try to enhance campus safety, but the experts and the evidence are mixed about how effective the devices are.\n\nIn our 2015 study for the nonprofit RAND Corporation, we investigated how technology can be used to make schools safer. We profiled communities like Londonderry, New Hampshire, which remodeled schools to attach vestibules to entrances to make it harder for visitors to gain entry. Clark County, Nevada, installed more than 12,000 video surveillance cameras in its nearly 360 schools. And in Florida's Miami-Dade school district, security officers used wands to randomly conduct metal-detection screenings of students and their bookbags.\n\nBut does this technology make a difference? We don't know. Evidence of the effects of various school safety technologies is scarce. So in its absence, we interviewed dozens of school safety experts from school safety organizations and urban and rural school districts about their views regarding a range of school safety technologies.\n\nThe experts were divided about metal detectors, X-ray machines and video surveillance technology, which some felt made schools seem unwelcoming. One said these types of technologies send a mixed message to students: \"We want you to be a part of the community, but we don't trust you.\"\n\nBut the experts acknowledged some benefits of these security measures as well. Video surveillance can provide retroactive evidence for investigations when property crime or violence occurs. And metal detectors can help some educators, students and parents feel safer.\n\nSome of the experts said the potential for serious harm to students and others on campus that can result from a mass shooting, regardless of how infrequent or remote a possibility, may justify any investment in technology. But none expressed strong confidence that any one school safety technology could prevent such tragedy.\n\nSince our research was about the role of technology in keeping schools safe, we were surprised when both the evidence and experts stressed the importance of non-technological approaches. By and large, such approaches foster positive school climates: Students and staff have strong and trusting relationships with each other, students are engaged and enthused about learning, and a system is set up to attempt to handle disciplinary infractions justly and fairly.\n\nWhat's concerning is that there is emerging evidence that some technologies, such as metal detectors and video surveillance, may even detract from a school's climate. But this is a difficult theory to test.\n\nA study recently published in the American Journal of Criminal Justice found that visible security measures were associated with higher levels of student exposure to drugs and fighting. A 2010 review of studies found mixed evidence about metal detectors, with some surveys showing that students actually felt less safe when attending schools with metal detectors in place. Taken together, the two studies imply that visible security measures are not a panacea to ensure safety at school.\n\nWhile the research is far from conclusive, it suggests that schools need to carefully invest in school safety technology. Moreover, if investments are made in technology alone without taking into consideration school climates -- and how engaged and welcomed students feel in their classrooms -- the answer to the question \"Is the U.S. doing enough to keep its students safe?\" is likely to be a resounding \"no.\"",

(Associated Press)\n\nMore Vietnam War veterans who developed ailments after exposure to Agent Orange deserve health care, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin told a Senate panel this week -- but high costs, medical science and politics stand in the way.\n\nShulkin told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee that last year he suggested to White House budget officials that they add bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, Parkinson-like tremors and high blood pressure to a list of 14 illnesses presumed to be caused by exposure to Agent Orange during the war, the Tuscaloosa News reported.\n\n\"I have transmitted my recommendations to the (White House's) Office of Management and Budget. I did that by Nov. 1st,\" Shulkin said. \"And we are in the process right now of going through this data. In fact, we met with (OMB officials) on Monday. They asked for some additional data to be able to work through the process and be able to get financial estimates for this. So, we are committed to working with OMB to get this resolved in the very near future.\"\n\nThe government previously expanded coverage in June 2015 for Vietnam War vets affected by Agent Orange, which accounts for one out of six disability checks issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAt that time, the cost for covering Agent Orange-related ailments was projected to be $47.5 million over 10 years.\n\nShulkin also told the committee his position on Blue Water Navy veterans of the Vietnam War being ineligible for treatment, despite suffering an illness on the VA presumptive list.\n\n\"I am aligned with you that these veterans have waited too long,\" Shulkin said, \"and this is a responsibility that this country has. And, as our veterans get older, it's unfair. ... I believe it is imperative upon us to resolve this issue.\"\n\n\"I am aligned with you that these veterans have waited too long, and this is a responsibility that this country has. And, as our veterans get older, it's unfair. ...

The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act (HR 299) was introduced last year by Rep. David Valado, R-Ga. Despite 327 co-sponsors, the bill has yet to pass.\n\nShulkin has been under scrutiny in recent weeks, leading to speculation that President Donald Trump might replace him with Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Last month, Shulkin was found by the Department of Veterans Affairs to have misused finances for a trip to Europe, and inappropriately accepted tickets to tennis matches at Wimbledon.",

                "title": "New York's Cardinal Dolan: Democrats have abandoned Catholics",
                "body": "Cardinal Dolan on how Trump can expand school choice\n\nArchbishop of New York makes his case\n\nA couple of events over the past few weeks brought to mind two towering people who had a tremendous effect on the Archdiocese of New York and the U.S. more broadly. Their witness is worth remembering, especially in this political moment.\n\nLast Saturday's feast of St. Patrick, the patron saint of our cathedral and archdiocese, reminded me of Archbishop John Hughes. As the first archbishop of New York (1842-64), \"Dagger John\" displayed dramatic reverence for the dignity of Irish immigrants. Thousands arrived daily in New York -- penniless, starving and sometimes ill -- only to be met with hostility, bigotry and injustice.\n\nAn immigrant himself, Hughes prophetically and vigorously defended their dignity. Because the schools at the time were hostile to these immigrants, he initiated Catholic schools to provide children with a good education sensitive to their religion and to prepare them as responsible, patriotic citizens. The schools worked. Many remain open to this day, their mission unchanged.\n\nThe second event was the recent funeral of a great African-American woman, Dolores Grier. A convert to Catholicism, she was named vice chancellor of the archdiocese three decades ago by Cardinal John O'Connor; she was the first layperson and first woman to hold the prestigious position. Grier was passionate about civil rights, especially the right to life of babies in the womb. She never missed an opportunity to defend, lovingly but forcefully, their right to life.\n\nGrier attributed her pro-life sensitivity to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who preached that abortion was an act of genocide against minorities. No wonder, she often observed, abortuaries were clustered in poor black and brown neighborhoods. The statistics today confirm her observation: In 2013 there were more black babies aborted in New York City (29,007) than were born here (24,758), according to a report from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nIn 2013 there were more black babies aborted in New York City (29,007) than were born here (24,758).\n\nThe values Archbishop Hughes and Dolores Grier cherished -- the dignity and sanctity of human life, the importance of Catholic schools, the defense of a baby's civil rights -- were, and still are, widely embraced by Catholics. This often led Catholics to become loyal Democrats. I remember my own grandmother whispering to me, \"We Catholics don't trust those Republicans.\"\n\nSuch is no longer the case, a cause of sadness to many Catholics, me included. The two causes so vigorously promoted by Hughes and Grier -- the needs of poor and middle-class children in Catholic schools, and the right to life of the baby in the womb -- largely have been rejected by the party of our youth. An esteemed pro-life Democrat in Illinois, Rep. Dan Lipinski, effectively was blacklisted by his own party. Last year, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez insisted that pro-life candidates have no place in the modern Democratic Party.\n\nLast year, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez insisted that pro-life candidates have no place in the modern Democratic Party.\n\nIt is particularly chilly for us here in the state Hughes and Grier proudly called their earthly home. In recent years, some Democrats in the New York state Assembly repeatedly blocked education tax credit legislation, which would have helped middle-class and low-income families make the choice to select Catholic or other nonpublic schools for their children. Opposing the bill reduces the ability of fine Catholic schools across the state to continue their mission of serving the poor, many of them immigrants.\n\nMore sobering, what is already the most radical abortion license in the country may soon be even more morbidly expanded. For instance, under the proposed Reproductive Health Act, doctors would not be required to care for a baby who survives an abortion. The newborn simply would be allowed to die without any legal implications. And abortions would be legal up to the moment of birth.\n\nThe \"big tent\" of the Democratic Party now seems a pup tent. Annafi Wahed, a former staffer to Hillary Clinton, recently wrote in this newspaper about her experience attending the Conservative Political Action Conference. She complimented the conservative attendees, pointing out that most made her feel welcome at their meeting. They listened attentively to her views -- a courtesy, she had to admit, that would not be given to them at a meeting of political liberals.\n\nThe \"big tent\" of the Democratic Party now seems a pup tent.\n\nI'm a pastor, not a politician, and I've certainly had spats and disappointments with politicians from both of America's leading parties. But it saddens me, and weakens the democracy millions of Americans cherish, when the party that once embraced Catholics now slams the door on us.\n\nTo Archbishop Hughes, Dolores Grier, and Grandma Dolan, I'm sorry to have to write this. But not as sad as you are to know it is true.",

                "body": "CAIRO - In a surreal scene from the 2001 film \"Vanilla Sky,\" Tom Cruise runs through a deserted Times Square before screaming in despair. In a satirical version widely shared in Egypt, the square is filled with campaign billboards for President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n\nOpen your eyes anywhere in Egypt these days, and you'll see billboards, banners and posters hailing the general-turned-president, who will stand for re-election next week against a little-known politician who has made no effort to challenge him.\n\nThe outcome of the election is a foregone conclusion, so the advertising blitz appears aimed at encouraging turnout to try and bolster the vote's legitimacy.\n\nIn the meantime, the displays have provoked a wave of grim satire on social media, one of the last remaining avenues for dissent amid a sweeping crackdown that has escalated in the lead-up to the March 26-28 vote.\n\nA still photo cropped from the 1997 blockbuster \"Titanic\" shows Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet seated on the doomed ship's deck with an el-Sissi banner in the background. Another shows the stars of \"Friends\" gathered at their favorite cafe, with a sign outside saying: \"Gunther and the rest of the staff at Central Perk support Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\"\n\nThe real banners are paid for by individuals and entities from all walks of life, from private businesses and loyal political groups to lawmakers, trade unions and state-owned companies. Even a small tea house or grocery store might hang a banner out front.\n\n\"You alone are our beloved,\" swoons one banner, sponsored by a private company in the Sinai Peninsula. Another, with the image of a child, says \"Mohammed Ahmed Mustafa supports Grandpa el-Sissi.\"\n\nAutocratic rulers across the Middle East have enjoyed similar displays of public adulation for decades. Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi stared down from ubiquitous signs and billboards -- until joyous crowds tore them down when the longtime dictators were overthrown.\n\nDuring Egypt's 2011 uprising, crowds tore down portraits of Hosni Mubarak and changed the name of a central metro station from Mubarak to Martyrs. When they took over Cairo's Tahrir Square they transformed it into a sprawling gallery of opposition banners, artwork and revolutionary graffiti.\n\nEgypt's first freely elected president, the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, was widely mocked, both online and off, during his divisive year in power, before being overthrown by the military on el-Sissi's orders. Since then, the government has silenced its critics, arresting thousands of Islamists as well as prominent secular activists, and blocking hundreds of independent and critical websites.\n\nImad Hussein, the pro-government editor of the independent Al-Shorouk daily, says the proliferation of banners in support of el-Sissi is part of Egyptian culture.\n\n\"It's like a traditional Egyptian wedding when the guests try to outdo each other with how much money they give the newly-wed couple to help them start their life together,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nOthers see the banners, and the election itself, as the latest evidence of Egypt's slide back into authoritarianism. A string of potentially serious candidates withdrew from the race under pressure or were arrested, and the resulting vote strongly resembles the one-man referendums held by Arab autocrats going back to the 1950s.\n\n\"Most of these banners are made by people as a means of self-preservation or as part of their pursuit of personal gain,\" said Ibrahim Awad, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. \"The satire and sarcasm on social media show that a large segment of the population, especially activists, is not taking the elections seriously.\"\n\nA collage posted online has an elderly man waking up in his bed, shocked at the sight of an el-Sissi banner smiling down at him. Another has a statue of a nude Aphrodite with an el-Sissi sticker pasted on it. With her hand on her chest, she seems to plead with a passing museum visitor, saying: \"Enough with the posters already.\"\n\n\"The master of darkness and all death eaters support Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi,\" declares a banner hung over a scene from a \"Harry Potter\" movie with the staff and students of Hogwarts seated around a conference table.\n\nThe banners have inspired other jokes that are circulating the old-fashioned way, by word of mouth. There's the one about the voter who can't decide between the two candidates -- el-Sissi looking to his left or el-Sissi looking to his right.",

Greg Palkot reports.\n\nA French police officer who offered himself up in a hostage swap Friday after an armed man reportedly yelling \"Allahu Akbar\" went on a rampage in southern France, has died, a report said early Saturday.\n\nDetails about the death of the officer, identified as Col. Arnaud Beltrame, were not immediately available.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nThe officer had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nOfficials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raised the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nPolice said the suspect, identified as Redouane Lakdim, 26, carjacked a vehicle, shot at police and barricaded himself inside a Super U supermarket in Trebes before officers stormed in, fatally shooting him.\n\nMacron, speaking after a meeting at the emergency center at the interior ministry, praised Beltrame for offering himself in the exchange.\n\n\"He saved lives,\" said Macron, who said the rampage appeared to be a terrorist attack - the first to hit France since he became leader in May.\n\nThe Islamic State group said Lakdim, who was known to French police for petty crime and drug dealing, was one of its \"soldiers.\"\n\nFrench counterterrorism prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed that Lakdim shouted \"Allahu akbar\" as he entered the supermarket and claimed to be a \"soldier of the Islamic State.\" There were about 50 people inside the market when the Morocco-born suspect entered, the prosecutor said.\n\nMolins added that an unidentified woman who was close to the suspect and shared a life with him was taken into custody on Friday.\n\nThe series of events appeared to begin when Lakdim hijacked a car near the medieval city of Carcassonne Friday morning, killing one person in the vehicle and injuring another.\n\nYves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union, said Lakdim then fired at least six shots at a group of police officers who were returning from a jog nearby. He said the officers were wearing athletic clothes with police insignias.\n\nOne officer was shot in a shoulder, but the injury was considered non-life-threatening.\n\nAfterward, Lakdim went to the supermarket in Trebes, 60 miles southeast of Toulouse, where he opened fire and killed two people. He took an unknown number of hostages.\n\nLakdim reportedly yelled \"Allahu Akbar,\" which means \"God is Great\" in Arabic, and said \"he is ready to die for Syria,\" local media reported.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the officer participating in the swap managed to leave his cellphone switched on after the exchange, establishing contact with officers outside the supermarket.\n\nThrough that phone, police heard gunshots inside the building and decided that elite forces had to storm the market, killing Lakdim, Collomb said. He said two other officers were wounded during the assault.\n\n\"He acted alone, there was no one else but him,\" Collomb said, speaking from Trebes.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim demanded the release of Salam Abdeslam, the lone survivor of an ISIS terror cell behind the deadly 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 130 people, officials said.\n\nThe interior minister said Lakdim was a petty criminal and small-time drug dealer who had been under police surveillance, but it was not clear to authorities that he was a committed radical.\n\n\"It was more of a petty criminal who at a certain moment decided to act,\" he said.\n\nCounterterrorism investigators took over the probe into Friday's rampage. France has been on high alert since a string of Islamic extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 left more than 200 people dead.",

His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nJoshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\nUnder guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.\n\n__\n\nFollow Thomas on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",

The companies have been accused of using voluntary work programs to bypass state labor laws. (Getty Images)\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers is urging U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to defend a private prison company that is being sued by former inmates who claim they were forced to work for a wage of $1 a day.\n\nIn a letter dated March 7, 18 GOP congressman argue that \"alien detainees\" are not employees of private prisons and should not be able to file lawsuits seeking payment for their work.\n\nThe letter was first reported by the Daily Beast.\n\n\"It is our expectation that you will soon get involved in this litigation and take the position that these lawsuits lack legal merit and should be dismissed,\" the letter reads.\n\nPrivate prison companies GEO Group and CoreCivic have been the subject of at least five lawsuits over detainee pay. The companies have been accused of using voluntary work programs to bypass state labor laws.\n\nOne lawsuit against GEO for instance, filed by the state of Washington last year, sought to force the company relinquish its profits that it supposedly made by violating minimum wage laws.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers' letter argues that paying immigrant detainees more than $1 a day would \"drain the federal government of limited taxpayer resources\" and that immigrant advocates have raised the overall cost of detention by discouraging cooperation with federal authorities.\n\nAs of Friday, there was no indication that Sessions' office received the letter, the Washington Post reported, citing a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice.\n\n\"Unless your agencies act to intervene in these lawsuits, immigration enforcement efforts will be thwarted,\" the letter reads.\n\nEditor's Note: After this story first appeared, GEO Group contacted Fox News, noting that the Daily Beast article cited above had been updated to include a statement from the company, in which it says that wages in the Voluntary Wage Program are set by the federal government, not the company. The statement reads, in part:\n\n\"GEO has consistently, strongly refuted the allegations made in the lawsuits referenced in the [Daily Beast] story, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our company against these baseless claims. The facts laid out above are clearly stated in our legal responses to these lawsuits and were also largely included in the Congressional letter that was the subject of the story.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Daily Beast story did not include any of these facts and instead factually mischaracterized this matter as 'forced labor' (including in the story's headline) as if that characterization was an indisputable fact without even using the word 'alleged' or 'allegation.'\"",

No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis in February sent Trump a memorandum laying out policies that \"in the exercise of his independent judgment\" should be implemented by the Defense Department. The memo reads, in part:\n\n\"Based on the work of the Panel and the Department's best military judgement, the Department of Defense concludes that there are substantial risks associated with allowing the accession and retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and require, or have already undertaken, a course of treatment to change their gender.\n\n\"Furthermore, the Department also finds that exempting such persons from well-established mental health, physical health, and sex-based standards, which apply to all Service members, including transgender Service members without gender dysphoria, could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden of the military that is mot conductive to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nIn July, Trump tweeted that the federal government \"will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\" - reversing a 2016 policy under President Barack Obama. The move caught the Pentagon by surprise.\n\n\"Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail,\" the president said at the time.\n\nTrump's push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges and the Pentagon began allowing transgender recruits to seek enlistment in January.\n\nA 2016 study by the Rand Corp. estimated that nearly 4,000 transgender troops were on active duty and in the reserves, Politico reported. But LGBT advocacy groups in the military put the figure at around 15,000, the report said.",

On March 3, 2009, the bus carrying the visiting cricketers, part of a large convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. They were on their way to play the third day of the second test against Pakistan, and six Pakistan policemen and two civilians were killed, and six members of the Sri Lanka team were injured.\n\nThat resulted in an end to international cricket in the country, and the Pakistan Cricket Board was left with no choice but to choose United Arab Emirates as its \"home\" turf to host international teams.\n\nHowever, the PCB continued in its efforts to convince foreign nations to begin touring Pakistan. Lahore first hosted the PSL final last year, and there were Twenty20 international matches organized against a World XI (three matches) and Sri Lanka (one).\n\nBut a reluctance from some international PSL players to play in Pakistan remains. The preliminary PSL matches were played at Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates\n\nAustralian Shane Watson (Quetta Gladiators) and Englishmen Eoin Morgan (Karachi) and Kevin Pietersen (Quetta) all refused to accompany their respective franchises to Lahore earlier this week for two PSL eliminators.\n\nThe absence of the top stars hurt both franchises and drew an angry response from Gladiators coach and former Pakistan captain Moin Khan.\n\n\"We, in the coming season, should only pick players who have the consent to visit Pakistan,\" Moin said after losing the first eliminator against Zalmi.\n\n\"We do not need to push for individuality as our league has now become a bigger brand ... we don't need to get these players who don't want to come to Pakistan. In fact, this is hurting Pakistan as it is sending a negative signal and affects our country's image as well.\"\n\nThe provincial administration in Karachi has put up in place stringent security arrangements for Sunday's final. Spectators might have to wait in long queues hours before the evening final and will get into the stadium only after going through at least three security checkpoints.\n\nBut the city is giving a festive look to welcome foreign players like Peshawar Zalmi's Darren Sammy of West Indies and Chris Jordan of England, and South African J.P. Duminy and New Zealand's Luke Ronchi of Islamabad United.\n\nBillboards and player cut-outs have been displayed on the sides of main streets to celebrate an international-standard game for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nSammy has become a household name in Pakistan -- especially the way he has carried Zalmi to the final after playing four successive matches with a leg injury.\n\n\"Yes Karachi we're coming,\" Sammy said in a video message. \"I want you all to come and support Peshawar Zalmi. I want everybody to wear the yellow shirt, it's a yellow storm, we're coming.\"",

President Donald Trump has cited his case to illustrate problems with the nation's immigration policy.\n\nBracamontes has repeatedly said in court that he killed the deputies and wished he had killed more.\n\nThe deputies were killed shortly after the couple arrived in Sacramento during what Monroy said was a wandering journey spurred by Bracamontes' drug-infused paranoia.\n\nThe court also heard victim impact statements from Davis' family, the report said.\n\n\"I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest,\" Debbie McMahon, Davis' mother, said.\n\nWhite rejected arguments from defense attorney Pete Kmeto that Monroy was a battered wife and victim of an abusive, threatening husband, who \"was armed to the teeth, raving about killing people\" and abused methamphetamine, the Bee reported.\n\n\"She's not the person who killed law enforcement officers,\" Kmeto said, noting that Monroy never pulled a trigger during the crime spree. \"This client is not an evil person, this client has been victimized and has had a tough life.\"\n\nIn opposition, Sacramento prosecutor Rod Norgaard told the judge that Monroy knew before the rampage that her husband wanted to kill police officers, the newspaper reported.\n\n\"She did not commit a crime with the devil,\" Norgaard said. \"She married him.\"\n\nMonroy faced a life sentence after she was convicted of 10 charges including murder, attempted murder and carjacking, attempted carjacking and possessing an assault rifle.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty for Bracamontes, who was convicted by a separate jury. Closing arguments in his case are set for Monday.",

The officer then fired into the vehicle, striking the driver.\n\n\"At the time, the officer felt he was in peril for his own life and took action,\" Largo Police Lt. Randall Chaney said later at a news conference.\n\nA backup officer arrived just as Steiner fired his weapon, police said. It was not immediately known how many rounds were fired.\n\nThe identity of the driver was not immediately released, but police said he was the only occupant of the vehicle. The driver was pronounced dead at Largo Medical Center.\n\nSteiner was treated for non-life-threatening injuries at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater.\n\n\"I just spoke with him, actually, and he's doing OK,\" Chaney said.\n\nThe lieutenant added that Steiner's actions may have stopped others from being injured or killed.",

Kazi had no known links to terrorism, did not leave behind a manifesto or any threats or explanation, and a video found on a cellphone provided no clue.\n\n\"Why did this individual end up at the front gate of Travis Air Base on fire and now deceased? We don't have the answers to that,\" Ragan said. Investigators know of no one else associated with the incident nor any threats to air base or the community.\n\nAir Force gate personnel initially thought they were dealing with a vehicle accident when Kazi crashed and they realized he was on fire. No shots were fired as he entered the base, and it was only after the fire was out and they broke through the locked minivan doors to aid Kazi that they realized it was loaded with five propane tanks, three gallon-size gasoline cans and several cigarette lighters, Ragan said. Also found was a gym bag with personal effects and three cellphones.\n\nKazi's body was so badly burned that he had to be identified by fingerprints. Ragan said he is a native of India who has lived in the United States since 1993 and was a permanent legal resident. He never served in the military and has no known ties to the air base, he said.\n\n\"We know what happened,\" Ragan said. \"Now the question is why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don't know the answers to that, quite frankly. So the investigation that we're doing right now is trying to piece together his life, trying to piece together what led up to this event, and attempt to determine why he was there and why he had those items in his vehicle ... They will continue at it until we get the answers.\"\n\nRagan said they have been unable to find any of Kazi's family living in the United States. A family member in India has been notified of Kazi's death, Ragan said. He said Kazi appeared to work as a cab driver in the past, but that investigators haven't determined if he was currently employed. It's not clear if he owned the minivan.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence of any religious affiliation or anything at this point,\" Ragan said. \"As of right now, we know of no other associates.\"\n\nInvestigators have interviewed some of Kazi's acquaintances and are working on some search warrants, he said. They also are scouring social media, so far without result.\n\nCalls to several numbers associated with Kazi were not returned Friday.\n\nAbout 10,000 people live and work on the base 55 miles (88 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.",

They then carefully prepared each one for reburial in individual coffins.\n\nThe families of the soldiers and Argentine officials thanked Cardozo on Friday at an emotional ceremony in Buenos Aires.",

                "body": "NEW ORLEANS - The first-degree murder trial of a man accused of killing a New Orleans police officer in 2015 is nearing its end.\n\nDefense lawyers for Travis Boys wrapped up their case Thursday. New Orleans news outlets report that prosecution rebuttal witnesses and evidence were presented Friday, as prosecutors sought to counter defense lawyers' contention that Boys is mentally ill. Boys has pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nIt was unclear whether state District Judge Karen Herman would have jurors deliberate Friday night or delay the start of deliberations until Saturday.\n\nIf convicted, Boys would serve life in prison for the death of Officer Daryle Holloway. Holloway was shot in a police SUV in June 2015 as he was transporting Boys to jail after an earlier arrest.\n\nBoys escaped the SUV. He was caught the next day after an intense manhunt.\n\nPolice said they believe Boys smuggled the gun into the police vehicle. They said the suspect was handcuffed but somehow got his hands in front of his body, shot Holloway and escaped the vehicle, which crashed into a utility pole.\n\nIn October 2015, a former police officer pleaded guilty to malfeasance and obstruction of justice charges related to Holloway's death. Wardell Johnson is awaiting sentencing in the case. Police said he failed to adequately pat down Boys after his arrest, and tried to cover up his shoddy police work.\n\nBoys had been set for trial in October. But he brought an abrupt end to jury selection in those proceedings by smearing his head and face with feces he had smuggled into the courtroom.\n\nHerman, who ordered a mental evaluation for Boys after the feces-smearing incident, later declared Boys competent for trial and stated that he had \"hijacked\" the proceedings with his stunt. \"He will no longer be allowed to control these proceedings,\" Herman told the defense at a November hearing.\n\nJurors were selected last week. Testimony began after opening statements on Monday.\n\nHolloway's body camera was on when he was shot. Media accounts of Tuesday's testimony say a New Orleans police lieutenant walked jurors through the video recording, pointing out images of Holloway's arm trying to control the handgun used in the shooting. It also captured the sounds of a struggle, Boys yelling \"Let me out before you kill yourself,\" and a gunshot.\n\nDefense attorneys have focused on Boys' mental capacity, eliciting testimony from one expert who testified that an IQ test he took as a teenager indicated \"borderline retardation,\" and a sister who said Boys had trouble remembering basic information.",

The paper said the ginormous rock was turned up in a most unlikely place -- an ice bucket two tables down from where Hilton had been partying.\n\nA witness told the Post's Emily Smith: \"Paris was dancing with her hands in the air, and the next minute her giant ring had flown off. She was really panicked as the venue was packed and very dark, it was the early hours of the morning and it was crazy in there.\"\n\n\"It was amazing that they managed to even see that huge diamond in an ice bucket.

After 14 months in the Oval Office, Trump is more comfortable bucking the advice of White House staffers and congressional Republicans, and that is increasingly putting even his allies on edge.\n\nTrump may have an even more dramatic shake-up in mind for his administration.\n\nThe president has floated to outside advisers a plan to do away with the traditional West Wing power structure, including the formal chief of staff role, to create the more free-wheeling atmosphere he relished while running his business and later his presidential campaign at Trump Tower.\n\nThe sense of apprehension is palpable in the West Wing, where tempers are running short and uneasy aides discuss their future employment prospects behind closed doors, according to six White House officials and several outside advisers. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal dynamics.\n\nRecent blows to staff confidence have been almost exclusively instigated by the president himself. He congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his re-election and didn't chide him about the tainted vote or the poisoning of a spy on British soil. He pushed forward with steel and aluminum tariffs, prompting his chief economic adviser to quit. And he agreed to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to the surprise of many national security officials.\n\nThursday's announcement of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster's impending exit continued the trend.\n\nThe two men never clicked personally, and Trump was known to complain when he saw extended meetings with the national security adviser on his schedule. Trump also, as he did with fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, grew frustrated when McMaster would try to curb some of his instincts on international relations, according to White House officials and outside advisers.\n\nNow he has turned to former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, whom Trump described to one outside confidant as \"a killer\" on television and likely to forcefully advocate for the president's beliefs, despite sometimes divergent views on American intervention overseas, according to a person familiar with the president's views but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nTrump has admired Bolton for years, tweeting in 2014 his praise of an article in which Bolton argued for more domestic oil drilling. He has expressed appreciation for Bolton's appearances defending Trump even though he has voiced some unhappiness about the look of Bolton's bushy mustache, according to the person familiar the president's thinking.\n\nTrump is not entirely unmoored from his aides. After threatening on Friday to veto a $1.3 trillion spending agreement his staffers had already promised he would sign, Trump came back around after a concerted lobbying effort by his legislative team and Cabinet secretaries. But not before venting his frustration at the process and the bill -- drafted in part by his own team -- in a hastily called \"press availability\" in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.\n\nTrump has long chafed at how chief of staff John Kelly has curbed access to him in the Oval Office and has mused about doing away with the gatekeepers, according to two people familiar with the president's thinking but not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.\n\nTrump, who frequently muses about staff shake-ups without following through, appears to have tabled the idea for now. But it received a ringing endorsement from his former chief strategist Steve Bannon during a panel discussion in New York on Thursday.\n\nBannon suggested a system of \"five or six direct reports\" to the Oval Office would fit the president's preferred management style\n\n\"I think the president is a very hands-on manager and feels more comfortable\" with such a style, said Bannon , who spoke admiringly of Kelly but said the chief of staff put \"too much structure into the White House.\"\n\nReince Priebus, Trump's first chief of staff, \"was a little bit more like President Trump was used to. General Kelly came in and it was completely different, very ordered, very structured,\" said Bannon, who had his own falling out with Trump. \"I think we've seen a reaction to that and I believe you're going to see the president much more directly in contact with staff people.\"",

                "body": "Twelve bump stocks were found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas massacre shooter. Lawmakers, including some Republicans are concerned about their capabilities but what are they?\n\nDays after yet another mass shooting sparked a nationwide debate on gun control and an immediate response from lawmakers, President Trump took action.\n\nThe president said he signed an order on Feb. 20 directing the Justice Department to ban \"bump stocks\" and other gun modifiers that make semi-automatic firearms fire faster.\n\n\"We must move past clichés and tired debates and focus on evidence-based solutions and security measures that actually work,\" Trump said during a ceremony to honor the 17 victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nA month later, Trump confirmed the Justice Department is forging ahead with his plan to ban rapid-fire bump stocks.\n\n\"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns,\" he explained in a tweet on March 23.\n\nHere's what you need to know about bump stocks, the devices involved in last year's Las Vegas shooting.\n\nA bump stock is an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to mimic a fully automatic weapon's \"cyclic firing rate to mimic nearly continuous automatic fire,\" according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\nSemi-automatic rifles with bump stocks could fire hundreds of rounds per minute, according to experts.\n\nYes. The ATF gave its seal of approval under the Obama administration in 2010.\n\nAt the time, the bureau concluded bump stocks didn't convert a semi-automatic firearm into one that is fully automatic, meaning it was not equivalent to machine guns that are regulated under the National Firearms Act, which dates back to the 1930s.\n\nBump stocks are currently legal under federal law. However, it is illegal for U.S. citizens to own fully automatic firearms produced after May 19, 1986, The New York Times reported.\n\n\"The classification of these devices depends on whether they mechanically alter the function of the firearm to fire fully automatic,\" Jill Snyder, a special agent in charge at the ATF, told The Times. \"Bump-fire stocks, while simulating automatic fire, do not actually alter the firearm to fire automatically, making them legal under current federal law.\"\n\nBut since the deadly Las Vegas shooting, states and cities have increasingly pushed for legislation to ban the devices.\n\nMassachusetts became the first state to pass legislation banning the device after the October incident. The state law, which went into effect Feb. 1, prohibits possession of the device under all circumstances. It also bans the possession of trigger cranks.\n\nNew Jersey, as well as large cities such as Denver and Columbia, South Carolina, also have enacted laws prohibiting the sale and possession of bump stocks.\n\nCalifornia law already prohibited the sale of bump stocks.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) even called for an immediate review of bump stocks after the Vegas shooting.\n\n\"The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,\" the NRA said in a statement in October.\n\nTrump assured Americans that something would be done about bump stocks very quickly.\n\n\"I'm writing that out myself. I don't care if Congress does it or not,\" he said on Feb. 26. \"You put it into the machine gun category, which is what it is, it becomes, essentially, a machine gun, and nobody is going to be able to -- it's going to very hard to get them.\"\n\nOn March 23, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, which includes several policy changes aimed at curbing gun violence, including the so-called \"Fix NICS\" measure to strengthen the background check system.\n\nThe measure to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) provides additional funding to agencies and states that comply with the system. Those that did not, would be penalized.\n\nMore than $2 billion is also allocated to train school officials and law enforcement officers to identify signs of potential threats. This money, would also be used to install metal detectors.\n\nAnother main action Trump has taken on guns has been to sign a resolution blocking an Obama-era background check rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain mentally disabled people.\n\nObama's rule, which affected an estimated 75,000 people, required the Social Security Administration to forward to the Justice Department the names of certain disabled beneficiaries to be added to an FBI database of individuals ineligible to purchase a firearm.",

Bolton is known to be hard-hitting, fiercely nationalistic and eager to confront U.S. adversaries.\n\nIn his first year in office, Trump surrounded himself with foreign policy aides whose views spanned a wide spectrum. Bolton's pick rounds out a team that in Trump's second year will be composed almost entirely of hawks whose publicly stated views about national security veer decidedly to the right.",

                "body": "The storm that drenched California this week brought much-needed rain to the state, which has been slipping back into drought conditions due to a dry winter that only turned wet and snowy this month.\n\nPreliminary storm data Friday shows some stunning totals for the three-day storm, including more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain at some locations in the Sierra Nevada and on the central coast, and 31 inches (79 centimeters) of snow at Tuolumne Meadows in the Sierra.\n\nIn the agricultural Central Valley, farmers say the storm interrupted some harvests and will delay some planting, but that's outweighed by the benefit of adding more moisture to the soil.\n\nSafety officials are at the site of a small California dam that had threatened to fail under heavy rains.\n\nSpokesman Chris Orrock said Friday that state dam experts are inspecting Moccasin Dam, near Yosemite National Park in Tuolumne County. Operators are now draining the reservoir behind the weakened 60-foot (18-meter) high dam.\n\nAuthorities evacuated about three dozen people Thursday when water neared the top of the dam. Officials also spotted water seeping through the front of the earthen dam.\n\nAuthorities say the danger of immediate dam failure had passed by late Thursday.\n\nThe 88-year-old dam is part of the Hetch Hetchy water system that supplies water to 2.7 million people in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nA storm that pounded California with heavy rain has moved on, leaving only a few stray showers in its wake.\n\nThe storm swelled rivers, flooded streets and triggered water rescues statewide over three days but spared communities a repeat of the deadly debris flows that occurred during a January deluge.\n\nForecasters said Friday that Southern California will see mostly benign weather for the coming week. But the break in precipitation will be brief for northern and eastern California.\n\nThe first of two new weather systems will bring widespread rain and heavy snow in the mountains through the weekend.\n\nA powerful storm in California that swelled rivers, flooded streets and triggered water rescues throughout the state is on its last gasp.\n\nThe three-day storm spared communities a repeat of the deadly debris flows following a deluge earlier this year.\n\nBut it did dump record rainfall in some parts and unleashed flooding that led to dramatic rescues from Los Angeles in Southern California all the way to Folsom, some 400 miles (645 kilometers) to the north.\n\nIn San Luis Obispo County in central California, rescuers reported pulling 10 people from the Salinas River on Thursday.\n\nAll remaining flood warnings and watches were set to expire overnight Friday.",

                "body": "In nearly 3,000 protests nationwide, students across the country walked out of their classrooms to take a stand against gun violence one month after the Parkland, Florida shooting.\n\nJust days after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people, students-turned-activists echoed the words \"never again\" and \"not one more,\" pushing lawmakers for increased gun control and better school safety.\n\nMany of the Parkland students, who have primarily taken to social media to champion these issues, have met with President Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., among others to demand action.\n\nOne shooting survivor Cameron Kasky, a junior at the high school, wrote an op-ed about his experience, demanding Congress to take action.\n\nOther Parkland shooting survivors have organized events.\n\nIn addition to the 17-minute National School Walkout on March 14, which honored those killed in the massacre and protested gun violence, student activists are planning a march in Washington, D.C. called a \"March for Our Lives.\"\n\nAhead of the event, here's what you need to know.\n\nThe march is slated to take place on Saturday, March 24, around 12 p.m., organizers said.\n\nThe primary march will take place in Washington, D.C. on Pennsylvania Avenue between 3rd and 12th street NW, according to the March for Our Lives website.\n\nInitially, organizers wanted to hold the event on the National Mall, but were forced to choose another location because their request conflicted with a film crew's permit, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMany other cities -- such as Portland, Oregon; Boise, Idaho; Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, Dallas and Chicago, among hundreds of other places -- are holding \"sister marches.\"\n\n\"This is such a unifying experience, it's truly nonpartisan\" said Ellie Boan, 19, a freshman at the University of South Carolina. She plans to attend a sister march in Columbia on March 24.\n\n\"Not everyone necessarily agrees how [gun reform] should happen. But different viewpoints are coming together and all agree that no American child should feel unsafe in school,\" she said.\n\nFor Boan, who has been working with local high schools and student organizations on her campus to help organize the event, the shooting itself \"doesn't get anymore close to home.\"\n\nBoan is originally from Parkland, Fla. While she didn't attend Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, her older brother did. On top of that, her parents' home is \"just five minutes away from the school\" where the Valentine's Day mass shooting unfolded.\n\n\"I was on the phone with my mom during the shooting,\" she said, adding that helicopters heading toward the high school could be heard in the call's background.\n\n\"[Parkland] was the last place in America I ever expected for this to happen,\" she said. Once known for its picturesque golf courses and safety, Boan added, the city will now be remembered as the site of one of the \"biggest mass shootings in U.S. history.\"\n\nShortly after the suspected shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was identified, Boan had a chilling realization: She knew him, albeit not well.\n\n\"His name sounded familiar, even though I didn't want it to,\" she said.\n\nAt that moment, Boan realized that she and he had attended the same middle school.\n\n\"He even had a presence back then,\" she said.\n\nComing to that realization was the \"most difficult thing to deal with,\" Boan said. \"I knew someone who was capable to inflict that kind of damage.\"\n\nBut Boan has since channeled her emotions -- which have ranged from sadness to fear to anger -- into activism.\n\n\"I wanted to do something even though I couldn't be there [Parkland],\" she said.\n\nParticipating in the march later this month is the \"most effective way to process what I was going through,\" she added. \"Students are directly telling legislators what they want to be done. I hope that continues.\"\n\nAdults are listening\n\nPerry Bradley, founder and executive director of Building Better Communities, a community outreach organization in South Carolina, is helping organize the sister march in Columbia that will end on the steps of the city's statehouse.\n\nStudents, local lawmakers and state representatives are slated to speak at the event.\n\n\"Parkland opened our eyes,\" Bradley told Fox News. \"Adults are embracing what kids have to say [about gun reform].\"\n\nA bipartisan cause\n\n\"I think that we have finally reached a breaking point in America,\" 21-year-old Antwon Stephens, who plans to participate in a sister march in Atlanta, told Fox News. \"Both sides are tired of the answer being nothing.\"\n\nStephens, who said he comes from a family who \"firmly believes in the Second Amendment,\" echoed Boan -- he also thinks the March for Our Lives movement presents an opportunity for unity, adding that both sides of the political aisle should work in a \"non-partisan way\" to understand \"why things like this keep happening.\"\n\n\"I think it is going to take a whole lot of elbow grease to keep this movement going strong,\" he said. \"But this movement is most powerful because it's led by students.\"\n\nFor family and the future\n\n\"I was numb. I was in shock for three days after I heard about the shooting,\" said Jennia Taylor, a senior at Spelman College who also plans to attend a sister march in Atlanta.\n\nHailing from Parkland, Florida, the shooting greatly impacted Taylor not only because it occured in her hometown, but also because the 21-year-old is a 2014 graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, she told Fox News.\n\n\"[Stoneman Douglas] is a big family; it was like hearing that someone invaded your home,\" Taylor said, who added that she first found out about the massacre through her family's group chat.\n\n\"I lived there in high school,\" she said. \"I saw my teachers and coaches more than I saw my parents.\"\n\nThe day of the shooting, hearing about students and faculty who had been injured or killed affected Taylor the most, she said. It was also unnerving, she added, because Taylor's younger cousin is a freshman at the school.\n\nShe was also worried for her former classmates as well, as many of them have younger siblings or family members who are current students at the high school, she said.\n\n\"We all kind of know each other, she said. \"It's so intertwined, it's kind of crazy.\"\n\nTaylor's heart sank when she heard that Aaron Feis, a beloved football coach at Stoneman Douglas, had been shot and killed shielding students from a rain of bullets.\n\nTaylor's two brothers, also graduates of Stoneman Douglas, played football at the school and her family was well acquainted with Feis. As a result, the loss hit her hard.\n\n\"It's really hard for my family knowing him, and knowing his family,\" she said.\n\nAs for her participation in the March for Our Lives, Taylor said she's excited to \"see people from all walks of life who have been affected by gun violence come together and march for a purpose,\" she said. \"[They're] putting opinions aside to make sure we have a safe community and safe society.\"\n\n\"I'm going to grow up and have kids. I don't want to fear that every time they leave they're going to get shot,\" she said. \"After it happened in my hometown, I realized that it's time to take action.\"\n\nThe National Park Service told the Washington Post that at least 500,000 people are expected to attend the march in D.C. alone.\n\nThe event, which is being organized and led by Stoneman Douglas students and shooting survivors Emma González, Cameron Kasky, among others, is mainly funded through donations.\n\nKasky created a GoFundMe page to help pay for the event, raising more than 3.3 million in a month.\n\n\"Half of the funds raised on this GoFundMe will go toward the March For Our Lives Action Fund,\" Kasky explained on the fundraising page. \"The other half of the funding raised on this GoFundMe will provide relief and financial support to the victims and families of the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School via the Broward Education Foundation.\"\n\nCelebrities such as George and Amal Clooney and Oprah have donated $500,000 to the event, as have Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Deadline reported.\n\nJack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, announced on March 9 that he also donated $500,000 to March for Our Lives.\n\n\"I'm so inspired by all the conversations the Stoneman Douglas students are leading!\" he tweeted.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, and Giffords, an anti-gun violence group that was started by former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, among other national organizations, are also working with march organizers -- either through donations or planning and logistics.\n\n\"Students are making history and demanding that our elected officials protect them. Everytown is proud to help them make their voices heard on March 24, and we look forward to more Americans following their lead to forge meaningful change to our country's gun laws,\" John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown, said in a statement after the organization announced its $2.5 million grant to support sister marches around the country.\n\nThe ride-hailing company Lyft also announced that it will offer free rides to Stoneman Douglas students participating in the march.\n\nThe event is not a political one, organizers claim.\n\n\"School safety is not a political issue,\" a mission statement on the organization's website reads. \"There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing.\"\n\nWhile the activists \"support the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms, as set forth in the United States Constitution,\" they also have a list of demands, urging members of Congress to pass laws to end the sale of high-capacity magazines, improve background checks and more safety measures.",

                "body": "LOS ANGELES - The storm that drenched California this week brought much-needed rain to the state, which has been slipping back into drought conditions due to a dry winter that only turned wet and snowy this month.\n\nPreliminary storm data Friday showed some stunning totals for the three-day storm, including more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain at some locations in the Sierra Nevada and on the central coast, and 31 inches (79 centimeters) of snow at Tuolumne Meadows in the Sierra.\n\nIn coastal Santa Barbara and Ventura counties northwest of Los Angeles, where drought conditions have been characterized as severe to extreme, many locations reported well over 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain from the storm.\n\nAny addition to the Sierra snowpack is welcome: Runoff from the 400-mile-long (644-kilometer-long) range supplies about a third of the water used by Californians each year, but the most recent measurement found its water content to be less than 40 percent of normal.\n\nFor counties like Santa Barbara, the rain will help fill reservoirs that are vital to local water supplies even though the storm forced thousands to evacuate their homes due to the threat of destructive debris flows which fortunately did not materialize. A little over a year ago, years of drought had reduced a major reservoir there to less than 10 percent of capacity before the historic rains of 2017.\n\nIn the San Joaquin Valley -- part of the Central Valley agricultural heartland of California -- the storm brought pluses and minuses.\n\n\"It's making it messy,\" said Joe Del Bosque, owner of Del Bosque Farms on the west side of the San Joaquin, where the rain interrupted his asparagus harvest for two days and when it resumed workers had to walk the crop out of the fields because tractors couldn't be used.\n\nIn addition to lost wages for workers, the storm will delay planting of his melons and other farmers' tomatoes, which in turn will delay those harvests, he said.\n\nOn the positive side, the moisture the storm put into the ground will help his almond and cherry trees, which have finished blooming and are leafing out. It will also help develop cover crops that are plowed into the ground where organic melons are grown.\n\nRunoff will also help recharge groundwater on the east side of the San Joaquin Valley that has been depleted through pumping during years of drought, Del Bosque said.\n\n\"I think the benefits of the storm outweigh the disadvantages of it ... because we needed this rain so badly,\" he said.\n\nAs the storm headed east Thursday, authorities continued to clean up rockslides and mud from roads and cut up toppled trees.\n\nIn Tuolumne County near Yosemite National Park, state experts were inspecting a small dam that had threatened to fail during the rains.\n\nOperators were draining the reservoir behind the weakened 60-foot (18-meter) high dam, said spokesman Chris Orrock.\n\nAuthorities evacuated about three dozen people Thursday when water neared the top of the dam. Officials also spotted water seeping through the front of the earthen dam but the danger of immediate failure passed by late that day.\n\nThe 88-year-old dam is part of the Hetch Hetchy water system that supplies water to 2.7 million people in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nForecasters said Southern California would see mostly benign weather in coming days, but northern and eastern California could expect heavy snow in the mountains from Friday afternoon through Sunday as two new systems moved through.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this story from San Francisco.",

Slowly, the snake slithered up the man's body and started to wrap itself around his neck.\n\nThe man appeared calm - acting as if he was simply wearing a turtleneck. He continued to motion people to come closer.\n\nThirty seconds later, the man kneeled on the ground and appeared to be having trouble breathing. He leaned forward and grabbed the snake's body, attempting to forcefully pull the creature off.\n\nFor nearly a minute, a group of people just watched in shock and horror. They realized the man was in serious trouble when he toppled over onto the sandy ground.\n\nHe appeared to be unconscious when a man stepped in to help. He sprinkled water on the snake and eventually the python slitered away.\n\nA group of three men rushed the unidentified man to a nearby hospital in Varanasi on March 20, according to The Independent. His condition is still unknown.\n\nSnake charmers are common in India, but the reptiles have been known to turn on their handlers.\n\nA famed \"snake whisperer\" in Malaysia died last week after he was bitten by a cobra, Free Malaysia Today reported.\n\nLast year, Dan Brandon, a snake enthusiast in the U.K., was found suffocated to death near his pet python, \"Tiny.\" A coroner later confirmed there was \"no doubt\" the python had killed him.",

                "body": "On the roster: Washington well represented in spending deal - Stocks slide as China trade concerns remain - Dem Senate committee outraises GOP - White House Counsel McGahn heading for the exit? - Crash into you\n\nWASHINGTON WELL REPRESENTED IN SPENDING DEAL\n\nYou can't blame the spending bill that just plopped out of your government for our debt and deficit any more than you could blame the last box of Nilla Wafers for the 500-pound man's waistline.\n\nIt sure didn't help, but at this point what's another 1,400 calories or another $1.3 trillion?\n\nIn announcing that he was signing the measure, President Trump vowed that he would never again sign legislation like it. He seemed to be talking about the additional spending he wanted in the bill, particularly for his signature initiative: a wall along sections of the U.S. southern border.\n\nBut if he was talking about a bill that spends money the government does not have, he will sign plenty more just like it.\n\nEven in an era of robust economic growth, Republicans have already managed to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt in just 14 months. Current projections are that they will do so again in less than a year, and given what we are seeing in markets these days, it could come very soon indeed.\n\nThe license plates in the District of Columbia take up the cry of our colonial forebears: \"Taxation without representation.\"\n\nAnd it is certainly true that the residents of the District of Columbia, some 700,000 souls, do not have voting members in the House and Senate. But it would be hard to say that their interests are not represented. The federal district is a growing, increasingly affluent medium-sized American city arranged around a single industry. But the good thing about this company town is that the company never has a bad year because it can borrow whatever it likes.\n\nWhen the United States went off the gold standard, the doom-and-gloomers of the day warned that a floating currency would be an invitation to irresponsible conduct on the part of the government. If the Feds could just print their way out of shortfalls or economic problems, ruinous inflation and instability would sure follow.\n\nOur government (mostly) did not do that, but what it did do was find a way to cook the books.\n\nMost of the money the federal government owes -- currently zooming toward the $22 trillion mark -- it owes to you. The Treasury Department takes from the Social Security trust fund and promises to pay back later. They don't, but do make interest payments. That's why the fourth largest expenditure of the government is debt service.\n\nThis spending bill, like the ones that have come before it and the ones that come after it was predicated on the idea that spending rates must be increased to keep the government and the economy humming along.\n\nEvery new high rise condominium complex on Massachusetts Avenue, every new Michelin starred restaurant and every gleaming glass facade on another building full of influence peddlers are monuments to this arrangement.\n\nShould we have more defense spending or more domestic spending? Yup. Should we lower taxes or expand the social safety net? You betcha. Should we engage in nation building abroad or nation building here at home? Like, duh.\n\nThis arrangement that suits Washington so well also suits politicians quite nicely. They have avoided hard choices for decades, always arguing that addressing systemic problems would be too disruptive. And down goes another box of Nilla Wafers. Chomp.\n\nSo in the interest of Washingtonians, in and out of office are certainly well represented, even if the District doesn't get a vote on the final spending bills. But there is one group that has neither a voice nor an advocate in this process: future generations.\n\nOur Constitution says that the purpose of our republic is, in part, to \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\" Well, there is plenty of posterior covering, but not a lot of evident care for posterity.\n\nThe orgiastic spending of the past five decades, facilitated by the military and economic might of the world's great super power, has seldom come with any tax increases on the living. But make no mistake, deficit spending is every bit as much taxation as what the folks at the IRS do.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the first fiscal hawk, argued that the government should never borrow what could be paid back by the current generation. He argued that the earth belongs to the living and that \"the dead have neither powers nor rights over it.\"\n\nJames Madison tried to temper Jefferson's point of view arguing to his friend that debts incurred for the purpose of securing liberty for future generations should be allowed. Borrowing money to raise money to build an army to repel an invading force but that any debt had to be for a purpose that serves \"the unborn, as well as the living.\"\n\nYou would have to cut the bologna pretty thin to argue that much of what the government does today is in the interest of securing blessings for future generations. Perhaps the better place for a \"taxation without representation\" license plate is not on the bumper of a BMW idling outside Fiola Mare but instead on a baby carriage.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: THE WORST, EXCEPT FOR ALL THE REST\n\n\"It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it may forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust.\" - Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62\n\nTIME OUT: BROTHERS AND OTHERS\n\nNatGeo: \"So how can biological siblings have different [genetic] results? The family mismatch (usually) isn't due to skeletons in the closet and is instead because of slight variations in egg and sperm DNA. When the body creates sperm or eggs, the cells engage in some reshuffling known as genetic recombination. This process cuts the number of chromosomes that normal cells have in half -- from 46 to 23 -- so that when a sperm and egg combine during fertilization, they form a complete genetic package. ... Because of recombination, siblings only share about 50 percent of the same DNA, on average, [Megan Dennis] says. So while biological siblings have the same family tree, their genetic code might be different in at least one of the areas looked at in a given test. That's true even for fraternal twins. The more diverse your recent ancestors are, Dennis says, the more pronounced the effects of genetic recombination can be.\"\n\nSTOCKS SLIDE AS CHINA TRADE CONCERNS REMAIN\n\nFox Business: \"The S&P 500 notched its worst week in more than two years Friday, as stocks continued to retreat while investors weigh the impact of tariffs and higher interest rates.

'I believe the outcome of this (Nov. 6) special election is of such crucial importance to our state and to the nation,' Taggart said in a written statement. Taggart's statement comes a day after Republican Gov. Phil Bryant announced he will appoint Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith to Cochran's seat temporarily and support her election to the post in November. It also comes amid Bryant facing some Republican backlash over his choice.\"\n\nDCCC continues to add to their Red to Blue list - Roll Call: \"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is releasing its fourth round of Red to Blue candidates Thursday. The nine latest additions include two African-Americans. The DCCC had been criticized for not including any black candidates on the list so far this cycle. 'For us, it doesn't make any sense,' Quentin James, the co-founder of Collective PAC, which backs black candidates, told BuzzFeed last month about the lack of African-Americans on the Red to Blue list. 'We are excited our efforts to ensure the DCCC uplifts, highlights and prioritizes black candidates are achieving results,' James said in a statement Thursday. A majority of the 33 candidates now on Red to Blue are women. To earn their spot in the program, the candidates surpassed goals for fundraising, grass-roots engagement, local support and campaign organization, the DCCC said.\"\n\nGOP women's group announces House and Senate endorsements - The Hill: \"A GOP group that backs female candidates who support free-market policies and national security unveiled its second round of endorsements in top Senate and House races. ...

Steyer's NextGen America said this week it will target a minimum of 700,000 young Michigan voters through mail and digital outreach. It is hoping to influence congressional contests and the contest to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.\"\n\nCourts deal Walker a blow in Wisconsin - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"Dealing a setback to Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans, a judge ruled Thursday the governor must call special elections to fill two vacant seats in the Legislature. Walker declined to call those elections after two GOP lawmakers stepped down to join his administration in December. His plan would have left the seats vacant for more than a year. Voters in those areas took him to court with the help of a group headed by Eric Holder, the first attorney general under Democratic President Barack Obama. Dane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds -- whom Walker appointed to the bench in 2014 -- determined Walker had a duty under state law to hold special elections so voters could have representation in the Legislature.\"\n\nPoll shows Massachusetts Gov. Baker staying strong - WBUR: \"Massachusetts voters continue to give high approval ratings to Gov. Charlie Baker, who maintains a commanding lead over this three Democratic challengers, according to a new WBUR poll. The survey of 504 registered voters (topline results, crosstabs) found that two-thirds of them have a favorable view of the governor, while a majority still have not heard of the three Democrats: Jay Gonzalez, Bob Massie or Setti Warren. There are still more than seven months to go until election day, so the Democrats still have time to turn things around -- and they are running hard to try to do that. Among them is Warren, a former Newton mayor, who addressed the Democratic caucus in the town of Hull last month.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE COUNSEL MCGAHN HEADING FOR THE EXIT?\n\nPolitico: \"President Donald Trump's top White House lawyer, Don McGahn, is expected to step down later this year, though his resignation is contingent on the president finding a replacement and several other factors, according to four sources familiar with McGahn's thinking. McGahn, according to two of the sources, has signaled interest in returning to the Jones Day law firm where he previously worked and reprising a role he had during the 2016 campaign by handling legal matters for Trump's reelection. But the exact timing for McGahn to make any move remains in flux. He's told associates he'd like to leave the White House by the summer, but it could also be put on hold through the 2018 midterms. Concerned about the velocity of turnover inside his White House and beyond ... sources said Trump wants to have a new White House counsel in place who he's comfortable with before clearing McGahn for the exits.\"\n\nEliana Johnson: 'Why Trump Hasn't Fired Mattis' - Politico: \"Trump is said to divide the members of his Cabinet into first-tier 'killers' and second-tier 'winners.' [James Mattis] is indisputably a killer, but he's also something rarer: a sometime loser -- of policy arguments, that is -- who manages to disagree with the president without squandering his clout or getting under Trump's skin. ... Yet Mattis has been able to present the president with views he doesn't like without bearing the brunt of his frustration. ... Trump remains as enthused about Mattis, one of his first Cabinet picks, as he was when he tapped him for the job in December 2016, according to several White House aides. ... People close to the president sense that on a subset of important issues, he will defer to Mattis, who represents an institution, the military, that the president venerates, and whose status as a combat veteran has earned him Trump's respect.\"\n\nHOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE FOLDS UP RUSSIA PROBE\n\nPolitico: \"House Intelligence Committee Republicans voted Thursday to end their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, declaring that a string of contacts between Donald Trump's associates and Russian government affiliates fell short of collusion and recommending dramatic new steps to crack down on intelligence leaks. In a summary of their findings, committee Republicans cataloged a string of meetings between Trump associates -- from Donald Trump Jr.'s run-in with a Russian government official at a 2016 National Rifle Association event to what the report called 'possible' attempts by Moscow to set up a back channel with Trump's transition team after the election. The committee dinged Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, for providing an 'incomplete' account of his July 2016 trip to Moscow, which drew FBI investigators' interest.

Rosenstein, Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) complained that the Justice Department has been taking too long to produce the materials, some of which he and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) began asking the department for last October.

In fact, her behind-the-wheel test on Wednesday in Buffalo, Minn., failed at the start as she crashed into the driver's examination station before she even got on the road. The 17-year-old from Monticello inadvertently put the 2014 Chevy Equinox into drive instead of reverse as the test began about 2 p.m., bringing the test to a halt. When she stepped on the accelerator, the vehicle lurched forward, jumped the curb and plowed through the front of the station in a strip mall on 1st Avenue S., said Buffalo Police Chief Pat Budke. She was not hurt, but her vehicle suffered significant damage, the chief said. The examiner, a 60-year-old woman from Buffalo, was taken to a local hospital with noncritical injuries. No one inside the office was hurt, Budke said. No charges will be filed, Budke said.\"",

                "body": "President Trump discusses school safety during a meeting with the nation's governors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday that the administration would ban bump stocks and \"all devices\" that turn otherwise legal weapons into \"illegal machine guns,\" keeping a promise made amid a bipartisan gun control debate.\n\nMoments before he departed Joint Base Andrews for his Florida property at Mar-a-Lago, and hours after signing a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, the president tweeted about the new policy.\n\n\"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns,\" he wrote on Friday.\n\nA bump stock is an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to achieve a fully automatic weapon's \"cyclic firing rate to mimic nearly continuous automatic fire,\" according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks can fire hundreds of rounds per minute, according to experts.\n\nThe bump stock moved to the foreground in the national discussion of gun control last fall, after Stephen Paddock used the attachment when he opened fire at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. He killed 58 people and injured hundreds more.\n\nThe president, for months, has urged the Justice Department to ban firearm modifiers, directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to implement new federal guidelines \"very soon.\"\n\nOn Friday, Sessions announced that bump stocks fall within the definition of \"machine gun\" under federal law, as the devices allow a semiautomatic firearms to achieve a continuous firing cycle with the single pull of the trigger.\n\nWHAT ARE BUMP STOCKS? HOW THEY WORK AND WHY TRUMP WANTS THEM BANNED\n\n\"Since the day he took office, President Trump has had no higher priority than the safety of each and every American,\" Sessions said in a statement. \"That is why today the Department of Justice is publishing for public comment a proposed rulemaking that would define 'machine gun' to include bump stock-type devices under federal law - effectively banning them.\"\n\nSessions cited the \"senseless\" Las Vegas attack, noting that the rule is a \"critical step\" in the effort to reduce the threat of gun violence.\n\nThe White House released a memo last month that directed the Justice Department to propose the rule.\n\nTrump wrote in the memo, \"Although the Obama administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machine guns.\"\n\nThe ATF made bump stocks legal in 2010, when, at the time, the bureau concluded that bump stocks didn't convert a semi-automatic firearm into one that is fully automatic, meaning it was not equivalent to machine guns that are regulated under the National Firearms Act, which dates back to the 1930s.\n\nSince the shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school last month, the president has proposed numerous measures in the gun control debate, including banning bump stocks, arming and training teachers and school officials, and raising the age requirement to purchase a gun from 18 to 21.\n\nThe president, though, has touched off tensions with the National Rifle Association, which endorsed him during the 2016 presidential campaign.",

The city says it is pursuing \"all potential funding options\" for the work, including state dollars.\n\nIn January, more than 100 University of Chicago faculty members signed a letter urging the Obama Foundation to find a different location for the center.

                "body": "KHYBER AGENCY, Pakistan - Deep in the mountainous terrain of Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas just miles from the Afghan border, around a dozen men - from their early 20s to their late 50s - salute and stamp feet to their national anthem.\n\nThe flag dramatically bursts open, and rose petals flutter down around their crisp black-and-white, traditional dress uniforms. Proud and emotional teachers look on as their students prepare to venture out into the wild western frontier.\n\nIt almost seems like the moment when a \"Grease\"-style song and dance number might break out - complete with \"We Go Together\" choreography. But Pakistani officials want the world to know this is serious stuff: This is no ordinary graduation, and these are no ordinary students.\n\nThey're now called \"inductees,\" and have just completed at least six months of \"deradicalization\" rehabilitation. This particular group is made up of former members of groups like Lashkar e-Islam (LEI), which in 2015 announced it was merging with the Taliban.\n\n\"This is not a jail, this is a deradicalization center. We want to ensure the gentlemen are skilled in their chosen vocation,\" Pakistan Army official Zubair, who oversees security and programming at the center, told Fox News. Part jovial tour guide and part serious junior high science teacher in demeanor, Zubair said the center offers aims to \"help them for a better life. The goal is for them to be useful members of society.\"\n\nWelcome to Rehab for Radicals, Pakistan-style. It's called Saboon ll (meaning \"First Ray of Sunlight\"), and is a joint venture between the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the Headquarters of the Pakistani Army's Frontier Corps.\n\nFollowing Pakistani military operations to clear terrorist pockets out of the area, some 650 militants subsequently surrendered. And by law, they could \"neither be prosecuted nor released to the society.\"\n\nSo, in January 2015, Saboon became the solution. And its doors in the foothills of the tribal area mountains opened wide.\n\nNow, the center's experts enthusiastically say, this crop is ready to re-enter the real world. Each graduate has been given a certificate of recognition and a Technical Training Diploma by the Khyber Institute of Technical Training, as well as a goodie bag filled with personal items, tools for their chosen tradecraft, and an NGO-donated farming kit.\n\nSome even have a job lined up. That's apparently the magic ingredient that will keep the weapons away.\n\nZubair insists, with unwavering conviction, that rehab is also \"helping out\" the military. He pointed out what he noted were numerous examples of this throughout a recent Fox News tour of the facility: There is a gym, a patch of overgrown grass to practice agriculture tidbits, a health clinic where they can learn first aid. Then there are the classrooms, where students learn an array of skills from carpentry and computers to auto mechanics and mobile phone repair.\n\nIn contrast with their spirited security guards and teachers, the former fighters generally remain quiet, and expressionless. There is no hint of them being hardened fighters fresh from the Hindu Kush.\n\n\"When they come, all others, including us, are infidels in their view. That is the main challenge,\" said one religious leader at the center. \"But that is all changed now.\"\n\nThe rules for release are minimum six months at the center, individual and group training, and an approved risk assessment from both a psychologist and a religious leader.\n\nRecent grads must report to law enforcement every two weeks. If they are then deemed to be on their best behavior, the monitoring is reduced to once a month, then every two months. After a year, the \"frequency of reporting\" becomes very infrequent, managed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSocial workers and psychologists also do home visits. \"Many are uneducated, so that is a challenge,\" one female worker said. \"It is a hard job, but they do change.\"\n\nProgram organizers claim 900 fighters have successfully passed through their doors - with a 100 percent success rate.\n\nBut then there are the critics, some of whome call that claim absurd.\n\n\"This is a ridiculous assertion. Intervention programs are not an exact science and absolutely not foolproof,\" noted Robin Simcox, national security and foreign policy fellow at The Heritage Foundation. \"They can do good, but we should never rule out that terrorists genuinely do recant their views.\"",

Slowly, the snake slithered up the man's body and started to wrap its body around his neck.\n\nThe man appeared calm - acting as if he was simply wearing a turtleneck. He continued to motion people to come closer.\n\nThirty seconds later, the man kneeled on the ground and appeared to be having trouble breathing. He leaned forward and grabbed the snake's body, attempting to forcefully pull the creature off.\n\nFor nearly a minute, a group of people just watched in shock and horror. They realized the man was in serious trouble when he toppled over onto the sandy ground.\n\nHe appeared to be unconscious when a man stepped in to help. He sprinkled water on the snake and eventually the python slitered away.\n\nA group of three men rushed the unidentified man to a nearby hospital in Varanasi on March 20, according to The Independent. His condition is still unknown.\n\nSnake charmers are common in India, but the reptiles have been known to turn on their handlers.\n\nA famed \"snake whisperer\" in Malaysia died last week after he was bitten by a cobra, Free Malaysia Today reported.\n\nAbu Zarin Hussin, a firefighter whose snake-catching skills went viral, led a fire department King Cobra Squad, where he trained other firefighters to catch the deadly serpents, according to newspaper.\n\nLast year, Dan Brandon, a snake enthusiast in the U.K., was found suffocated to death near his pet python, \"Tiny.\" A coroner later confirmed there was \"no doubt\" the python had killed him.",

(AP)\n\nJust hours after Peruvian legislators voted to accept the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, 79, over accusations of corruption, the country's ambassador to Canada was sworn in as the new president.\n\nMartin Vizcarra, 55, took the oath of office Friday after flying in from Canada. He was welcomed at the airport with a large cake, a marching band and supporters carrying signs that read, \"Peru is with Vizcarra.\"\n\nDespite the show of support, Vizcarra is not known by most of the country. A poll taken in March showed that 81 percent of Peruvians did not recognize his name.\n\nWhile Vizcarra is expected to continue Kuczynski's pro-business agenda, he will face a tough challenge building consensus with a hostile congress and growing public anger at Peru's political class. Protesters scuffled with police Thursday night while calling for new elections for both the president and congress.\n\nOusted President Kuczynski was voted out in a 105-12 tally. Kuczyski threatened to withdraw is resignation offer earlier because the proposed congressional resolution accused him of \"betraying the fatherland,\" something he would have to admit if he accepted.\n\nThe language was ultimately removed.\n\nKuczynski's downfall was his association with Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant that has admitted to spreading some $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America, including $29 million in Peru.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe new president's first test on the international stage will come in three weeks when he is expected to host President Donald Trump and other Western Hemisphere leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Lima.",

                "title": "John Yoo: At last! Trump finally assembles a top legal team to deal with Mueller probe",
                "body": "The president's criticism raises speculation that he may seek to have the special counsel fired; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports.\n\nPresident Trump is finally bringing in a first-string legal team to deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russian meddling into the 2016 presidential election and possible \"collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe president, who has often stated that there has been \"no collusion,\" has hired Joseph diGenova and diGenova's law partner and wife Victoria Toensing to join his outside legal team.\n\nDiGenova served as the chief federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., during the Reagan years and was an independent counsel at the end of the George H.W. Bush's term. He has also appeared frequently as a guest on Fox News programs.\n\nToensing is a former assistant U.S. attorney and was a former deputy assistant attorney general during the Reagan administration.\n\nPresident Trump also reportedly tried unsuccessfully to hire Theodore B. Olson, who represented the George W. Bush administration before the Supreme Court and successfully defeated an independent counsel investigation into his own service in the Reagan administration.\n\nJohn Dowd, who had led Trump's legal team, resigned Thursday after diGenova's joined.\n\nWhile certainly colorful, Trump's defense team until now could not boast veterans of the unique combination of criminal law and constitutional politics demanded by independent counsel investigations, especially those into the president.\n\nPresident Trump's lawyers seemed almost to be part and parcel of the circus-like atmosphere that has pervaded the White House. But just as the president eventually replaced provocateurs such as Steve Bannon with seasoned professional manager like White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, he is now upgrading his legal team. It is as if the Golden State Warriors are subbing in for a college basketball team.\n\nAccording to media reports, President Trump's defense team became deeply split over whether the president should submit to an interview with Mueller and his prosecutors. While Trump affirmed Thursday that he would \"like to\" answer Mueller's questions, Dowd apparently believed that the president's lack of discipline and tendency to go off script could leave him vulnerable to perjury charges.\n\nOn this score, President Trump should trust his instincts. While his old legal team might have provided good advice for a regular criminal case, Mueller's investigation is no normal investigation.\n\nAs president, Trump cannot simply invoke the same defenses available to an ordinary criminal suspect.\n\nThe Constitution gives the president the responsibility to \"take care that the laws are faithfully executed.\" It also makes the president the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Because of this, the president should not be put in the position of openly evading and frustrating a legitimate federal investigation. Doing this would undermine the cause of federal justice.\n\nIt's important to note that in addition to seeking to indict White House and campaign aides, Mueller could also recommend that Congress impeach President Trump - an option that does not require the commission of a crime alone.\n\nPresident Trump would err by listening to advice that he invoke his executive privilege to keep presidential conversations and documents secret. While executive privilege has constitutional roots and plays an important role in protecting national security, diplomatic and law enforcement decisions, it does not shield presidential conversations from the criminal law.\n\nHiding behind executive privilege would fail to deter Mueller and would also set back the privilege for future presidents who would truly need to invoke it. Defenders of presidential prerogatives should worry that a claim by President Trump of secrecy would ultimately weaken the privilege.\n\nWhile some media reports have credited President George Washington with first invoking the right to withhold confidential talks from Congress and the courts, the real credit for first invoking executive privilege goes to President Thomas Jefferson,\n\nPresident Jefferson ordered the prosecution of his former vice president, Aaron Burr, on a charge of treason for raising a rebellion in Louisiana. But Burr claimed that Jefferson had blessed his plans and demanded military reports to prove his innocence - much as the Watergate burglars 170 years later would claim that President Nixon had authorized their crimes. Chief Justice John Marshall, sitting as the trial judge, obliged with a subpoena for the military reports.\n\nPresident Jefferson considered ignoring Marshall, who was his second cousin. But instead, Jefferson argued that presidents could withhold evidence because the Constitution does not allow any branch of the federal government to force its will on the others.\n\nPresident Jefferson wrote: \"The intention of the Constitution, that each branch should be independent of the others, is further manifested by the means it has furnished to each, to protect itself from enterprises of force attempted on them by the others.\"\n\nJefferson's point was that just as the president could not force the Supreme Court to adopt his view of the Constitution, John Marshall could not impose his opinions on the president. Still, the president ultimately provided some documents for the trial and Burr was acquitted.\n\nEver since, presidents of both parties - including Dwight Eisenhower, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama - have invoked executive privilege. In United States v. Nixon (1974), the Supreme Court endorsed such presidential claims.\n\n\"Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process,\" Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for a unanimous court. He accepted that in the role commander-in-chief of the armed forces and in dealing with foreign affairs the president could demand an absolute privilege \"to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets.\"\n\nBut the Supreme Court rejected President Nixon's claim to decide for himself whether the privilege applied. In the case of the Watergate burglars, the right to a fair trial should prevail over any claim to confidentiality in executive branch discussions, the high court ruled.\n\n\"The impediment that an absolute, unqualified privilege would place in the way of the primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions would plainly conflict with the function of the courts under Art. III\" of the Constitution, Burger wrote. The court concluded that the judiciary could force the president to hand over documents and tapes needed by the Watergate special prosecutor.\n\nIf Mueller obtains a court subpoena, therefore, President Trump would have to turn over documents and even testify under oath, unless he invoked the protection against self-incrimination provided to all Americans by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution - a move that could prove to be politically disastrous. But the president could not hide behind executive privilege.\n\nIf President Trump refuses to testify he will only waste precious time delaying Mueller from getting the information he wants. Instead, the president should cooperate and even testify, for it is only Mueller who can credibly clear the Trump campaign of allegations of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe president would display an unexpected wisdom if he conserves the presidential power of executive privilege for coming crises that will truly demand it.",

                "body": "Facebook CEO is 'sorry' for the data-use scandal. William La Jeunesse reports.\n\nWe now know that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users by using a personality test app. The information was used to help Republican presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to target voters, and the data was later used on behalf of the Trump campaign to develop profiles of potential voters.\n\nThe problem is that Cambridge Analytica stands accused of violating its contract with Facebook and misrepresenting the purpose of some of its data mining. It is alleged not to have deleted data when requested to do so by Facebook. Lawsuits are no doubt in the works.\n\nA contract breach would make what Cambridge Analytica did different from what political campaigns have done for years - use analytics to properly target potential voters. But that doesn't mean that what other campaigns have done to exploit data isn't eye popping.\n\nFor example, according to tech guru Sasha Issenberg, the 2012 Obama campaign used the same permission structure of Facebook to gain access to data on the friends of people who used their Facebook profiles to log onto an Obama campaign website. Using this data, Issenberg says the Obama campaign created \"a new political currency that predicted the behavior of individual humans. The campaign didn't just know who you were; it knew exactly how it could turn you into the type of person it wanted you to be.\"\n\nThe manipulation of social media data by political players was viewed as benign when it was used to elect President Obama. But now that it's perceived that President Trump may have benefitted from similar behavior, the pitchforks are out and the mob is ready to storm the Facebook castle. Writing new government regulations is the demand of the day.\n\n\"You've created these platforms, and now they're being misused, and you have to be the ones to do something about it. Or we will,\" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California warned Facebook. \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.\"\n\nFellow Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced the Honest Elections Act, a bill to create regulatory rules she says would block foreign interference from social media trollers from Russia and other adversaries. Klobuchar dismisses Facebook's efforts to police itself as meaningless: \"They say 'trust us,'\" she says.\n\nCertainly, Facebook can be faulted for putting its head in the sand and not revealing what it learned about Cambridge Analytica's behavior after the 2016 elections. Unlike recent Internet security scandals, such as those involving Target stores or the federal Office of Personnel Management, no personal financial or identifying data was stolen.\n\nCambridge Analytica scooped up data on who people's Facebook friends were and what they liked. By declining to blow the whistle on Cambridge Analytica's alleged behavior, Facebook made the scandal worse.\n\nNow Facebook will now be put through the same political wringer that Big Oil or other suddenly suspect companies are. Facebook will have to deal with investigations from the Federal Trade Commission and at least two state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, the European Union is planning to consider a tax on digital ad revenue and the sale of digital data to third parties. California lawmakers are debating legislation that would establish a data protection authority that would request and use data. And the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee will soon call Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify.\n\nZuckerberg didn't help matters for his firm this week when he told an interviewer: \"I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated.\" While he makes up his mind, he has proposed useful changes in policies, such as having Facebook ban any developer who has not agree to a thorough audit.\n\nIt is precisely when the media and politicians are baying that something - anything - must be done to address a scandal that thoughtful debate is necessary.\n\nLook at Sen. Klobuchar's benign-sounding Honest Elections Act. It would require the same disclosures for online political ads that now apply to broadcast ads. But it's completely unclear if that would block entities such as the Kremlin-backed trolls who put up online ads during the 2016 election. The ads that the Kremlin trolls bought wouldn't be considered political advertising because they didn't explicitly support or oppose any candidate.\n\nNew regulations could help increase transparency. In Canada, Facebook users can click on a button and see all ads running on a Facebook page even if they are directed at someone else. But regulations could easily stifle political speech, which we've seen is a real problem everywhere from college campuses to corporate America.\n\nThe Internet Association, a group of tech companies, warns that \"proposals that would hold platforms liable for advertisers' claims could discourage platforms from carrying ads from individual citizens or legitimate groups that aren't well known or established.\"\n\nFacebook and Congress will have to come to some understanding and level of trust on how to prevent future misuse of Big Data. But the worse policy response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal would be to adopt European-style data rules that will inhibit innovation, make the social media experience less accessible to consumers and not even prevent abuses.",

He worked with historian and filmmaker Sara Vladic to determine that a record-keeping error led to one man's name appearing on some versions of the ship's passenger roster but not on the survivors list.\n\nThe pair discovered the man didn't sail during the tragic voyage in 1945 because of a last-minute change.\n\nThe historians determined the final crew list was corrected to show 1,195 men were on board and the number of men killed was 879, not 880.\n\nThe report was published in a recent issue of the U.S. Naval Institute's Proceedings Today.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Indianapolis Star, http://www.indystar.com",

But critics argue he is going farther than others who have led the spy agency.\n\nOur former intelligence chiefs have a responsibility to maintain the nonpartisan, mission first reputation of the intelligence community.\n\n- Buck Sexton, former CIA official\n\n\"When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,\" Brennan recently tweeted.\n\nMollie Hemingway, a staff writer at The Federalist, said Brennan's comments destroy the media narrative that intelligence chiefs are \"a bunch of apolitical boy scouts.\"\n\n\"As Brennan's increasingly unhinged tweets show, a year later, that narrative (and push by compliant media) looks patently absurd,\" she tweeted.\n\nSexton, host of a syndicated radio program \"Buck Sexton with America Now,\" suggested Brennan's comments are hurting the reputation of the agency.\n\n\"Our former intelligence chiefs have a responsibility to maintain the nonpartisan, mission-first reputation of the intelligence community,\" he said.\n\nOther experts say Brennan's intense partisanship is unusual for someone in his position, even if other former top administration officials have been outspoken about their beliefs after leaving office.\n\nI think he is afraid of the Russian president. They may have something on him personally... the fact that he has had this fawning attitude toward Mr. Putin... I think continues to say to me that he does have something to fear.\n\n- Ex-CIA Director John Brennan in an MSNBC interview\n\n\"Partisan criticism is not uncommon, but it is usually diplomatic,\" said Cal Jillson, political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. \"Think of James Baker or Leon Panetta, people who speak softly because they are used to being listened to.\"\n\nJillson said that current and former intelligence officials who have been privy to secret information should adhere to a higher code of conduct because their remarks \"carry more weight.\"\n\n\"With politicians, we take what they say as raw speculation,\" Jillson said. \"But for someone like John Brennan, who has known the country's deepest secrets for decades, the public takes it as an allusion made with the knowledge of the nation's secrets, which he has a responsibility not to reveal.\"\n\nBrennan is facing criticism from the left, too.\n\nThe liberal New York Times opinion page recently cited Brennan's tweet accusing Trump of \"venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption\" and argued such accusations hurt his credibility.\n\n\"Declarations like these may be important to make and gratifying to read, but they really shouldn't be coming from those whose integrity depends on them remaining outside the political fray, even in these insane times,\" the paper said.",

                "body": "ESPN will reportedly pay Michelle Beadle $5 million per year to co-host \"Get Up!\"\n\nESPN is under fire for a new morning show that will reportedly pay its hosts multimillion-dollar salaries on the heels of recent layoffs at the network.\n\n\"Get Up!\" will be hosted by Mike Greenberg, Michelle Beadle and former NBA star Jalen Rose. A glowing feature in The Hollywood Reporter, headlined, \"ESPN Plans to Wake up Woke with New Morning Show,\" recently revealed that the program would dabble in politics while offering a whopping $14.5 million in combined salaries for the three co-hosts.\n\nTalk-radio host and author Clay Travis brought the lofty salaries to the attention of his followers with an explosive monologue on his \"Outkick the Show\" program on Thursday. Travis said there was \"no way\" ESPN can justify paying $14.5 million to three hosts when the company has been plagued by layoffs.\n\n\"These are some of the craziest salaries I've ever seen,\" Travis said.\n\nAccording to THR's Marisa Guthrie, Greenberg will be paid $6.5 million, Beadle will earn $5 million and Rose will take home $3 million per year. ESPN is also constructing a studio at Manhattan's South Street Seaport.\n\n\"This is an intriguing financial decision. ... I am all in favor of guys, and girls, making as much money in our industry as they possible can,\" Travis said. \"I'm not sure there has ever been a more over-paid member of the sports media in the history of sports on television than Michelle Beadle.\"\n\nESPN declined comment when asked to confirm the salaries.\n\nTravis focused his outrage on Beadle, pointing to her failed stint as an NBC Sports host, while mentioning that Greenberg's two decades on ESPN Radio could possibly justify his inflated salary. He said that Beadle's contract is not justified by market reality, and that she would struggle to earn a fraction of her \"Get Up!\" salary if she became available, saying ESPN essentially bid against itself for no particular reason.\n\n\"Before they pay anybody else, before they pay for all of the facility. Before they pay for anything, they have to get to $14.6 million in advertising revenue just to justify being able to make $100,000 on this show,\" Travis said. \"There are going to be a lot of ESPN employees that watch this show and they're going to sit around and say: 'Wait a minute. They fired hundreds of people at this company. How many of them could they have kept and let Michelle Beadle go?'\"\n\nESPN laid off somey 250 employees in 2017, according to Sports Illustrated. The staffers let go included on-air talent, in addition to producers, executives and tech workers.\n\nSports media website Awful Announcing published an article mocking the network by exploring what else could be purchased with the money going to Greenberg, Beadle and Rose. The story points out that the morning-show hosts will be paid more than several high-profile superstars from the world of sports, such as Steelers' running back Le'Veon Bell or Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nAwful Announcing's Andrew Bucholtz noted that the inflated salaries add pressure for the show to succeed, which \"isn't going to be easy\" in the crowded morning TV landscape.\n\nESPN has come under fire in recent memory for a variety of situations that have left some viewers feeling that the network has a liberal bias. During a recent shareholder meeting for ESPN's parent company, Disney, a frustrated investor told CEO Bob Iger that ESPN had become a \"24/7 anti-Trump tirade channel.\"\n\nIt doesn't appear that \"Get Up!\" will do anything to challenge those claims, as the show's executive producer, Bill Wolff, has previously held executive producer titles at with MSNBC's anti-Trump \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" Chelsea Handler's failed Netflix show and ABC News' overwhelmingly liberal daily gabfest \"The View.\"\n\nWhile the show will \"mostly\" stick to sports, according to Guthrie, and Wolff told THR that the show would delve into politics when necessary.\n\n\"When players take a knee, then it deserves coverage and conversation,\" Wolff told the magazine. \"If something political makes itself part of our world, we are dishonest and inauthentic if we don't discuss it.\"\n\nAn ESPN insider criticized The Hollywood Reporter's headline, saying whether or not the show discusses politics was not the focus of the piece. Beadle, who is an outspoken feminist, and Rose have been outspoken about political and racial issues, while Greenberg typically sticks to sports.\n\nWhen reached for comment, an ESPN spokesperson emphasized that the team from \"Get Up!\" has no intention of discussing anything political unless it happens to be a huge, national story that has a sports-related angle.\n\nESPN's \"Get Up!\" will air on Weekdays, 7-10 a.m. ET, starting on April 2.",

                "title": "Texas Quail Rigs were the hunting steeds of their day",
                "body": "Much as the landed aristocracy of Europe traditionally commanded stables of thoroughbreds and packs of highly trained dogs to assist in their hunting parties through the forests of England, Germany, and France, so too did American hunters once enlist the assistance of their own trusty steeds. Over here, however, faced with ranches and game parks spanning hundreds of thousands of acres, mechanical means eventually took over as more suitable and practical form of transportation than mere horseback.\n\nThe end result? The fascinating world of \"hunting cars,\" or \"Texas Quail Rigs,\" which expanded on the vein of vehicular modification that had once guided the Maharajas of India on their own big game exploits. Several of these unique callbacks to classic Americana were on display at the 2018 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, providing a fascinating look back at an underappreciated era of coachbuilding.\n\nIt's unlikely you've ever seen a version of the Buick Roadmaster quite like this one, which was commissioned by a seven-term Congressman named Richard M. Kleberg, Sr., to serve as his hunting rig on the enormous King Ranch. How big was the King parcel? It sprawled a massive 825,000 acres across four Texas different counties.\n\nAfter having made do with a makeshift 'sport-utility' type home-built rig based loosely on a 1946 Ford outfitted with a winch, Kleberg elected to pursue his quail from the more comfortable - and stylish - confines of a heavily modified Buick, which was built in 1949 with the cooperation of GM's Styling Section. In fact, Buick sent a representative down to Texas to tool around the ranch with the Congressman in the Ford and take notes on what worked and what didn't with that particular homebrew in order to improve on it wherever possible.\n\nThe Roadmaster chassis itself was chopped approximately five inches, but the vehicle is six inches taller than stock due to a suspension lift intended to give it respectable off-road capability, and also four inches longer thanks to a stretched cargo area at the rear that was formed out of 20-gauge steel. Like its predecessor, the car includes a hidden cable winch in the front bumper and also adds a 32-quart cooling system along with nickel-chrome moly steel axle shafts and steering parts, the latter two installed to ensure no chance of a breakdown out on the plains.\n\nBuick fans will also notice that the front grille is complemented by intakes situated just above, where additional air helped keep the engine from running hot. The entire rig weighs 900 lbs more than stock, even with the extensive use of aluminum at the front of the vehicle.\n\nIn addition to its various mechanical upgrades, the Roadmaster also features several obvious nods to hunting convenience, including leather rifle holsters built into the fenders (where they can be easily reached by passengers), a fold-down windshield to facilitate shooting from inside the cabin, and a frightening fender seat for those willing to brave the bumpy Texas terrain in order to gain the best possible vantage point. Hidden compartments and additional storage for food and supplies were also included throughout the vehicle, and there's also a radio telephone, an altimeter, and a compass inside the cabin.\n\nPast is present\n\nAmelia Island also displayed several other intriguing hunting rigs in the King Ranch Roadmaster's class. In fact, a 1968 Jeep Wagoneer sat right there alongside the Buick, which is fitting since it was originally created as a copy of one of Kleberg's later quail rigs. Like the Roadmaster, it too features a heavily-modified body -- this time doorless -- with its own rifle holders, bumper bar, and a large, raised bench seat at the rear that serves as a shooting platform. Of course, it also comes with four-wheel drive, something that Kleberg couldn't have begun to dream about for his Buick in the late '40s, but which is now par for the course for any off-road ride.\n\nCHECK OUT MORE CLASSIC CAR STORIES FROM HAGERTY\n\nMost of these vehicles have been lost to the ravages of time, left to rot in barns or in fields after their days of traipsing through the wilderness in search of prey were done. It was a rare treat to see these hunting rigs alongside the older Rolls-Royce and Armstrong and Phantom-based \"shooting brakes\" from the 1920s that inspired their production.\n\nThe Texas Quail Rig spirit continues on today, with pickups, SUVs, and even a Unimog or two having replaced custom automobiles -- but the modifications are just as elaborate, if not more so, than what one would find in dusty ranch archives. The ability to install flatbeds, hydraulic cranes and power buckets for hydraulic shooting platforms on these heavy-duty vehicles, not to mention their much higher gross weight capability, has created a virtual blank slate for outfitters to fill with their imaginations.\n\nIt's hard to say whether modern-day rigs will eventually join their predecessors in the ranks of classics, but one thing is certain: quail are no safer in the 21st century than they were 100 years ago.",

                "title": "GOP candidates line up to take on Romney in Utah Senate race",
                "body": "The Utah Senate GOP Primary is now flooded with candidates vying to best Mitt Romney in what could be a runaway race for the former governor\n\nAfter 40 years, one of Utah's Senate seats will be back in contention after longtime Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch announced he was retiring.\n\nHatch is 84 years old and amid mounting speculation that he would not run for another term, former Massachusetts governor and 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney announced Feb. 16 he would vie for the seat.\n\nThe prospect of a political powerhouse like Romney winning the primary has not daunted the hopes of a flooded field of candidates who have filed alongside him to try their chances. The race is being called a \"David vs. Goliath\" situation. Ten candidates have filed to run in the hopes of besting the former governor. Some have political experience and some do not. Voters and party officials are wondering if they even have a chance.\n\n\"When there's an open seat, typically there are 12 to 15 people that throw their name in the hat, but I will say this election cycle, because of the name recognition, there are a lot of candidates that I've known that were interested in running for that seat that will not run against Mitt Romney because they read the tea leaves and they say I do not want to get defeated by Goliath and come back in six years or 12 years and run again as the guy who got trounced,\" said Rob Anderson, chair of the Utah Republican Party.\n\nBut with that name recognition comes withering criticism that Romney was too harsh on President Trump in the early months of the 2016 campaign. President Trump has since endorsed his candidacy, but for Utahns, those denouncements echo loudly.\n\n\"I believe he is as politically dangerous as he is physically attractive,\" said candidate Jeremy Friedbaum; a local restorer of grand pianos who has run in races previously. \"He's truly dangerous, if he had gotten his way with not having anybody vote for Trump, we'd have Hillary Clinton as our president today. We'd lose the courts, corruption would be deeply entrenched...you shouldn't trust a man who tried to do that.\"\n\nOther candidates have concerns that Romney's bid is seemingly like a planned \"coronation\" and want it to be a conversation about issues that affect Utahns instead.\n\nBut the Romney for Utah campaign disputes that notion.\n\n\"In a little over a month he's been to 21 of the 29 counties. He's made stops in 40 cities, he's put almost 5,000 miles on his truck, his 2002 Chevy. So we have been circling the state up and down. He's been working hard,\" said MJ Henshaw, a spokesperson for the campaign.\n\nThose in Utah Republican political circles said State Rep. Mike Kennedy has the qualifications and is very well liked and can give Romney the strongest chance of a worthy challenge, but that his national recognition is next to none.\n\nKennedy grew up poor and has eight children. He's a doctor of law and medicine and describes himself as a \"common man.\"\n\nIf elected, he said he would stand with the president even when times are tough - not just when it suits him.\n\n\"And not convenient and at the same time if there are disagreements,\" he said. \"There's a way to respectfully disagree. I don't believe that throwing criticisms likes throwing rotten tomatoes at a poor actor on stage is the best way to go about things.\"\n\nThe Utah GOP picks its nominee through the caucus system. Candidates can appeal to delegates directly to capture their vote. At the nominating convention on April 21, if a candidate gets 60 percent or more of the vote, then no primary is even held and the winner would face-off against the Democrat in the general. But candidates do have another option to get on the ballot if they can get signatures as well, 28,000 are needed to qualify. If so, a primary would take place.\n\nBut that's not deterring some of the more obscure personalities from running, especially Brian Jenkins, an Abraham Lincoln impersonator. He filed to run dressed in a top hat and long black overcoat, complete with a dyed long beard.\n\nHe admits it is part publicity stunt and marketing ploy to get voters interested in Lincoln's life and philosophy,\n\n\"I'd probably walk around just like this on the Senate floor,\" he said.\n\nVoters in this predominantly red state have grown more unfavorable to President Trump's job performance in recent months. The most recent Real Clear Politics average has it at 55.7 percentage points.\n\nThe race so far has opened old intraparty wounds dating back to the 2016 election with fraught, yet consistent quibbling as establishment and tea partiers come#MAGA types square off.\n\nKennedy, in his campaign video, offers the question:\n\n\"Do you honestly think an establishment insider is going to fix the problems in Washington and restore our values?\"",

                "body": "Across the web, online administrators are hitting \"delete\" on sex ads.\n\nSeveral websites built solely around prostitution and sex trafficking, such as Cityvibe, have begun going dark, and mainstream websites like Craigslist and Reddit are removing their \"Hookers\" and \"Personals\" sections which acted as thin veneers for sex trafficking and prostitution advertisements.\n\nWhy?\n\nThis week, Congress passed a bill soon headed to the president's desk to be signed into law that will change the landscape of the internet forever. H.R. 1865, known as FOSTA-SESTA, amends the 1996 Communications Decency Act Section 230 -- which courts previously interpreted as granting broad immunity to websites that facilitate third party sex trafficking and prostitution ads.\n\nThis legislation was sparked by the powerful momentum of the documentary I Am Jane Doe, which spotlights the stories of sex trafficking survivors fighting for justice against these multi-million dollar websites, and it was championed by survivors, Rep. Ann Wagner, Sen. Rob Portman, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Shared Hope International, World Without Exploitation, 50 United States Attorneys General, and many more.\n\nFor years this law thwarted sex trafficking survivors' attempts to sue websites like Backpage.com -- a website which garnered 99 percent of its income from ads for sex, and which refused to take down ads of known child sex trafficking victims according to a U.S. Senate investigation. Online sexual slavery auctions were in effect a protected class of crime, a tragedy compounded by the fact that 73 percent of child sex trafficking victims referred to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children were sold online.\n\nThat is until this week.\n\nAfter removing its Personals section offline, Craigslist, for many years a go-to site for sex trafficking, stated: \"Any tool or service can be misused. We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day.\"\n\nMany have made hyperbolic claims that amending the law to hold websites accountable for knowingly hosting sex trafficking and prostitution ads would \"break the internet.\"\n\nThese developments clearly refute that argument. The sun rose today and Twitter is still functioning, knitting blogs remained intact, and Wikipedia is uninterrupted. The only difference is scores of websites are voluntarily removing sections that facilitated a high volume of sex ads.\n\nThese websites already knew the problem existed, but just lacked the incentive to effectively safeguard their communities. The writing was on the wall that their criminal liability, and perhaps even conspiracy with sex traffickers in some cases, would soon be addressed.\n\nSo, is sex trafficking on the internet over?\n\nCertainly not, there will be websites that attempt to guise sex ads as \"dating\" ads. Most likely, many ads will migrate to social media sites where they will attempt to blend in with other users. Some ads may transfer to the dark web.\n\nBut at the end of the day, ads for sex trafficking and prostitution were already occurring in all of these places simultaneously 'before the new legislation. What H.R. 1865 did at a minimum is it effectively shut down the lowest hanging fruit -- the forums and websites where any young pimp could become a wealthy trafficker just by posting a few ads and skyrocketing the number of sex buyer clients in his rolodex.\n\nRaising the barrier to entry for the sex trafficking market is a step in the right direction. This measure, before it's even been signed into law, has decreased the profits in the lower tiers of trafficking. Now law enforcement should focus its resources on the more sophisticated (and more damaging) organized crime components of trafficking.\n\nOne thing is for sure, this law made sex traffickers' jobs harder, and for some, impossible. Which, in my book, is a good thing.",

                "body": "Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, in Iraq with some members of his platoon, before he was arrested over the shooting of an Iraqi man in his custody. In the back, right holding the U.S. flag is Adam Kohlhaas, who was killed in a roadside bombing tied to an Al Qaeda cell. (Courtesy of Behenna family)\n\nWhen Michael Behenna told his parents he wanted to enlist in the Army after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they were proud.\n\nWorried, too.\n\nThe Behennas themselves were devoted to careers in public service. Scott Behenna was an FBI intelligence analyst and retired Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation special agent. Vicki Behenna prosecuted Timothy McVeigh for the lethal Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nBut as parents they werefearful that if he were deployed to a battlefield, Michael, the eldest of their three sons, could be maimed or killed.\n\nInstead, First Lt. Michael Behenna returned from Iraq in 2008 with a murder charge. He was found guilty of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone and locked up at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan.\n\nBehenna admitted during his trial that instead of taking an Iraqi prisoner, Ali Mansur, home after a 2008 interrogation in Iraq -- as he was ordered to do -- he took him to a railroad culvert. There he stripped Mansur and questioned him at gunpoint about a roadside bombing that had killed two members of Behenna's platoon, which Behenna had witnessed.\n\n\"When you send a child over to fight in a war, the last thing you think you'll ever have to deal with is seeing him be charged with killing an Al Qaeda\" terrorist, Scott Behenna said to Fox News.\n\nBehenna, who was 24 at the time, said he acted in self-defense when Mansur threw a chunk of concrete at him, and reached for the lieutenant's handgun. The Army said the argument didn't stand up, because Behenna was already pointing his weapon at the prisoner.\n\nIn combat, we can bomb and kill people, even in their sleep. We don't convict pilots who drop a bomb on the wrong house, and we shouldn't. Yet if you come face to face with an insurgent, with one individual, and you're making a split-second decision, you can be prosecuted for murder.\n\n- Scott Behenna, whose son was convicted of a combat-zone crime\n\nBehenna was sentenced to 25 years in prison, which was reduced to 15. In 2014, when he had served five years, he was granted parole.\n\nBehenna, now 34, is one of about a dozen veterans who were paroled or continue to be held in Leavenworth because of combat-zone crime convictions that many military experts and political leaders say never should have happened. They are seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, who has so far granted just two - one to former Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, and the other to a former Navy sailor, Kritian Saucier, who took photos of classified areas in a submarine and served a year in federal prison.\n\n\"If these guys messed up, there are administrative ways to handle it. But we charge them with murder,\" Scott Behenna told Fox News. \"These guys are put on multiple tours, and they're stressed out. We're fighting an enemy that has no uniform. These guys had no criminal record, I'd have any of them as my neighbor, even living in my home. They're phenomenal people. We second-guessed them and put them in prison.\"\n\nScott and Vicki Behenna said the military justice system bewildered and frustrated them. They also said the handling of their son's case sometimes seemed to run counter -- in ways that shaped key outcomes -- to what would have been done in the civilian world.\n\n\"I understand criminal law, but I was not familiar at all with the UCMJ,\" said Vicki Behenna, referring to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThey say one misstep they believe denied their son a fair trial was the failure of the prosecution to disclose that their own expert's analysis supported Lieutenant Behenna's version of events. The expert felt so strongly that he reached out to the Behennas about his suppressed findings.\n\nVicki Behenna said, \"As a nation, we should be sympathetic and understanding of the stress and fear\" that those in combat operate under when making split-second decisions.\n\nScott Behenna said the military failed to thoroughly investigate the scene of the shooting in a timely manner.\n\nAs a mother, I want that for Michael. I want him to be forgiven, be able to, if and when he has kids, and wants to coach little league, that he'll be able to do it, and not be prevented because of a criminal conviction.\n\n- Vicki Behenna, whose son will remain on parole until 2024\n\n\"In the civilian world, we take whatever time is necessary to do a good crime scene investigation if it could exonerate someone,\" he said. \"But the military won't do it.\"\n\nScott Behenna concedes his son erred when he deviated from orders to take Mansur home, taking him elsewhere for an unauthorized interrogation. But he cannot fathom how Behenna and some 11 others who are detained or on parole from Leavenworth based on combat-zone crimes have been treated more harshly than others whose jobs involve split-second, life-and-death decisions.\n\n\"Americans released Al Qaeda terrorists and other people\" from the military's Guantanamo Bay detention facility, he said. \"We released them, not on parole, we let them go free even though we know a third of them go back [to terrorist activities]. But we don't give that to our guys.\"\n\nBehenna said it makes little sense that there's discretion granted in cases where the military drops bombs on suspected enemies, and kills innocent civilians in the process.\n\n\"We can bomb and kill people, even in their sleep,\" he added, \"we don't convict pilots who drop a bomb on the wrong house, and we shouldn't. Yet if you come face-to-face with an insurgent, with one individual, and you're making a split-second decision, you can be prosecuted for murder.\"\n\nLast year, Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, asked Trump in a letter to review the cases of veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and are in jail for battlefield crimes.\n\nThe Behennas say their son has rebuilt his life, and enjoys running his own cattle ranch. He is required to check in with his parole officer, and be listed in the public domain as a felon.\n\n\"I understand, legally, what it takes to get a pardon, and how difficult they are to get,\" Vicki Behenna said. \"As a mother, I want that for Michael. I want him to be forgiven, be able to, if and when he has kids, and wants to coach Little League, that he'll be able to do it, and not be prevented because of a criminal conviction.\"\n\nMany of the other Leavenworth vets have it worse. Some are from poor families, who lack the means to keep their vet's case in the public eye, or to visit Washington to meet with lawmakers to build support for clemency, a pardon, or a change in the way the military punishes combat zone crimes.\n\nThree of the men remain in jail: Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, Sgt. Derrick Miller, and Master Sgt. John Hatley. The other Leavenworth vets got paroled; one got his conviction overturned. These are the only ones in the group who are still behind bars.\n\nSgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland was on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan in September 2010 when he was warned the unit's base had been penetrated. An Afghani suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation - and ended up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun, and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nArmy First Lt. Clint Lorance is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012, in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed, days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.\n\nU.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley, a highly decorated 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War, is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007 encounter in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight.\n\nHe radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.\n\nTwo years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal - though none were ever found.\n\nHatley insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government's relations with Baghdad.",

An open murder charge allows the jury to decide between first- or second-degree murder.\n\nPolice allege Gelia broke into Southwell's home in Nov. 2016 and fired several shots. She died from a single gunshot wound, the medical examiner said. The bullet entered Southwell's ride side, punctured her lungs, hit her rib and hit her spine.\n\nAuthorities arrested Gelia that evening after they saw him in a white SUV matching the description of a vehicle leaving the scene. Gelia told officers he'd been holding a gun to his head when they stopped his vehicle.\n\nJackson Police Sgt. Wes Stanton interviewed Gelia the night of the arrest. A recording of the interview was played for the jury, and showed Gelia saying he \"didn't want to hurt anyone.\"\n\nThe 25-minute Facebook Live recording that Gelia allegedly made before and during the shooting is also expected to be played for the jury.\n\nAndrew Kirkpatrick, Gelia's attorney, said he won't deny much of what his client is accused of, but is seeking a lesser charge.\n\n\"By the end of this trial, I will ask you to find him guilty, but I ask you to find him guilty of the appropriate charge,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"Everything he did that night was an act of human stupidity.\"\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Jackson Citizen Patriot, http://www.mlive.com/jackson",

                "body": "AUSTIN, Texas - Weeks ago, as a serial bomber was terrorizing Austin and the community was gripped in fear, the city's interim police chief attended a meeting at a local Baptist church, part of his frequent neighborhood visits to hear concerns from the community.\n\nInterim Police Chief Brian Manley was met with angry questions of hate crimes and people who feared a terrorist in their midst. As the worried audience of 400 peppered him with questions, he kept his composure, calmly answered all the questions and made an impassioned promise to catch the killer.\n\nIt was a critical moment of the Austin bombing investigation, when tensions were high and a wrong statement could inflame the community. But through his unruffled demeanor, some said, Manley was able to bring the community together.\n\n\"His work with the community is masterful, and I consider it masterful because he cares,\" said Austin Mayor Steve Adler, \"and because he considers himself part of this community and he has always been part of this community.\"\n\nNow there is a big push to permanently hire Manley, largely credited with helping locate accused serial bomber Mark Anthony Conditt.\n\nManley is a first-generation police officer who has a degree in finance. He does not come from a long line of law enforcement, but he told Fox News his passion to protect others runs deep in his blood.\n\n\"I still went and got my business degree, but I knew this is what I wanted to do,\" Manley said. \"And, I've never looked back.\"\n\nFlash forward several decades and Manley led hundreds of law enforcement officials in the investigation of a series of package explosions that resulted in two deaths and multiple injuries.\n\nThe complicated investigation started with a breakdown of the explosive devices' compartments, then moved to a review of store receipts, hundreds of tips, surveillance footage and cellphone technology. It hit a high point Wednesday morning when authorities located Conditt, 23, who eventually blew himself up.\n\nThe investigation thrust Manley into the national spotlight like never before.\n\nNot free of criticism, Manley took heat for being slow to recognize the serial nature of the explosions and for his description of Conditt - \"a very challenged young man,\" avoiding the use of the word terrorist.\n\nBut, praise from all levels continues to ring loudly.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted Wednesday: \"AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!\"\n\n\"I have not seen a better job than what we've seen from this police chief and the Austin police force,\" Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott said at a press conference that evening.\n\nThe mayor said Manley's even keel during the investigation helped the community cope, even when racial tensions and fear ran high.\n\n\"The ability for him to be able to lead in a way that's not about him or his ego, but getting the work done was once again on display for all of us to see,\" Adler said.\n\nCity officials are rallying to give Manley a permanent chief title. The city manager, who has to approve the hire, said a decision will be made in the next few weeks. City Manager Austin Cronk added that his priority right now is the bombing probe.\n\nBut some on the council are trumpeting Manley's achievements.\n\n\"You need someone who is both a strong leader, someone who can make those hard decisions, but also someone who can communicate with the community and hear their concerns and reflect their concerns back and I think Chief Manley does a really good job balancing those responsibilities,\" said Austin City Council member Jimmy Flannigan.\n\nManley, who rose through the ranks beginning as a patrolman, brings three decades of experience on the force.\n\nManley, a married father of two, was a former child abuse investigator who also led teams during the 2009 presidential inauguration and helped Houston when it was dealing with devastating floods.\n\nBut nothing, he said, can compare with the last three weeks.\n\n\"These,\" he said, \"have absolutely been the most difficult weeks of my career.\"",

                "body": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A Florida nursing home where 12 elderly patients died of overheating after Hurricane Irma knocked out its air conditioning made matters worse by using portable units that were not properly ventilated and increased temperatures in most of the facility, an engineer testified in a deposition.\n\nWilliam Crawford, an air-conditioning engineer, said in a deposition released by the state late Thursday that the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills didn't have nearly enough portable units and those they had wound up heating much of the facility because they were not being vented to the outside. The 150-patient home is suing the state to get its license reinstated and Crawford has been hired by the state as an expert witness.\n\nCrawford told the home's attorney Geoff Smith in a deposition last month that the nine portable air conditioners the home deployed after September's storm were insufficient, producing only about 10 percent of the cooling capacity of the home's central cooler. Authorities say temperatures in the home rose dangerously between Sept. 10, when Irma knocked out the home's air conditioner, and Sept. 13, when patients began dying and the facility was evacuated. Under state law, nursing homes must maintain a temperature of 81 degrees (27 degrees Celsius) or less.\n\n\"The capacity of the spot coolers was insufficient to cool the space of the patient areas,\" Crawford said.\n\nAir conditioners work by removing heat from an enclosed space and taking it outside. Crawford said the heat from the portable air conditioners on the first floor was being vented into its ceiling, trapping it beneath the second floor. That meant that most of the first floor's heat was rising to the second floor, with some flowing back to the first floor. He said conservatively the temperature in the cavity between the first-floor ceiling and the second floor was at least 95 degrees (35 Celsius) but probably reached between 100 degrees and 110 degrees (38 to 43 Celsius).\n\nHe said without proper ventilation, the heat generated by the air conditioners' operation actually increased temperatures inside the building, although he couldn't say exactly how hot it got.\n\n\"I can say with certainty it was above 81\" in most of the facility, he said. It's possible, he said, that the temperature was cooler within 9 feet (3 meters) of the five portable units that were on the first floor. \"There was no way they maintained 81 degrees on the second floor,\" where four units were deployed, he said.\n\nJulie Allison, an attorney for the home, said in a statement Friday, \"We will be addressing these matters in court, and we look forward to sharing all of the evidence that has been obtained and that will be considered in a fair and impartial manner by the judge.\"\n\nSmith wrote in a letter to Congress in November that during the outage, staff monitored patients and none exhibited any sign of heat exhaustion the first two days.\n\nHe said about 3 a.m. on Sept. 13, several patients began showing signs of respiratory and cardiac distress. He said the staff summoned paramedics for each patient and followed proper protocols.\n\n\"The onset of heat stroke is impossible to predict and can occur in 10 to 15 minutes,\" he said. He said the elderly are susceptible at 81 degrees (27 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe 12 deaths have been ruled homicides but no one has been charged. A criminal investigation is ongoing.",

The sheriff said 34 people face felony counts of unlawful animal fighting and 86 face misdemeanor counts. Others arrested were spectators.\n\nGentry said the suspects are from Arkansas, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nIt wasn't known Friday if the inmates tending to the roosters are accused of staging the fights.

                "title": "Parkland teens keep gun-control grown-ups at arm's length",
                "body": "Hiding from a gunman at their South Florida high school, a small group of teenagers resolved on their own to launch a crusade against gun violence that will peak with a series of protests across the country Saturday.\n\nTo launch those demonstrations and their own effort to become a force in November's elections, the students have joined forces with a well-financed and energized liberal infrastructure that's been laying the foundations for years for a national push for gun control. That's led to criticism that their cause is less spontaneous than it seems.\n\n\"This isn't just a few kids from a Parkland high school who started a national movement -- they've been swept up in it,\" said Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun rights group. \"The gun-prohibition movement in this country is pretty organized and anytime there's a tragedy they jump on it and try to get the victims to work with them.\"\n\nSuch critiques infuriate the teenagers who have worked furiously since last month's massacre at their Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people died. They say they welcome financial help and assistance with certain basic, organizational tasks -- \"I'm 17. I can't rent a hotel room,\" said Cameron Kasky, a Parkland junior -- but that the ideas behind the movement remain all theirs.\n\n\"You can help us but you're not going to run us,\" Kasky said by phone. \"There are some things we're going to inevitably need help with. But our message, our organization, our platform -- that's us.\"\n\nHe said as proof of his group's independence, they've turned down requests by some adult supporters to address Saturday's main march in Washington, preferring to reserve all speaking slots for youth.\n\nLonger-established gun control groups supporting the march chortle at the notion that they are the ones really in charge. \"Everybody wonders who's the adult pulling the strings, and there really isn't one,\" said Peter Ambler, executive director of the organization created by former Rep. Gabby Giffords after she was shot in the head in a 2010 mass shooting. \"This is an authentically student-led movement, from the message to the formation of the program, up and down.\"\n\nKasky recalled how in the days after the attack people kept asking him if George Soros was funding them. He didn't even recognize the name and had to look it up to find that they were referring to a liberal billionaire whose funding of several progressive groups is a favorite of conservative conspiracy theorists.\n\nLikewise, Kasky laughed off attacks connecting the students to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who's been accused of anti-Semitism. The criticism came because the teens accepted help from the Women's March movement to organize student walkouts last week, and the co-president of the Women's March had met with Farrakhan. Kasky noted that most the students in the group are Jewish.\n\nYet the Parkland students are in no way going it alone. The raw emotion and outrage they emitted over social media and at rallies after the Valentine's Day attack electrified supporters of gun control and opened wallets. They've raised more than $4 million to support the more than 800 scheduled marches, including donations from celebrities such as George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, as well as support from groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group funded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nIn groups like Everytown, the Parkland teens are getting support from a well-financed gun control movement that sprouted up after the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, when 20 first-graders and six adult staffers were killed. After gun control legislation failed in the U.S. Senate, activists decided they needed to create a counterpart to the National Rifle Association's combination of financial heft and grassroots support.\n\nEverytown raised more than $70 million in 2016, the last year for which tax records are available, and has pushed gun control measures in several states with limited success. It helped get a background check ballot measure passed in Nevada in 2016 as well as laws in 25 states to prevent domestic abusers from owning firearms.\n\n\"The turf has changed significantly before Parkland,\" said John Feinblatt, Everytown's president, noting last year's Virginia governor's race, won handily by Democrat Ralph Northam, a supporter of gun control in the NRA's home state.\n\nStill, the Parkland students have been quick to seize their moment. First, they went to Tallahassee to lobby for gun control legislation at Florida's Capitol, where they were joined by Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. They traveled to Washington, met with senators and parents of children killed at Sandy Hook and got advice on activism from U.S. Rep. John Lewis, the Georgia congressman who was a stalwart of the civil rights movement. A pro bono attorney helped them set up a nonprofit to handle donations. They even have their own app.\n\nWhat happens after Saturday? Kasky said the students plan to launch a get-out-the-vote campaign targeting young voters, whom he and his fellow organizers expect will tend agree with them on guns.\n\nThe students aren't the only ones benefiting from the energy they've injected into the gun control movement. Feinblatt said Everytown has received nearly 100,000 separate small donations since Parkland. Everytown, and Giffords' organization, are helping fund some of the \"sibling\" demonstrations around the country Saturday. The main march's web page directs supporters who want to make a tax deductible donation to an Everytown fund.\n\nGottleib, of the pro-gun group, said the Parkland teens represent only one side of the debate among their generation and that they're being lionized by the media at the expense of peers who disagree. In fact, that's helped some pro-gun teens start to mobilize, he said: Youth memberships in his relatively small group have increased twelvefold since Parkland.\n\n\"There's movement on both sides of the equation,\" Gottleib said.\n\n___\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.

Last month, he emerged from nearly two years of isolation in a French prison to be tried in Brussels over the shootout that resulted in his capture.\n\nThe verdict for the trial is set for April 29.\n\nAbdeslam has refused to answer the French investigators' questions regarding the carnage in Paris that resonated around the world.\n\nIt's not the first time a gunman and hostage-taker in a French supermarket has made a demand on behalf of fellow jihadis.\n\nIn January 2015, Amedy Coulibaly took over a kosher supermarket and demanded police to back off their pursuit of two brothers who had killed staff members of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo days earlier.\n\nCoulibaly killed four hostages before he was shot and killed.\n\nTen months later, the Paris attacks at multiple venues killed 130 people.\n\nAbdeslam is back in solitary confinement in France.",

Nearby were pall bearers and honorary pall bearers including Saints coach Sean Payton, quarterback Drew Brees and general manager Mickey Loomis; and Pelicans general manager Dell Demps, coach Alvin Gentry and star forward Anthony Davis.\n\nArchbishop Gregory Aymond officiated at the Mass, an invitation-only event that followed two days of public visitation at Notre Dame Seminary.\n\nAmong those attending were NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, former Gov. Bobby Jindal and Gov. John Bel Edwards, who had earlier ordered flags at the state Capitol and state buildings flown at half-staff Friday in Benson's memory. Mayor-elect Latoya Cantrell, who succeeds the term-limited Landrieu in May, also attended.\n\n\"Tom was a New Orleans saint, on Earth,\" Aymond said during the Mass, noting that the New Orleans-born Benson was born to a poor family. Aymond recounted personal memories, including Benson's joy at recounting, repeatedly, how he met Gayle at the cathedral during a service.\n\nHe noted Benson's personal losses, saying he suffered the deaths of two previous wives, two children and three siblings.\n\n\"Some of the tensions of family life brought him disappointment and another loss,\" Aymond said. It was an apparent allusion to his falling out with daughter Renee, and her two children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc. They had been in line to take over the Benson business empire but Benson made it known in January 2015 that he intended for Gayle Benson to inherit complete control of the Saints and Pelicans. There followed an unsuccessful attempt by the estranged heirs to have Benson declared mentally incompetent in court.\n\nBenson was a successful automobile dealer when he bought the Saints in 1985. Under his ownership, the team achieved its first winning seasons and a Super Bowl championship in 2010 that buoyed the spirits of a city that was still struggling at the time to recover from Hurricane Katrina, which hit less than five years earlier.\n\nBenson bought the city's NBA franchise, the Pelicans, in 2012.\n\nIn recent years, Benson was becoming known for his philanthropy as well as his business holdings and ownership of sports franchises. Beneficiaries included the Catholic churches and organizations and a $20 million donation to the Ochsner Health System for the Gayle and Tom Benson Cancer Center.",

(iStock)\n\nA Texas law preventing consumers from buying hard alcohol at large retailers like Target, Costco and Walmart was ruled unconstitutional this week by a federal judge.\n\nUnder the state law, publicly-owned big-box retailers were prevented from selling spirits, though it did not apply to private retailers. But as of Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman overturned the law, making room for Texas to join the 30-plus other states that sell hard alcohol in such stores, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nMARINE'S 2-YEAR-OLD BROTHER TAKES HIS PLACE IN GIRLFRIEND'S PROM PHOTOS\n\nDespite the win for free-market advocates, the battle isn't over. Parties on the losing side who have fought to keep the law in place plan to appeal the judge's decision. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, the main defendant in the litigation, declined to comment to the Tribune due to the ongoing nature of the case, but The Texas Package Stores Association said it plans to file an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans. It represents liquor store owners in Texas, the Tribune reports.\n\n\"We will appeal the trial court's decision and continue to fight for family-owned liquor store owners against the world's largest corporate entities that seek to inflate their profits by upending sensible state laws that protect both consumers and small businesses,\" Lance Lively, the association's executive director, told the Tribune.\n\nThe appeal could take up to a year or more, according to experts, especially if it were to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, Texans will have to continue buying their liquor at private retailers.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThis fight over the long-standing state liquor law has been going on for the last three years, when Walmart sued the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission in federal court in Austin, arguing that the law unfairly kept them and stores like them out of the market.",

                "body": "BELLEFONTE, Pa. - A forensic pathologist testified Friday that injuries that killed a Penn State fraternity pledge last year might not have been fatal if fraternity members had summoned help more quickly.\n\nDr. Harry Kamerow took the stand in a preliminary hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence to proceed with charges against 11 members of Beta Theta Pi in the death of Tim Piazza of Lebanon, New Jersey.\n\nPiazza, 19, died of severe head and spleen and abdominal injuries from falling down basement stairs the night of a pledge bid acceptance ceremony, Kamerow said, adding that Piazza had also consumed a dangerous amount of alcohol, three or four times the legal limit for driving.\n\nHe said Piazza would have had a much better chance of surviving had help been called after he was brought upstairs. Instead, fraternity members were shown on camera taking half-hearted and even counterproductive steps to address his condition, and an ambulance was not called until the next morning.\n\n\"He has a much better shot at survival, if they brought him out of the basement, recognized what's going on,\" and called an ambulance, Kamerow testified. \"If he's very close to that period, he's got a good shot. As time passes on, his prognosis grows dimmer and dimmer and dimmer.\"\n\nThe defendants, among 26 young men accused of crimes related to Piazza's death, were not in court for the preliminary hearing, which could stretch well into next week.\n\nPiazza's parents, Jim and Evelyn Piazza, were in the courtroom as Kamerow described their son's injuries, which included a fractured skull, brain bleeding, a shattered spleen and bruises.\n\nThe house's elaborate security camera system showed Piazza participating in a pledge drinking gauntlet, then being carried upstairs after a fall down the steps at about 11:20 p.m. He was ultimately left alone in the dimly lighted first-floor \"great room\" overnight.\n\nIn the morning, Piazza somehow ended up back in the basement, where fraternity members found him unconscious. They carried him upstairs and then waited 40 minutes to summon help. He died at a hospital less than a day later.\n\nFive of the 11 defendants are charged with involuntary manslaughter. Other charges include hazing, reckless endangerment, conspiracy and alcohol violations.\n\nThe attorney general's office has said its review of the case is ongoing and has not indicated its plans for other defendants.",

Due to a clerical error he never attended boot camp.\n\nBaker landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day in 1944 under the command of First Army commanding Gen. Omar Bradley and fought through the Cherborg Forest, the station reported.\n\nIn the critical fight at St. Lo, he was there as the Germans collapsed and surrendered en masse at the Falaise Gap.\n\nWith the First Army, he was among the first U.S. troops to enter and liberate Paris.\n\nHe also fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He was awarded five Bronze Stars.\n\n\"Well, you just took it day by day, whatever happens is going to happen, you know, just try to dodge the bullets,\" Baker told the station.\n\nHe stood at attention on the stage as he received the Legion of Honor from Guillaume Lacroix, the consul general of France in Chicago.\n\n\"Mr. Jack Baker, and through him, thanks (to) all the veterans who have helped my country be what it is today. A free, independent, democratic country,\" Lacroix said.\n\nBaker is well known in Olive Hill, Ky., where he still cuts his own grass. He is looking forward to another season of fishing in Tygarts Creek, the Ironton Tribune reported Thursday.\n\nThose honoring Baker included the commander of the First Army, Lt. Gen. Stephen Twitty.\n\n\"Generations from now many of these folks will be gone and shame on us if we don't say thank you for the sacrifices you've made for this great country,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Army says the First Army is the military's longest serving field Army and is celebrating its 100th birthday on Aug. 10, 2018.",

                "body": "Former U.N. ambassador named as new National Security Adviser. In a separate development, NSA Cyber Security Division chief speaks with Catherine Herridge.\n\nPresident Trump's decision Thursday to appoint former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton as national security adviser brings a hawkish presence, combined with a bulldog spirit, to the White House.\n\nTrump announced late Thursday that Bolton would replace H.R. McMaster in the post, and while the Bush-era hawk's staunch defense of the war in Iraq may conflict with Trump's more skeptical approach, his stand on other issues -- along with his penchant for getting in the face of his opponents -- makes him a natural fit for the Trump White House.\n\n\"I think what you said is offensive and inappropriate -- you are a munchkin in the media,\" Bolton said to a Sky News host in January who asked if Trump was a \"slippery fish.\"\n\nWhile he served at the U.N., he was no fan of the place, once saying that if the headquarters in New York City lost 10 stories, \"it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\n\nSo controversial was Bolton, who served under the Reagan and both Bush administrations, that he was unable to gain enough votes to be confirmed by the Senate as U.N. ambassador and was instead appointed by recess. He has also mulled presidential runs in 2012 and 2016.\n\nBut while Trump has been hesitant on the value of military action in far-away theaters, Bolton's hawkishness and bullishness do align somewhat with Trump.\n\nParticularly they both share a strong skepticism of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has repeatedly promised to tear up if it cannot be satisfactorily re-negotiated. Bolton has gone even further. In 2015, Bolton wrote an article for The New York Times, titled: \"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.\"\n\nHe also supports Trump's aggressive stance on North Korea. He recently wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, called \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\"\n\n\"In 1837 Britain unleashed pre-emptive 'fire and fury' against a wooden steamboat,\" he wrote. \"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \"necessity\" posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first.\"\n\nIt is not clear if he will support Trump's move to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He has also expressed significantly more skepticism about Russia and has called for a \"strong response\" from NATO to the poisoning of a former spy in the U.K.\n\nBut Axios reported that Bolton has a reputation not only for having hawkish tendencies, but also for getting things done.\n\n\"My problem with you, over the years, has been, you're too competent,\" then-Sen. Joe Biden told Bolton during his 2001 confirmation hearing for undersecretary of State for arms control and international security affairs.\n\nBolton said as much himself in an interview with Fox News' Martha MacCallum Thursday night.\n\n\"I've been in a lots of bureaucracies, and I've seen the way that bureaucracies that don't like decisions, sit on them,\" he said. \"So I know my way around the corridors in Washington and I think that role will also be important.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said in a statement Thursday night that he hoped Bolton would \"temper\" his military-first instincts.\n\n\"Mr. Bolton's tendency to try to solve every geopolitical problem with the American military first is a troubling one,\" Schumer said. \"I hope he will temper his instinct to commit the men and women of our armed forces to conflicts around the globe, when we need to be focused on building the middle class here at home.\"\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was \"deeply concerned\" by Bolton's positions and he hoped Bolton would \"moderate his positions and work closely with our military, diplomatic, intelligence, and development professionals before rushing into armed conflict.\"\n\nBut Republican hawks welcomed the appointment.\n\n\"He believes in a strong military, going after terrorists, taking the gloves off,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n\"He is a diplomat. But he understands that if you're going to deal with thugs like in Iran, you have to be taken seriously.\n\nBolton is likely to encourage Trump's more bullish tendencies when it comes to foreign policy, and some lawmakers are expecting a significant pivot in terms of foreign policy remarks from the White House.\n\n\"The era of leading-from-behind is over,\" Graham said. \"John Bolton is a leading-from-the-front kinda guy.\"",

I said if we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThat's convenient: a challenge that needs a time machine. I'd kick your butt, if I were in high school. Of course, Trump hits back saying Joe would go down fast, crying. Now, Biden was speaking at a college rally against sexual assault. His message: To urge responsibility for both men and women. But no one cares now because we've got a fight on our hand. Welcome to high school where the big men on campus taunt each other and everyone gathers around to watch. Mind you, the combined age of the combatants is like 150 years. If there's going to be a tussle, you're going to need pallet of Fixodent.\n\nBut it's so juvenile. And if I recall, it's always the people who boast of their physical prowess who are the least harmful. I'm pretty sure the last fight Biden was in was over a window seat in first class.\n\nAnyway, it was only a week ago that Dems were fretting over whether they had a fighter among them to match Trump. Jolting Joe headed the call. The problem is it's the least appealing part of Trump's behavior that his lifting and it's so fake. Plus, there's a lot of other good stuff you could steal from Trump: the fun rallies, support for law and order, the strong stance against terror. But to focus on the one thing that most people, including Trump supporters, only really tolerate because of the other good stuff Trump possesses, that's a miscalculation. And it's one Republicans love to see because most people are really bad at being Trump -- except Trump.",

                "body": "LIMA, Peru - After months of political upheaval in Peru, congress has accepted the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, making way for a new government led by a little-known former governor.\n\nMartin Vizcarra will lead a nation where a vast majority of voters no longer have faith in their elected officials and a congress dominated by lawmakers loyal to the daughter former strongman Alberto Fujimori.\n\nHere's a look at what lies ahead for the Andean nation:\n\nKUZCYNSKI'S EXIT\n\nKuczynski becomes the first sitting president to exit office over his ties to Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America's biggest corruption scandal. He has denied any wrongdoing. Two former Peruvian presidents are accused of accepting bribes from Odebrecht and a third is under investigation.\n\nVizcarra, who celebrated his 55th birthday Thursday, is the former leader of a sparsely populated department in southern Peru who became vice president in 2016.\n\nHis brief stint as transportation minister ended following questions about his handling of a new airport being built near Cusco. More recently, he's served as Peru's ambassador to Canada, where he kept a low profile.\n\nA recent poll showed a majority of Peruvians don't know the vice president's name.\n\nVizcarra will face many of the same obstacles that Kuczynski encountered, but there are a few factors that could work in his favor.\n\nThe opposition Popular Force party led by Keiko Fujimori has lost seats in congress: Her brother and a small faction of lawmakers abandoned the party following Kuczynski's pardon of the feuding siblings' father, former President Alberto Fujimori.\n\nKeiko Fujimori herself is under scrutiny for allegedly having accepted money from Odebrecht. The company has admitted to paying $800 million in bribes to officials around Latin American in exchange for public works contracts, including $29 million in Peru.\n\nAnalysts say that for Vizcarra to succeed, he will need to do something Kuczynski failed to master: Building alliances across Peru's political spectrum in order to pass legislation through congress.\n\nVizcarra is expected to continue Kuczynski's pro-business agenda, but he could start off on a different foot by appointing cabinet members from a wider range of Peru's political parties.",

(Reuters)\n\nA British Airways crew member was reportedly arrested on suspicion of raping one of the airline's female flight attendants during a layover in Singapore.\n\nThe male employee, who was not identified, is currently believed to be in police custody, according to sources for the Daily Mail, which first reported the news.\n\nALASKA AIRLINES PILOT ACCUSED OF RAPE GROUNDED AS SHOCKING DETAILS EMERGE\n\nBritish Airways has since confirmed that the company is \"cooperating with the police investigation and are offering our full support to our cabin crew\" in an emailed statement obtained by Fox News.\n\nThe airline declined further comment \"as it is a live investigation.\"\n\nThe incident allegedly took place during an off-duty party after the British Airways crew landed in Singapore after traveling from London's Heathrow Airport, the Daily Mail reports. The flight attendant -- believed to be the flight's senior flight attendant -- was moved to a separate hotel apart from the one normally used by British Airways crew after reporting the incident.\n\nWOMAN REJECTS AMERICAN AIRLINES' $5,000 OFFER AFTER ALLEGING SHE WAS RAPED IN PLANE BATHROOM\n\nShe, along with the male crew member, did not continue on the second leg of the crew's journey to Sydney.\n\nA source for British Airways added to the Daily Mail that the airline sent a \"replacement crew\" to Singapore to staff the flight, and a manager to \"manage the crisis.\"\n\nThe alleged incident follows news of a female American Airlines passenger who recently filed a lawsuit against the carrier over their response to her alleged rape aboard a June 2017 flight. The woman, Aubrey Lane, claimed the airline did not detain the alleged rapist. Lane had also turned down $5,000 from American, stating that she was waiting for \"some sort of human response.\"\n\nAlaska Airlines, too, was recently sued by a female First Officer Betty Pina, who claims a male pilot drugged and raped her during off-hours at a Minneapolis hotel. An Alaska Airlines representative told Fox News that the pilot was grounded after the airline learned of the incident.",

A report by the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Office of Detention Oversight that year found the jail has deficiencies in its food, health care and safety services.\n\n\"Seventeen [17] detainees stated the food was bland and the portion sizes are too small.

The salads were made with rotten lettuce, we had beans every day and noodles with no taste,\" she said. \"Same s--- over and over.\"\n\nShe also claimed the jail \"freezes you to death\" at night and said her toilet was clogged up for days before it was fixed.\n\nThat jail is like a prison; it's not a common jail.

                "title": "Amazing military ATVs armed with laser weapons will blast drones out of the sky",
                "body": "The U.S. military is looking to harness laser-equipped ATVs to knock out drones (Raytheon)\n\nLaser weapon plus military grade ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) equals blasting enemy drones out of the sky. This is an ingenious way to provide easily movable defense against the growing threat of attacks from enemy drones.\n\nTerrorist drone destroying Raytheon laser weapons mounted on military Polaris Defense ATVs could soon be destroying enemy drones before they can harm U.S. forces with explosives.\n\nRapidly driving an MRZR to support an area under attack by a swarm of small drones, it will look like the warrior has something resembling \"R2D2\" popping his head out of the backseat. But terrorists will quickly learn it is not a cute robot, it is a powerful drone slaying laser weapon.\n\nThis isn't the stuff of science fiction anymore. Last Autumn the Raytheon and Polaris team proved that destroying drones with the MRZR HEL armed weapon works.\n\nAs long as there is power, U.S. forces will never run out ammunition with a laser weapon.\n\nAnd there's been a lot of buzz about this dynamic duo in the Pentagon of late. Hopefully this will translate into acquisition and rapid deployment.\n\nUS MILITARY EYES FUTURISTIC 'BIONIC ARM' FOR TROOPS\n\nThis is an outstanding solution to immediately provide U.S. forces with more options to protect the force from these proliferating flying threats. The Polaris Defense MRZR will be able to reach teams in remote areas with difficult terrain and provide them a laser weapon for their arsenal.\n\nRaytheon's Multi-Spectral Targeting System is a high energy laser (HEL) combined with electro-optical and infrared sensors.\n\nDelivering 20 to 30 blasts on about the same electricity as your fridge, recent reports suggest the system can already detect an enemy drone at more than 16,400 feet to blast it out of the sky.\n\nU.S. forces could soon drive these to forward operating bases to protect teams there, to landing strips to protect arriving aircraft or position the MRZRs with HEL to protect MEDEVAC to make sure wounded are not prevented from reaching care by drones.\n\nWhy are 'hobby drones' such a big threat?\n\nThe threat of commercially available \"hobby sized\" drones to the U.S. military is real and serious - and the threat is only growing. Adversaries can use hobby drones for surveillance exposing U.S. force size, location and armament.\n\nJust as dangerous, they can also be loaded up with explosives and used to attack U.S. forces. These drones could also be used to launch chemical and biological attacks against ground troops.\n\nPODCAST: BREACH ENEMY DOORS + BEER BOTTLES WITH THIS AMAZING NAVY SEAL\n\nWhy have they become increasingly frequent in war zones?\n\nThe cost of these hobby drones has become cheaper and cheaper. While they become more inexpensive, they have become more sophisticated at the same time. They are very easy for bad guys to get their hands on.\n\nARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW SNIPER RIFLE\n\nSound ridiculous that terrorists would buy children's toys and use them to attack our forces?\n\nTake the recent Mosul siege for example, ISIS used waves of small drones to attack Iraq's security forces.\n\nHEL for enemy small drones\n\nLaser weapons tend to be power gobbling beasts and extremely difficult to make smaller, lighter and rugged enough to make practical sense in combat scenarios.\n\nThis Raytheon laser can deliver about 20 to 30 laser blasts on a single charge from a normal 220v outlet.\n\nAnd this is a charge that is about as much at plugging in a fridge or washing machine. Imagine that.\n\nAdd a generator and you've got a laser weapon with unlimited blasts - a limitless magazine to protect US forces.\n\nUS ARMY TANKS GET FUTURISTIC SHIELDS TO DESTROY INCOMING THREATS\n\nThe HEL system onboard delivers about four hours of tracking, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability while also acting as beam director on this single charge.\n\nPODCAST: LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT MILITARY DRONES FROM THIS ARMY INTELLIGENCE EXPERT\n\nHow about the ATV?\n\nLet's take a closer look at what the MRZRs bring to delivering laser blasts in war zones.\n\nThere are many reasons why Polaris Defense MZRZR's are so valued by U.S. Special Operations - not to mention the civilian model is wildly popular throughout the country.\n\nDesigned for extreme performance in the toughest terrains, the MRZR is a small, ATV. Both variants also reach a max speed of around 60 mph with 88HP engines. To ensure maximum agility, the ATVs are built with a low center of gravity.\n\nThe MRZR can carry 1,000 pounds, while the MRZR 4 can carry an additional 500 pounds.\n\nUS SOLDIERS SET TO RECEIVE NEW SPECIAL OPERATIONS-STYLE NIGHT VISION GOGGLES\n\nMRZR vehicles are already designed with keyless ignition, which makes it easy to jump in and instantly respond to a hobby drone attack. The vehicles can also be endlessly adapted for different mission configurations and requirements.\n\nImportant for keeping a low profile and avoiding detection, the vehicle can black out instantaneously.\n\nDefinitely air transportable, the MRZRs regularly catch flights with CV-22 tiltrotor military aircraft to support teams gaining access to targets and to provide laser protection support.\n\nGood for defense, great for defense budgets\n\nThe cost per laser blast is usually estimated at about a dollar a shot.\n\nRight now, forces are largely limited to their current arsenal. This means the U.S. and its allies are often forced to use weapons far more expensive than a dollar a shot.\n\nLaunching a Patriot missile against a hobby drone can cost a few million dollars - and is worth every penny if it saves an American life.\n\nSCHOOL SHOOTINGS: HOW ARMY TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP SAVE THE LIVES OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS\n\nGiven the vast numbers of drones in the hands of adversaries and the fact that drone swarm attacks will most likely become a fixture in war zones, the numbers of drones that need to be killed to protect forces is huge.\n\nFor adversaries, this attack can be as cheap as a $150 drone. For the U.S., solutions to defend against these attacks must come at as low a price tag as possible. Otherwise, the cost could become astronomical.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nRight now, it is stop and shoot. When Raytheon cracks the huge challenge of shooting on the move - and no doubt they will - imagine how amazing it will be to have a laser that can shoot on the move - and from an MRZR no less. U.S. forces could fire laser weapons on the move in the toughest of terrains.\n\nThis will greatly expand the ways the laser weapon can be used. For example, an MRZR armed with the laser could escort U.S. military convoys and protect the convoy from terrorist hobby drones loaded with explosives.\n\nOther laser weapons\n\nWhat sort of other laser weapons may be joining the U.S. arsenal? Space-based lasers, laser weapons for U.S. military aircraft and vessels at sea as well as other ground vehicles are all underway. Using lasers to shoot down enemy missiles over the sender's backyard could even be possible in the near term.\n\nThis past summer, Raytheon had another breakthrough, successfully firing a laser weapon from an Apache helicopter at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.",

He was 86.\n\nA lifelong Southern Democrat, Miller famously famously spoke at the 2004 GOP convention as a Democrat in support of former President George W. Bush's re-election campaign.\n\nA decade earlier, Miller had been the keynote speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, endorsing then Arkansas Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton for president.\n\n\"The people of Georgia have lose one of our state's finest public servants,\" grandson Bryan Miller said in a statement.\n\nHe said Miller \"passed away peacefully at his home with family by his side.\"\n\nMiller was the 79 governor of Georgia, serving from 1991 through 1999. He represented the state of Georgia in the U.S. Senate from 2000 to 2005.\n\nMiller's political career began in 1959, when he served as mayor of Young Harris, moving on to become a Georgia state senator from 1961 to 1965. He then served as Georgia's lieutenant governor from 1975 to 1991, making him the longest serving lieutenant governor in Georgia's history.\n\nLater in life, Miller was a Fox News contributor.\n\nAs governor, Miller created the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) scholarship, and Georgia's voluntary pre-kindergarten program. According to the Miller Institute Foundation, more than 1.8 million students have gone to college in Georgia on HOPE scholarships, and more than 1.6 million four-year olds have begun their education through the pre-K program.\n\n\"These were his proudest achievements in his 46-year career in public service,\" the foundation said in a statement Friday.",

I'm very close to him, he is like my own little brother,\" she said.\n\nAll dressed up in mini Marine Corps dress blues in some of the photos and a tiny tuxedo in the rest, young Clay looks thrilled to be photographed alongside his brother's girlfriend. Fontaine shared the sweet photos online, which have since gone viral, receiving over 42,000 retweets and 200,000 likes on Twitter as on Friday morning.\n\n\"My boyfriend is a Marine and isn't home to take me to my senior prom... so his little brother stepped in and took his place. Needless to say, this girl is so happy,\" she wrote in the post.\n\nWhile it's been hard for Fontaine to be separated from her boyfriend of a year, who's 1,000 miles away on the East Coast training for his Military Occupation Specialty, she supports the sacrifice he's making. \"I have been with him through this entire process of becoming a Marine, and that has given us a special bond,\" she told Fox 8.\n\nFontaine said she was surprised the photos went viral.\n\n\"I received so much amazing feedback from our friends and family!\" she told The Times-Picayune. \"My boyfriend was so thrilled. Like I said, he's sentimental when it comes to his family, so it really touched his heart,\" she said.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nDespite the fun they seem to be having in the pictures, Fontaine said she didn't actually go to the prom with Clay, but a group of friends instead.",

(Reuters)\n\nBritish scientists have developed a lightweight and highly sensitive brain imaging device that can be worn as a helmet, allowing the patient to move about naturally.\n\nResults from tests of the scanner showed that patients were able to stretch, nod and even drink tea or play table tennis while their brain activity was being recorded, millisecond by millisecond, by the magnetoencephalography (MEG) system.\n\n'MIND-READING' ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRODUCES A\n\nDESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT\n\nResearchers who developed the device and published their results in the journal Nature said they hoped the new scanner would improve research and treatment for patients who can't use traditional fixed MEG scanners, such as children with epilepsy, babies, or patients with disorders like Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"This has the potential to revolutionize the brain imaging field, and transform the scientific and clinical questions that can be addressed with human brain imaging,\" said Gareth Barnes, a professor at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Neuroimaging at University College London, who co-led the work.\n\nCurrent MEG scanners are cumbersome and weigh as much as half a tonne, partly because the sensors they use to measure the brain's magnetic field need to be kept very cold - at minus 269 degrees Celsius, Barnes' team explained.\n\nThey also run into difficulties when patients are unable to stay very still - very young children or patients with movement disorders for example - since even a 5-millimeter movement can mean the images are unusable.\n\nCOMPUTER-GENERATED 'BRAIN AGE' ESTIMATES HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE GOT LEFT\n\nIn the helmet scanner, the researchers overcame these problems by using quantum sensors, which are lightweight, work at room temperature and can be placed directly onto scalp - increasing the amount of signal they are able to pick up.\n\nMatt Brookes, who worked with Barnes and built the prototype at Nottingham university, said that as well as overcoming the challenge of some patients being unable to stay still, the wearable scanner offers new possibilities in measuring peoples' brain function during real world tasks and social interactions.\n\n\"This has significant potential for impact on our understanding of not only healthy brain function but also on a range of neurological, neurodegenerative and mental health conditions.\"",
