                "body": "Mass student-led protests calling for tighter gun control are under way across the United States.\n\nThe protests - under the banner March For Our Lives - have grown out of a movement calling for change after 17 people were killed by a gunman at a high school in Florida last month.\n\nHalf a million people are expected to descend on the biggest march in Washington DC.\n\nMore than 800 sister protests are planned nationwide and abroad.\n\nSolidarity marches have taken place in London, Edinburgh, Geneva, Sydney and Tokyo.\n\nOrganisers have said it may become \"standing room only\" for the main event in Washington, as the swelling crowds could make it hard to move.\n\nParticipants want to seize on public outrage in the wake of the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland to convince US politicians to finally take decisive action, including by banning the sale of assault weapons.\n\nHowever, the issue divides Americans. The right to bear arms is protected under the 2nd amendment of the US constitution and the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby remains highly influential.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the White House released a statement praising the \"many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today\".\n\nIt also cited steps it is taking to tackle gun violence, including banning bump stocks, plus enacting the STOP School Violence Act, which seeks to improve school security and increase training for students, staff and local law enforcement.\n\nThere are also plans to improve criminal background records so gun buyers are properly vetted before making a purchase.\n\nOrganisers say up to half a million people could rally in Washington DC, which would make it the largest protest since last year's women's march.\n\nAriana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson are set to perform.\n\nImpassioned youth leaders have been taking to the stage to call for change, including 17-year-old Edna Chavez, whose brother was shot and killed in a south Los Angeles neighbourhood where, she said, it was normal to see flowers and tributes on the streets.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for our dead friends,\" said speaker Delaney Tarr, a Parkland student.\n\nThe BBC's Jon Sopel in Washington says the protesters there have strung out lines of photographs of students and teachers killed in school shootings.\n\nA demonstration has also been held in Parkland, with relatives of the victims speaking to crowds.\n\nBy Marianna Brady, BBC News, Washington\n\nThe crowds started to gather in the early hours of the morning outside the US Capitol. Chants for \"no more NRA\" and \"no more guns\" erupt every few minutes at random.\n\n\"He was my soulmate,\" said Victoria Gonzalez, looking down at a sign of her boyfriend Joaquin Oliver.\n\nValentine's Day - 14 February - started off as a great day for Victoria. \"Joaquin and I exchanged gifts in the morning and he walked me to class. I was so happy.\"\n\nLater that day, she would learn that Joaquin was one of 17 people shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas school.\n\n\"It wasn't real. It's taken a while for it to sink in. I'm here today so no one ever has to face this again,\" she said, standing in a crowd of several thousand ahead of the march.\n\n\"It gives me a lot of hope seeing how many people are out here supporting us. It feels like the whole entire world is on our side,\" Victoria said.\n\nAt a rally in Houston, Texas, Mayor Sylvester Turner called the events a defining moment in US history and announced a commission to tackle gun violence on a local level.\n\nFamilies of the victims of the 1996 school shooting in Dunblane, Scotland, also joined a solidarity demonstration outside the US consulate in Edinburgh.\n\nIn London, several hundred people gathered outside the new US embassy in Vauxhall, carrying placards addressed to US politicians and the NRA, saying \"protect kids not guns\" and \"books not bullets\". The crowd was a mix of US immigrants and allies.\n\nSome 69% of Americans think gun laws should be tightened, according to a new poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, up from 61% in October 2016.",

                "body": "Authorities in Finland have received a Spanish request to arrest separatist Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont.\n\nThe arrest warrant was issued on Friday, a day after his arrival there.\n\nThe ex-leader has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since last October's banned referendum that backed Catalonia's unilateral secession bid.\n\nTensions in the region are very high and separatist leaders have abandoned plans to name a new president following the arrest of the latest candidate.\n\nCrowds of protesters clashed with police in Catalonia on Friday night after Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state.\n\nConvictions could result in up to 30 years in prison.\n\nOne of those taken into custody was Jordi Turull, who was to be the subject of a vote in the Catalan parliament on Saturday for regional president.\n\nOther separatist figures were already in custody or had gone into exile abroad.\n\nMr Puigdemont has been in Finland since Thursday.\n\nHis lawyer, Jaume Alonso Cuevillas, told Catalunya radio on Saturday that Mr Puigdemont would co-operate with the Finnish authorities. His client \"had not fled from Spanish justice\", he said.\n\nFriday's rulings at the Supreme Court in Madrid were considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight.\n\nAltogether 25 separatists have been charged variously with sedition, rebellion, embezzlement and other crimes. They deny the allegations.\n\nThe five Catalan politicians remanded in custody on Friday were:\n\nAll five spent some time in detention following the banned referendum but were released on bail late last year pending investigations into their individual roles in the vote.\n\nIn his 70-page ruling, Supreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena said that they should be returned to jail as they represented a flight risk. He did not set a date for their trial.\n\nThe five join four other Catalan leaders already in prison. They include Oriol Junqueras, the former Catalan vice-president, and Jordi S?chez, who was nominated to lead the Catalan government but dropped the bid after the Spanish authorities refused to release him to attend an investiture ceremony.\n\nJudge Llarena also issued an arrest warrant for Marta Rovira, the deputy head of the separatist Esquerra Republicana party, who failed to appear in court on Friday.\n\nIt later emerged that she had fled into exile and Spanish media reported that she was in Switzerland.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority.\n\nIn a setback for the pro-independence cause, a survey published by the Catalan Centre for Opinion Studies recently suggested support for independence had dropped sharply, with 53.9% of Catalans now against the idea and 40.8% saying they were in favour.",

They were called \"fugitives of justice\" by US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and could face extradition in more than 100 countries if they travelled outside Iran.\n\nMany of the \"intrusions\", Mr Rosenstein said, were done \"at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\".\n\nThe hackers also targeted the US Department of Labor, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the United Nations, according to prosecutors.\n\nMr Qassemi said the sanctions were an example of Washington's hostility towards the Iranian nation.\n\nWashington has adopted a much more belligerent stance against the Islamic Republic since US President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.",

                "body": "Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna, is sliding towards the sea.\n\nScientists have established that the whole structure on the Italian island of Sicily is edging in the direction of the Mediterranean at a rate of 14mm per year.\n\nThe UK-led team says the situation will need careful monitoring because it may lead to increased hazards at Etna in the future.\n\nThe group has published its findings in the Bulletin of Volcanology.\n\n\"I would say there is currently no cause for alarm, but it is something we need to keep an eye on, especially to see if there is an acceleration in this motion,\" lead author Dr John Murray told BBC News.\n\nThe Open University geologist has spent almost half a century studying Europe's premier volcano.\n\nIn that time, he has placed a network of high-precision GPS stations around the mountain to monitor its behaviour.\n\nThis instrumentation is sensitive to millimetric changes in the shape of the volcanic cone; and with 11 years of data it is now obvious, he says, that the mountain is moving in an east-south-east direction, on a general track towards the coastal town of Giarre, which is about 15km away.\n\nEssentially, Etna is sliding down a very gentle slope of 1-3 degrees. This is possible because it is sitting on an underlying platform of weak, pliable sediments.\n\nDr Murray's team has conducted lab experiments to illustrate how this works. The group believes it is the first time that basement sliding of an entire active volcano has been directly observed.\n\nOn the human scale, a movement of 14mm/yr - that is 1.4m over a hundred years - will seem very small, and it is. But geological investigations elsewhere in the world have shown that extinct volcanoes that display this kind of trend can suffer catastrophic failures on their leading flank as they drift downslope.\n\nStresses can build up that lead eventually to devastating landslides.\n\nDr Murray and colleagues stress such behaviour is very rare and can take many centuries, even thousands of years, to develop to a critical stage.\n\nCertainly, there is absolutely no evidence that this is about to happen at Etna. Local residents should not be alarmed, the Open University scientist said.\n\n\"The 14mm/yr is an average; it varies from year to year,\" he explained.\n\n\"The thing to watch I guess is if in 10 years' time the rate of movement has doubled - that would be a warning. If it's halved, I'd say there really is nothing to worry about.\"\n\nOf more immediate concern is the confounding effect this sliding could have for the day-to-day assessment of the volcano.\n\nScientists get hints that eruptive activity is about to occur when magma bulges upwards and deforms the shape of the mountain. To gain an unambiguous view of this inflation, researchers will need to subtract the general E-S-E motion.",

World TB Day is an opportunity for people everywhere to be informed about TB, educate others and urge governments to take action. This global movement will make a powerful statement and show solidarity for people who have been affected by TB.\"\n\nThe most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have higher rates of TB than some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and even Yemen.\n\nLondon is known as the TB capital of Western Europe and has seen initiatives such as a mobile clinic taking to the capital's streets to test vulnerable people, such as the homeless.\n\nFree testing and treatment of latent TB is available in England for people from areas where TB is common.\n\nLast year researchers in Oxford and Birmingham reported they had made a world-first breakthrough in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n\nThey managed to isolate different strains of the disease using a process called genome sequencing.\n\nIt means patients who may have waited months to get the right drugs can now be diagnosed in only a few days - so they have a greater chance of recovery.\n\nWhile figures have gone down over the last six years in England, another issue in the battle to eradicate TB is drug resistance.\n\nA recent study found one in five global cases of the disease is now resistant to at least one major treatment drug.",

On Friday, the Pentagon said it would continue to comply with federal law, and \"continue to assess and retain transgender service members\".",

Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight.\n\nAltogether 25 separatists have been charged variously with sedition, rebellion, embezzlement and other crimes. They deny the allegations.\n\nThe five Catalan politicians remanded in custody on Friday were:\n\nAll five spent some time in detention following the banned referendum but were released on bail late last year pending investigations into their individual roles in the banned referendum.\n\nIn his 70-page ruling, Supreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena said that they should be returned to jail as they represented a flight risk. He did not set a date for their trial.\n\nThe five join four other Catalan leaders already detained in prison. They include Oriol Junqueras, the former Catalan vice-president, and Jordi S?chez, who was nominated to lead the Catalan government but dropped the bid after the Spanish authorities refused to release him to attend an investiture ceremony.\n\nJudge Llarena also issued an arrest warrant for Marta Rovira, the deputy head of the separatist Esquerra Republicana party, who failed to appear in court on Friday.\n\nIt later emerged that she had fled into exile and Spanish media reported that she was in Switzerland.\n\n\"Exile will be a difficult road, but it is the only way I have to recover my political voice. Long live a Catalan Republic for all!,\" she said in a letter published in the Spanish media.\n\nJudge Llarena also reactivated European arrests warrants for six others who are in self-imposed exile, including former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont who is in Belgium.\n\nThe nationalist Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) condemned the court ruling and demanded the release of all those held in prison.\n\nAlthough the leadership vote for Mr Turull can no longer take place on Saturday, Catalan parliament speaker Roger Torrent said he would use the parliamentary session to read a statement in support of those in prison.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority.\n\nIn a setback for the pro-independence cause, a survey published by the respected Catalan Centre for Opinion Studies recently suggested support for independence had dropped sharply, with a majority of Catalans now against the idea.",

                "body": "A French police officer who swapped himself for a hostage in a supermarket siege on Friday has died, officials say.\n\nLt-Col Arnaud Beltrame, 45, had been hailed as a hero by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe gendarme helped bring an end to a gunman's shooting spree that killed three in southern France.\n\nThe radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was shot dead as police brought the siege to an end.\n\nAnnouncing the police officer's death on Twitter, Interior Minister G?ard Collomb said: \"He died for his country. France will never forget his heroism, his bravery, his sacrifice.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr Macron had revealed that Lt-Col Beltrame had suffered serious injuries and was fighting for his life in hospital.\n\nSixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of \"Islamist terrorism\".\n\nLakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people.\n\nOne person - believed to be Lakdim's partner - has been arrested in connection with the shootings.\n\nThe violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car. He killed a passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injured the driver.\n\nHe then shot at a group of policemen who were out jogging, wounding one of them.\n\nLakdim is then believed to have driven a short distance to the small town of Tr?es, where he stormed into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, \"I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!\"\n\nHe killed two people - a customer and a store worker - before seizing others as hostages.\n\nMr Collomb told reporters on Friday that police officers had managed to get some people out of the supermarket but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield.\n\nIt was at this point, he said, that Lt-Col Beltrame had volunteered to swap himself for her.\n\nAs he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation.\n\nWhen police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed but Lt-Col Beltrame was injured.\n\nLakdim, was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality. He was known to French intelligence services.\n\nProsecutor Francois Molins said he had been on an extremist watch-list due to \"his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement\", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. However, subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said.\n\nIn 2011 Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon and in 2015 he was convicted for drug use and refusing a court order, Mr Molins said.\n\nEarlier, Mr Collomb said that though Lakdim had been known to authorities as a petty criminal, they \"did not think he had been radicalised\".\n\nLakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning.\n\nThe family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon.",

                "title": "Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face?",
                "body": "Donald Trump, who built his career as a New York real estate mogul, became a reality television star by directly and dramatically sacking contestants on The Apprentice at the end of every show.\n\nOnly the strong survived, and the weakest competitors were told their shortcomings to their face and summarily dismissed with the catchphrase \"You're fired!\"\n\nThe Apprentice made for compelling television - 28 million Americans watched the first season finale - and helped cement Mr Trump's reputation as a take-charge, high-flying businessman among many Americans. It's a perception that candidate Trump capitalised on during his presidential campaign.\n\n\"When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding your country and your city and every place else, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell them you're fired. Fired!\" Mr Trump said at a 30 September, 2016, campaign rally.\n\nSince becoming president he's had plenty of staff turnover - but several of his most high-profile dismissals have been carried out in a decidedly different manner.\n\nJames Comey, the FBI director that Mr Trump let go in May 2017, learned he was out by watching cable news while on a government trip to Los Angeles. The president's personal aide would later hand-deliver a letter with official confirmation.\n\nEarlier this week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly got the bad news when the president announced his replacement on Twitter. He had spent the last week in Africa and, according to some accounts, was only vaguely informed a few days earlier by Chief of Staff John Kelly that the president was considering a change.\n\nThis is not, needless to say, a commonly accepted way of dismissing employees.\n\n\"The right way to fire someone is in a manner that upholds their dignity, and shows them some respect, and gives them thanks for the service they provided, especially if they've done nothing wrong, violated the law or anything like that,\" says Michael McDermott, a management professor at the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business.\n\n\"I can't think of any business, organisation or government entity that has any kind of oversight that would tolerate this kind of behaviour in their chief executive officer.\"\n\nHe said doing a termination in person helps ease the shock and provide some comfort and reassurance.\n\n\"I think you saw even in Rex Tillerson, he was a little bit emotionally shaken by how it's happened,\" he added. \"He's independently wealthy, he's had a very successful life, yet it was somewhat traumatic for him.\"\n\nThere have been other prominent White House sackings - including presidential adviser Steve Bannon, communications director Anthony Scaramucci and White House staff secretary Rob Porter. Those were reportedly all handled by Mr Kelly, without the president's direct involvement.\n\nReince Priebus, Mr Trump's first chief of staff, technically resigned - but the news was made public without his prior knowledge, via another presidential tweet.\n\nThe president has also publicly criticised or rebuked other members of his administration - including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and National Security Advisor HR McMaster - while reportedly privately mulling their dismissal or hoping they would resign. At least so far, however, Mr Trump has refrained from pulling the trigger.\n\nThis all fits with a picture painted of Trump the real-world businessman, in a July 2016 Politico article by Michael Krause.\n\n\"Rather than magisterial and decisive, Trump the actual boss swings wildly between micromanaging meddler and can't-be-bothered, broad-brush, big-picture thinker,\" Krause writes.\n\n\"He is both impulsive and intuitive, for better and for worse. He hires on gut instinct rather than qualifications; he listens to others, but not as much or as often as he listens to himself. He's loyal - 'like, this great loyalty freak' as he once put it - except when he's not.\"\n\nMore from Anthony:\n\nUntil he became president, Mr Trump was the king of his family-business empire, a decidedly different experience than that of governing in a constitutional democracy, with its checks-and-balances, consensus-building requirements and constant, white-hot scrutiny.\n\nDuring a televised town hall forum on 29 March, 2016, Mr Trump boasted that firing people was easy - but he gave a clue, perhaps, of why he's so frequently shied away from the act.\n\nWhen asked why he hadn't sacked his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was accused of assaulting a female reporter. Mr Trump replied.\n\n\"I'm a loyal person,\" he said. \"It would be so easy for me to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family, he's got four beautiful children in New Hampshire, ruin his whole everything and say 'You're fired.' I've fired many people, especially on The Apprentice.\"\n\nLewandowski was eventually let go, three months later - and the news was delivered not by the candidate, but by his son, Donald Jr.\n\nAccording to McDermott, the decision to fire someone can require an amount of courage. Telling a person they are no longer wanted or needed can be an uncomfortable situation.\n\n\"It gets to a leader's style,\" he says. \"If you see people as objects to be used to achieve your ends, you're almost in a position where you don't have to show them respect as people, you just have to remove the chess piece from the board because it's an object.\"",

                "body": "There's a common misconception that most little girls dream about one day becoming a princess, with a prince who can sweep in to save the day and lead her into a life of luxury.\n\nFor most of us, this is a mere fantasy, but occasionally for a precious few, the fairy tales of our childhoods can become reality.\n\nAmerican actress Meghan Markle is one of these lucky individuals. Yet, while she may now be the envy of many, Meghan hasn't spent her life waiting for a prince to appear.\n\nIn addition to being an established actress, best known for her work on the popular TV drama Suits, Meghan set up and ran her own lifestyle blog called The Tig for almost three years.\n\nThe Tig was closed in April 2017, and all its articles were taken offline. Meghan's social media accounts were wiped in January, two months after her engagement to Prince Harry was announced.\n\nHad she not met Prince Harry, it is likely that Meghan could have gone on to develop her brand further into a much bigger business opportunity, the same way Hollywood A-lister Gwyneth Paltrow did with her hugely successful lifestyle platform Goop.\n\nOn The Tig, Meghan shared beauty, diet and fashion tips, recipes, travel advice, and words of wisdom about love and life - all the essentials you might need to live an \"inspired lifestyle\".\n\nMeghan wrote many of the blog posts herself, and she reinforced the messages from The Tig on social media, with companion posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBefore her accounts were deactivated in January, she had 3 million Instagram followers, 800,000 Facebook likes and 350,000 Twitter followers.\n\nMeghan had also partnered with Canadian High Street fashion retailer Reitmans to release two fashion collections in 2015 and 2016.\n\nApart from discussing issues dear to her heart - such as feminism, humanitarian causes and the personal struggles she'd overcome in her life - Meghan would share quotes from inspirational books she had read.\n\n\"You are always enough,\" was a key Meghan mantra - based on advice once given to her by a casting director during an audition.\n\nHer blog made mention of Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love and neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi's posthumously published autobiography When Breath Becomes Air.\n\nShe also cited the works of Deepak Chopra, an alternative-medicine guru and leading public speaker in the New Age movement.\n\n\"She was trying to show people you could live your best life no matter what your circumstances were, and she was sharing tips and tricks she had learned from meeting people,\" says Amanda Dishaw, editorial director of Vancouver-based lifestyle fashion publisher Effervescence Media.\n\n\"She brought in a range of experts to give advice on The Tig, from make-up artists and dieticians, to fitness instructors, yoga instructors and travel experts.\"\n\nEffervescence Media runs two popular online blogs relating to the royals; What Would Kate Do?, which blogs about Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Meghan's Mirror, which is focused on news about Meghan, as well as reviving old archived lifestyle and wellness articles from The Tig.\n\nThe lifestyle publisher said that web traffic to Meghan's Mirror has gone up 100-fold since Meghan shut The Tig down, with unprecedented traffic on 27 November 2017 - the day her engagement to Prince Harry was announced.\n\n\"She was definitely making money off the affiliate marketing on the website: for example, she would have her friend Jessica Mulroney come on to talk about current fashion trends, and then the site would recommend certain pieces of clothing with links to where you could buy the items,\" says Ms Dishaw.\n\n\"At one point, there would have been at least four or five people working on the site, but you could definitely tell when she was writing herself.\"\n\nBoth Meghan and Gwyneth's lifestyle brands have something in common: they are part of a rising online Wellness movement, whose devotees say is devoted to positivity, spirituality and improving one's lot in life by starting from within.\n\nWellness is a rising part of the growing online content marketing industry, where the opinions and philosophies of influencers on social media now carry more weight with some than conventional wisdom.\n\nAccording to research firm Technavio, the global content marketing industry will be worth $412bn (?297bn) by 2021.\n\nUK-based digital content marketing agency Zazzle Media was one of the pioneers of the industry when it started in 2009.\n\nThe firm has a database of 10,000 influencers that it regularly connects with big brands who want to reach specific audiences.\n\nAbout 20% of its influencers now focus on wellness topics, thanks to a rise in requests from clients.\n\n\"Wellness is one of, if not the fastest growing space at the moment, in terms of influencer environment and business opportunities,\" says Zazzle Media's founder and managing director Simon Penson.\n\n\"Instagram really does help people embrace that way of living because you're sharing visual imagery - a picture tells a thousand words.\"\n\nSource: Zazzle Media\n\n\"The whole spirituality piece has been made socially acceptable and positive by celebrities talking openly about it,\" he says.\n\n\"When millennials see people they look up to talking about spirituality and veganism, it become more acceptable and they start looking into it and how it can benefit their lives.\"\n\nA lack of trust in big business and established wisdom is a key reason for the industry's popularity, says Influence & Co, a major content marketing firm in the US.\n\n\"There is a rise in demand for content from people you can trust,\" says the firm's founder John Hall.\n\nHis company, which has seen its business grow fifteen-fold in the last three years, says the change in social consciousness is affecting how brands advertise and market their products.\n\n\"The trend is moving from super-promotional to being more educational, with the focus being on how you can help the audience, rather than always selling to them.\"\n\nMr Hall and Mr Penson both feel that it is possible to become a hugely popular influencer by building your brand from scratch, but celebrities can become successful much faster as they already have a head start.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop has long courted controversy with its unconventional views on health and lifestyle, but it still commands millions of readers every month and boasts offices in the US and UK, as well as a magazine published by Conde Nast.\n\nThe Tig had a more measured approach, and its audience was primarily made up of Meghan Markle fans who discovered her through Suits.\n\nAccording to Effervescence Media, the readership for What Would Kate Do? is primarily made up of older women, many of them based in the US, who are traditional royalists.\n\nIn contrast, the readership for Meghan's Mirror includes both royalists and millennials, including a large group of young African American women, who now \"feel represented\" in the royal family, says Ms Dishaw.\n\nWith its encouraging, inclusive approach to life that focused on good food, forming healthy emotional bonds, fitness and self-love, observers of The Tig feel that Meghan could have done a lot more with her brand, because fans identified with her and saw her as a \"real\" everyday person.\n\n\"We've seen so many comments from our readers about how she came from a humble beginning, she was an actress, she did humanitarian work, and now she's living out a fairy tale,\" says Ms Dishaw.\n\n\"Our readers are saying that if she could sort her life out, then I can do that too.\"\n\nMs Dishaw thinks that Meghan could have continued to expand her brand by launching fashion collections in the US, as well as moving further into wellness with yoga apparel, fitness DVDs, a cookbook or even a talk show.\n\n\"Any time you can show either vulnerability or authenticity, or being genuine, people can connect and relate to that, and that makes them want to read and engage with your content,\" explains Mr Hall.\n\nMeghan's fans have been very upset since The Tig and her social media accounts were closed down, with some likening the loss of Meghan's voice to the \"death\" of a friend.\n\n\"It was a daily confidence booster seeing her posts come up on Instagram, because she was constantly giving you all these positive affirmations,\" says Sabrina Andersen, the founder of UK-based fan community website Meghan Maven.\n\nIn January, Ms Andersen set up an online petition asking for Meghan's social media accounts to be reactivated.\n\n\"It was about having that connection to her that was suddenly cut off. There's a lot more to her than her being a good actress,\" she says.\n\n\"She just has a personality that makes you feel good. Even though you don't know her on a personal level, you kind of feel like you do know her.\"",

                "title": "India's 'tuberculosis warrior'",
                "body": "On world tuberculosis (TB) day, public health specialist Chapal Mehra and photographer Shampa Kabi follow Dr Zarir Udwadia who has been working tirelessly to fight the disease in its often untreatable forms.\n\nWhen Dr Udwadia, an acclaimed pulmonologist, wrote in a medical journal in 2012 about a virtually untreatable form of TB, the ordinary Indian did not know who he was.\n\nBut the letter set off a frenzy in the medical community and eventually made him one of India's best known doctors, and a man who reminded the country of its growing epidemic of TB and drug-resistant TB (DR TB) - a type of tuberculosis which is unresponsive to at least two of the first line of anti-TB drugs.\n\nIndia is is the global TB epicentre - the country records 2.8 million new tuberculosis cases annually, of which more than 100,000 are multi-drug resistant (MDR), according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe disease kills 400,000 Indians every year, and costs the government around $24bn (?19.2bn) annually.\n\nWhy is TB diagnosis a challenge? \"Because India continues to rely heavily on outdated diagnostic techniques, some of which miss about 50% of all TB cases,\" says Dr Udwadia, who is based in the western city of Mumbai, India's financial capital.\n\nHe believes India needs to adopt newer technologies such as the GeneXpert, a molecular test that detects the presence of TB bacteria.\n\n\"We need to scale up the GeneXpert and make it the first test for everyone like they do in South Africa.\"\n\nDr Udwadia is often termed the miracle worker or the saviour by his patients. The most critical patients, often those with virtually no hope, and their families, crowd his free clinic, waiting with files of records and X-rays. Many wait overnight hoping to be seen by him.\n\nEven though the government once found his findings questionable, it has more recently discovered in him an enabling critic who is helping India's fight against the deadly infection.\n\n\"TB is much more than just a medical affliction caused by a specific bacterium,\" says Dr Udwadia. \"It is a strange, terrible and fascinating entity. Every death from TB is an avoidable tragedy. It is our task to reverse the tide.\"\n\nThough treatable, TB kills an Indian every minute and is an engine of poverty, debt and suffering. It remains India's severest health crisis- one which needs urgent action.\n\n\"Normal TB is really easy to treat, four drugs over six months at a cost of $5 will almost always cure you,\" says Dr Udwadia.\n\nBut, he adds, if patients are given the wrong drugs or incorrect doses, or are irregular with their medication, the TB bacteria becomes resistant to the drugs.\n\nThis drug-resistant TB takes far longer - up to two years - and thousands of dollars to treat. It requires many more drugs - 250 injections and 15,000 pills, to be precise.\n\n\"When stacked up [the pills] equal a 30-storey tower,\" says Dr Udwadia. And the drugs that are toxic can have severe side effects, he adds. \"They can make you deaf, blind, give you kidney failure and leave you psychotic.\"\n\n\"Every now and then, I come across patients who are virtually untreatable,\" he says.\n\nDr Udwadia describes MDR-TB, which is resistant to multiple drugs, as a \"ticking time bomb\" that could reverse the progress India has made so far in its battle against the infection.\n\n\"In our crowded communities, each MDR patient infects 10-20 others with the same deadly strain ensuring the epidemic amplifies relentlessly.\"\n\nHe recalls one of his patients, Salma, a poor woman who lived in Dharavi, a sprawling slum that lies at the heart of Mumbai. Nearly a million people are estimated to live in an unending stretch of narrow lanes, open sewers and cramped homes.\n\nIt is \"an incubator of TB by virtue of its poverty and overcrowding\", according to Dr Udwadia.\n\nSalma, he says, had spent five years trying to cure herself of her TB infection. She had travelled for more than 1500km (932 miles), visited at least four government TB clinics, seen 12 private physicians and received multiple drugs in various combinations.\n\n\"What could be more soul destroying than taking five years of treatment but finding yourself getting worse, not better?\" asks Dr Udwadia.\n\nSalma, who was resistant to every single TB drug, died four days after a surgery.\n\n\"So who killed Salma? Who let her down? We did! drug-resistant TB is a collective indictment of us all.\"\n\nIn the last year alone, Dr Udwadia says, 10 million people across the globe have got sick with TB, two million have died of it and about 150,000 patients of drug-resistant TB in India are desperate for a cure.\n\n\"All they get is delays, disruptions and disillusion,\" he says.\n\nReferring to India's launch of its first bullet train project in September 2017, he adds, \"forget your bullet trains, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and just help our patients get on this one.\n\n\"Give us the new drugs we need to treat, give us the labs and tests to diagnose early, give us more funds, not more cuts in the TB budget, and give us social change, because TB is the perfect expression of an imperfect civilisation.\"",

                "title": "'I tried to kill myself nine times before the NHS helped me'",
                "body": "It was the ninth time in the space of 10 days that Sherry Denness had tried to kill herself. \"It felt like checkmate - there were no open doors or other ways for my life to turn, I just wanted to die,\" she says.\n\nOnly just 18, Sherry has been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions, including borderline personality disorder (BPD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nOn seven of her nine suicide attempts, which took place in November last year, the teenager had landed in A&E, been patched up and deemed well enough to be sent home with no further help. Another time she'd taken all of her prescribed medication in one go and ended up in critical care for two days. But once the physical symptoms had been dealt with, to her parent's despair, she was simply discharged and sent home.\n\nThis time things turned out differently.\n\n\"When you're in mental health crisis, it feels like everything is just closing in on your brain like a clamp,\" she says.\n\n\"I was psychotic and I was hearing Kieran in my head telling me I need to leave the house.\" Kieran is one of the voices Sherry hears - the worst one, she says.\n\n\"When I'm in that state, it is very hard to comprehend that the voices are not real. I hear him in my ears like I'd hear a real person. He will say, 'No-one likes you, no-one loves you, you're better off dead.'\"\n\nUnder Kieran's influence, she quarrelled with her parents and stormed out of the house. A little later PC Pete Coe and PC Dan Ayrton found her on a pathway nearby, train tracks lying just ahead. They'd been alerted by a crisis team Sherry had called in her non-lucid state to ask about a place to live.\n\n\"It was a freezing cold evening and Sherry was sitting cross-legged on the floor, I remember there being a lot of blood because she was self-harming,\" says Coe. Sherry's clothes were scuffed from her attempts to scale the fence that stood between her and the train tracks.\n\nAfter checking with a mental health professional at the local hospital, Coe used his police powers to detain Sherry under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. \"By sectioning Sherry we were able to do what we could to keep her safe and get her the help she clearly needed,\" Coe says. At the time, Sherry didn't want to go with the police and resisted their attempts to help her. But now she thanks them for calming her down - and, she says, for saving her life.\n\nWhen Sherry's mum, Andi, saw the blue lights of an ambulance from her kitchen, a cold tentacle of dread slipped around her stomach. She ran out of the house, fearing the worst. To see her daughter alive, and with the police, was a huge relief.\n\n\"When they told me they'd sectioned my daughter, I felt my legs go from beneath me and I cried like a two-year-old child because I was so grateful that she was finally going to get into hospital and get the help she so desperately needed,\" she explains. \"Sherry is from a very loving family but she wasn't well so she hurt herself again, and again, and again. And each time they discharged her we were saying as parents, 'She needs to be in a hospital - she's not very well.'\"\n\nBut things didn't go smoothly even after she was sectioned. Once she'd been escorted by the police to A&E to treat her physical injuries she should have been transferred to a children's mental health unit.\n\nBut a shortage of beds meant Sherry landed in an adult ward at a hospital in Guildford, where her parents say she was propositioned by a male patient in his 50s. So she was then transferred to a secure children's mental health unit in Sheffield, 160 miles away. It was the only place that was available.\n\nShe was eventually transferred from Sheffield to another hospital in Guildford, close to her home, and there she began to feel more lucid and positive. She was discharged at the end of November and is now back at home with her family.\n\nSherry has spent nearly a year of her life in mental health facilities.\n\nShe was 11 when she was first assessed by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs). \"They took my mum aside and told her I was just an attention seeker and they didn't take it seriously,\" she remembers. Eventually, at 13, she was given treatment for ADHD, but by then children at her school had already begun to bully her.\n\nAt school, Sherry was often kicked out of class for disruptive behaviour and spent most of her time in isolation. \"I couldn't concentrate and no-one listened to what I was saying,\" she says. \"When you have ADHD it feels like everything is going 10 million times faster than normal and you don't understand why people around you are so calm.\" Sherry struggled to make friends and became increasingly isolated. She began self-harming at 13 and was first sectioned by the police at 14. At that point Sherry's parents decided to take her out of school.\n\nThe family feels Camhs has let Sherry down for years now.\n\nAfter she was finally sectioned in November her parents made a viral video in which her dad, Chris, tells the story of those horrific 10 days by holding up a series of messages drawn on paper. He then asks people to show they care about her - and about other young people struggling to get treatment for mental health problems - by getting involved in a social media campaign under the hashtag #wecaresherry.\n\n\"We started the campaign to give Sherry hope because she thought that nobody cared,\" Chris says. But the family are also calling for changes in the way Camhs operates.\n\nFor example, they argue that A&E is no place for a child having a mental health episode - though that is where Camhs advises them to go.\n\n\"Getting Sherry to A&E when she's in a heightened state is a nightmare,\" says Chris. \"Normally we have to call the police to get her there.\" Both parents have been trained in safe restraint but have to take shifts because her physical strength when she is distressed can be overpowering.\n\nThey tell me about six-hour waits, unsympathetic security staff and receptionists who are openly exasperated at seeing Sherry back in A&E again.\n\n\"I have been to A&E a lot of times for self-harm and suicide attempts and parents of little kids will look at you in disgust and shuffle their kids away because they can see you're holding your arm or your leg,\" Sherry says. \"It's not nice and it makes you feel even worse. You sit there for hours and hours until they can get a Camhs person to come and see you.\"\n\nIn the 10 days that Sherry attempted to kill herself nine times, she was seen by 18 different healthcare professionals, ranging from staff from A&E to Camhs. But none provided the help she needed to address the cause of her problems. The family says the threshold for accessing this help is too high.\n\nThey are also calling for more investment in Camhs and better training for the staff young people experiencing a mental health crisis might come into contact with, including teachers, the police, paramedics and A&E doctors and nurses. They'd also like to get the message out that early intervention is key.\n\n\"A lot of this could have been avoided if I'd got the help I needed sooner,\" says Sherry.\n\nThe family has received hundreds of messages of support from parents and young people who say they have had experiences similar to Sherry's. The video, meanwhile, has now been watched more than five million times.\n\nIn it, recordings of Sherry playing her digital piano can be heard in the background. When she is at home she tries to play every day - it gives her a focus.\n\n\"Whenever Sherry is in hospital I sit and listen to her piano recordings. And then I look over and I realise she's not there, but it still brings me comfort,\" says Andi.\n\nAt the same time, if Sherry is in hospital she will be wearing a pair of new pyjamas, handmade by her mum, who is a dressmaker. \"I wear the pyjamas and hug myself in them,\" Sherry says.\n\nShe also has a fleece \"care blanket\" with photos of her loved ones printed on it, which she wraps around her shoulders.\n\n\"In many areas it is desperately hard for young people to get the support they need,\" says Matt Blow, policy manager at YoungMinds, a UK charity for the well-being and mental health of young people. Every day the charity's helpline hears from parents who have been waiting months for an appointment for their child and have nowhere to turn, he says.\n\n\"Sometimes their children have started to self-harm, become suicidal or dropped out of school during the wait.\"\n\nHe estimates that only one in four children with mental health problems is currently receiving support from Camhs, but adds there is a postcode lottery, with services far better in some parts of the country than others.\n\nA recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) report - ordered by the government as part of its Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, a ?1bn plan to improve mental health care by 2021 - says some children are waiting up to 18 months to be treated.\n\nIt also echoes Sherry's family's concern that those who work with children and young people - in schools, GP practices and A&E, for example - sometimes lack the skills to identify and support children with mental health needs, hindering their access to specialist help.\n\nAccording to another independent report, Camhs turns away nearly a quarter of children referred to them for treatment by concerned parents, GPs and others.\n\n\"Without a doubt, after years of drought, the NHS's mental health funding taps have now been turned on,\" Claire Murdoch, Mental Health Director for NHS England said in a statement when the CQC report was published. \"It's going to to take years of concerted practical effort to solve these service gaps - even with new money - given the time it inescapably takes to train the extra child psychiatrists, therapists and nurses required.\"\n\nAsked to comment on Sherry's story and the shortcomings highlighted by the CQC, she said Camhs services were improving \"but from a starting point of historic underfunding and legacy understaffing, relative to rapidly growing need\".\n\nShe added: \"The CQC rightly acknowledge that the NHS's five-year plan for mental health, developed with patients, their families, health professionals and other partners, sets out a clear route map for improvement and investment, and progress is under way. As we look out over the next few years, the CQC is also right to highlight better cross-sector working involving health providers, schools, regulators and government, as well as children and parents, if we're to put in place care which is timely, supportive and of the highest quality.\"\n\nAs the NHS struggles to cope with demand, police forces across the country have reported a rise in the number of mental health related incidents they deal with. The Metropolitan Police, Britain's biggest police force, received a phone call relating to mental health every five minutes last year. The numbers have risen by nearly a third since 2011-12 and are now at record levels.\n\nPC Coe, who found Sherry near the railway tracks, says that even in his three-and-a-half years in the job, the amount of time he spends dealing with mental health calls has noticeably increased. \"The police are picking up the slack from other services,\" he says. \"If people have nowhere else to turn to, they call us.\"\n\nIt's been more than three months since Sherry came out of hospital and, buoyed by the #wecaresherry campaign, she's begun to make recovery boxes for other young people struggling with their mental health. The boxes include home comforts like fluffy socks and chocolate, as well as stress toys and advice on coping techniques. Sherry received her own recovery box just after coming out of hospital and her favourite items include \"an unsquishable stress ball\" and coconut hand cream, because it smells like holidays.\n\n\"When I'm low I find it really lonely and I deny myself nice things like this because I think I'm helping myself by punishing myself. So if someone goes out of their way to send a box like this it is really lovely,\" Sherry says.\n\nShe loves helping people and wants to be a police officer for that reason. She explained this to PC Coe and his colleague over the course of the hours they spent together waiting in A&E, and then waiting for Sherry to be transferred.\n\n\"It was good to hear that Sherry had plans for the future,\" says Coe. \"She asked if a police career would be possible after all her run-ins with the police, she was worried about being black-balled because of it.\"\n\nHe reassured her that she hadn't done anything wrong - being sectioned wasn't the same as being arrested. It was something that \"could happen to anyone\".\n\nSherry's ambition to join the police may seem surprising for someone who has had so many traumatic experiences involving them.\n\n\"I have been resuscitated by the police, I have been detained and sectioned by the police and they've stopped me from doing things I was determined to do,\" she says. \"But I think they are highly underrated and they deserve a lot more respect. There are people my age who call them pigs - but I think they do a brilliant job.\"\n\nFor now, Sherry is focusing on getting better and supporting other people in the process.\n\n\"I still have my low days and I still struggle but it is more bearable - it is never going to go away and I've had to come to terms with that. There will be days throughout my life when I'm not going to want to be alive, and I have come to terms with that as well,\" she says.\n\nShe draws strength from the huge support for the #wecaresherry campaign.\n\n\"I am just taking things one day at a time and knowing that there are people out there who are supporting me really brings home the fact that I do deserve to be alive. It really is amazing.\"",

                "body": "Facebook ended the week $58bn lower in value after its handling of a historic data breach.\n\nIts founder Mark Zuckerberg apologised for data breaches that affected 50 million users.\n\nThe apology did not stop investors from selling shares in Facebook, with many wondering just how bad the damage will be for the social network.\n\nThe breach was called a \"light bulb\" moment for users, spawning a the social media trend #deletefacebook.\n\nAll the negative headlines led to some advertisers saying \"enough is enough\".\n\nShares in the social media company fell from $176.80 on Monday to around $159.30 by Friday night.\n\nFacebook's initial public offering in 2012 priced shares at $38 each, giving the company a market valuation of close to $104bn.\n\nFollowing steady user growth and a dominant space in the digital advertising market ensuring revenues, Facebook's share price climbed to $190 by February this year.\n\nBrian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said he had one of the most negative outlooks for Facebook's share price on Wall Street.\n\n\"I had a $152 price target on Facebook for 2018 - and that was before the events of this week\".\n\nMr Wieser said the share price slump showed investors were wary of increased regulation and users leaving the platform \"but there's little risk of advertisers leaving Facebook. Where else would they go?\"\n\nHargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the week had been a \"damaging episode\" in Facebook's history.\n\n\"One of the secrets of Facebook's success has been that the more people who use Facebook, the more integral it becomes to its customers. Unfortunately for Facebook, the same dynamic cuts in the opposite direction if it loses a meaningful number of users as a result of this scandal. \"\n\nAdvertising firm M&C Saatchi's founding director David Kershaw said the revelations that a 2014 Facebook quiz essentially harvested data from users and their connected friends without consent have led to a backlash from advertisers.\n\n\"Clients have come to the point, quite rightly, where enough is enough, \" Mr Kershaw said.\n\nAdvertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank on Wednesday suspended ads on the social media platform.\n\nOn Friday tech entrepreneur Elon Musk had the official Facebook pages for his companies Tesla and SpaceX deleted.\n\n\"Make no mistake Facebook is an amazing medium from the advertiser's point of view because of the accuracy of its targeting - which comes from data. But I think those large companies are very nervous to be associated with a medium where the data is being abused, particularly in a political context,\" Mr Kershaw said.\n\nMr Kershaw told the BBC any change in Facebook's data protection policy was more likely to come from the threat of a withdrawal of \"hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtag [campaigns] on Twitter,\" referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular.\n\nUK advertising group ISBA met Facebook on Friday and said its \"constructive and challenging\" summit had convinced the group that the social media company was taking steps to \"rapidly address public and advertiser concerns\", including app audits and face-to-face meetings with individual UK advertising clients.\n\nIt will take some time before it becomes clear if the advertising industry's dissatisfaction with Facebook leads to them actually pulling their money out of the social network, or whether the howls of condemnation amount to mere posturing from a group of concerned clients.\n\nThe Facebook founder tried to reassure users \"the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago.\"\n\nHowever, Passion Capital tech investor Eileen Burbidge, who is also on the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group, said Facebook's reassurance to users and clients took too long.\n\n\"The fact that it took them five days to come out with a statement, which happened to be a fair, sensible and comprehensive statement, was just far too long,\" Mrs Burbidge said.\n\n\"I think they were just really tone deaf for too many days.\"\n\nThe technology venture capitalist said Facebook underestimated the consumer backlash that occurred once their data was used for political purposes.\n\nCambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum.\n\n\"Some people are using the term 'political manipulation'.\n\n\"They [Facebook] assumed they had already taken care of this... as they had already changed their terms of service, for example,\" Mrs Burbidge said.\n\nIn Mr Zuckerberg's online statement he offered a timeline of how Facebook's data permission agreements with users and other companies had changed since the 2014 personality quiz app was able to scrape data from quiz takers and their contacts without their expressed permission.\n\nMrs Burbidge said there may need to be new regulation over political campaigning \"which really hasn't kept up with social media\".\n\nTechnology writer Kate Bevan said the week's events have woken Facebook's users up to the fact that the platform's games, quizzes and apps could harvest their data for more serious intents.\n\n\"This week feels to me like a real light bulb moment where people are understanding that it's not just clicking 'like' on Facebook, it's giving your data away\".\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by the European Union's commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Vera Jourova said the Cambridge Analytica allegations had been \"a huge wake-up call\" for Facebook users about the demand for their data.",

Dominic Cummings said claims by the Observer newspaper are \"factually wrong, hopelessly confused, or nonsensical\".\n\nIn a separate development, Brittany Kaiser, Cambridge Analytica's former business development director, has told the Guardian the firm carried out data analysis for Leave.EU, the rival Brexit campaign to Vote Leave that was fronted by Nigel Farage.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it did \"no paid or unpaid work\" for Leave.EU.",

                "title": "Virtual reality as sharp as the human eye can see?",
                "body": "Finnish start-up Varjo has developed a prototype virtual reality (VR) headset that its makers claim gives an image 50 times sharper than most other headsets currently on the market.\n\nWhen I tested the prototype - looking round the virtual cockpit of a passenger plane - the level of detail in the small central area of vision was certainly impressive - as close to the real thing as I've come across.\n\nImage quality outside this area, simulating standard VR headsets, was noticeably fuzzier.\n\nFounder and chief executive Urho Konttori says the firm has managed to achieve this by mimicking how the eye sees.\n\n\"The human eye only focuses on a thumbnail-sized area of vision - the brain fills in the rest,\" he says. \"Our peripheral vision is less detailed, at a much lower resolution.\"\n\nSo Varjo's headset provides very high definition images only of the objects our eyes are focusing on at any particular moment, the rest of the scene is at lower resolution. It uses eye-tracking technology to tell which parts of the image it needs to render in high definition.\n\nThis technique is known as foveated rendering within the industry - chipmaker Nvidia has been working on it for a few years.\n\nThis selective approach uses a lot less computing power, says Mr Kontorri - roughly 25% less than current VR headsets.\n\nBut this level of detail doesn't come cheap - headsets will cost between ?5,000 and ?10,000 (?4,350 and ?8,700) - so the Helsinki-based firm is targeting corporate customers, such as aircraft manufacturers, carmakers, architects, construction firms and the entertainment industry.\n\n\"VR visualisation - looking at designs of cars, buildings, cityscapes in high-definition 3D - will become a key part of the design process for business,\" says Brian Blau, VR analyst for research firm Gartner.\n\nMr Kontorri, who used to work for Microsoft and Nokia, is hoping that simulator training for aircraft pilots and other professionals could be made a lot cheaper using VR in addition to training on traditional full-scale simulators.\n\n\"Fully functional cockpit simulators can cost around ?10m so there aren't many around, and access to them is limited,\" he says. \"Using our system could bring the total cost of training to around ?100,000.\"\n\nCarmakers BMW, Audi and Volkswagen have all asked for early access to the technology so they can help develop the prototype, says Mr Kontorri. And aerospace firms Saab and Airbus have also expressed interest. Game development platforms Unreal and Unity are technical partners.\n\nBut of course, a prototype is not the same as a final product.\n\nVarjo, which has attracted more than $15m (?11m) in funding so far, is aiming to bring a final version to market by the end of 2018.\n\nAnd rivals are exploring a similar approach.\n\nChipmaker Qualcomm, for example, has teamed up with eye-tracking firm Tobii to develop headsets that concentrate graphical processing power to where the user is looking.\n\nThe image quality of the peripheral vision is reduced without the user noticing.\n\n\"There is definitely a market for high-end virtual reality,\" thinks Tom Mainelli, an VR specialist at market intelligence firm IDC.\n\n\"In fact, we're seeing an increasing demand from commercial entities that want higher-resolution hardware to drive more immersive experiences in everything from employee training to product design to manufacturing.\"\n\nBut so far, it's fair to say VR has had an image problem - in more ways than one.\n\nPicture quality on most consumer headsets has suffered by comparison with today's high-resolution smartphone and TV screens, while slow frame rates have often contributed to feelings of nausea among users watching fast-moving content.\n\nThis is also caused by latency - when you move your head and the image lags behind slightly.\n\n\"This causes your eyes, inner ear, and brain to get out of sync,\" says Mr Mainelli.\n\nFaster graphics chips can help address this issue, he says, \"but the content must address it, too. If a VR experience has lots of jump cuts outside the control of the user it can also cause discomfort, regardless of the frame rate or low latency.\"\n\nTailoring content to suit the environment will be crucial for airlines looking to offer more immersive entertainment for their passengers, says Moritz Engler, co-founder of Munich-based start-up Inflight VR.\n\n\"On a plane you can't have people making sudden head movements and potentially hitting other passengers,\" he says. \"You have to make sure the content is appropriate.\"\n\nThis means avoiding content involving roller-coaster rides or fighter plane dogfights.\n\n\"The last thing we want is for passengers to get sick,\" he says.\n\nInflight VR has developed a platform to manage and distribute suitable content for airlines and has been trialling its service with Spanish carrier Iberia, amongst others. Airlines could offer commercial services as well as entertainment, Mr Engler believes.\n\n\"Say you're flying to the Maldives, you could watch a film about scuba diving and then book a course, or you could go virtual shopping during the flight,\" he says.\n\nAnother obvious drawback with VR is the inconvenience of having to put on a clunky headset that can become uncomfortable after prolonged use.\n\nVR headset makers are beginning to address all these issues.\n\nFor example, HTC is releasing its Vive Pro headset in April, which features a much higher-resolution screen, high-performance headphones with noise cancellation facility, and a more comfortable strap. It will cost ?799.\n\nUsers will also be able to unplug the headset from the computer and move freely thanks to a wireless dongle accessory.\n\nPimax has even produced a headset with ultra high-definition 8K image resolution and a 200 degree field of view (humans can see 220 degrees without having to move our heads).\n\nCheaper headsets - think Samsung's Gear - use your smartphone as the screen, but new products such as Facebook's Oculus Go and Lenovo's Mirage Solo will \"eliminate the need for a phone or PC altogether,\" says Mr Mainelli.\n\n\"These products will drive a much different experience and will ship in notable volumes this year.\"\n\nSo VR for business has a long way to go if it's to catch up with the consumer gaming market. About 20 million headsets were sold in 2017, says Mr Blau, but the business sector accounted for less than 5% of that.\n\n\"The problem with VR is that people think they're going to get a movie-quality experience, but the technology can't match that yet.\"\n\nIt seems that higher-definition images, faster chips and lighter headsets can't come fast enough.",

                "body": "Peru's Congress has sworn in the Vice-President, Mart? Vizcarra, to replace the sitting president who resigned amid allegations of corruption this week.\n\nMr Vizcarra is expected to serve out Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's term, which ends in 2021.\n\nSpeaking after the ceremony, he said tackling corruption would be a priority for his government.\n\nBut he also urged all sides to put an end to a politics of confrontation and work together to achieve growth.\n\n\"This is a new beginning for Peru,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to define clear goals for the country, leaving aside political differences.\"\n\nMr Vizcarra, 55, said that in a few days he would appoint a completely new cabinet.\n\n\"I propose a social pact to fight corruption and encourage growth, with social integration\", he said.\n\nThere were calls from the opposition for him to call fresh presidential elections.\n\nHis message to Congress, however, was clear - he intends to stay in power until the end of the current term.\n\nFor that he will need the support of the opposition, led by politicians loyal to Peru's most divisive figure, former president Alberto Fujimori.\n\nHis promise to investigate corruption allegations against his immediate predecessor, Mr Kuczynski, will get the support of Fujimoristas in Congress.\n\nMr Fujimori's daughter Keiko, who leads the Popular Force party, wished the new president good luck.\n\n\"This is a time for all Peruvians to be united,\" she tweeted.\n\nA former governor of a mining-rich province, Mr Vizcarra is seen as business-friendly but some Peruvians have questioned whether he has the political experience to handle the presidency at a time of crisis.\n\nTo add to the pressure on the new president, Peru will be hosting the Summit of the Americas in three weeks' time, which US President Donald Trump has said he will attend.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Peru's Congress voted overwhelmingly to approve Mr Kuczynski's resignation.\n\nHe had tendered his resignation letter on Wednesday, on the eve of a planned impeachment vote against him in Congress.\n\nHis position had become untenable after the opposition released secret videos and audios that appeared to implicate him in efforts to buy support from opposition legislators to reject the motion.\n\nMr Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, went on national television on Wednesday to reject the claims.\n\nHe said the tapes and audios had been edited to incriminate him.\n\nMr Kuczynski enjoyed immunity from prosecution as president. But with allegations of corruption against him mounting, he could now face trial.\n\nHe was accused of taking bribes from the Brazilian construction company, Odebrecht.",

                "body": "Armed police have killed a suspect who shot dead three people in a series of attacks in southern France.\n\nThe heavily armed gunman hijacked a car and then took hostages at a supermarket in the town of Tr?es.\n\nThe man, named as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, said he was fighting on behalf of the Islamic State group.\n\nHe is believed to have killed and wounded his victims in three separate incidents which began in Carcassonne, 15 minutes' drive from Tr?es.\n\nLater, President Emmanuel Macron said 16 people had been injured in the attack.\n\nAmong them is a gendarme who swapped places with a hostage. Mr Macron said the man, who has been hailed for his heroism, was fighting for his life in hospital.\n\nHe was shot several times, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters. One person has been arrested in connection with the shootings, he added.\n\nThe suspect is said to have been demanding the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people.\n\nMr Macron called the attack an act of \"Islamist terrorism\".\n\nThe attacker began his spree of attacks on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where he first hijacked a car, killing one passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injuring the driver.\n\nHe then shot and wounded a policeman who was jogging with colleagues.\n\nThe suspect is then believed to have driven a few kilometres to the small town of Tr?es, where he charged into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, \"I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!\" and took hostages.\n\nCarole, who was shopping at the supermarket, said people hid in a cold room.\n\n\"A man shouted and fired several times. I saw a cold room door, I asked people to come and take shelter,\" she told France info radio.\n\n\"There were 10 of us, and we stayed an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the emergency back door.\"\n\nInterior Minister G?ard Collomb told reporters that police officers managed to get some people out, but that the gunman held one woman back as a human shield.\n\nIt was at this point, he said, that the 45-year-old gendarme volunteered to swap himself for her - and left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so police could monitor the situation,\n\nWhen police heard gunshots, an elite Swat team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed but the gendarme was seriously injured, and another officer was also hurt.\n\nMr Collomb hailed the \"heroism and courage\" of the gendarme, a lieutenant-colonel.\n\nRedouane Lakdim, reportedly from a Moroccan background, was known to French intelligence services, said Mr Collomb.\n\n\"He was known for petty crimes,\" including small-time drug-dealing, he said. \"We had monitored him and thought there was no radicalisation,\" he said.\n\nHas very active on Salafist social networks and incarcerated in Carcassonne in 2016, reports Le Parisien. Salafism is a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam.\n\nHe is also suspected of making a trip to Syria, though that is unconfirmed, Le Parisien adds.\n\nLakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters - one of whom a neighbour saw him taking to school on Friday morning.\n\nThat apartment has now reportedly been raided by police.\n\nIn a statement released online, Islamic State claimed the attacker was \"a soldier of the Islamic State\" - a claim President Macron said the security services were studying.\n\nMr Macron was at an EU summit in Brussels when the attack took place but said he would return to oversee the response.\n\nFrance has been hit with several deadly jihadist attacks since 2015 and has been on high alert since. A state of emergency put in place after the 2015 attacks in Paris was lifted in October.\n\nIn February, Salah Abdeslam went on trial in Belgium over a shootout in Brussels that led to his capture months after the Paris attacks. He is not expected to go on trial in France until 2020 at the earliest.\n\nAre you in the area? Have you witnessed what has happened?

                "title": "Police inspector guilty of wife's murder",
                "body": "A police inspector has been found guilty of murdering his wife and dumping her body in a lake.\n\nDarren McKie, 43, denied murdering his wife Leanne but admitted manslaughter towards the end of his trial.\n\nMrs McKie, 39, a detective constable, was found strangled in Poynton Lake in Cheshire on 29 September.\n\nJurors at Chester Crown Court deliberated for almost two days before reaching a majority verdict. McKie will be sentenced on Tuesday.\n\nThe couple, who both worked for Greater Manchester Police (GMP), had financial problems and owed more than ?100,000, the court heard.\n\nThey had appeared to be a \"perfect family\" but were really living \"well beyond their means\", prosecutors said.\n\nThe father-of-three, who had 20 years of police service, strangled his wife after she discovered he had made a joint application for a ?54,000 loan without her consent.\n\nMcKie had forged his wife's signature repeatedly, using her warrant number and wage documents for the application, the jury heard.\n\nProsecutor Nigel Power QC told the court: \"What produced the argument that led to her death was that he'd been found out in committing serious criminal offences.\"\n\nThe court heard McKie had left work at Stretford police station abruptly at about 11:30 GMT on the day of his wife's death, after receiving a text message from her revealing she had discovered the loan application.\n\nMr Power said McKie then \"determinedly strangled his wife to death\", involving significant force for at least a minute.\n\nIn the hours that followed, the inspector showed a surveyor into his home and was said to have laughed with parents on the school run.\n\nPolice believe Mrs McKie's body was either under the stairs or in the boot of their car when the surveyor arrived.\n\nHe was twice spotted walking towards Wilmslow, where the family lived, by patrol officers in the hours before Mrs McKie's body was discovered in shallow water at Poynton Lake.\n\nDuring the second sighting, at 02:15 GMT, the officers noticed he was not wearing shoes.\n\nHis trainers were later found in a wheelie bin with traces of his wife's blood on them, as well as soil from the lake area.\n\nIn his closing speech, Mr Power said the inspector went on to play a \"game of cat and mouse\" with police.\n\nMckie tried to cover his tracks by not carrying his mobile phone in an attempt to prevent police tracing his movements.\n\nHe also sent text messages to his wife's phone in the hours after her death, and showed \"no emotion\" in police custody.\n\nThe jury rejected McKie's defence barrister's suggestion that the killing had not been intentional and was a \"terrible, terrible mistake\".\n\nDet Supt Aaron Duggan, who led the investigation, said: \"This is a very tragic case, we have got three children here who have been left without a mother - and sadly also a father - because of his actions.\n\n\"I think he has completely distanced himself from the reality of what he has done. I think it's very very sad that he's waited until all the evidence has been presented before he has admitted his guilt.\n\n\"We can't lose sight of the fact that it has involved two police officers but we haven't treated the case any differently because of that.\"\n\nDet Insp Adam Waller said McKie had \"used the knowledge gained as a police officer to try and systematically cover his tracks\" with the aim of creating the impression that his wife had been murdered by somebody else.\n\n\"He is a coward and refused to admit responsibility for his actions throughout,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Mrs McKie's family said \"justice had been served\" but there were \"no winners in this trial\".\n\n\"Our lives will never be the same again. We have lost our beautiful daughter and our grandchildren have lost their beloved mummy,\" they added.\n\nGMP Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said the force had \"lost a colleague and much-loved friend\".\n\nHe added: \"Leanne was a hard-working officer who showed the utmost professionalism. She worked as a detective in the serious sexual offences unit and supported victims when they were at their most vulnerable.\"",

                "body": "The firm that designed the sensors on the Uber self-driving car that killed a woman this week has said its technology was not to blame.\n\nSan Jose-based Velodyne told the BBC it was \"baffled\" by the incident, adding its equipment was capable of seeing in the dark.\n\nElaine Herzberg, 49, was struck by the car late on Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona. She died in hospital.\n\nThe investigation into what caused her death is ongoing.\n\nVideo of the incident was published by investigators earlier on Wednesday. It showed Ms Herzberg walking with her bicycle, away from a pedestrian crossing. Neither the car - nor its human driver - reacted.\n\nA spokeswoman for Uber told the BBC it would not comment on Velodyne's view while the inquiry took place.\n\nVelodyne's Lidar sensors are used by a number of companies testing self-driving cars on public roads today.\n\nLidar is a type of radar that essentially gives the car the ability to \"see\" what is around it.\n\nVelodyne Lidar president Marta Hall told the BBC it would not be advising its customers to halt tests in the wake of the Arizona death because \"we do not believe the accident was due to Lidar\".\n\nInstead, the company is pointing to Uber's on-board computer as potentially being to blame, Ms Hall said.\n\n\"Our Lidar can see perfectly well in the dark, as well as it sees in daylight, producing millions of points of information.\n\n\"However, it is up to the rest of the system to interpret and use the data to make decisions. We do not know how the Uber system of decision-making works.\"\n\nWhile it makes use of third-party hardware, Uber's self-driving cars use software developed in house.\n\nUber has suspended its self-driving programme - which was taking place in four US cities - until it knows more about what happened.\n\nThe firm's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said of the incident: \"We're thinking of the victim's family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.\"\n\nVelodyne said it had not been in contact with Uber about the incident, but was in the process of preparing to speak to investigators.\n\nThe National Traffic Safety Board said it was working on a preliminary report to be published within the next few weeks - a fuller conclusion will not be made for several months.\n\nMs Hall added: \"We are very sad, sorry, and worried for the future of a project which is intended to save lives.\"\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

                "body": "Google's Sidewalk Labs has big plans for Toronto's waterfront. The problem is, nobody seems to know what they are.\n\nEver since a Google-affiliated company announced that it would be building a \"smart city\" on the Toronto waterfront, rumours have swirled about what kinds of futuristic tech might be in store.\n\nWould there be flying cars like in the Jetsons? Teleportation like in Star Trek? And more importantly, in light of Cambridge Analytica's misuse of millions of Facebook users' data, what would the company be doing with all the user information it collects?\n\nFor now, most of these questions will have to remain unanswered, much to the chagrin of the hundreds of Torontonians who attended public meetings on Tuesday and a number of city officials who are growing wary of corporate vagaries.\n\n\"The public has a right to know... the contents of a deal of this significance and this importance,\" Deputy Mayor Denzil Minnan-Wong told the BBC.\n\n\"In any deal I get something and you get something.\"\n\n\"What exactly are we getting from Sidewalk and what are we giving for it?\"\n\nThe project was commissioned by the publically funded organisation Waterfront Toronto, who put out calls last spring for proposals to revitalise the 12-acre industrial neighbourhood of Quayside along Toronto's waterfront.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau flew down to announce the agreement with Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, last October, and the project has received international attention for being one of the first smart-cities designed from the ground up.\n\nBut five months later, few people have actually seen the full agreement between Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto.\n\nAs council's representative on Waterfront Toronto's board, Mr Minnan-Wong is the only elected official to actually see the legal agreement in full. Not even the mayor knows what the city has signed on for.\n\n\"We got very little notice. We were essentially told 'here's the agreement, the prime minister's coming to make the announcement,'\" he said.\n\n\"Very little time to read, very little time to absorb.\"\n\nNow, his hands are tied - he is legally not allowed to comment on the contents of the sealed deal, but he has been vocal about his belief it should be made public.\n\n\"Do I have concerns about the content of that agreement? Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it that is being hidden, why does it have to be secret?\"\n\nWhen I spoke to Dan Doctoroff, the chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, he told me that the plans for the waterfront city would be all about improving the lives of the citizens living there, and that would include extensive collaboration with them.\n\nHe also acknowledged that in the past, technology and urban planning have not been the most comfortable of bedfellows and that smart city plans are often imposed on those living there with little consultation or explanation.\n\nHe wanted his team to work better with the community, but clearly so far that hasn't happened.\n\nIt is not surprising that citizens are wary of the partnership. Tech firms are currently under increasing scrutiny for how they capture, store and use people's data.\n\nThe idea of a city built from the internet up sounds intriguing but, in the current climate, it is bound to raise questions about privacy.\n\nAs to the details of what will be in the city - it is very likely to be a testbed for driverless cars, another pet project of Alphabet's - but beyond that, nothing is yet written in stone.\n\nMr Doctoroff wants citizens to help decide what the city they live in looks like and his team needs to get on with this if it is to win back the trust of Toronto's inhabitants.\n\nA spokesperson for Waterfront Toronto said it did not want to make the preliminary deal public until all negotiations were finalised, and said it intends to release the next iteration of the deal soon.\n\nAs for privacy, Sidewalk Labs says it takes that very seriously, and is working with former federal privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier to try and set a global-standard for how smart-cities should treat users data.\n\nBut the specifics, including how data will be collected and where it will be stored, remain thin.\n\n\"There are a lot of questions we've got to work through over the month ahead, and we are very conscious of not wanting to short circuit the public consultation process and the expert consultation process we are working on,\" Micah Lasher, head of policy and communications at Sidewalk Labs told the BBC.",

Like many students his age, he devotes a couple of hours per day, and many more at weekends, to video games.\n\nBut he's not just playing them - he's making them. And making a lot of money doing it.\n\n\"In the 10 months that Jailbreak has been released, it has already yielded seven figure profits,\" Balfanz says of his cops-and-robbers adventure game released last year. A few weeks ago, it was played for the billionth time.\n\nBalfanz is just one of thousands of young gaming entrepreneurs in their teens or twenties making money in an industry that made $36 billion last year.\n\nIt's offering new ways to make a living that didn't exist 10 or even five years ago, even within the games industry.\n\nAnother 18-year-old student, Andrew Bereza, is the creator of Miner's Haven and Azure Mines, two games he made over the last two years for Roblox, a kids-focused platform that allows children to build their own games and publish them online - it's the same platform that houses Balfanz's Jailbreak.\n\nThere are new ways to make a living that didn't exist 10 or even five years ago, even within the games industry\n\n\"While I'm not in the annual millions like a couple of my colleagues have recently hit, I've been steadily earning six figures every year since I started,\" he says.\n\nHe is using his earnings to pay for university, where he is studying computer science.\n\nIf he didn't have a platform to distribute his games, \"I don't know how I ever would have been able to afford college or the ability to do full-time game development\", he says.\n\nMaking and selling your own games\n\nToday, thanks to online sales platforms like the App Store, Steam or Roblox, anyone with the right idea and some development nous can reach more than a billion people.\n\nBut while the technology and ecosystem to reach this vast customer base has only appeared in the last decade, the DIY mentality of young app developers is nothing new: it's actually not too different from wannabe rock stars starting bands in their garages in the 1970s, or aspiring directors filming home movies on a VHS camcorder in the 1980s.\n\nI've been steadily earning six figures every year since I started - Andrew Bereza\n\n\"With creative industries, that's always been the case, particularly in young people,\" says Roger Altizer, co-founder of the entertainment arts and engineering programme at the University of Utah. He says that young people have always come up with creative expressions and have tried to monetise them.\n\nWith video games specifically, Altizer points out that in the 1980s, young designers made their own video games, stored them on floppy disks and put them in plastic bags, sold them physically at stores, capturing a certain entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nToday? We have indie games like Flappy Bird that become worldwide sensations, achieving overnight success. However, there are now so many being published, it's becoming an ever-more crowded market.\n\nStill, the idea of possible success in this field fuels dreams.\n\nAnthony Tan is a high-school student in Australia whose surreal adventure game, Way to the Woods, is due out next year, and has already generated a lot of excitement among games journalists. \"You play as a deer and their fawn trying to find their way home in a sleepy, abandoned world,\" Tan says.\n\n\"I think I'd like to go to uni after my completing my current project,\" says 18-year-old Tan, who \"started off making crappy little Flash games on the side for fun in about Year 8 or 9.\"\n\nWhile not everyone is going to make millions off their own game, it still scratches an entrepreneurial itch, Tan says: \"Video games are fun for me because I get to dip my toes into all of those fields: creating, designing, modelling, sculpting, painting, engineering, composing.\"\n\n'Serious games' to promote a cause\n\nA lot of young people have used this democratisation of resources to be innovative in a particular way: promoting ideas to improve society. Games that touch on gender identity, cultural politics or mental health care.\n\nAs a concept, this isn't new, either. The World Food Programme released what it described as \"the world's first humanitarian video game\" nearly 13 years ago: called Food Force, it was released in seven languages and aimed to teach kids about world hunger.\n\nBut what is new is that young budding video game developers are doing this on their own, and even pursuing careers doing so at university.\n\n\"We have people coming to school to make serious games because they want to make games that make a difference,\" Altizer says.\n\nAltizer himself does this at the Therapeutic Games and Apps lab at the University of Utah, which focuses on creating games that help spinal cord injury patients do exercises that prevent pressure sores from wheelchair use, or games that give social workers VR tours of fictional homes to spot dangers for children inside.\n\nWe have people coming to school to make serious games because they want to make games that make a difference - Roger Altizer\n\nThe internet doesn't just allow today's teens and young adults to make their own games to spread a message, though: a charismatic few are using it to make a living as performers.\n\nStreaming online in front of millions\n\nA relatively new way of making money is by playing video games - and getting strangers on the internet to watch you do it.\n\n\"Let's Play\" videos, in which an online personality films themselves playing a video game as they add colour commentary for viewers, is a trend that grew so popular, it eventually led to a new platform, Twitch.tv - an entire site devoted to streaming videos of other people playing video games. It is now one of the most popular websites on the internet globally, and was bought by Amazon in 2014 for nearly $1 billion.\n\nBeing a streamer on a place like Twitch requires entrepreneurial skills, scrappiness and a tolerance for risk.\n\nElspeth Eastman, a Twitch streamer with 122,000 YouTube subscribers, said that after university she spent $2,000 on a new computer to try her hand at streaming. Today, she says she makes a living doing what she loves full-time.\n\n\"Right now, I'm sitting in a room that's 90% wires and computers,\" Eastman says over the phone from her filming studio. \"It's absolutely your own business. You have to do everything at once: you're the lights guy, and you're also the person on stage.\"\n\nEventually, it can lead to advertising partnerships, or paid subscriptions, with a cut of the funds going to the streamers. But for a lot of newer streamers, it's asking for donations from subscribers. It takes a while to get enough viewers to be able to monetise.\n\n\"This patronage model where people would sponsor artists is very common,\" Altizer says.\n\nEastman and another streamer, who goes by Valkyrae and has had a full-time job streaming for three years, point to the importance of networking and self-promoting yourself on social media, or filming videos with streamers who have more subscribers than you.\n\nIt's absolutely your own business - Elspeth Eastman\n\nAnd like DIY app development, the community-centred nature of streaming can also drive a greater good. Valkyrae mentions a charity stream that she participated in last Christmas that raised $8,700 in six hours for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\n\"One of my subscribers had cancer and he needed surgery,\" she says. \"And we raised enough money for his surgery, which was like $8,000. You can help people financially - I'm helping my mum financially because of all this extra income I'm getting.\"\n\nProfessional video game players\n\nBut perhaps the most ambitious - and lucrative - avenue to success that didn't exist in the mainstream a decade ago is the rise of the professional video game player. Many of these people are in their 20s or younger.\n\nSumail Hassan is the youngest gamer to win $1 million in eSports winnings. He's made more than $2.5 million playing Dota, an online multiplayer game. He calls it a full-time job.\n\n\"ESports have only gotten bigger since my career started in 2015,\" Hassan says. He's 19 now but has been gaming since he was seven. \"I knew video games were the thing I was best at and so went pro.\"\n\nAltizer says that the University of Utah offers eSports scholarships, and that the university has a varsity eSports programme that pits players against each other in games like League of Legends and Overwatch.\n\nLike professional athletes, the chances of becoming a world-renowned eSports player are very slim. \"It might not be a path to fame and riches of winning the international tournament. That's the same thing as going to school and playing lacrosse - there aren't many people making millions of dollars as lacrosse players,\" Altizer says.\n\nI knew video games were the thing I was best at and so went pro - Sumail Hassan\n\nHassan says he's going to stay focused on his gaming career for now, but advises others looking to follow in his footsteps to stay in school and get an education. (This is a sentiment echoed by streamers Eastman and Valkyrae.)\n\n\"Don't bet on making a living playing games,\" Hassan says.\n\nWhether it's eSports, streaming or developing indie video games out of your bedroom, the games industry has evolved rapidly over the last couple of decades, and many of these new career paths were born alongside the growth of the internet.\n\nBeing successful here calls upon lots of skills beyond computer programming: having a bubbly on-air personality, marketing yourself on social media and more.\n\nBut most won't end up in a big studio making the next Call of Duty, or become the next champion World of Warcraft player, or a Twitch streamer with millions of followers. And that's not a bad thing, because young people today have more opportunities to enter the industry.\n\nAltizer likens it to music: \"There are probably more people working in the industry supporting music rather than making money as musicians,\" he says. \"It's easier to get a job at the music store tuning guitars than opening for a band on stage.\"\n\n--\n\nBryan Lufkin is BBC Capital's features writer.

                "body": "UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's likening of Russia's World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics has been branded \"totally irresponsible\" by the Russian ambassador in London.\n\nAlexander Yakovenko said \"nobody had the right\" to compare Russia - which lost 25 million lives in World War Two - with Nazi Germany.\n\nHe said it was an insult to British war veterans from the Arctic convoys.\n\nMr Johnson told the BBC: \"I stick by, completely, what I said.\"\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said the material used in the attack had been identified as being part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia, known as Novichok.\n\nShe will later tell an EU summit the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia shows Moscow has no respect for international law.\n\nThe pair remain in a critical condition in hospital after they were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March.\n\nRussia says the UK had \"no proof\" it carried out the attack.\n\nMr Johnson made his initial comment at a Foreign Affairs Select Committee meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe foreign secretary agreed with the comparison made by Labour MP Ian Austin, adding: \"Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right.\n\n\"I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin glorying in this sporting event.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Russian Embassy in London on Thursday Mr Yakovenko said Moscow considered the foreign secretary's comments \"unacceptable and totally irresponsible\".\n\n\"The British government is free to make a decision about its participation in the World Cup,\" he said.\n\n\"But nobody has the right to insult the Russian people - who defeated Nazism and lost most than 25 million people - by comparing our country to Nazi Germany.\n\n\"That goes beyond common sense. And we do not think British war veterans - including those of the Arctic convoys [which shipped four million tonnes of armaments and essential supplies to the Soviet Union during World War Two] - would share this opinion.\"\n\nThe Soviet Union's war dead included Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and citizens of other non-Russian Federation countries.\n\nSpeaking later, on a visit to Derby, Mr Johnson said he stuck by what he said \"completely\".\n\nHe said: \"We don't want to escalate this any further. What we want is some way in which they will at least accept that the Russian state must have had some role in this.\n\n\"We want to see the safety of UK people going to the World Cup, that's the most important thing, [but] I think that the idea of Vladimir Putin glorying in a great sporting occasion and receiving the adulation of international figures is, as I said, emetic.\n\n\"So I stick by completely what I said.\"\n\nMr Yakovenko's response came as he gave a statement on Russia's latest position regarding the Salisbury attack.\n\nHe criticised the British government for refusing to share information and provide the Russian government with a sample of the nerve agent.\n\nHe said Mrs May had \"built the official position on assumptions\", adding: \"Britain has, without any evidence, blamed Russia of poisoning of three people [the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey who was part of the initial response to the incident] and continues to refuse to cooperate.\n\n\"We cannot accept that.\"\n\nBut Mrs May will stick with her conclusion and tell EU heads of state that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat does not respect borders and places all European nations at risk.",

It is unlikely that US president Donald Trump will be in attendance. When asked whether he had received an invite for the wedding, Mr Trump said \"not that I know of\".\n\nThe dress code listed on the royal invitation requests a \"morning suit or lounge suit\" for men, and a \"day dress with hat\" for women.\n\nThat means shirts, suits and ties with the possibility of top hats and waist coats for men. Meanwhile women will be expected to opt for knee length dresses, with hat choices similar to those found at Royal Ascot.\n\nThe details of Ms Markle's wedding dress remains a mystery.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will marry the prince and Ms Markle.\n\nThe Rt Rev David Conner, dean of Windsor, will conduct the service at St George's Chapel.\n\nFollowing the marriage service, a carriage procession will travel along a route including Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road, Long Walk and back to Windsor Castle.\n\nAll 600 guests will attend a lunchtime reception at St George's Hall, which is being given by Her Majesty The Queen.\n\nMs Markle is reportedly planning to break with the tradition for royal brides by making a speech.\n\nThen, later in the evening the newlyweds will celebrate with 200 guests at a private reception less than mile from Windsor Castle at Frogmore House, hosted by Prince Charles.\n\nThe 17th-century country house and gardens - a former home to numerous royals throughout history - was the back drop for pair's engagement photos.\n\nThe Royal Family will pay for the wedding, including the service, music, flowers and reception.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen an organic lemon and elderflower cake for their big day.\n\nIn keeping with transatlantic nature of the occasion, the couple have enlisted Californian pastry chef and food writer Claire Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in east London, to bake the cake.\n\nA statement from Kensington Palace said Ms Markle and Prince Harry wanted \"members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too\".\n\nPubs and bars across England and Wales will be allowed to stay open later than usual - serving until 1am on the morning of the wedding day, and again after the couple are married.\n\nYou may not be able to get your hands on the official wedding favours, but that needn't stop people from getting a souvenir to remember the day - especially if you like china.\n\nThe official range of commemorative fine bone china is by the Royal Collection Trust and includes mugs, a tankard and a plate.\n\nMeanwhile, Stoke-on-Trent pottery firm Halcyon Days is manufacturing a range of mugs, plates and teapots.\n\nThe firm is one of only 14 to hold royal warrants, a certificate for providing goods and services to the royal households.",

Grant came second, leaving Gyllenhaal last.\n\nThe alternative to answering the question was eating a plate of turkey testicles, so Barrymore didn't hesitate to - as she described it - sell Gyllenhaal down the river.\n\nThat's despite Corden predicting, incorrectly, before posing the question: \"You're never going to answer this.\"\n\nReferring to Gyllenhaal, she said: \"I don't even care if he hates me,\" explaining she would be sick if she had to eat the food. \"I literally am doing this because I won't make it.\"",

The guns must also be registered and their use is limited to certain activities, like target practice.\n\nThe previous Conservative government ensured Cabinet had the ability to overrule the RCMP after the force made some controversial classification decisions.\n\nMr Giltaca said verifying someone has a valid license when a firearm is transferred between owners \"is reasonable\".\n\nGun control advocates raised concerns the new bill does not go far enough in addressing all aspects of gun violence in Canada.",

                "body": "Confused by all the Brexit jargon in the news? Here's a glossary to demystify commonly used EU-related terms.\n\nAcquis communautaire: A French phrase meaning the entire body of European Union law. Countries have to incorporate it into their own law before joining the European Union.\n\nAlignment: Keeping rules and regulations in the UK in line with those in the European Union after Brexit, as in \"regulatory alignment\".\n\nArticle 50: The European Union's exit clause. It is part of the Lisbon Treaty and by invoking it or triggering it a country formally and legally signals it is leaving the European Union.\n\nBrexit: Short for Britain exiting the European Union.\n\nBrexit bus: Refers to a bus hired by the Leave campaign in the run-up to the European Union referendum. On its side was a slogan that became one of the most controversial of the campaign and was credited by some with swinging the result: \"We send the EU ?350m a week. Let's fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave.\"\n\nBrexit day: 29 March 2019: the day when the UK is due to leave the European Union.\n\nBrexiteers: Short for those who are in favour of Brexit. See also Brexiters.\n\nBrexiters: Short for those who are in favour of Brexit. See also Brexiteers.\n\nBrexodus: A combination of the words \"Brexit\" and \"exodus\" to mean the departure of people or companies from the UK because of Brexit. Whether this has happened, or will happen, is contested.\n\nCake and eat it: A phrase used to mean that Britain is trying to retain all the benefits of European Union membership without the obligations, including payments to the EU budget, accepting jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and accepting the free of movement of people. European negotiators have frequently used \"cake and eat it\" to characterise Britain's approach. See also \"cherry picking\".\n\nCanada model: Refers to a free-trade agreement between the EU and Canada which removes lots of barriers to trade between the two, but not as many as the Norway model - which involves signing up to more EU rules, contributing to the EU budget and allowing the free movement of people.\n\nCherry picking: A phrase used to mean the UK is trying to choose which European Union arrangements it wants to stay associated with and which it wants to fully opt out of. Similar to \"cake and eat it\".\n\nCliff edge: The prospect of the UK crashing out of the European Union with no deal at all. That would mean having no agreement on the terms of Britain's withdrawal or future trade relations, and could lead to serious disruption to businesses and individuals in Britain and across the EU.\n\nCommon Agricultural Policy: The EU policy designed to provide financial support to farmers through a system of payments. It was created to make sure that farmers in the EU produced enough food and also had a fair standard of living. Critics say it is wasteful and favours rich landowners and big agri-businesses.\n\nCouncil of Ministers: A European Union body that represents member states' national governments. It is made up of government ministers from all member states who meet regularly. Together with the European Parliament, the council has the power to make EU laws and decide the budget.\n\nCustoms union: A trade agreement under which two or more countries decide not to have taxes on imports (tariffs) of goods from countries in the union. Countries also decide to set a common tariff on goods entering from outside the union. The EU customs union includes EU member states and some small non-EU members and forbids members from negotiating trade agreements separately from the EU.\n\nDExEU: The Department for Exiting the European Union: the name of the new UK government department responsible for managing the UK's departure from the EU.\n\nDivergence: Allowing rules and regulations to differ between the European Union and the UK after Brexit.\n\nDivorce bill: The money the UK has in principle agreed to pay the European Union as part of the deal on Britain's departure. It includes the UK's share of the EU's unpaid bills, contributions to the EU budget for 2019 and 2020, pensions for EU officials and a long list of smaller items. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated the cost of the financial settlement at ?37 billion.\n\nEU: European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave.\n\nEU referendum: A national vote held on 23 June 2016 to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. It was decided on a simple majority and the Leave campaign won by 52% to 48%.\n\nEU Withdrawal Bill: Legislation passing through the UK Parliament that will repeal the European Communities Act, which took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community. It will also convert almost all EU law into UK law. Parliament will then be able to decide which EU laws it wants to keep and which it wants to get rid of. This bill is also sometimes known as the repeal bill.\n\nEuropean Commission: The European Union's civil service. The European Commission has a key role in initiating EU legislation.\n\nEuropean Council: A body of the European Union that makes its most important strategic decisions. Its members are heads of state or government of the 28 EU countries, the European Council president and the president of the European Commission.\n\nEuropean Court of Justice (ECJ): The ECJ is the EU's highest legal authority and rules on disputes over European Union treaties and other EU laws. Its decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.\n\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA): An area covering the 28 European Union countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which enables those three countries to be part of the EU's single market. They abide by the rules of the EU single market and its freedom of movement of people, goods, services and money.\n\nEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA): An organisation made up of four countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. They are allowed to trade freely with the single market in return for accepting its rules. They're not in the EU customs union and can negotiate trade deals with third-party countries such as China.\n\nEuropean Parliament: The directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union. It has 751 members and is elected by citizens in all 28 European Union member states.\n\nEurosceptic: An opponent of European Union integration, believing that it threatens the power of individual countries to determine their own destiny. Eurosceptics range from those who want far-reaching reform of the EU to those who reject the EU totally.\n\nEuroscepticism: The belief that European Union integration threatens the power of individual countries to determine their own destiny. Eurosceptics range from those who want far-reaching reform of the EU to those who reject the EU totally.\n\nFour freedoms: The free movement of goods, capital, services and people in the EU's single market.\n\nFree-trade agreement: An agreement between countries to reduce trade barriers, including import or export taxes (tariffs) and import quotas, in order to increase trade in goods and services.\n\nFreedom of movement: One of the founding principles of the European Union. It means that citizens of EU member states and their families can live and work in any other member state. It is a major factor in public debate about Britain's capacity to control immigration.\n\nFrictionless trade: Trying to do business between the UK and the European Union with the minimum of tariffs, quotas, customs checks and other obstructions.\n\nGlobalisation: The process by which the world is becoming increasingly interconnected as a result of hugely increased trade, travel and other forms of interaction.\n\nHard border: A border controlled and protected by customs officials, police, or military personnel.\n\nHard Brexit: This phrase is often used by critics of Brexit who think it will harm the UK economy. A hard Brexit would be one where few of the existing ties between the UK and the EU were retained leading to more disruption than a Soft Brexit.\n\nHenry VIII powers: Legal provisions for ministers to decide on changes to existing UK law without the normal process of scrutiny in Parliament. The term is named after King Henry VIII's preference for creating laws by royal proclamation rather than through Parliament.\n\nIrish border: The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. After Brexit, it will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMandate: The authority to carry out policy. In relation to Brexit it often refers to the referendum result giving a mandate to the government to take Britain out of the European Union.\n\nMEP: Member of the European Parliament.\n\nNorway model: An arrangement in which the UK would have to allow freedom of movement of people, make a contribution to the EU budget - smaller than it currently makes - and abide by the rulings of the European Court of Justice, in exchange for remaining in the single market.\n\nPassporting: The arrangement under which British companies and foreign companies with bases in the UK are allowed to sell financial services across the European Union with no regulatory barriers.\n\nRemoaners: A derogatory term meaning a person who complains about Britain leaving European Union and/or the outcome of the Brexit referendum.\n\nReste ?liquider: A French accounting term meaning outstanding bills. In the context of Brexit it refers to projects the EU has agreed to support financially, but has yet to pay for.\n\nSchengen area: The 26 European states that have abolished passport controls at their mutual borders. Some European Union member states, including the UK, are not in the Schengen area. Some countries that are not members of the European Union are in the Schengen area.\n\nSettled status: A legal status that will give European Union citizens and their families the right to stay in the UK and access benefits and public services after Brexit.\n\nSingle market: The way the European Union is treated as one territory with a free market in goods, money, services and people. The single market embraces 500 million consumers and includes EU member states and four other countries that have secured access but retain some optouts.\n\nSoft Brexit: Leaving the European Union but staying as closely aligned to the EU as possible. It could keep the UK in the single market or the customs union or both. It could involve British compromises on free movement of people, allowing European Union citizens rights to settle in the UK with access to public services and benefits.\n\nTariff: A tax or duty to be paid on goods being imported or, very occasionally, exported.\n\nTariff-free trade: Trade without any taxes or duties to pay when goods are imported or exported.\n\nTransition: The period between the UK leaving the European Union and the start of new arrangements for future trade. The UK calls it an \"implementation phase\".\n\nTreaty: A formally concluded and ratified agreement between states, either individually or collectively.\n\nTTIP: Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership: a proposed trade agreement between the European Union and the United States. The deal was put on hold by the US shortly after the election of Donald Trump as US President.\n\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO): A global organisation dealing with the rules of trade between states. If the UK were to leave the European Union with no new trading relationship agreed, UK trade with European Union member states would have to abide by WTO rules, significantly increasing the costs to business.",

                "body": "The WhatsApp group is both a bane and boon to modern working life. Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office is no exception. And in a recent exchange between senior officials at King Charles Street a simple phrase expressed the collective frustration of many: \"(Expletive) elephants!\"\n\nThis was a reference to the increasing occupation of the foreign secretary with the welfare of animals. A brief perusal of Boris Johnson's Twitter feed confirms this. He is much concerned with the trafficking of pangolins.\n\nWhile many denizens of the Foreign Office are no doubt deeply concerned with the continuing survival of these particular fauna, there are others who would also prefer their boss to concentrate a little more closely on perhaps more strategic elements of British foreign policy.\n\nThe focus of their frustration is the government's strategy entitled \"Global Britain\". The aim of this policy is to show that the UK will remain internationally engaged after Brexit. It argues that Britain has a unique blend of assets that gives it a special place in the world. These include hard power - its membership of Nato and its status as one of Europe's major military and intelligence powers; soft power - its language, universities, BBC World Service and so on, its diplomatic clout as a close ally of the US and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and its values as a liberal standard-bearer for human rights and the rule of law.\n\nThat, at least, is the theory behind Global Britain. But in practice it is much maligned as a slogan in pursuit of a strategy. The Foreign Affairs Committee recently issued a report saying Global Britain risks being seen as a \"superficial branding exercise\" unless ministers actually set out what it means in practice. Others believe it is a post facto justification for Brexit, an attempt to convince other countries that the UK is not turning in on itself. Other critics go even further and see Global Britain as a post-imperial fantasy by nostalgic Brexiteers.\n\nBut here is a question - has the confrontation with Russia over the Salisbury nerve agent attack finally given the Foreign Office an issue through which Global Britain can come of age? Here is a crisis where the UK can use its assets to unite allies against Russia, to use the incident as a catalyst to unlock wider diplomatic action against Moscow that has been long coming. Here is an issue where the UK can show some leadership and persuade European allies that while it may be leaving the EU, it is by no means leaving the wider European defence and security alliance.\n\nOne can argue that this strategy has borne some fruit. Theresa May has succeeded in uniting her European allies behind Britain's position on Russia. They have agreed formally that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack, saying there was \"no plausible alternative explanation\". The EU has taken the extraordinary step of recalling its ambassador from Moscow.\n\nTo get 27 other EU member states to sign up to this language is a significant diplomatic success for the UK. One has to remember that there are many countries in the EU that are economically and politically far closer to Moscow than the UK. It is frankly surprising that countries like Greece, Italy and Hungary are prepared to put their names to a statement that is so critical of Russia. Mrs May clearly shared enough intelligence about the attack to ensure that an alliance of Berlin, Paris, the Baltic and Eastern European states would persuade the rest of the EU to fall in line.\n\nAnd the diplomatic work behind the scenes is also showing results. UK officials have quite sensibly not been asking for things they know the EU could not agree. For example, the UK has not sought tougher EU sanctions against Moscow. They know this would not be agreed and would be used by Russia to illustrate EU division.\n\nInstead, the UK has been playing a longer game, looking for allies to step up pressure on Russia unilaterally, arguing that Salisbury is just the latest example of a pattern of aggressive behaviour that affects them all. The UK is saying it will support other countries if they too decide to disrupt Russia's intelligence networks by expelling some spies masquerading as diplomats.\n\nThe UK is urging its allies to make sure that Russia feels it is under pressure in every international forum, constantly being asked questions, constantly being put on the back foot. One official told me that by the time of the Nato summit in July, the UK wants Russia to have pulled in its horns and accepted that it over-reached itself in Salisbury.\n\nThis, of course, is the rosy scenario. Not all of Britain's diplomacy has been so deft. The decision by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to tell Russia to \"shut up and go away\" prompted MPs to nickname him the Joe Dolce of British politics (after the 1980s one-hit wonder who topped the charts with the song, Shaddap You Face).\n\nThe decision by the foreign secretary to compare Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler provoked equal brickbats from colleagues, not least because it broke one of the first rules of British politics - never, ever make comparisons with the Nazis. These missteps mattered because they risked turning the confrontation with Russia into a bilateral shouting match between the UK and Moscow. The government's clear intention throughout the crisis has been to ensure that the pressure on Russia remains international.\n\nAnd there clearly remains a limit beyond which European unity will not survive. It is one thing to unite around a condemnatory statement, it is quite another to agree collective action. David Cameron, with some foresight, took steps to ensure the UK had greater energy independence and security. Other EU countries are far more dependent on the pipelines bringing gas from the eastern steppes and will be reluctant to provoke the Russian bear too much. Will these countries really be ready to punish Russia where it hurts by making it harder for Moscow's elite to make and protect its money overseas?\n\nBut right now, UK officials believe Russia finds itself more isolated than it had anticipated and that, in part, is due to British diplomatic and political leadership. Some believe that Global Britain has a bit more flesh on its bones. They argue that Russia and Brexit have, counter-intuitively, led to Britain leaning into European allies more than before. They cite the deepening European diplomatic attempts to protect the Iran nuclear deal from Donald Trump's scepticism.\n\nOthers are more sceptical, saying the UK still has to decide its approach to a US that is increasingly unpredictable, to a resurgent and more confident China, and to a Middle East where confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran is oft mooted. It still has to work out what role a post-Brexit UK can play in a world - a role that is realistic and pragmatic, not based on false grandeur but a practical use of what diplomatic assets the UK has.\n\nThe crisis with Russia may not have turned Global Britain into reality, but it has certainly given diplomats something to work on.",

                "body": "Are you happy? How do you think you will feel a month or two from now?\n\nPredicting whether we will be happy or not in the future is something that the vast majority of us would like to understand better. After all, if we could make changes today that we knew would make us happier tomorrow, we would act.\n\nFor a lot of people, achieving happiness is about getting rid of the negative parts of life: if only we could be free from stress, boredom, illness, loneliness or financial hardship, then we'd be more content and more satisfied with our lot.\n\nBut what if there was more to it than that? Is happiness just the absence of problems, or is it something more? \"We don't know if people are happy because they got rid of all the negative factors in their life or whether they need to do something more positive and active to build happiness,\" says Peter Kinderman, professor of psychology at the University of Liverpool in the UK.\n\nThat's why Kinderman is collaborating with BBC Tomorrow's World to explore these issues, in an online experiment called the Secrets of Happiness. He's specifically interested in whether our 'style of thinking' can predict future mental wellbeing - and you can help inform the research by completing a survey about yourself below.\n\nKinderman's research focuses on how we react to difficult events and the effect on our mental health. The survey asks a series of questions about your experiences and feelings in the present, and again in six weeks' time. Kinderman hopes the experiment will test his hypothesis: how we make sense of the world now affects how we will feel in the future. The hope is to gain insights that will help people adjust their thinking style and have a better chance at happiness.\n\nKinderman, who is also a consultant psychologist in the UK National Health Service, believes that dwelling on problems and pessimism are threats to our mental health. If the data he collects has predictive power, then red flags could be raised for someone who has a negative way of interpreting events - particular for those at risk of mental illness.\n\nBetter understanding\n\nThe good news is that as with other health problems, there are treatments available to change our thinking styles. Evidence-based methods like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can help us develop more helpful ways of responding to circumstances and to decrease rumination, or overthinking.\n\n\"I think the secret of happiness is to understand our complex web of emotions, both the positive and negative, and for each of us to come up with a road map to address the factors that cause negativity and to enhance the factors that lead to happiness,\" he says.",

                "body": "Listen carefully. The strange sound of rushing air you can hear in the background, as Britain continues its slow march towards Brexit, is a deep collective sigh of relief.\n\nMinisters, officials and business leaders - the latter group puffing out their cheeks more than anyone - wanted, needed, to see their wish of a Brexit transition period fulfilled.\n\nSo one obstacle cleared, or more accurately, skipped around.\n\nThe danger that's kept much of business and many MPs at Westminster awake at night, fear of the UK tumbling off a cliff edge into its post-Brexit future next March, has receded. Not disappeared. Receded.\n\nNow Theresa May and the UK negotiating team can focus on the task ahead. Urgently.\n\nA sigh of relief is time consuming, and there's no time or breath to spare.\n\nTeam-UK will need plenty of both as it confronts the next stage of the process; contemplates wholly unresolved issues like the Irish border - in truth barely even addressed in negotiations - and the talks about talks which have yet to begin on the future trading relationship.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that the issue of the Irish border, or the conflict to come over the shape of a future trade deal, could yet blow the Brexit plan into fragments, and see the prime minister and perhaps even her government disappear into the resulting political crater.\n\nBrexiteer ministers and MPs are having none of it.\n\nThey sound optimistic because they are. And, who knows? It could all work out in the end.\n\nAmong business leaders, especially in the City, there is mild surprise that firms have defied earlier apocalyptic predictions.\n\nEven former Remain-supporting MPs have noted a certain cautious confidence that the infrastructure of the Square Mile - the concentration of legal and technical expertise, to say nothing of schools, homes and the rather appealing lifestyle available in London (to those who can afford it) might just see the City through.\n\nAnd, who knows? EU negotiators might just give a little on the mutual recognition of rules and standards companies crave.\n\nThat's the optimistic view. Remember, Brussels has already dangled the thought there could be no tariffs imposed on exports of goods. It's a start.\n\nOthers remain deeply worried. The head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, told me a trade deal comparable to the EU's agreement with Canada would be disastrous.\n\nServices denied access, exporters forced to deal with costly and wearying paperwork and checks on the rules of origin of goods and the like.\n\nBut maybe, somehow, Theresa May may yet pass on the legacy of a politically arduous but complete Brexit.\n\nThose trade discussions will be hazardous. The prime minister has conceded Britain cannot expect to win everything it wants by way of market access, has even conceding access to markets here and in Europe will be diminished.\n\nDissident Tory MPs insist their determination to resist what they would see as a poor deal has grown.\n\nMore ominously for the government, they are also convinced their numbers have grown to the point they could defeat Theresa May by joining with Jeremy Corbyn's repositioned Labour Party in the coming vote on whether the government should seek to remain inside the EU customs union.\n\nIf that vote - possibly some time after 3 May's English local elections - is lost, ministers can be expected to shrug it off.\n\nThe dissidents fully expect the government to try.\n\nBut a defeat would also be a dangerous marker ahead of the later promised \"meaningful vote\" on the outline of a trade deal - if one exists - in the Autumn.\n\nLose that vote, and the prime minister's authority will suffer a huge and perhaps mortal blow.\n\nCould she survive?\n\nCertainly government whips would use the prospect of a prime ministerial defenestration - and even the spectre of Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street - to pile pressure on potential rebels.\n\nAs for the Irish border issue, the calculation among Brexiteers and the MPs of the Democratic Unionist Party (who were kept in close and constant touch with the government's thinking ahead of the March EU summit) is that if and when it comes to the crunch, Dublin will blink first.\n\nBritain has not accepted the \"backstop\" option in the EU withdrawal text that says Northern Ireland will remain in a customs union if all other ideas for avoiding a hard border with the Republic fail.\n\nSome still undefined backstop, yes, just not that one.\n\nUK negotiators will now take their published plan to enforce rules away from the border to Brussels.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis would also like to see most Irish traders exempted from border controls altogether.\n\nAn alternative is for the UK to enforce the EU's external border, and allow those trading with the UK on lower tariffs, or none at all, to reclaim duties paid.\n\nOverall, the guiding ambition remains a frictionless trade deal with the EU that renders border controls redundant.\n\nSo far, Brussels has sounded cool on all of it. Something has to give.\n\nAnd with the DUP adamant they will never, ever, live with a settlement that separates out Northern Ireland, and with Tory colleagues equally adamant that the UK must leave the customs union and the single market, it cannot be the prime minister.\n\nThis obstacle too may yet conceivably send the Brexit plan up in smoke. Another mushroom cloud. Another crater.\n\nIn the meantime, those most sceptical about the value of Brexit believe the government should give up any idea of being willing to walk away from negotiations with no deal.\n\nDissidents insist Parliament would never allow that in any case.\n\nMinisters such as David Davis insist they must be prepared for any eventuality, and whatever happens in negotiations, or even in Parliament, Brexit will happen.\n\nThere is, in the end, more at stake here than Mrs May's future or that of her administration.\n\nThere is also no shortage of undeclared potential candidates quietly dreaming of taking over her job.\n\nSometimes, actually quite often, you have to wonder why?",

                "body": "A gunman is believed to have killed at least two people during a hostage-taking at a supermarket in Tr?es, southern France.\n\nAn operation involving elite police is continuing at the Super U shop, where others were wounded.\n\nReports say the gunman, who remains in the supermarket, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.\n\nEarlier, a policeman was shot and wounded while jogging with colleagues in Carcassonne, a 15-minute drive away.\n\nHe was shot in the shoulder by the same suspect involved in the supermarket hostage-taking but is not critically injured, Yves Lefebvre, secretary-general of the SGP Police-FO union told the Associated Press.\n\nTr?es Mayor Eric Menassi told BFM TV that the gunman was now alone in the shop with one police officer, after other hostages were freed.\n\nThe suspect is said to be heavily armed and asking for the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 Paris attacks, which killed 130 people.\n\nReports say the suspect is known to French intelligence services and that his mother is at the scene.\n\nA security source told French news agency AFP that most employees and customers at the supermarket \"managed to flee\".\n\nPrime Minister ?ouard Philippe said the situation was \"serious\" and that all signs pointed towards a \"terrorist act\".\n\nHundreds of police officers have been deployed to the area, and the vicinity has been cordoned off.\n\nCounter-terrorism prosecutors are leading the investigation but few details have been provided.\n\nFrance has been hit with several deadly jihadist attacks since 2015 and has been on high alert since. A state of emergency put in place after the 2015 attacks in Paris was lifted in October.\n\nIn February, Salah Abdeslam went on trial in Belgium over a shootout in Brussels that led to his capture months after the Paris attacks. He is not expected to go on trial in France until 2020 at the earliest.\n\nAre you in the area? Have you witnessed what has happened?

                "title": "What is a trade war and why should I worry?",
                "body": "Stock markets are tumbling and economists are edgy as talk of a trade war dominates the news.\n\nChina is threatening to hit back against planned US tariffs, saying it is \"absolutely not afraid\" of the consequences.\n\nThis puts the world's two largest economies at each other's throats.\n\nBut what is a trade war? How does protectionism work? And how will it all affect you?\n\nIt's what it sounds like - a trade war is when countries try to attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas.\n\nOne country will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation.\n\nThis can hurt other nations' economies and lead to rising political tensions between them.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reckons trade wars are \"good\" and easy. He's not afraid to raise tariffs.\n\nIt's a tax on a product made abroad.\n\nIn theory, taxing items coming into the country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive.\n\nThe intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting your country's economy.\n\nThe president is planning tariffs on $60bn worth of Chinese goods, in part because of alleged Chinese theft of intellectual property - which means design and product ideas.\n\nThe White House said it has a list of more than 1,000 products that could be targeted by tariffs of 25%.\n\nCompanies will get a chance to comment before they are put into effect.\n\nMr Trump wants to cut the trade deficit with China - a country he has accused of unfair trade practices since before he become president.\n\nMr Trump made a big point on the campaign trail about cutting the country's trade deficits.\n\nHe's convinced it hurts US manufacturing, and has said time and time again on the stump and on Twitter that the US must do more to tackle them.\n\nMr Trump may also be trying to appeal to voters in manufacturing states - including in key bellwether states, like Ohio.\n\nIt's a term meaning the difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country.\n\nAnd the US has a massive trade deficit with China.\n\nLast year, it stood at about $375bn. Mr Trump's not happy about that.\n\nHe wants to cut back this trade deficit, and he intends to use tariffs to do it.\n\nBut while the president hates them, trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nMany wealthier countries have in recent decades shifted from manufacturing economies to service economies.\n\nThe US exported $242.7bn worth of services in 2017, in areas like banking, travel and tourism.\n\nServices account for 90% of the US economy. China, in contrast, doesn't export nearly as many services as it does manufactured goods.\n\nSo the president's obsession with trade deficits is not always popular, with critics damning the administration's moves as protectionism.\n\nProtectionism is trying to use tariffs to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition.\n\nTake Mr Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs.\n\nAt the start of March, before his latest moves against China, the president announced a 25% tariff on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminium.\n\nThe Trump administration claims the US relies too much on other countries for its metals, and that it couldn't make enough weapons or vehicles using its own industry if a war broke out.\n\nCritics point out the US gets most of its steel from Canada and the EU - staunch US allies.\n\nIn theory, taxing foreign steel and aluminium will mean US companies will buy local steel instead.\n\nThe thinking is that will boost the US steel and aluminium industries, as more companies will want to buy their goods.\n\nSteel and aluminium prices will go up in the US because there will be less of these goods coming in from abroad - so the greater demand for local steel will push up the price, lifting profits for steel makers.\n\nSort of.\n\nUS steel makers could get a boost - demand will drive new hires and bigger profits.\n\nBut the US companies that need raw materials, like car and aeroplane makers, will see their costs rise.\n\nThat means they might have to put up the prices on their finished products. That would hurt consumers.\n\nSo car prices could go up in the US. As could prices for gadgets, plane tickets and even beer - the price of making a can could rise.\n\nThey could affect people around the world - especially since China is threatening to retaliate.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy is planning to tax US agricultural and industrial products, from soybeans, pork and cotton to aeroplanes, cars and steel pipes.\n\nIn theory, China could also tax US tech companies like Apple. That would hit the tech giant, and it could be forced to raise its prices to compensate.\n\nWhile the EU is exempt from the new steel tariffs, as are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, a global trade war could hurt consumers around the world by making it harder for all companies to operate, forcing them to push higher prices onto their customers.\n\nDepends who you ask.\n\nFree trade is the opposite of protectionism - it means as few tariffs as possible, giving people the freedom to buy cheaper or better-made products from anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is great for companies trying to cut costs, and that's helped drive prices down and boost the world economy.\n\nCars, smart phones, food, flowers - free trade has brought affordable products from around the world to your home.\n\nBut at the same time, that means companies are less likely to buy local products. Why buy domestic when you can get more, cheaper, from a different country?\n\nThis means the loss of jobs in wealthier countries, and uneven growth - while free trade has made some people richer, it's made others poorer.\n\nNo idea.\n\nHistorians have pointed out that tariffs often lead to higher costs for the consumer, while economists across the board are against the plans.\n\nThe Republican Party is also overwhelmingly against Mr Trump on tariffs - they're big supporters of free trade.\n\nMr Trump's decision to take on China could lead to adverse effects for consumers in the US and in China, but also worldwide.\n\nAn economic showdown between the world's biggest economies doesn't look good for anyone.",

                "title": "The DIY makers who build their own watches",
                "body": "\"It probably started on Reddit,\" recalls Matthew Wright, an engineer from Brisbane, Australia. Online, he stumbled on a couple of posts from people who had made their own watches. He'd never even thought about doing something like that, but now he wanted to have a go too.\n\nHe started reading forums, researching tools and materials, and checking out where parts could be acquired, such as cases, dials, hands, strap and movement. \"It becomes like a big jigsaw puzzle, you try to work out what pieces will fit together,\" he says.\n\nBefore long, he had made his own watch to wear on his wedding day - a black dial in a stainless steel case, with tan strap. And then, he made four more in a similar style to give to his groomsmen.\n\n\"They still wear the watches on a regular basis - it's quite a nice feeling when I see them wearing it,\" he says.\n\nThanks in part to the availability of information over the web, many people just as curious as Wright have embarked on their own home-made watch projects. And some have even launched businesses as a result. But how easy is it to get started?\n\nA quick hit on Google will bring up a wave of results that can kick things off for enthusiasts. There's the Reddit Watch forum, the TimeZone Watch School, which offers courses via the web for a price, discussions on the WatchUSeek forum, and hundreds of YouTube videos aimed at makers.\n\nPeople can buy kits for assembling watches or individual parts online with relative ease, too. This is the exact rabbit-hole that Wright fell down when he started researching.\n\n\"You see other people who've made little changes to watches, they've changed dials or whatever, and the next thing, I stumbled across websites where you can buy the cases completely empty,\" he recalls.\n\nPeople like Wright, who have a bit of experience with making their own bits of tech, will already have some of the necessary tools and know-how to get going, of course. One such person is Mike Hamende. By day, Hamende is a nuclear power plant operator in Illinois. By night, he makes things - from drones to robots to toys and his own circuit boards.\n\n\"My hobby is design and fabrication, and at the time a watch felt like a natural project to attempt,\" he says, remembering how he embarked on making his first watch, with a glow-in-the-dark dial.\n\nHe's since made two more with mechanical movements. Initially, he decided to take apart some watches in his own collection to try and learn how everything slotted together. Then, he found technical details about the movements online - importantly, these provided the detailed dimensions he needed to plan his design.\n\n\"Basically, those drawings tell you the size and shape of the cavity you need to have inside your watch case for the movement to fit properly,\" he says.\n\nThe whole thing was modelled in computer software and then brought to life with the help of tools, like a 'fly cutter', that could mill and shape the materials he was using.\n\nA hobby is one thing. But some take their watch-designing even further. In 2013, Jan Binnendijk, a maker in the Netherlands, found an old, broken watch once worn by his father. In the process of taking it apart and fixing it, he fashioned his own parts - including a case, dial and hands. By the time he'd finished, much of the device was brand new.\n\nLater, he published photos of his project on a Dutch watch forum. \"That drew the attention of a guy who was starting his own watch company. He needed a supplier of cases,\" recalls Binnendijk.\n\nA team of five people eventually came together to make 52 watches with pre-made movements. They sold them for 500 euros ($615) each, which Binnendijk says covered the cost of materials.\n\nThe team eventually came together to make 52 watches and sold them for 500 euros ($615) each\n\nBinnendijk specialises in machining the cases and has largely worked with titanium, a particularly strong metal, for this purpose. He went on to found his own watch company, DumeT. The timepieces he's making now will sell for 1,990 euros ($2500). He's hoping in the future to make his own movement as well, which could mean he's able to craft an entire mechanical watch from scratch in his workshop.\n\nWith this in mind, he recently bought a book on watchmaking by legendary English watchmaker George Daniels. \"I don't believe in God, I believe in George Daniels,\" jokes Binnendijk.\n\nBut he still has fond memories of that first batch of 52 watches he made with his friends and contacts. He recalls that one customer had flown to the Netherlands from Singapore on business. Presumably excited to buy a limited edition watch made by enthusiasts, the businessman asked to meet the team in person. They converged at Amsterdam's Hilton Hotel to hand over the watch.\n\n\"Can you imagine, just guys in an old beat-up BMW going to the top of the Hilton,\" recalls Binnendijk.\n\n\"We were on the roof terrace, we were all smoking cigars, drinking beer, having lots of fun.\"",

Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 70.\n\nMS affects the central nervous system and can cause problems with:\n\nMost cases start as relapsing-remitting MS and most of these develop into secondary-progressive MS within 15-20 years.\n\nPatients in this trial, which was funded by drug company Novartis, had had MS for an average of 17 years - four years with secondary MS, the advanced stage.\n\nMost needed assistance with walking before the trial began.\n\nWhen standard measures of disability were used to track their progress, there was a 21% lower risk of walking or arm movements getting worse for those given the drug, compared with those taking the placebo.\n\nBut the international research team found the drug had no effect on maintaining patients' walking speed and it had some side-effects, although it was still thought to be safe.\n\nLead author Prof Ludwig Kappos, from the University of Basel, said: \"Although the results are not as good as we wanted to see, it is a very large study, which is robust.\n\n\"It means siponimod is one option to delay the disease in the advanced stage.\"\n\nDr Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at the MS Society, said: \"These results bring us closer to the first ever treatment for people with secondary-progressive MS - so it's big news.\n\n\"This trial showed that siponimod had a modest but significant effect in slowing disability progression, which is incredibly encouraging.\"\n\nBut Dr Luanne Metz, from the University of Calgary, in Canada, said a second trial was needed to confirm the benefits of the drug and its impact beyond three to six months.\n\nShe said: \"Although siponimod seems to reduce the time to confirmed disability in secondary-progressive MS, the treatment effect was small.\n\n\"In our opinion... the absence of a significant difference for the key secondary clinical outcome are disappointing results and do not suggest that siponimod is an effective treatment for secondary-progressive MS.\"\n\nShe added: \"Trials of other novel treatments that target non-inflammatory mechanisms are still needed.\"\n\nBefore the drug becomes available on the NHS, it would need to be approved by the European Medicines Agency and then recommended as cost-effective by bodies in the UK.",

                "title": "The jewellery of the Jazz Age",
                "body": "Synonymous with Gatsby-style glamour and the Jazz Age, the bold, sleek Art Deco era was a game-changing time in design. Its angular, geometric aesthetic celebrated the exciting new worlds of industry, speed, mechanisation and technology. It was a uniquely lively and eclectic time in design, and spanned the opulent, 'Roaring 20s' to the more austere 1930s.\n\nArt Deco design has endured like no other style, and it is in jewellery that the era's influence has proved particularly lasting. Having re-emerged over the decades, jewellery inspired by the Art Deco era is once again enjoying a revival today - the bold, innovative sensibility of the time has been hard to miss in recent years, both in fine jewellery and costume styles.\n\nSo what was it about Art Deco jewellery that set it apart and made it significant? \"The Art Deco style really is about modernity,\" Dennis Nothdruft, senior curator at London's Fashion and Textile Museum, tells BBC Culture. \"The jewellery of the period encapsulated the elements of the style in such a clear and exquisite way - geometries, sleek lines, shine and sparkle. It was such sophisticated work and perfectly set off the fashions of the day.\"\n\nOriginally called 'Style Moderne', the new design aesthetic was famously showcased at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925. And even before this, some jewellers had already been forging the new look - as Nothdruft explains: \"I find Cartier the classic Art Deco jeweler. As a company they were already exploring modern styling before the Art Deco exhibition, what they went on to produce were classics of the era. Beside the jewellery, things like cigarette cases and watches were also masterpieces in miniature.\"\n\nAnd the look keeps re-emerging, Nothdruft adds: \"As a style, the Art Deco cycles through periodically. It always signals sophistication and glamour. . . What does change is how jewellery is worn - perhaps layering pieces instead of one necklace or one bracelet.\"\n\nI see ideas for jewellery everywhere, the wheels, the cars, the machinery of today - Raymond Templier\n\nAfter the detailed intricacies and excesses of the Art Nouveau style, the abstract, clean, angular lines of the Art Deco era marked a new, daring sensibility and drew heavily on the dynamic mood of the newly mechanised urban world. Typical of this structured, geometric look is the jewellery of Raymond Templier, some of which is in the permanent collection at London's V&A Museum, including a brooch from around 1930. Templier commented in the Goldsmith's Journal at the time: \"As I walk in the streets I see ideas for jewellery everywhere, the wheels, the cars, the machinery of today.\" He was known as 'the architect of the jewel'.\n\nThe Art Deco jewels were typified by sleekness and sharpness of edges, with a regularity about the lines, surface and volume. Interesting and unusual blends of gems and materials were introduced for the first time, with natural materials such as onyx, rock crystal, jade, ivory and silver, combined with man-made ones such as glass and plastic. By the end of the 1920s, a pared-back, icy look became fashionable, and minimalist rings appeared, with a rigour and severity about them. The favoured metal was platinum, and because of its strength, less was needed, giving great prominence to the gems.\n\nA clean break\n\nA recent sale at Christie's, Beyond Boundaries: Magnificent Jewels from a European Collection, showcased some of the era's most outstanding pieces. It showed how the end of World War One ushered in a rejection of the excesses of the Edwardian and Belle Epoque eras. It was a time of great change and upheaval and the Art Deco design movement emerged from the chaos of war presenting a clean sweep.\n\n\"While designers came from diverse backgrounds, they all held the same ideal: to make a clean break from the past, draw inspiration from everyday life, and rid the decorative arts of useless ornamentation,\" says Laurence Mouillefarine, a historian of the Art Deco era. Along with the artists and architects of the time, the master jewellers of the era worked on developing the connection between form and function. Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Paul Brandt, Raymond Templier and Fouquet are among the jewelers who created masterful, geometric looks, from a stunning Deco sapphire ring by Raymond Templier, to an emerald ring and a diamond-and-onyx ring both by Jean Fouquet, all recently sold by Christie's Geneva.\n\nIn later-period Art Deco, structural clips and double-clip brooches became fashionable, and along with an emphasis on geometric design, there was also a focus on contrasts in colour, and rock crystals were often set beside diamonds, heightening the gem's sparkle. Egyptian, Chinese and Japanese art and motifs were also an inspiration, with the frequent inclusion of coral, enamels, pearls, lacquer and jade. Some designs even lifted - or appropriated - motifs from Asian art.\n\nJewellery specialist at Christie's auction house Raymond Sancroft-Baker says: \"After WWI people wanted to embrace the new. Art Deco took hold, and Cartier was at the forefront of innovation. It introduced the Tank watch in 1917 and, after Jacques Cartier had travelled to India in search of gemstones, 'Tutti Frutti' jewellery, which became very popular in the 1920s. One must remember that jewellery is after all a fashion ornament, and having the latest design is always important.\"\n\nSancroft-Baker explains that Jacques Cartier first visited India in 1911 and, through his buying agents in Delhi, Calcutta and Bombay, managed to acquire Indian rubies, sapphires and emeralds, carved with floral motifs, at modest prices. \"The workshops in Paris assimilated Indian designs into a new style of multi-gem jewels that were far removed from the typical severity of purely diamond-based Art Deco jewels,\" he says. \"The genre reached its crescendo with a stunning necklace, the 'Collier Hindou', which was commissioned in 1936 by the heiress to the Singer sewing machine company, Daisy Fellowes.\"\n\nCartier items from the era are highly collectible - a sleek diamond, emerald, enamel and onyx bracelet, made for the Paris Exhibition of 1925, was also sold through Christie's recently. And a pair of streamlined Art Deco diamond bracelets by the jeweller, originally from the collection of Doris Duke, sold in 2017 for nearly $1 million (?706,000) at Christie's New York.\n\nThe long strands of pearls were layered elegantly by the chic flappers of the time\n\nAlso a fashionable choice in the 1920s and 30s was Tiffany, bringing new diamond cuts, contrasting round and baguette brilliant diamonds clustered together in stylised blooms. Tiffany pearls worn several ropes together were particularly popular, with the long strands layered elegantly by the chic flappers of the time. Tiffany now takes a contemporary approach to Art Deco principles, maintaining the geometry and fluid settings of the sleek originals, and the jeweller's Art Deco inspired pieces today are among some of their most popular items.\n\nTiffany's yellow-diamond ring features a large gem in platinum, bedecked with round-and-baguette white diamonds is clearly inspired by the era. Also influenced by its own 1920s creations is a collection inspired by the iconic Zeigfeld Theatre, including a sterling silver ring with a round black-onyx and freshwater cultured pearls.\n\nJewellery designer Carat London is also among the broad spectrum of accessible, independent brands now influenced by Art Deco sensibilities. Heidi Thompson, creative director of Carat London is inspired by the \"architecture and d?or\" of the era, she tells BBC Designed, particularly in the brand's Chrysler collection. \"Obviously the iconic Chrysler building in New York City was the main inspiration. Our mood boards included patterns from not only the exterior of the building but also the wallpaper, geometric compositions in paintings and furniture, and the beautiful details of the wrought iron gate.\"\n\nSo why does Thompson think this style of jewellery resonates so much now? \"Fashion is an eternal renewal, and Art Deco is one of the most chic and feminine periods in fashion history. This era speaks to women of all ages and reminds us of the opulence of great parties and beautiful dresses. Every woman dreams of having a Gatsby moment.\"",

                "title": "The surprising history of the wolf-whistle",
                "body": "You might not have seen To Have and Have Not - a romantic thriller from 1944 in which Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall smoulder over each other for 90 minutes - but you'll know its most famous scene. It starts with the pair trading barbs until Bacall suddenly leans in and kisses Bogart.\n\n\"What'd you do that for?\" Bogart says, a dumb smile across his face. \"I've been wondering whether I'd like it,\" Bacall shoots back.\n\nShe then gets up to leave. \"You know you don't have to act with me, Steve,\" she says. \"You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing.... Oh, maybe just whistle.\"\n\nShe opens the door, but turns as if remembering something. \"You do know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together, and blow.\"\n\nThe scene's unforgettable - the chemistry overwhelming (the pair started an affair on set, and married shortly after the film came out). But it should also go down in history for one other thing: what Bogart does next. He does indeed put his lips together and blow - a wolf-whistle, in fact - two notes that in the 70 years since have gone from being the height of fashion to, arguably, the world's most offensive sound.\n\nOne British politician is calling for a crackdown on wolf whistling and catcalling\n\nIn France, right now, lawmakers are considering fining people 90 euros (?78) if they're caught wolf-whistling as part of efforts to combat sexual harassment (how the police would implement it hasn't quite been worked out). One British politician is similarly calling for a crackdown on it and catcalling. While if you search for wolf whistling on Twitter, you'll quickly find women complaining about it being done at them, highlighting the intimidation and fear it creates, an obvious example of #everydaysexism. Wolf-whistling - once thought to be heard by every woman who passed a building site - looks set to be extinct.\n\nHow on earth did this two-note whistle - the first high in pitch, the second deep - come to be so charged with meaning? And how did it go from being an everyday occurrence to one that shocks? Its history has surprisingly never been told before.\n\nA wolf in sheep's clothing\n\nIf you search online for the wolf whistle's origins, the one theory thrown about is that it's down to sailors. While at sea, they mainly shouted orders to each other. But in storms, they would rely on piped or whistled 'boatswain calls' - the only sounds that could be heard above the waves. One of these, the 'turn to' call, sounds a lot like a wolf-whistle and the idea goes that sailors took that and started using it to call women when they reached shore. There's just one problem with the theory: it's not true, at least according to historians at both Britain's Royal Navy and its National Maritime Museum. Spokespeople for both said they'd never heard the idea before and felt it extremely unlikely that sailors would have taken a call used in difficult - frightening - situations in the middle of the ocean and transported it to land, let alone to leer at women.\n\nSo where does it come from? The clue is in its very name.\n\n\"My theory I got from talking to an old shepherd,\" says John Lucas, author of A Brief History of Whistling. \"He was this very knowledgeable guy, trained sheepdogs, and he ran through a whole bunch of calls with me and did one that sounded exactly like a wolf whistle. I said, 'Christ, that's a bit politically incorrect!' and he said, 'No, it's kosher, it's from Albania'.\"\n\nThe shepherd explained that in mountainous parts of Southern Europe, shepherds have for centuries used the whistle to warn each other, and their dogs, when wolves appeared. They'd put two or three fingers in their mouths, then blow those notes. \"It's an incredible carrying whistle, unbelievably noisy,\" Lucas says, \"You'd hear it for miles.\" Both the technique and the tune seem to have been called wolf whistling.\n\nBut by the 1930s, that two-note whistle had started being associated with an altogether different type of wolf - the sexual predator. Lucas saw that use for himself as a boy during World War Two. He lived in rural Leicestershire and there were a lot of America GIs - soldiers - stationed near his home. Lucas and his friends would follow them around hoping to get some chewing gum. \"They'd hang around outside the church hall, outside dances, and they'd whistle at women as they went in. That's when I first heard it. Quite how it transformed from Albanian sheep farmers to GIs I couldn't guess.\"\n\nThat moment of transformation may be unknown, but what popularised wolf-whistling seems clear: cartoons, especially those of Tex Avery, the legendary animator who helped create Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Avery was one of the people who turned cartoons from a gentle medium into an anarchic, chaotic art form where anything was possible. Variety's obituary of him from 1980 makes that clear: \"He had no interest in duplicating or imitating reality. In his mind... the more unreal the better. At worst, his films are strident and silly. At best, they are shatteringly funny. In either case, they are unlike anyone else's, before or since.\"\n\n\"You want to know why Tex Avery was special?\" says Pierre Floquet, author of The Comic Language of Tex Avery. \"Have you got an hour?\" One of Avery's famous characters, Floquet says, was a wolf who whistled. He first appears in Avery's 1937 cartoon, Little Red Walking Hood, in which he wolf-whistles at the fairy-tale character and then chases her around town until he gets hit over the head with a hammer. The audience is clearly meant to be happy he's been knocked out. \"Most of Avery's imagination or his creation came from watching social trends,\" Floquet says. \"He would pick up on things and modify and play with them. In the 1930s, with the moral standards of the time, a ladies' man was not a good thing. It only gradually turned into a more positive picture.\"\n\nThe change is arguably seen in Avery's 1943 Red Hot Riding Hood, a highly inventive cartoon that resets the classic fairy-tale in Hollywood. The wolf is now a gentleman about town in a top hat and tails, who goes to a nightclub where he sees Red Hot Riding Hood singing. She's so sexy -worryingly, that is the only word for it - that the wolf goes bananas. He wolf-whistles at her. He pulls out a machine that wolf-whistles for him. He hoots. He slaps the table. His tongue rolls out of his mouth. His eyes pop out of his head. He even starts hitting himself over the head with a hammer as if trying to knock himself out. It's so ludicrously over-the-top, and so well done, it's little surprise to learn the scene's been ripped off repeatedly since. You can find parodies of it in films like The Mask and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nThe cartoon was seen as so sexual it apparently ran into trouble with censors, and was probably only allowed to be shown because it was during WWII and the US military wanted cartoons like it. \"If you increased the libido of soldiers by watching cartoons, they would get frustrated,\" Floquet says, \"and if they got frustrated, they would get aggressive and be better soldiers. I'm not kidding! This is more or less what the army commissioners would say they wanted and expected in cartoons.\"\n\nIt's an instant way to set a scene or get across a character, and can be used for both cheekiness or seediness, often both at once\n\nAvery's cartoon would have been seen by almost every US soldier in the war, and by most American boys too. If they hadn't been wolf-whistling before that moment, they soon were. And it seems that shortly after the cartoon appeared, wolf-whistling was everywhere. The first mention of 'wolf-whistling' in a newspaper comes in 1944, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, and then the practice appears in To Have and Have Not and numerous other films, including the Oscar-winning noir Mildred Pierce. It's an instant way to set a scene or get across a character, and can be used for both cheekiness or seediness, often both at once.\n\n'Innocent fun'?\n\nYou even find it popping up in books. PG Wodehouse - the comic novelist behind Jeeves and Wooster and numerous other characters - used it in Ice in the Bedroom when the glamorous Dolly Molloy walks into a hotel. \"She unquestionably took the eye... Wolf-whistling is of course prohibited in the lobby of Barribault's Hotel so none of those present attempted this form of homage.\"\n\nImmediately after the war, you could even buy The Original Hollywood Wolf Whistle, a device that attaches to your car so you can wolf-whistle at passers-by. Hot rod enthusiasts still use them today.\n\nThe wolf-whistle's most notorious appearance in history, though, comes a decade later, on 28 August 1955, when Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American, was lynched in Mississippi a few days after allegedly wolf-whistling at a white woman in a grocery store. He was kidnapped, beaten until he was unrecognisable, shot and dumped in a river, his body weighed down with a fan blade tied around his neck with barbed wire. Till's mother insisted on having an open casket at his funeral, so the world could see just what horror had happened to her son. His death became a rallying cry for the civil rights movement.\n\nThe rise of feminism started killing it off in the 1970s, according to Lucas. People came to realise it was \"demeaning and pretty horrid,\" he says. \"My wife was wolf-whistled by a guy on a building site [once] and she marched straight up to him and asked what on earth he was doing.\" Lucas was appointed professor of English at Loughborough University in the late-1970s and remembers some of his female students shouting at men who wolf-whistled them: \"My teddy bear can whistle louder than that!\"\n\nAs it started falling away in society, it did in films too, although it still pops up from time to time - in Grease it's used to help create the mood of the sexy 1950s, in Legally Blonde it's used for a quick gag (\"I feel comfortable using legal jargon in everyday life. [Man wolf-whistles]. I object!\") - but the current debate around #metoo might be the final nail in its coffin. If it does appear in films from now on, it may only be in a negative sense. Whether you celebrate its passing, or think it's an appalling sign ('Political correctness gone mad!'), may depend a little on your age as much anything. If you grew up back in the 50s or 60s when wolf whistling was widely seen as innocent fun, you may struggle to see it as otherwise. But if you grew up seeing it as harassment, it's hard not to see it as anything but.\n\nOne person who is sad to see it go is Sheila Harrod, 74, a one-time world champion whistler who makes whistling seem as much as an art form as any other type of music. She can whistle like an opera singer or to imitate bird calls, and she's appeared on television and radio stations worldwide and performed to thousands.\n\n\"I first taught myself to whistle by doing it in the street,\" she says. \"The only one I could do was the wolf-whistle. I used to put two fingers in my mouth and do it, the louder the better.\" If it wasn't for wolf whistling, she'd never have had the globe-trotting life she's had. \"You don't hear it now I think because people fear they'll get accused of sexual harassment,\" she says.\n\n\"It's a shame. I always thought of it as just more cheeky, to brighten up the day. If someone did it to me, I use to do it back twice as loud. That'd always get a laugh.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind getting a few wolf-whistles now at my age.\"\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

                "body": "Theresa May has hailed the progress being made in Brexit negotiations as EU leaders prepare to approve the terms of a transition phase after the UK's exit.\n\nThe 27 leaders are set to endorse a 21-month transition period after March 2019, when the UK officially leaves.\n\nThe UK prime minister says she wants a \"new dynamic\" as talks move on to the economic and security relationship.\n\nShe also welcomed the US exemption for EU firms from tariffs on steel imports but is pushing for further action.\n\nThe Trump administration has decided to temporarily exclude the EU, as well as a number of other countries, from paying tariffs of 25% on steel imports due to come into effect on Friday.\n\nMrs May said this was welcome but what was needed was a permanent exemption, given the \"huge importance\" of the industry to the British economy and government.\n\n\"I want to ensure that steel workers and their jobs are properly safeguard,\" she said.\n\nMrs May has remained in Brussels for the second day of the EU Council summit to discuss steel and other trade issues although she will not be present when her colleagues meet to rubber stamp the transition period and consider approving guidelines for the second phase of negotiations.\n\nAhead of their meeting, she told reporters: \"We've made good progress on the withdrawal agreement.\n\n\"But also I'm looking for a new dynamic in the next stage of the negotiations so that we can ensure that we do develop, that we work together to develop, a strong future economic and security partnership which I believe is in the interest of the UK and the European Union.\"\n\nBy the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler\n\nAfter a night of heated dinner debate over Russia, EU leaders turn their palates and attention this morning to a breakfast - though as this summit timetable keeps shifting, possibly brunch - discussion about Brexit.\n\nThe two issues are closely linked.\n\nTheresa May came to Brussels looking for a robust response to the Salisbury attack. This was important for her not just in security terms. It was also her first test after a year of often bad-tempered Brexit negotiations to see if she could still rally European support in times of need. She could.\n\nAt a dinner on Thursday night, Mrs May said the UK and EU should work on issues like Northern Ireland, trade and security with \"energy and ambition\".\n\n\"We have the chance now to work together to explore workable solutions - in Northern Ireland, in our future security co-operation and in order to ensure the future prosperity of all our people.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is an opportunity. It is our duty to take it and to enter into it with energy and ambition.\"\n\nThe UK is set to leave the bloc on 29 March 2019, but earlier this week Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier struck a deal that would allow for a transition period - which the UK government describes as an implementation period - until December 2020.\n\nUnder the terms of that joint legal text, the UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals, while EU citizens arriving in the UK will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit.\n\nA solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland has yet to be agreed, with the EU insisting on a \"backstop\" option of Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the customs union.\n\nEU Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday he was \"absolutely sure\" a solution would be found to prevent the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Irish government has insisted the UK has provided a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that will ensure no physical infrastructure, checks or controls at the border after withdrawal.\n\nOn Thursday, the European Council agreed with the UK that it was \"highly likely\" Russia was behind the Salisbury attack, Mr Tusk saying there was \"no other plausible explanation\".",

                "title": "The teenagers using tech to rebuild bodies",
                "body": "From talking gloves to do-it-yourself mind-controlled arms, a raft of teenage inventors are rethinking the world of prosthetics.\n\nFor most of human history, prosthetics were extremely crude. Back in Roman times, the general Marcus Sergius had an iron hand made when his own was cut off in battle. He strapped it to his arm while he fought ferocious enemies, including Hannibal, but it was little more than an accessory. By the Victorian era, they were becoming a bit more creative and useful. This vintage prosthetic features a fork, which the user can attach to their index finger.\n\nFast-forward to 2018 and millions of people still don't have access to the technology they need. It turns out losing a limb is far more common than people realise; according to the World Health Organisation, there are 40 million amputees in the developing world. Just 5% of these have access to any form of prosthesis.\n\nA number of teenage inventors are already tackling this challenge, however. Though in many countries they're too young to drink, drive, or vote, they are already inventing low-cost solutions for those in need.\n\nTake 19-year old Shiva Nathan, an undergraduate research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. He spent his childhood playing video games, which was surprisingly useful training for engineering prosthetics. \"My uncle is a neurologist and he bought a MindWave Mobile headset for me to play around with, to see if I could do anything interesting with it,\" he says.\n\nThe headset works using EEG technology, which measures the electrical impulses produced by neurons in the brain. It's been used for decades by doctors as a way of diagnosing epilepsy, but today it's widely marketed as being able to read brain signals that allow users to play games without lifting a finger.\n\nAround the time he received the headset, Nathan heard about a distant cousin in India who had lost both of her arms in an explosion. \"When I learned about her injuries and I learned about the prosthetics she had received, I thought that I could build better ones,\" he explains.\n\nThough there are many cutting-edge prosthetics already on the market, from hands that let their wearer feel the texture of objects, to those that can see for themselves, most cost upwards of US$30,000 (?21,420).\n\nArmed with his gaming headset and a $30 (?21) micro-controller ?- a device that can be programmed and then connected to other devices, such as a television - Nathan set about making a prosthetic arm that would be available to everyone.\n\nOther than the micro-controller and the headset, the device was made entirely from materials from Nathan's local electronics store\n\n\"The way it works is that it uses an EEG headset that is connected by Bluetooth to a micro-controller. The headset is able to read your brainwaves and based on the signals it receives from the brain, it can send that data via Bluetooth to the arm, which can control its movements,\" he explains.\n\nOther than the micro-controller and the headset, the device was made entirely from materials from Nathan's local electronics store. \"The schematics for it are all online, the programs for it are all online and you should ideally be able to program one yourself with off-the-shelf components,\" he says. The \"Arduino prosthesis\" has won numerous awards, including prizes from the 2013 National microMedic Contest and the 2014 Bluetooth Breakthrough Awards.\n\nOther inventors have started even younger. Though he's now 18, Adeeb Al Balooshi, from the United Arab Emirates, was just nine when he invented a waterproof prosthetic foot.\n\nHis father had polio as a child, and consequently his right leg didn't grow as much as his left. Al Balooshi was first driven to invent while waiting for his father in the sea. He knew his father loved swimming, but it took him a long time to join his son, because he had to unstrap and remove his prosthetic first - a laborious process.\n\nAl Balooshi set to work inventing a prosthetic foot that was lightweight and waterproof, so his father would never have to remove it at the beach again. The previous version was made from metal rods and leather, but the young inventor upgraded this to one made of graphene, a super-light, super-strong wonder material made of carbon.\n\nThis new foot doesn't have straps and is powered by hydraulics, much like a cutting-edge hand developed a few years earlier by a team of university-educated, adult researchers.\n\nWith the success of his father's prosthetic foot, Al Balooshi went on to invent a cleaning robot for his mother and a seatbelt with a heart rate monitor inside, that can wirelessly beam health alerts to emergency services. Today he holds seven patents - and by a more youthful measure of success has over 36,000 Instagram followers.\n\nDoherty decided to design a glove that could detect sign language using motion sensors and then convert it into speech\n\nThen there's Emma Doherty, a 15-year old from Greater Manchester in the UK who is developing the Speaking Signs device. This prosthetic isn't for amputees, but for people with hearing loss.\n\nIt started two years ago. \"I read an article where I saw how deaf people were struggling to interact with society because they were restricted to a certain number of people who understood sign language, and I was very interested to find a way around that,\" she says.\n\nDoherty decided to design a glove that could detect sign language using motion sensors and then convert it into speech. It was inspired by the singer Imogen Heap, who has invented gloves to turn gestures into music. \"The deaf person wouldn't be able to hear the response, so a microphone would be able to listen instead and note it down, sort of like how on an iPhone you can dictate to it. Then the response would be displayed on a screen on the glove,\" she says.\n\nThough it's currently in the prototyping stage, Doherty's glove has already attracted the attention of those it was designed to help. \"Once it got out there and people heard about it, I started getting emails from people saying 'How much do you need, how much are they, because my son is really struggling to interact with his friends, or with people in his class',\" she says.\n\nLast year, Doherty's idea won the UK's Big Bang Fair, a prize for young inventors, and has attracted funding to continue its development from a software company based in Cambridge. Eventually, she hopes the Speaking Signs device will allow people with hearing difficulties to have conversations with any one of the seven billion people on our planet.\n\nThe field of prostehtetic developed and improved massively ove the 20th Century. It seems there are a number of young inventors who want to ensure that innovation continues well into the 21st.\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.",

                "body": "A shadow cabinet minister has broken ranks with official Labour Party policy to call for another Brexit referendum.\n\nShadow Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Smith said a vote should be held when talks with the EU have concluded.\n\nIn an article for the Guardian, he also called for Labour to back membership of the EU single market.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the party was \"not calling for a referendum at this stage\".\n\nJeremy Corbyn announced last month that Labour wanted the UK to be a permanent member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit.\n\nBut Mr Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, said that was not enough.\n\n\"If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market,\" he said in his article.\n\n\"I'm pleased my party has taken a big step in this direction by backing continued customs union membership, but we need to go further.\"\n\nHe argued that Labour \"needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland\".\n\n\"Given that it is increasingly obvious that the promises the Brexiters made to the voters - especially, but not only, their pledge of an additional ?350m a week for the NHS - are never going to be honoured, we have the right to keep asking if Brexit remains the right choice for the country.\n\n\"And to ask, too, that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms, and true costs of that choice, once they are clear. That is how Labour can properly serve our democracy and the interests of our people.\"\n\nConservative Brexit Minister Steve Baker accused Labour of \"trying to frustrate the Brexit process\".\n\n\"These comments show that on one of the biggest issues facing the country, Labour have no interest in making a success of it, betraying millions of Labour voters.\n\n\"Only the Conservatives are getting on with delivering what British people voted for, taking back control of our laws, borders and money.\"\n\nSir Keir Starmer said Labour's position was that the \"benefits of the single market and customs union... need to be hard-wired into the final agreement\".\n\n\"We want a strong relationship with the single market with no drop-offs in rights, standards or protections,\" he added.\n\nAsked if Mr Smith was going against official party policy with his comments, Sir Keir said: \"That's not a matter for me to comment on. My focus is on ensuring we are challenging the government appropriately on the negotiations with the EU. \"\n\nMr Smith argued for a second EU referendum during his abortive Labour leadership bid - but Jeremy Corbyn has consistently ruled one out, saying that the public had come to a decision, and has insisted the UK cannot remain in the single market.\n\nOther shadow cabinet members have appeared more open to the idea of another referendum.\n\nIn January 2018, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she would consider it only in exceptional circumstances - \"if 90% of the population was now saying we will stay in the European Union\".\n\nLabour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, did not rule out a second referendum, in a December 2017 interview with BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, but added: \"What we actually want is a negotiated settlement.\"\n\nAnti-Brexit Labour backbenchers such as Chuka Umunna, a member of the cross-party Open Britain campaign, have also argued for a second referendum.\n\nMr Umunna said Mr Smith was \"absolutely right\" to say that Labour \"needs to go further in opposing the government on Brexit\", saying the Leave campaign had made promises \"we now know cannot be delivered on\".\n\n\"If we are not going to be offered the Brexit we were promised we have every right to ask whether Brexit is the right path for the country,\" he said.",

He denies the charges.\n\nStuart Olding, 25, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. He too denies the charge.\n\nAnother man has also been charged in connection with the case. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure. He denies the charge.\n\nThe Irish News, among other newspapers, reports on the unveiling of a portrait at Stormont to Martin McGuinness, a day after the anniversary of the former deputy first minister's death.\n\nIt says Michelle O'Neill, who succeeded Mr McGuinness as Sinn F?n's leader at Stormont, urged politicians across Northern Ireland to choose hope over fear as she unveiled the portrait with a \"broken heart bursting with pride\".\n\nFormer DUP leader and first minister, Peter Robinson, who was in attendance, said political leaders will have to return to the negotiating table if a solution to the current impasse is to be found.\n\nThe unveiling of the portrait has not been welcomed in all quarters however.\n\nStephen Gault, who was injured in the Enniskillen bomb attack at the town's cenotaph in November 1987, tells the News Letter he is \"sickened by the glorification\" of the former IRA commander.\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph says former civil servants could be asked to pay back money from redundancy payments they received under a Voluntary Exit Scheme.\n\nIt says all 3,701 redundancy awards, which cost the taxpayer nearly ?109m are being reviewed after it emerged some civil servants were paid too much in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe Department of Finance has started issuing written requests for those affected, asking them to make arrangements to repay the money, which the Telegraph says in some cases exceeds ?1,000.\n\nThe department has denied overpayments occurred as a result of any error, although the newspaper says it has seen one letter which states that \"the old computer system miscalculated\".\n\nIt also says the department is \"obliged to seek recovery\" in accordance with the manual for Managing Public Money.\n\nThe Daily Mirror reports that the South-Eastern Health and Social Care Trust has apologised to the family of a deaf man from County Antrim who had to tell him he was dying because a hospital did not provide a sign-language interpreter.\n\nThe trust has also paid ?7,000 compensation to Thomas Carson's family. He was being treated in the Ulster Hospital at the time.\n\nMr Carson received the news he was terminally ill in late 2016 from his daughter, Jillian Shanks.\n\nMs Shanks said it was \"distressing\" for the family.\n\nThe trust said it was \"grateful the Carson family accepted the apology\".",

                "body": "A Pakistani television anchor previously accused of hate speech has joined cricketer-turned-opposition politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) party.\n\nAn eloquent speaker with a penchant for religious sermons and rather rash thoughts, Dr Hussain is well known - and no stranger to controversy.\n\nDr Hussain was a member of parliament from 2002 until 2008, when he was expelled by the MQM party.\n\nAs a politician, he was involved in several rows. On one occasion, he was held hostage by students angry at his work criticising suicide bombings.\n\nOn another occasion, he declared British-Indian novelist Salman Rushdi as \"worthy of death\" - comments that eventually forced him to resign from parliament.\n\nAs a journalist, a religious ideologue and a showman, Dr Hussain has had stints at nearly all the major media houses in Pakistan.\n\nHis TV shows are elaborately scripted, preach a certain brand of religion, and include quiz shows and product giveaways.\n\nDr Hussain has gifted cars, motorbikes and household electronics on his shows - and on one occasion, even abandoned babies.\n\nOn one show during Ramadan, he brought two abandoned infants from a welfare organisation onto his live show, where they were adopted by two couples.\n\nCritics accused him of using the babies to boost ratings, and argued that their privacy had been breached.\n\nIn 2016, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) banned his programme for three days for alleged lewd content over some of his hand gestures and double entendres.\n\nHe was severely reprimanded by human rights groups when he declared Ahmadi Muslims as \"non-Muslims and worthy of death\" in one of his programmes. Soon afterwards two Ahmadis were gunned down in Sindh, leading some to suspect the killers were inspired by Dr Hussain's rhetoric.\n\nPemra also banned his show on Bol TV after he levelled allegations of blasphemy against various people including human rights activists, journalists and bloggers. Pemra received complaints that he was endangering the lives of those he named.\n\nLiberal-minded viewers in Pakistan tend not to take Dr Hussain seriously - but he commands considerable influence with some conservative viewers, including housewives who watch his shows.\n\nHis popularity has turned him into one of the most highly paid TV show hosts in Pakistan. He has signed lucrative contracts just to host his show for a month during Ramadan, the fasting month when viewership of such programmes spikes.\n\nHe also has influence with certain political groups in Pakistan's polarised political environment - especially as a harsh critic of former PM Nawaz Sharif.\n\nHis fans are mostly those opposed to Mr Sharif's PML-N and Asif Zardari's PPP party, and mostly comprise followers of Imran Khan's PTI.\n\nAt a joint press conference with Mr Khan in Karachi on Monday, Dr Amir Liaquat Hussain described the PTI as \"the last stop\" in his career.\n\nPakistan will have general elections in July.\n\nAs a resident of Karachi, Dr Hussain will be looking for a constituency in his native city where the military has already broken the strangle hold of MQM and where constituencies are up for grabs.\n\nThe PTI party, which is seen as close to the military, is keen to capitalise on this. And in Dr Hussain, the PTI will have a famous, local candidate who has successfully delved in the city's politics before.\n\nBut this is no guarantee of success, and some observers believe the PTI may struggle in the forthcoming general elections due to a surge in support for Mr Sharif's party.\n\nWhat's clear is that Pakistani politics is notoriously unpredictable - and the country hasn't heard the last from the outspoken TV host.",

                "body": "John Bolton, an ultra-hawkish conservative who rose to prominence in the George W Bush administration, will be the new National Security Adviser to President Donald Trump.\n\nA firm defender of American power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad, Mr Bolton has never shied away from making his strong views known - whether from a government perch, in the pages of newspapers or from a Fox News pulpit.\n\nHere are five things he believes.\n\nMr Bolton's views on North Korea will draw intense scrutiny as he joins the White House, given a looming summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un expected to take place by May.\n\nThe incoming National Security Adviser has made it clear that he believes that North Korea and its nuclear programme pose an \"imminent threat\" to the US, dismissing those who would argue that Washington still has time for diplomacy.\n\n\"Given the gaps in US intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in February of possible pre-emptive action.\n\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \"necessity\" posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first.\"\n\nDonald Trump is reported to have got rid of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson due to their opposing views on the Iran nuclear deal, which the US president has been deeply critical of.\n\nIn John Bolton, he will find someone whose views are much more aligned with his.\n\nMr Bolton has lambasted Barack Obama for agreeing the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, writing last year that the text of the agreement \"created huge loopholes, and Iran is now driving its missile and nuclear programs straight through them\".\n\nIn March 2015, a few months before the deal was agreed, he argued in the New York Times that only military action would suffice.\n\n\"Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,\" he said, advocating Israeli action specifically.\n\n\"Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\"\n\n\"There is no United Nations,\" Mr Bolton said in a 1994 speech. \"There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along.\"\n\nThat speech was made more than a decade before he was nominated by the George W Bush administration to be US ambassador to the UN - but Mr Bolton's scepticism of a global body accountable to no one sovereign nation is deeply held.\n\nThe Economist called him \"the most controversial ambassador ever sent by America to the United Nations\", but he also won praise in some quarters, for fiercely pushing for reform of the international institution.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the president was calling the US-led invasion in 2003, \"the single worst decision ever made\". Around the same time, John Bolton, who backed it strongly, was refusing to condemn it.\n\n\"When you say the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a mistake, it's simplistic,\" he is reported to have said in a Fox News appearance.\n\nIn 2016, when he was mulling a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr Bolton was less equivocal.\n\n\"If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region,\" the Washington Post quoted him as saying.\n\nMr Bolton has described Russian interference in the 2016 US election as a \"true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate\".\n\nIn July 2017, when President Trump met President Putin and the Russian leader denied Russian meddling, Mr Bolton wrote that he was \"lying with the benefit of the best KGB training\".\n\nMore recently, following the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripial in the UK - an attack blamed on Russia - Mr Bolton said the West should respond with a \"very strong answer\".",

                "body": "A senior Sinn F?n politician has said paedophile priest Fr Malachy Finegan physically abused him and tried to sexually groom him.\n\nConor Murphy said the priest, who died in 2002, dragged him into an office in St Colman's College, Newry, County Down, and beat him with a stick.\n\nMr Murphy told the Press Association that the priest asked him explicit questions, including if he loved him.\n\nThe priest has been accused of physical and sexual abuse by a number of former pupils, including the brother of former Irish president Mary McAleese.\n\nHe has also been accused of abuse while he was a parish priest in Clonduff, County Down.\n\nDetails of the abuse claims against Fr Finegan were revealed in a BBC Spotlight investigation in February.\n\nFr Finegan was never prosecuted for sexual abuse, but allegations against him were reviewed by the National Board for Safeguarding Children - a clerical abuse watchdog set up by the Catholic Church.\n\nMr Murphy, who was a pupil at St Colman's between 1975 and 1980, said he was angry that no one stopped the priest's abuse despite his sexual interest in young boys being common knowledge in the school.\n\nHe has demanded a full investigation.\n\nHe described the priest as a \"violent, volatile, bullying drunkard\" and recounted an incident from when he was a 14-year-old pupil at the school.\n\n\"There was a bit of ruckus going on in the class we were in and Finegan burst into the room,\" he said.\n\n\"He singled me out, he dragged me out by the hair, by the crown of your head, dragged me along the corridor, up two flights of stairs into his room and then he beat me with a stick on the hands and about the body.\n\n\"He was always prone to more violence than was perhaps to do with discipline.\n\n\"And then he suddenly flipped, as I was almost expecting, he sat me down and started asking me personal questions - did I smoke, did I drink? Bear in mind I was 14. Did I go out with girls? Did I masturbate? Did I love him? This type of conversation.\n\n\"I can't remember my responses but I wasn't shocked by the conversation, because I had been forewarned by other pupils that this was what was likely to happen.\"\n\nMr Murphy said his experience \"paled into insignificance\" compared to those men who have come forward to say they were sexually abused by the priest.\n\nHe said he wanted to go public with his story to reassure others they they would be believed if they wanted to break their silence.\n\nA priest, a teacher and a school president who died in 2002 - but it's only recently that accusations about Fr Malachy Finegan have emerged publicly.\n\nIn February, the Catholic Diocese of Dromore revealed it had reached a settlement with one of 12 people who had accused the priest of abuse while at St Colman's College.\n\nAnother victim - Sean Falloon - spoke publically of being abused for eight years from the age of 10 while Fr Finegan was a parish priest.\n\nIn the weeks since, the Catholic Church and police have come under fire for what they knew about the priest and when.\n\nBishop of Dromore, John McAreavey, resigned over the controversy, specifically for serving at Fr Finegan's funeral mass despite knowing of claims made against him.\n\nA group of victims have also complained to the Police Ombudsman over claims the police were aware of the allegations against the priest in 1996 but failed to interview him.\n\nMr Murphy said that while he was not aware the priest was sexually abusing students at time, everyone in the school knew about the explicit conversations he would try to instigate.\n\n\"We knew it was wrong, it was inappropriate, that it was not natural for a man, particularly a priest, to behave in that fashion.\"\n\nHe added that \"we didn't understand it was essentially a grooming exercise\" but that students were aware that \"if you were in a room alone with him that he was liable to ask you very inappropriate questions and display an inordinate interest in your sexual development\".\n\n\"We didn't know that he had sexually abused boys but we knew and understood that he had an unhealthy interest and the way you approached that conversation was to shut down and try to get out of that office as quickly as you could.\"\n\nHe added: \"I didn't know what a paedophile was, we didn't know what the behaviour of a paedophile was, but as an adult looking back it was fairly obvious to us that these were the classic symptoms of paedophilia.\"\n\nMr Murphy also said Fr Finegan would \"assault pupils\" and that it was not simply about discipline.\n\nHe added that he believed the priest was \"drinking very heavily\".\n\n\"I was only a kid but I had worked in a bar from when I was 12 years old and I knew.\n\n\"He would appear in the corridor in the mornings with his shoe laces undone, his vest hanging out underneath his shirt, his eyes bloodshot and quite aggressive.\n\n\"He would launch an attack if someone was coming up the corridor with their tie not straight they were liable to get thumped in the face for it.\n\n\"That was going on as a matter of course through my time there.\"\n\nMr Murphy said the Catholic Church, the school and wider education authorities all had questions to answer as to why no one intervened to stop Fr Finegan.\n\n\"They left him to abuse people without any interference probably across two generations of boys,\" he said.\n\n\"I am angry that a man who was a violent, aggressive bully, a drunkard with an unhealthy interest in children, and that was obvious, was allowed to be a principal of a school, was allowed to be teacher in a school over a long number of years, allowed access to young boys.\"\n\nHe said that the system of administration in St Colman's College \"allowed a paedophile to flourish\" and that \"it needs to be investigated\" as to why this happened.\n\nMr Murphy, who has made a statement to lawyers representing victims of Fr Finegan's abuse said he hoped his story would help to validate the accounts of others who have come forward.\n\n\"I hope me speaking publicly maybe gives some people confidence to come forward, and that's the purpose of me speaking.\n\n\"It's not to draw any degree of sympathy for myself but it's actually to encourage others and to say that we believe those who say they were sexually abused, we know the pattern in the school.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church has described Fr Finegan's abuse as \"abhorrent\" while St Colman's College has said it condemns in the \"strongest possible terms the physical, sexual and emotional abuse inflicted by Malachy Finegan\".\n\nIn a further statement, the board of governors at St Colman's College said: \"The board unreservedly condemns all abuse and advises that anyone who is a victim to contact the PSNI.\n\n\"The school is co-operating fully with a PSNI investigation regarding historic abuse.\n\n\"This is the most suitable mechanism to address these issues. Until such investigations are complete the board will not be making further public statements.\"",

At the time, she was nearly 20 stone.\n\n\"I felt like I was responsible for my own downfall,\" Janet, 55, said.\n\n\"It stuck in my gut a bit, thinking I could maybe not have been in this position had I sorted my lifestyle out.\"\n\nJanet, a grandmother, has since lost nearly seven stone after she cut down on sugar, started cooking healthier meals from fresh ingredients and became more active.\n\nCancer Research UK found overexposure to UV radiation caused about 13,600 cases of melanoma skin cancer a year - or 3.8% of all cancer cases.\n\nOther preventable causes of cancer included drinking alcohol and eating too little fibre, it said.\n\nHowever, overall the analysis found the proportion of preventable cases of cancer had fallen - from 42.7% in 2011 to 37.7%.\n\nSource: Cancer Research UK\n\nCancer Research UK said the figures showed smoking prevention strategies were working, but more work was needed to tackle the growing problem of obesity.\n\nProf Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said: \"Obesity is a huge health threat right now, and it will only get worse if nothing is done.\n\n\"The UK government must build on the successes of smoking prevention to reduce the number of weight-related cancers.\n\n\"Banning junk food TV adverts before the 21:00 GMT watershed is an important part of the comprehensive approach needed.\"\n\nProf Mel Greaves, a cancer biologist at the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, said the study was an \"endorsement\" of the idea that many cancers were potentially preventable.\n\nBut he said the idea that obesity itself or eating too little fibre \"causes\" cancer was \"somewhat simplistic\" and still needed to be explored further.\n\n\"If obesity could be avoided, the impact on cancer rates is uncertain - but they would almost certainly decline significantly,\" Prof Greaves said.\n\n\"Given the currently high rates of obesity in young people, this represents (like cigarette smoking) a major societal challenge beyond the bounds of the medical arena.\"",

                "body": "After a night of heated dinner debate over Russia, EU leaders turn their palates and attention this morning to a breakfast - though as this summit timetable keeps shifting, possibly brunch - discussion about Brexit.\n\nThe two issues are closely linked.\n\nTheresa May came to Brussels looking for a robust response to the Salisbury attack. This was important for her not just in security terms. It was also her first test after a year of often bad-tempered Brexit negotiations to see if she could still rally European support in times of need. She could.\n\nEU leaders are divided over what action they want to take against Russia after Salisbury, but they often fall out over foreign policy.\n\nThis is not a reflection of fading solidarity with the UK because of Brexit. In fact, the EU is adamant on maintaining close security relations with a post-Brexit Britain.\n\nTraditionally Brussels has looked to the US for protection, but an unpredictable President Trump in the White House means EU leaders now think Europe should be better prepared to defend itself - in terms of cyber-security, preventing further terror attacks, and the prudent use of sanctions. With this they want the UK's help.\n\nThe EU's future relationship with the UK will thus be at the heart of Friday's Brexit debate at the summit.\n\nIt's the moment the UK has been waiting for - when European leaders give the nod to their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to (finally, from a British point of view) begin talks about trade and the rest of the EU-UK post-Brexit relationship.\n\nLondon hopes this will lead to a groundbreaking trade deal between the two sides - one so deep and wide-reaching that, among other things, it will dissipate concerns about the appearance of a post-Brexit hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThis, until now, has been a persistent sticking point in Brexit negotiations.\n\nBrussels remains sceptical but the UK government hopes trade talks will see EU unity over Brexit crumble, to its advantage, as the national interests of individual countries come to the fore.\n\nIt was easy for EU leaders to stick together in the first phase of Brexit negotiations - about the \"Brexit bill\" presented to the UK. They all wanted money. But look ahead to a future trade deal, and EU countries start to sing from different hymn sheets.\n\nDenmark is focused on fishing quotas, while Luxembourg fixates on financial services, Poland ponders security pacts and France and Germany insist on no rule-bending at all for the UK.\n\nEU leaders will attempt to contain their differences but it's going to be an interesting few months.\n\nIn the meantime another special on the Brexit menu will be the rubber-stamping of the transition arrangement, the 21-month period after the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nBusinesses in the UK and the EU are thrilled about this. Uncertainty over Brexit has been costly, and fears there could be no deal at all were commonplace before this week.\n\nThese fears shouldn't disappear entirely.\n\nBrexit negotiations could still break down. If they do, under the EU mantra of \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\", the transition period could be scrapped before it begins.\n\nThat said, EU leaders sound optimistic that a Brexit deal will be struck- though many question why the UK should be UK delighted that Brussels has allowed it to sign trade deals with other countries during the transition period.\n\n\"Doesn't Downing Street realise,\" one EU diplomat muttered to me, \"no country: not the US, Japan, no-one will want to complete a trade deal with the UK until they know what kind of relationship London has with us (the EU)?\n\n\"That's what will clinch the UK's value to them.\"\n\nYou won't be surprised when I tell you that UK negotiators disagree.",

                "body": "As the musical version of Disney's hit film Frozen opens on Broadway, reporter Elysa Gardner takes a trip to Arendelle with some excited fans.\n\nOn a late winter's evening in New York City, fans young and old gathered to be transported to an even chillier place.\n\nTheir destination, technically speaking, was Times Square, where Disney's latest stage outing, an adaptation of its 2013 screen musical Frozen - the highest-grossing animated film of all time - was in previews.\n\nBut even before the curtain rose inside Broadway's St James Theatre on 17 March, audience members were ready to suspend disbelief and enter the gates of Arendelle, the fictional kingdom where royal sisters Elsa and Anna grow up and apart and are then reunited - with a little help from an ice salesman, his reindeer and an indomitable snowman.\n\n\"I want to see what the characters look like in real life,\" said nine-year-old Margaux Knepper, from suburban Long Island.\n\nGabriel and Grace Stevens, aged 12 and nine respectively, had travelled all the way from Destin, Florida with their parents and were especially eager to see how Sven the reindeer would be recreated onstage.\n\nThe puppet design provided for Sven and Olaf the snowman is a highlight of this Frozen, which had its official opening night on Thursday.\n\nCredit for this goes to puppet designer Michael Curry, who previously made magic as Julie Taymor's collaborator on The Lion King, Disney's longest-running Broadway hit.\n\nYet for all the clever design elements involved in the production, it's the performances, guided with wit and tenderness by acclaimed British director Michael Grandage, that propel the story.\n\nThat story is spun by librettist Jennifer Lee, adapting her own screenplay, and composer/lyricists Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez - Academy Award winners both for Frozen and, more recently, Coco.\n\nThe journeys of the two spirited young women at the centre of Frozen have both classical elements - Grandage has cited Shakespeare in describing the story's arc - and aspects that seem freshly topical in the #MeToo era.\n\nElder sibling Elsa is burdened with the ability to literally freeze her environment - a power that nearly kills her sister in childhood and compels their parents to separate the once inseparable girls and isolate the castle in which they live.\n\nThe parents then perish in a storm. (This is Disney after all.) No sooner has Elsa been crowned, however than her strange magic is inadvertently revealed, sending Arendelle into a state of perpetual winter and its young queen fleeing into exile.\n\nPrincess Anna bravely follows her, hoping to finally connect with her sister. Meanwhile, a prince who has proposed to Anna on their first meeting organises a search party to rescue her and find Elsa.\n\nThe twists that follow - on the off chance you're not already familiar with them - reference and defy sexist stereotypes. These include the myth - previously shot down in another Broadway musical, the long-popular Wicked - that strong women are more likely to compete with than support one another.\n\nAs Elsa, Caissie Levy - a formidable belter whose previous Broadway roles include Wicked's Elphaba - lends heft and gleam to Frozen's signature siren call, Let It Go.\n\nShe brings the same qualities to the no less turbo-charged Monster, one of several new songs Anderson-Lopez and Lopez have crafted for the show.\n\nPlucky Anna provides more of a comic showcase and may well prove a breakout role for Patti Murin, who is both delightfully playful in her scenes with Kristoff the iceman - charmingly played by Jelani Alladin - and poignant in a darker sequence that introduces fetching new ballad True Love.\n\nAnna is joined in the latter scene by Olaf, who is given just the right goofy sweetness by Greg Hildreth and his accompanying puppet. Revisiting a choice line from the film (\"Some people are worth melting for\"), Hildreth reaped a well-deserved \"awwww\" from Saturday's audience.\n\nAndrew Pirozzi has a more physically demanding task manipulating the more elaborate and expressive puppet designed for Sven. Yet he nonetheless gives the creature a wry soulfulness.\n\nWithout speaking a word or singing a note, Pirozzi also factors in some of the show's funniest moments, nearly upstaging Olaf's entrance as he slowly manoeuvres the reindeer's bulky frame around to gawk at the snowman.\n\nScenic and costume designer Christopher Oram, Grandage's frequent collaborator, manages the same balance of sprit and spectacle, whether summoning the cultural and spiritual traditions of local townsfolk or bringing us deep into Elsa's domain.\n\nNatasha Katz's lighting and Finn Ross's video design, meanwhile, help evoke a sparkling winter wonderland - occasionally marked by icy spikes that pop up when Elsa's anger piques.\n\nThe spikes were a hit with Teegan Witock, a seven-year-old from Brooklyn, while her 10-year-old sister Anderson cited Elsa's lightning-fast costume change into a glittering ice-blue gown during Let It Go.\n\nOther audience members got a kick out of Mattea Conforti, the super-perky actress who played Anna as a young girl at Saturday night's performance.\n\nThere was also praise for the graceful Ayla Schwartz, who played young Elsa. (Two actresses alternate in each role.)\n\nTo no one's surprise, the evening ended with a standing ovation, during which Margaux Knepper and her friend Phoebe Talamas, also nine, scooted down the aisle to get a closer look at the players.\n\nThey were real all right, and both girls no doubt walked back into the frosty night air feeling a little warmer inside.",

                "body": "Vietnam has cancelled a major oil project in the South China Sea for the second time in a year, in the wake of Chinese pressure, the BBC has learned.\n\nState-owned PetroVietnam ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol to suspend a project off the south-east coast, a well-placed industry source said.\n\nIt means Repsol and partners could lose up to $200m of investment already made.\n\nThe news is unexpected as final preparations for commercial drilling were under way.\n\nChina is likely to regard this move as a significant victory. The Vietnamese decision seems to demonstrate that the recent show of force in the South China Sea by the United States has not changed Vietnam's strategic calculations.\n\nThe American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its escort ships made a high-profile visit to Danang earlier this month.\n\nVietnam has been seeking to develop the so-called Red Emperor oil and gas discovery (known in Vietnamese as Ca Rong Do) since 2009.\n\nAs part of the \"Red Emperor\" project, a rig, the Ensco 8504, was scheduled to depart from Singapore for the drill site on Thursday.\n\nThe site is in an area of the South China Sea designated Block 07/03 by Vietnam and Repsol's local subsidiary had previously estimated that it contains 45 million barrels of oil and 172 billion cubic feet of gas.\n\nThe company had contracted a Malaysian-owned company, Yinson, to provide a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel at the site for 10 years at an estimated cost of more than $1bn.\n\nMoreover, Repsol had commissioned the American engineering company Keppel FloaTEC to build a production platform to service the site at a likely cost of several tens of millions of dollars.\n\nOverall, according to the source, Repsol and its partners in the project (Mubadala Petroleum and PetroVietnam) are likely to be around $200m out of pocket. Repsol and related companies have not yet responded to questions from the BBC about the latest development.\n\nThis is the second time that Repsol has been ordered to suspend drilling. This area is adjacent to Block 136/03 where Repsol was ordered by the Vietnamese government to halt its development drilling in July last year.\n\nThat decision was reportedly taken after China threatened to attack Vietnamese outposts in a nearby piece of shallow sea known as the Vanguard Bank.\n\nReports from July 2017 suggested that it was the head of the Communist Party of Vietnam, General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, and the Minister of Defence, Gen Ngo Xuan Lich, who insisted that the drilling in Block 136/03 be stopped in order to avoid confrontation with China.\n\nIt is likely that the same dynamics were at work in the current decision.\n\nThere had been some thoughts in the region that Donald Trump's more muscular approach to China and the US Navy's more assertive posture in the South China Sea would generate political space for South East Asian governments to stand up more effectively for their maritime rights.\n\nPresident Trump's visit to Vietnam late last year and his subsequent conversations with the Vietnamese leadership seemed to suggest that the two governments were working together to counteract pressure from China.\n\nOther countries in the region are also keen to develop their offshore oil and gas reserves.\n\nMalaysia, Brunei and the Philippines are all coming under pressure from China to concede \"joint development\" in areas where the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives them sole rights. So far all the South East Asian states have resisted the pressure.\n\nVietnam has chosen to try to develop its fields alone and the result has been military threats from China and, now, a second climb-down, raising questions over Vietnam's offshore potential.\n\nSpeculation will turn to the fate of Exxon Mobil's Blue Whale gas project off central Vietnam. However, that is closer to land and so may not incur China's ire.",

Now we learn that the passports will be printed by a foreign company.\"\n\nUnder EU procurement rules, the Home Office had been required to throw open the bidding process to European firms.\n\nHowever, it added that passports did not have to be made in the UK and 20% of blank passport books are currently produced in Europe.\n\nIt also said the new deal could save the taxpayer ?100m-?120m and that 70 new jobs would be created in the UK, at sites in Fareham and Heywood in Lancashire.\n\nGemalto, which has its headquarters in Paris and has a factory in Fareham, said it was aware of the reports regarding the contract to produce the new UK passport.\n\nBut it added: \"As the process is still ongoing and the terms of engagement are confidential, we cannot make any further comment on it at this stage.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Home Office said: \"The chosen company demonstrated that they will be best able to meet the needs of our passport service with a high quality and secure product at the best value for money for our customers and the taxpayer.\"\n\nEarlier, De La Rue boss Martin Sutherland told the BBC's Today programme: \"Over the last few months we have heard ministers happy to come on the media and talk about the new blue passport and the fact that it is an icon of British identity.\n\n\"But now this icon of British identity is going to be manufactured in France.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'd like to ask Theresa May or Amber Rudd to come to my factory and explain to our dedicated workforce why this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon.\"\n\nDe La Rue, which has held the contract to manufacture British passports since 2009, said it it had been \"undercut on price\" by Gemalto.\n\nMr Sutherland said it was unclear whether jobs at the firm's Gateshead factory would be affected. De la Rue employed more than 600 staff at the site last year.\n\nThe company issued a profit warning on Tuesday, which triggered a sharp fall in its share price.\n\nExisting passport holders will continue to use their existing burgundy passports until they expire.\n\nThe Home Office issues more than six million passports annually and is the only provider of passports to British citizens.",

This is her story.\n\nValentine's Day 2018 - 3,300 lives were changed forever.\n\nA day later, sitting in the park with all of the students of my school, we mourned the loss of our friends, teachers, and coaches.\n\nI felt despair the likes of which I've never experienced in my life.\n\nThat night, the activism began. My friends started appearing on CNN, MSNBC, FOX, every show on America's dinnertime TV.\n\nThey talked about what happened in their part of the building, the changes they wanted to see, and the reform that is needed in this country.\n\nBy the next week, they had a name and they had a purpose.\n\nNever Again, they said, as they planned to March For Our Lives in Washington DC, right in front of the legislators who have the power to make the changes they want to see.\n\nIn that moment, I was so proud.\n\nI'm heading up to DC too, as a Douglas student, as a student journalist, and as a future voter in America.\n\nThe experience that myself and my classmates have endured should be something that no child in America should ever have to experience.\n\nExperiencing that sort of loss - in an environment where people expect to be safe - is one of the most traumatizing memories a child can have.\n\nSchool shootings have happened in America before.\n\nI remember being in seventh grade and being told about Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut. Most of the 26 people killed were children aged six and seven.\n\nI remember sitting underneath a table in sixth grade, practicing my first active shooter drill, and having our teacher tearfully tell us about the shooting at Columbine High School, before I was even born, where 13 people were killed.\n\nAfter both of those incidents, government officials promised it wouldn't happen again. They promised they would take precautions.\n\nDebates aired on every news outlet, featuring politicians and pundits talking about issues that they'd argued over for years.\n\nAnd then, people forgot. They stopped caring, and Columbine and Sandy Hook became tragedies that we remember once a year and then forget again because it's too painful.\n\nNot this time. We want to make sure the narrative is, finally, different.\n\nWe want people to know that we will not be silenced.\n\nUnlike the pupils at Columbine, we have the power of social media and citizen journalism to tell our own story our own way.\n\nUnlike those at Sandy Hook kindergarten, we have the age and composure to tell our story ourselves, and advocate for ourselves.\n\nThe voices of children cannot be ignored. The story of the students starts with Stoneman Douglas.",

                "body": "Quitting bad lifestyle habits could cut cancer rates in Scotland by more than 40%, according to a charity.\n\nCancer Research UK said about 13,000 cases a year could be avoided through simple changes.\n\nAnalysis of recent figures suggested Scotland has the largest number of preventable cancer diagnoses in the UK.\n\nDealing with smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption could make the biggest difference.\n\nAcross the UK, the study found that more than 135,000 cases of cancer a year could be prevented.\n\nThe figures, calculated from 2015 cancer data, found that smoking remains the biggest preventable cause of cancer in Scotland despite a continued decline in smoking rates.\n\nTobacco smoke caused 21% of all male cancer cases and 16% in women in 2015, according to the research published in the British Journal of Cancer.\n\nExcess weight is Scotland's biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking.\n\nAbout 7% of cases of cancer a year in Scotland - around six a day - are down to being overweight or obese.\n\nThis amounts to 8% of cases in women and 6% in men.\n\nObesity causes 13 types of the disease, including bowel, breast, womb and kidney cancer. The results suggest that more than 1 in 20 cancer cases could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nIn recent weeks, Cancer Research UK has been running a campaign across the UK featuring posters and radio adverts to increase awareness that obesity can cause cancer.\n\nIn light of the findings, the charity has renewed its call to the Scottish government to introduce legislation to restrict bargain buy special offers on junk food.\n\nProf Linda Bauld, the charity's prevention expert, based at the University of Stirling, said: \"These research findings are startling in that, for the first time, we can see how many cases of cancer in Scotland could be prevented by things like not smoking and keeping a healthy weight.\n\n\"As part of its expected diet and obesity strategy, the Scottish government must tackle what is the biggest preventable health crisis of our generation and make a real difference to the future of everyone in Scotland.\n\n\"In the fight against obesity, laws to restrict the tempting junk food deals that are at the heart of Scotland's poor diet will be crucial.\"\n\nThe third biggest preventable cause of cancer in Scotland is infections, which cause about 1,400 cases of cancer a year. Most of these cases are linked to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and H. Pylori.\n\nSir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: \"Leading a healthy life doesn't guarantee that a person won't get cancer, but it can stack the odds in your favour. These figures show that we each can take positive steps to help reduce our individual risk of the disease.\n\nThe Scottish government said it recognised the role lifestyle played in cancer rates, particularly smoking and obesity.\n\nPublic Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: \"We have recently consulted on a package of bold measures which includes world leading proposals to restrict the promotion and advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar, including bargain buy special offers on junk food.\n\n\"Scotland is also the first part of the UK to have set a target to eliminate smoking from society by 2034.\n\n\"We have already reached a record low in the numbers of teenagers smoking, and halved the number of children being exposed to second hand smoke.",

                "title": "Swiss watchmakers smarten up their act",
                "body": "Luxury watch label Hublot must have spent a small fortune bringing together football royalty - and soccer-mad Usain Bolt - for the launch of a new product.\n\nThey were joined by other legends from South America and Europe to add some sporting glitter to the unveiling of Hublot's first smartwatch, which coincides with the brand's sponsorship of this summer's World Cup.\n\nThe unveiling at Baselworld, the huge annual watch jamboree in the Swiss city of Basel, was the biggest celebrity event of the show.\n\nThat it was for the launch of a smartwatch was also significant. Because this looks like being the year when mainstream Swiss watchmakers accepted that smart devices will be a big part of the wrist-wearing future?\n\nSome Swiss manufacturers have been making smartwatches for years, but in general the industry has been a slow adopter of the technology.\n\nThe products being launched at Baselworld, though, are not the traditional black-faced Apple watch design. They are hybrid devices, mixing traditional features with connectivity.\n\nAnd whereas they were until now all powered by quartz battery technology, Frederique Constant has gone one better with what it claims is the world's first smartwatch with a mechanical movement.\n\nIn other words, the watch is powered by a spring, not a battery.\n\nMany critics of hybrid watches find them a turn-off because the analogue part of the movement - the heart of the watch that makes it work - was quartz.\n\nFrederique Constant's president, Peter Stas, did not hold back on the significance of the company's new Hybrid Manufacture watch. \"It could be a revolution\" for the industry, he says.\n\nPriced at up to $3,800 it's not cheap, but the watch is aimed at traditional - and wealthy - lovers of luxury timepieces who are interested in also owning a connected product.\n\nThe Frederique Constant group also unveiled other smart devices at Baselworld, including the Alpina X, which is aimed at the outdoor sporty type. It has a UV sensor, another first, says Mr Stas.\n\nAnd to prove the company is at the forefront of the digital game, the watch is being launched with a Kickstarter fund-raising campaign.\n\nThis is aimed at getting feedback from what will almost certainly be a younger consumer on the best features and refinements for future developments.\n\nThe Kickstarter move underlines a problem facing traditional watchmakers, particularly in Switzerland where most of the major global brands reside.\n\nSales among younger consumers are falling, with buyers either turning to smart devices or shunning watches entirely.\n\nApple sold 20 million smartwatches last year, about the same number exported by the entire Swiss watchmaking industry.\n\n\"Smartwatches are not going away; Apple is not going away,\" says Mr Stas. But he doesn't want to overstate the Apple threat.\n\n\"Hybrid devices are in many ways opening up a whole new market. They are for people who want traditional design plus something that is connected,\" he says.\n\nIt's possible Apple could one day consider a hybrid design, although Mr Stas thinks this highly unlikely. \"Apple is moving in a different direction. The DNA is different.\"\n\nMondaine Watch also unveiled a smart range this week. However, chairman Andre Bernheim can't see smart devices overtaking sales of traditional watches any time soon.\n\n\"But the time is here when most of the manufacturers will have to have them as part of the product range,\" he says.\n\nHe also doesn't see a threat from Silicon Valley or Samsung.\n\n\"A watch with a traditional design evokes an emotion. Lovers of good watches are passionate about them. You don't throw away a good watch, even if it's broken,\" Mr Bernheim says. The marketing challenge for hybrid manufacturers is to convince buyers they are not just a gadget\n\nThe emotional link is exactly why traditionalists are sceptical about smartwatches. \"For me, it remains a fad; a fashion I think will change,\" one small watchmaker told the BBC.\n\nThe country's famous watch and clock heritage is not just used as a marketing tool. There are still scores of artisans hand-crafting pieces prized by collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nNevertheless, for the president of the Federation of Swiss Watchmakers, Jean-Daniel Pasche, says it is important that the label \"Swiss Made\" becomes a hallmark of quality smartwatches as well as traditional pieces.\n\nHe says: \"We cannot say that smartwatches have affected our market. It has created a new market and both can develop alongside each other. It is important that the Swiss industry is a part of that.\"\n\nAnd although the traditionalists extol the artisanal qualities of Swiss watches, Mr Stas is quick to point out the smartwatch is a far from uncomplicated piece of machinery.\n\nAdding connectivity into an already cramped space has taken years of R&D at Frederique Constant.\n\nThe movement and electronic parts are all made in-house at the company's factory in Geneva. The shield that protects batteries in the company's quartz smartwatches from magnetic interference is patented.\n\nThat Swiss manufacturers finally see the technology as part of the mainstream was underlined with the official launch of the first smart device by the luxury brand Hublot, part of France's LVMH group.\n\nNo expense seems to have been spared to promote Hublot's Big Bang Referee 2018 Fifa World Cup Russia watch (yes, that really is the name) as global football stars of the past were brought together to launch a watch that will have a limited run of 2,018 pieces with a price tag of about $5,800.\n\nBut it was a statement of intent from Hublot. The technology-packed watch, designed with Google and Intel, will be on the wrists of referees at this summer's World Cup.\n\nCrucially for referees, the watch will be linked to new goal-line technology. But users will have pre-match alerts, goal alerts, and up to the second information on such things as red cards and player changes, as well, of course, as standard smartwatch features.\n\nFor a country whose watchmaking heritage goes back centuries, it looks like the industry is entering a new era.",

                "title": "Trump replaces McMaster with John Bolton",
                "body": "President Donald Trump is replacing US National Security Adviser HR McMaster with Bush-era defence hawk and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton.\n\nMr Trump tweeted to thank Gen McMaster, saying he had done an \"outstanding job & will always remain my friend\".\n\nMr Bolton, who has backed attacking North Korea and Iran, told Fox News his job would be to ensure the president has \"the full range of options\".\n\nGen McMaster is the latest high-profile departure from the White House.\n\nLast week, Mr Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by a tweet, replacing him with former CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nMr Bolton, whose appointment does not require US Senate confirmation, will be Mr Trump's third national security adviser in 14 months. He will take the job on 9 April.\n\nResponding to the move, Mr Bolton said he was looking forward to working with President Trump and his team \"to make our country safer at home and stronger abroad\".\n\nMr Bolton, 69, has been a foreign policy hawk in Republican circles for decades, having served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush.\n\nThe second Bush appointed him as US envoy to the UN, during which time diplomats privately criticised Mr Bolton's style as abrasive.\n\nA strident neo-conservative, Mr Bolton helped build the case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be wrong.\n\nKnown for his walrus moustache, Mr Bolton does not appear to have greatly moderated his views since his last spell in government.\n\nHe stands by the invasion of Iraq and has advocated in newspaper op-eds using military force against North Korea and Iran.\n\nAnalysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher\n\nEarlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted: \"I still have some people that I want to change\". He wasn't kidding.\n\nSince then chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, personal lawyer John Dowd and now National Security Adviser HR McMaster have headed to (or been shown) the exits.\n\nOne explanation is that the president feels more comfortable in his job - and more willing to challenge the advice given him by his closest aides.\n\nHe has chafed at the perception that he is being \"handled\" by those around him, and is installing men who agree to action, instead of preaching caution.\n\nWhen it comes to Iran, Mr Bolton and the president are on the same page. Coupled with Mr Tillerson's exit, the US is heading toward a much more confrontational relationship with the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn other ways, however, the former UN ambassador is an unusual choice.\n\nMr Trump frequently has called the Iraq war a colossal mistake - the same war that Mr Bolton enthusiastically promoted during his time in the George W Bush administration.\n\nCandidate Trump regularly espoused non-interventionism. Mr Bolton is a hawk's hawk.\n\nNow that hawk has a perch in the Oval Office.\n\nIn a brief statement on Thursday, Gen McMaster thanked President Trump for appointing him and said he was applying to retire from the US Army later this year.\n\nThe 55-year-old three-star general is leaving after just over a year as national security adviser.\n\nThe White House said Mr Trump and Gen McMaster had \"mutually agreed\" that he would leave. He had been rumoured for weeks to be on his way out.\n\nGen McMaster's departure came a day after someone at the White House leaked to media that Mr Trump was advised this week in briefing documents not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his recent re-election, but did it anyway.\n\nWhite House reporter Tara McKelvey says Gen McMaster seems happy about his decision.\n\nShe says she saw him recently joking with colleagues in the West Wing, and he had already worked out his exit strategy.\n\nThe president had reportedly found Gen McMaster's briefings to be grating. He was also described as aggressive and prone to lecture.\n\nGen McMaster replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after less than a month in the job for misleading the White House about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsay Graham described Mr Bolton's appointment as \"good news for America's allies and bad news for America's enemies\".\n\nSenator Chris Coons, a Democrat, said the new national security adviser's stance on Iran and North was \"overly aggressive at best and downright dangerous at worst\".\n\nAbraham Denmark, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for East Asia in the Obama administration, said: \"Bolton has long been an advocate for pre-emptive military action against North Korea, and his appointment as national security adviser is a strong signal that President Trump remains open to these options.\"\n\nBonnie Glaser, from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: \"Bolton has long supported regime change in North Korea and closer ties with Taiwan. Fasten your seat belts.\"",

                "body": "Championship club Reading have parted company with manager Jaap Stam after a run of just one win in 18 league games.\n\nFormer Manchester United and Netherlands defender Stam, 45, led the club to the Championship play-off final in his first season at the club.\n\nBut poor results this term have seen Reading slip to 20th, within three points of the relegation zone.\n\nSaturday's 3-2 defeat by Norwich City left the Royals without a win in their past nine Championship matches.\n\n\"Sometimes there's a new direction necessary in a club and the tide has to change,\" Stam told Dutch football publication Voetbal International.\n\n\"This can happen once in a while in a young manager's career and especially in the Championship, where clubs are changing managers more and more often.\"\n\nMajority shareholders Mr Yongge Dai and Ms Xiu Li Dai said in a statement the club had \"wanted to give Jaap every opportunity to turn around what has been a difficult and challenging Championship campaign\".\n\n\"After careful consideration, the decision has been made that a change is now necessary,\" it added. \"We will now focus on identifying and recruiting the right person to take the club forward.\"\n\nReading gave Stam his first coaching role in English football and he signed a new contract running until the end of the 2018-19 season in July after being linked with potential vacancies in the Premier League.\n\nBut, his departure eight months later leaves the Royals seeking their fifth managerial appointment since Brian McDermott's first spell at the club ended in March 2013.\n\nReading's next match is on Friday, 30 March against QPR at the Madejski Stadium and the club are yet to appoint a caretaker manager.\n\n\"Last season, we did exceptionally well and we tried to stand out in the Championship with our style of play,\" former Ajax assistant manager Stam said.\n\n\"This season, we wanted to make further steps, but due to various reasons, this didn't happen. It's a real shame as Reading is a wonderful club and I really wish them well.\"\n\nTim Dellor, BBC Radio Berkshire sports editor\n\nWe have been waiting for this news for a while as the form has been dire in the past three months.\n\nI think most Reading fans would have anticipated this news a long time ago. The club, the board and the owners have been incredibly slow to react.\n\nMost clubs would have got rid of their manager way before now had the form been as bad as this.\n\nFinally the decision has come. Whether it was too late or the correct decision, time will tell.",

It invests in infrastructure. It funds school safety and mental health,\" he continued.\n\nIt provides $1.6bn in funding for Mr Trump's border wall, far short of the $25bn the White House had sought.\n\nIt also includes a provision that would legally allow the slaughter of wild horses roaming the American West.\n\nIn a last-minute addition, it added funds to include the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for gun sales.\n\nIt includes a 9% budget increase for the US National Park Service to address a repair backlog that advocates say are urgently needed.\n\n\"This is a necessary investment with broad returns, and we hope this trend continues,\" in future spending bills, said Kristen Brengel of the non-profit National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nThe bill also boosts military spending.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called it \"a tremendous victory for the American people\".\n\n\"If you want to think you're getting a wall, just think it and sign the bill,\" she said, in a remark aimed at Mr Trump's Republican supporters in Congress.\n\nBut despite cross-party support, at least 90 conservative Republicans objected to the measure, calling it government spending run amok.\n\n\"This omnibus [spending bill] doesn't just forget the promises we made to voters, it flatly rejects them,\" Representative Mark Meadows, head of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, said after the vote.\n\n\"This is wrong.

But that is a massive job and the French state can't afford it.\n\nThat's why the cathedral has launched an international plea for private funds, aimed principally at the U.S. On this very roof after all once cavorted the hunchback of Disney fame - oh yes, and the book.\n\nMichel Picot, Head of fundraising\n\n\"Not begging, but asking for help is the best thing to do because it's not, it's not a French monument, it's not a Paris monument, it's a worldwide monument.\"\n\nTime, the elements and the petrol engine have exacted a heavy toll on Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nToday the imaginative genius of its medieval craftsmen is being eroded into annihilation. Without urgent help, much more will be lost.\n\nWhat is causing the masonry to crumble away?\n\nPollution, combined with the cold and rain, are eating into the limestone, making it crumble.\n\nThe first stone of Notre Dame was laid in 1163 and it took 180 years to complete. Today the cathedral stands as a Gothic masterpiece.",

He is handcuffed by the officers.\n\nWhile discussing whether to perform CPR, one officer said: \"Hey, mute\". The audio went silent for two minutes.\n\nMr Clark was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHis name was not officially released but his fiancee, Salena Manni, identified him. He had two sons, aged one and three.\n\nThe shooting has reignited the debate about interactions between law enforcement and African Americans.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Sacramento group issued a public statement calling the shooting a \"murder\" by police after reviewing the video. They organised a public event in his honour on Thursday.\n\n\"He was at the wrong place at the wrong time in his own backyard?\" Mr Clark's grandmother, Sequita Thompson, asked the Sacramento Bee newspaper.\n\nThe videos were first shown to the family before they were released to the public.\n\nPolice training expert Ed Obayashi told the newspaper that the officers' actions were \"reasonable\".\n\n\"It looks bad, but (the officers) are still perceiving a threat... he's not obeying,\" said Mr Obayashi.\n\n\"The problem is he's got an object in his hand which unfortunately even during daylight could easily be considered a gun.\"\n\nMs Thompson, who heard the gunfire, said that she never heard police ask her grandson what he was holding.\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said the investigation needs to be completed before he could draw any conclusions.\n\n\"Based on the videos alone, I cannot second guess the split-second decisions of our officers and I'm not going to do that,\" the mayor said in an statement to US media.",

But tonight, the prime minister's main goal is to try to stiffen up the EU's response to the threat from Russia.\n\nAt home, Theresa May has taken a firm rhetorical tone, in response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury.\n\nWhat the government hopes for in the next 24 hours though, is that the other EU nations are willing to come alongside in the same way.\n\nThe US, UK, France and Germany signed up to a very strong and uncompromising statement last week.\n\nBut the prime minister will tonight try to create a similarly strong and united front among the other 27 EU member states.\n\nIn extremely blunt language UK government officials have been briefing that Russia is a \"strategic enemy\" of Europe.\n\nTheresa May will tell her counterparts that it is a risk to all. Number 10 wants a robust statement from everyone in response, a show of unity, and by implication, other countries to look to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin.\n\nShe might not get her way, however. EU countries may share the UK's security concerns about Russia.\n\nBut member states like Greece and Hungary have their own reasons for concerns about taking a more hostile approach.\n\nCan the prime minister get consensus tonight, even persuade other countries to start taking similar action against Russia?\n\nIt would never have been a straightforward quest to get more than two dozen countries into the same position.\n\nBut with one foot out of the door, does the UK's foreign policy influence have the same stretch?\n\nThis is one of the first tests of whether Brexit is harming Britain's powers of persuasion.\n\nWill the rest of the EU see Theresa May tonight as the close friend who can hold the room, or with a year until exit, has she just become the awkward neighbour?",

                "body": "US President Donald Trump has suggested that former US Vice-President Joe Biden would lose a fight with him after Mr Biden openly fantasised of a punch-up.\n\nMr Trump called him \"crazy\" and \"weak\" after Mr Biden said: \"If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\".\n\nThis is not the first time the two septuagenarians have discussed the prospect of a tussle.\n\nMr Biden has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump since the presidential election.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Mr Trump, 71, took to Twitter to accuse \"crazy Joe Biden\" of \"trying to act like a tough guy\".\n\nMr Trump's Twitter response came after Mr Biden, 75, said in a Miami speech on Tuesday: \"They asked me if I'd like to debate this gentleman, and I said 'no.'\n\n\"I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.'\"\n\n\"I've been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life,\" said the Delaware Democrat, who served as vice-president under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017.\n\n\"I'm a pretty damn good athlete. Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign Mr Biden said that Mr Trump's 2005 recorded comments about how his fame allowed him to \"grab\" women by the genitals made him want to fight the then-Republican candidate \"behind the gym\".\n\nIt's revealing that Donald Trump, who has a knack for finding a political opponent's weakness, could only muster a \"Crazy Joe\" nickname and \"no, I'd beat YOU up\" rejoinder.\n\nJoe Biden has his political shortcomings - he ran for the president twice and barely made a ripple - but the career politician's carefully cultivated blue-collar image makes him a challenging target for Mr Trump.\n\nA 2016 presidential matchup between the two would have been a rollicking affair and has generated countless \"what ifs\". Would Mr Biden have won the Midwest and bested Mr Trump?\n\nSuch speculation may not be all academic, as Mr Biden still hasn't ruled out a 2020 campaign. He'd be 77 on election day, four years older than Mr Trump, but he's made the kind of early manoeuvres that could lead to another run at the presidency.\n\nIf his health holds, the Trump-Biden tussle - in the ballot box, not the schoolyard - could end up as more than just tough talk.\n\nAxios reported on Thursday that Mr Biden - who is rumoured to be considering running for president in 2020 - has hired a group of \"big-name\" policymakers to serve on his Biden Institute Policy Advisory Board.\n\nLast month both men campaigned for rival candidates in a congressional election in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe district, which Mr Trump handily won by 20 points in 2016, voted to elect a Democrat.",

His new hire, Joseph DiGenova, has suggested the president is the target of an FBI conspiracy. And last weekend, for the first time, Mr Trump took aim at Mr Mueller by name in a series of incendiary tweets.\n\nMr Mueller is reportedly looking into Mr Trump's business dealings and foreign contacts with the Trump administration beyond just Russia - suggesting that his investigation is nowhere near drawing to a close.\n\nThe president has been counselled to be patient.

                "body": "Online retail giant ASOS is the latest victim of a branding spelling mistake.\n\nThey accidently printed 17,000 plastic bags with the word \"onilne\" printed, rather than \"online\".\n\nThe fashion house then owned up to the error on social media, and joked the packaging would now be a limited edition.\n\nBut it's not the first time brands have made mistakes like this, so here are some of the best ones.\n\nDuring the presidential election in 2012, Republican candidate Mitt Romney's mobile app, misspelled 'America.'\n\nThe actress was spotted with \"Times Up\" on her arm to mark the Hollywood movement, but fans quickly spotted a missing apostrophe.\n\nShe joked about it after.\n\nDonald Trump had been president for just a day when he posted a tweet with a typo.\n\nAnd of course, people were ready to screenshot it.\n\nAfter the ASOS blunder, Sharee was keen to point out that Marks and Spencer had also made a similar error in the past.\n\nKeyboard slips can be embarrassing, but they can also be costly. In 2005, a division of one of Japan's largest investment banks, Mizuho Securities Co, listed shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\nBut instead of selling them for 610,000 yen each, a typing error led to the sale of 610,000 shares costing one yen. The mistake cost the company ?128m.\n\nPenguin Australia printed in The Pasta Bible the word \"people\" instead of \"pepper\".\n\nAnd that hopefully explains why a recipe required \"salt and freshly ground black people\". The publisher had 7,000 copies of the book destroyed.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York displayed outdated fare information, reducing the journeys by fifty cents. It had to stop circulating the old rates and it ended up costing them a quarter of a million dollars (?177,000).",

                "body": "A senior US official has said that the European Union (EU) and six other countries will be exempt from steel and aluminium tariffs announced by President Trump, at least temporarily.\n\nTrade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a Senate panel that Mr Trump had decided to \"pause\" the import duties while further discussions took place.\n\nThe tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium are due to come into effect on Friday.\n\nThe EU had argued it should be exempt.\n\nAside from the EU Mr Lighthizer said Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea would be exempted.\n\n\"The idea that the president has is that, based on a certain set of criteria, that some countries should get out,\" he told the Senate committee hearing.\n\n\"There are countries with whom we're negotiating and the question becomes the obvious one that you think, as a matter of business, how does this work?\n\n\"So what he has decided to do is to pause the imposition of the tariffs with respect to those countries.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the EU's trade commissioner said the bloc would \"stand up to the bullies\" over protectionism.\n\nCecilia Malmstr?m said protectionism was being \"used as a weapon to threaten and intimidate us\".\n\nIn announcing exemptions for the European Union, Argentina, Australia, South Korea and Brazil, the Trump administration has effectively narrowed the countries that it is targeting with its protectionist trade policies. It also blunts the potential fallout to the US economy from the implementation of these trade barriers.\n\nBut if the countries granted exemptions are removed from that total - including Canada and Mexico, whose exemptions had already been announced - then less than a third of US steel imports would be subject to tariffs.\n\nThis significantly lowers the potential economic impact of the tariffs - as well as the potential help it might provide to domestic steel industry here in the United States.\n\nAnd it suggests that in steel tariffs, as with many policy actions the White House has taken, the reality of what is being done falls slightly short of the rhetoric.\n\nGareth Stace, a director with the trade association UK Steel, said the temporary exemption from tariffs would be \"greeted with an enormous sigh of relief\" by the UK's steel sector.\n\n\"It now provides us with the breathing room to find a more permanent solution.\n\n\"The alternative would be a severe curtailment of our ability to export to the US. With some 350,000 tonnes of steel sold to the US last year, 7% of our total exports, it is clear any tariffs would ultimately hit the sector hard,\" he added.",

Your data is yours and you have a right to control its use.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, which has repeatedly said it did nothing wrong in the way it processed data, is under fire for allegedly using the personal information of millions of Facebook users for political campaigning, without their consent or knowledge.\n\nThe company could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe scandal has also plunged Facebook into crisis, with founder Mark Zuckerberg admitting that \"a breach of trust\" had occurred between the social network and its users.\n\nMany legal experts believe that it could be a landmark case, especially as it comes in the midst of a major crisis for Facebook, which stands accused of failing to carry out appropriate checks on how data harvested from its users was being used.\n\n\"It could be a crucial moment,\" said Dr Paul Bernal, a lecturer in information technology and media law at the University of East Anglia.\n\n\"But this case will only be pivotal if it produces other actions.\n\n\"Facebook has faced other storms of this kind before - but now it faces legal action and regulatory action and has to portray itself as not the really bad guy, which will mean changing its policies.\"\n\nOther key internet figures have also been speaking about the crisis.\n\nThe inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, said the crisis was \"a pivotal moment for the internet\" and urged Mr Zuckerberg to \"fix\" the issues around data sharing.\n\n\"It won't be easy - but if companies work with governments, activists, academics and web users we can make sure platforms serve humanity,\" he tweeted.",

                "body": "A High Court hearing on a bid by the UK's information commissioner to search the office of Cambridge Analytica has been adjourned until Friday.\n\nElizabeth Denham is seeking a warrant to access to the databases and servers of the London consultancy amid claims it improperly used data from Facebook users on behalf of political clients.\n\nThe move is part of her wider inquiry into political campaigning.\n\nBoth Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica has claimed it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office said it was seeking a warrant because Cambridge Analytica did not respond to its 7 March request to access records and data it held.\n\nMs Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in \"an unauthorised way\", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data.\n\nShe said Facebook had been told to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking in the Commons, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, said this week's revelations represented a \"turning point\" in the debate on the use of personal information stored online.\n\nIn response to a question from Labour MP Chi Onwurah, who called for the introduction of a \"digital bill of rights\", Mr Hancock said: \"It is increasingly clear that we need a new settlement with these big tech companies.\"\n\n\"This Wild West free-for-all of the internet companies has got to come to an end,\" he added.\n\nShadow digital minister Liam Byrne said it was \"ludicrous\" that a search warrant had still not been obtained by the ICO and suggested it did not have sufficient power to conduct investigations properly.\n\nBut Mr Hancock said: \"The truth is the data protection bill currently before Parliament is all about strengthening this enforcement and strengthening people's consent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said while the case raised a \"serious issue\" and data harvesting had to be \"dealt with,\" the party would still maintain its Facebook account.\n\nIt has also emerged that ISBA, a trade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook this week.\n\nThe Times reports if Facebook fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may decide to spend money elsewhere.\n\nIn 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life.\n\nAbout 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends.\n\nFacebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but Mr Wylie says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up.\n\nHe claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Donald Trump material to them.\n\nDr Kogan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was \"perfectly legal and within the terms of service\" and he was being used as a \"scapegoat\".\n\nA aUK parliamentary committee has called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence about its use of personal data.\n\nDamian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of previously \"misleading\" the committee.\n\nUS senators have called on Mr Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how his company will protect users, while consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission has also reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook.\n\nThe head of the European Parliament also said it would investigate to see if the data was misused.\n\nOn Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had \"sought and received assurances\" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to \"request all relevant evidence in their possession\".\n\nThere have also been calls for an investigation into the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya.\n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke cover for the first time since the revelations emerged to say that a \"breach of trust\" had occurred and he was \"really sorry\".\n\nEarlier Facebook said users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said Dr Kogan was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes.\n\nThey added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's rules.\n\nFor its part, Cambridge Analytica says it did delete the data when told to by Facebook.\n\nIt suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix following comments which appeared to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.\n\nHowever, the firm said the report of comments, secretly recorded by Channel 4 News, had \"grossly misrepresented\" Mr Nix's comments.\n\nBefore Channel 4 News had broadcast any of the secret filming, Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been \"deliberately entrapped\".",

Some drifts into large systems of circulating ocean currents, known as gyres. Once trapped in a gyre, the plastic will break down into microplastics, which may be ingested by sea life.\n\nThe message of the study is clear, said Laurent Lebreton.\n\n\"It goes back to how we use plastic,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not going to get away from plastic - in my opinion it's very useful, in medicine, transportation and construction, but I think we must divert the way we use plastic, particularly in terms of single-use plastic and those objects that have a very short service lifespan.\"",

                "body": "Syrian rebels and their families have begun leaving a key town in the besieged Eastern Ghouta area as part of an evacuation deal with the government.\n\nState media said 88 rebels and 459 civilians had gone from Harasta so far.\n\nSome 1,500 fighters from the Ahrar al-Sham faction and 6,000 civilians are to be transported from Harasta to the northern rebel-held province of Idlib.\n\nThe evacuation deal is the first agreed since pro-government forces stepped up an assault on the enclave a month ago.\n\nA monitoring group says air and artillery strikes have killed 1,500 civilians, while at least 50,000 others have fled the siege on foot in recent days.\n\nThe exodus came after soldiers and allied militiamen drove rebel forces out of about 70% of the region, cutting it into three pockets - one of them around Harasta.\n\nThe implementation of the evacuation deal, which was brokered by the government's ally Russia, began on Thursday morning with a prisoner exchange.\n\nState TV reported that 13 people held by the rebels were freed. It interviewed a soldier among them, who thanked God and the army for his release.\n\nLater, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent confirmed that its personnel had entered Harasta and it posted photos of them helping civilians on to buses.\n\nBy 14:00 (12:00 GMT) on Thursday, a total of 547 people had left Harasta in buses, according to the official Sana news agency.\n\nAhrar al-Sham, which had controlled Harasta, agreed to lay down its weapons in Harasta in return for safe passage for its fighters to the rebel stronghold of Idlib.\n\nThe BBC's Martin Patience in Beirut says the deal may put pressure on the rebel groups that control other parts of the Eastern Ghouta to follow suit.\n\nSimilar deals have been on the table with Jaysh al-Islam - which controls the northern pocket around Douma - and Faylaq al-Rahman - which controls the southern pocket around Arbin and Zamalka - but have yet to get anywhere.\n\nBoth factions have vowed to keep fighting, even as they have been driven further and further back.\n\nGovernment air strikes killed at least 19 people on Thursday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nThe UK-based monitoring group also said more than 4,000 civilians had fled Douma on foot and crossed into government territory through the al-Wafideen checkpoint over the past 24 hours. The civilians were leaving under an agreement between Jaysh al-Islam and Russia, it added.\n\nRockets and mortars are also still being fired by rebels into government-held districts of Damascus.\n\nA police source told Sana that two civilians were killed and four others injured by a shell that hit the Barzeh area on Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, state media said rockets hit a busy market in the Kashkoul area, killing at least 35 people.",

Technically, it still hasn't.\n\nMr Zuckerberg's words were not an explanation, but a legal and political defence. This company knows it is heading into battle on multiple fronts.\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nIn 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life.\n\nAbout 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends.\n\nFacebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up.\n\nMr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them.\n\nThe firm's chief executive, Alexander Nix - who was suspended on Tuesday - was secretly recorded in a Channel 4 investigation saying the London-based company ran Donald Trump's digital campaign during the 2016 US election.\n\n\"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\" he added.\n\nDr Kogan has said he was told by Cambridge Analytica everything they had done was legal, and that he was being made a \"scapegoat\" by the firm and Facebook.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFacebook says users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so.\n\nFor its part, Cambridge Analytica says it did delete the data when told to by Facebook.\n\nIt suspended Mr Nix following his comments which appeared to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.\n\nHowever, the firm said the report of comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 News had \"grossly misrepresented\" Mr Nix's comments.\n\nUS senators have called on Mr Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how his company will protect users, while consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission has reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook.\n\nThe head of the European Parliament also said it would investigate to see if the data was misused.\n\nThe UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is attempting to obtain a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nMeanwhile, a UK parliamentary committee has called for Mr Zuckerberg to give evidence about its use of personal data.\n\nThere have also been calls for an investigation into the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya.\n\nHave you deleted your Facebook account?

I've never lived anywhere else, I would never want to live anywhere else.\"\n\nQuinn reportedly said in her original remarks that even though she was a \"qualified lesbian\" when she ran for mayor in 2013, Nixon did not support her.\n\nShe later told the New York Daily News: \"My point was to draw a similarity between the two of us and to draw a clear contrast as it relates to her being completely unqualified to be the governor of the state of New York.\"",

                "body": "The maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) should be cut to ?30 or less, the UK's Gambling Commission has recommended.\n\nCurrently people can bet up to ?100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, such as roulette and blackjack.\n\nIt comes after a consultation on FOBTs for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nThe commission says the maximum stake on \"slots games\", like traditional fruit machine games, should be ?2.\n\nThe advice has been given to support the government with its review of gambling machines, with a decision expected in coming weeks.\n\nFOTBs have come under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm. The machines have been called the \"crack cocaine\" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems.\n\nAnd Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, told the BBC that its remit when considering stake recommendations had been \"to protect vulnerable people from harm\".\n\nFixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button.\n\nThe Gambling Commission's report said the ?30 limit for casino-type games had been recommended, because a higher limit means players could potentially \"lose large amounts of money in a short space of time\".\n\nThe government now has to decide whether to accept the commission's advice on the stake limit, or decide to impose a lower figure.\n\nThe government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a \"call for evidence\" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players.\n\nNow Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur has said: \"We've put consumers at the heart of our advice - advice which is based on the best available evidence and is focused on reducing the risk of gambling-related harm.\n\n\"In our judgment, a stake cut for Fixed Odds Betting Terminals alone doesn't go far enough to protect vulnerable people.\n\n\"That is why we have recommended a stake cut plus a comprehensive package of other measures to protect consumers. We have proposed actions that will tackle both the risk of harm and provide solutions that are sustainable in the longer term.\"\n\nThese include working with the gambling industry and others on steps to make limit-setting more effective - this could include ending sessions when consumers reach time and money limits.\n\nAnother recommendation is a proposed ban on machines being able to allow different - high and low stake - categories of games to be played in a single session.\n\nFOBT machines generated more than ?1.8bn in tax revenue last year.\n\nHowever, Mr Miller of the Gambling Commission told the BBC that although the gambling industry had argued that any cuts in stakes would harm the sector, those arguments played no part in its recommendations to government.\n\nEarlier government estimates had suggested that a ?2 cap could lead to a ?5.5bn loss in tax revenues over the next 10 years.\n\nBut MPs on the FOBTs All Party Parliamentary Group have said large gambling sector losses have been exaggerated.\n\nRather, quoting the Centre for Economic and Business Research think tank, they say the cost of problem gambling in the UK is ?1.5bn a year, \"when its impact on wider social welfare is taken into account - including areas such as employment, mental health and financial stability\".\n\nInvestors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms climbed strongly after the commission's announcement, with Ladbrokes Coral closing 2.8% higher and William Hill shares ending 4% up.\n\n\"This should be a relief for the sector as the worst-case scenario looks to have been avoided. Ministers will now have to justify a cut below ?30 on grounds of significant risk of harm,\" said analyst Neil Wilson at ETX Capital.\n\nThe Association of British Bookmakers has claimed that a ?30 maximum stake would see 2,100 betting shops closed and 10,000 jobs lost.\n\n\"We fully understand that there is public concern and that there will be a stake cut to reduce the levels of losses on machines in betting shops,\" it said after the Gambling Commission's announcement.\n\n\"In the interim, we remain committed to introducing further measures to address problem gambling and will continue to work with all interested parties.\"\n\nBut Grant Humphrey, Betting and Gaming lead at professional services firm EY warned: \"A ?30 maximum stake may lead to shop closures and job losses and could lead to a wave of industry consolidation.\"\n\nTom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said: \"This is a deeply disappointing report from the Gambling Commission who appear to have caved in to industry pressure.\n\n\"These machines are at the heart of the UK's hidden epidemic of problem gambling. The Government must cut the stake to ?2 on all FOBT machines including the highly addictive roulette style games, as well as increase the delay between each play.\"\n\nCarolyn Harris, chair of the FOBTs All Party Parliamentary Group, said: \"The problem is that these machines are addictive.\n\n\"It has got to be ?2 [maximum stake], nothing else is acceptable. It is now for the Secretary of State to make a decision.\"\n\nThe Gambling Commission recommendations have been sent to Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Ministers now have to decide whether to implement any of the commission's recommendations.\n\nCharity GambleAware said it welcomed the commission's \"contributions to the ongoing discussion\".\n\n\"In the meantime, we are waiting to hear what the ministers conclude in their review, and hope to hear the results soon.\"",

But he was freed in October 2015 due to overcrowded prisons.\n\nHe fled via Austria to Germany, where he arrived with no documents a month later, claiming he was 17 years old.\n\nBecause his DNA did not show up on a European register and there was no international arrest warrant for him, Freiburg's youth welfare office placed him with a foster family.\n\nBut during the trial evidence emerged suggesting that he was in fact from Iran and could be as old as 32.\n\nThe court accepted expert assessments, including X-rays of his bone structure and a dental analysis, and tried him as an adult, AFP news agency reports.\n\nMaria Ladenburger, a medical student who volunteered for a refugee charity, was attacked on her way home from a party.\n\nPresiding Judge Kathrin Schenk said: \"He knew that she was still alive as he laid her in the Dreisam [River], that she would drown, that she had to drown.\"\n\nThe murder shocked Germany and fuelled the backlash against Chancellor Angela Merkel's \"open door\" policy, which allowed more than one million migrants and refugees into the country in 2015.\n\nIncidents involving migrants, including the sex attacks during New Year's Eve celebrations in Cologne, helped boost the country's far right in last year's election.\n\nThe anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party entered the federal parliament for the first time, while Mrs Merkel's CDU party had its worst electoral performance in almost 70 years.",

In response, defendant Savage violently struck Ms Hwang's arm three times with his hand,\" lawyer Anahita Sedaghatfar wrote in the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nShe also claimed that Fox \"essentially admonished\" Hwang to \"keep her mouth shut and not report the harassment and ultimate physical assault perpetrated upon her or she would 'never work in the industry again'.\"\n\nHwang is seeking damages and compensation over claims of assault, battery and harassment.\n\n20th Century Fox said that Savage, 41, was cleared by an internal investigation.\n\nIn a statement, the actor - who played Kevin Arnold in The Wonder Years during the late 80s and early 90s - praised the \"tremendous courage\" of those who have come forward in the Me Too movement, and denied the allegations made against him.\n\nHe said: \"I was made aware that a woman working in the costume department of a show I was on almost three years ago has claimed that I treated her harshly on set simply because she was a woman.\n\n\"Fox conducted an extensive internal investigation into her claims, a process in which I fully participated.\n\n\"Fox determined that there was absolutely no evidence to support these accusations.

                "body": "A Russian diplomat has called for Boris Johnson to resign after he compared Russia's staging of the football World Cup to Hitler hosting the Olympics.\n\nAndrey Pritsepov, the consul general in Scotland, said the foreign secretary's comment \"crossed all diplomatic lines\".\n\nAnd he insisted it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest Vladimir Putin would use the tournament for political ends.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May will warn later that Russia poses a threat to Western democracy.\n\nAnd she will urge EU leaders to stand together in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nMrs May has accused Russia of being behind the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury - something which Moscow denies.\n\nHer foreign secretary, Mr Johnson, told a Commons committee on Wednesday that it was \"certainly right\" to compare \"what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup\" this summer with the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany, which were used as a propaganda tool by Hitler.\n\nMr Johnson added: \"I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event.\"\n\nDowning Street later confirmed Mr Johnson was speaking on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Kremlin has described Mr Johnson's comments as \"disgusting\", \"unacceptable\" and \"not worthy of a foreign minister of any country\".\n\nWhen asked about Mr Johnson's remarks by the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Pritsepov said that \"maybe it is time for him to go\".\n\nHe also claimed it was \"outrageous\" and \"very shortsighted\" for Mrs May to have blamed Russia for the nerve agent attack \"before the investigations have started\".\n\nScotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has joined Mrs May in condemning Russia over the chemical attack, saying it was \"very clear that Russia cannot be permitted to unlawfully kill or attempt to kill people on the streets of the UK with impunity.\"\n\nThe Russian Consulate in Edinburgh said on Wednesday that it had noted \"with regret\" that the Scottish government had \"unequivocally provided their full support to this hostile standoff with Russia\".\n\nBut it said it had been \"receiving warm messages of support and consideration from many residents of Scotland and want to thank them all profoundly.\"\n\nMr Pritsepov said he had since had a \"very constructive meeting\" with the Scottish government, where they had agreed \"that we will talk to each other, that we would act positively, and that we will try to de-escalate the stand-off\".\n\nAnd he suggested that residents of Scotland who applied for visas to travel to Russia would not be affected by the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats as much as those in England and Wales.\n\nWhen asked whether it would now be harder for UK resident to get through the visa process, he said: \"Not for residents of Scotland because we are providing all consular support.\n\n\"As to England and Wales, my ambassador has warned that the waiting time could double.\"",

                "title": "Curiosity rover: 2,000 days on Mars",
                "body": "Nasa's Curiosity rover, also known as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), is celebrating 2,000 martian days (sols) investigating Gale Crater on the Red Planet. In that time, the robot has made some remarkable observations. Here are just a few of them, chosen by the Curiosity science team.\n\nLooking back: In the history of the space age, some of the most dramatic planetary images ever taken have been of Earth, but photographed looking back from deep space. This image by Mastcam on the Curiosity Rover shows our planet as a faint pinpoint of light in the martian night sky. Every day scientists from across the world drive the Curiosity rover and study the Red Planet about 100 million miles from Earth.\n\nThe beginning: The first image that Curiosity took came back just 15 minutes after landing on 5 August 2012. Getting our imagery and other data relies on the timing of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) overpasses, a pattern which determines the structure of the martian working day, or sol. It shows a grainy Front Hazard Camera image - the team normally use these to help avoid obstacles - of our ultimate goal Mount Sharp. When this image came back we knew it was going to be a successful mission.\n\nRiver pebbles: Once we had started driving (16 sols after landing), we soon came across these pebble beds. The rounded shape of the clasts shows that they formed in an ancient, shallow river, flowing from the surrounding four-billion-year-old highlands into Gale Crater. The inset Mastcam image shows one of the pebbles in close-up. Contrary to our expectations before MSL, the crust being eroded by the rivers was not all dark, primitive basalt but a more evolved composition and mineralogy. Pebbles caught up in this ancient martian river are causing us to rethink our view of how the underlying igneous crust and mantle of Mars formed.\n\nAncient lake: Before landing and in the early part of the mission, the team wasn't sure what all of the terrains identified from MRO HiRISE orbital imagery were. They might have been lava flows or lake sediments, without close-up \"ground truth\" it was impossible to be certain. This image settled the debate and was a seminal stage in Martian exploration. Yellowknife Bay is made of layers of fine grained sand and muds, which were deposited as rivers flowed into an ancient Gale Crater lake. We made our first of 16 drill holes on sol 182 - we do this to get rock in to the spectrometers housed in the body of our rover - here at the John Klein site. The results - including identifying clays, organics and nitrogen-bearing compounds - showed us that this had been a habitable environment for microbial life. The next discovery step - Was There Life? - remains to be determined.\n\nDeep water: The Pahrump Hills section Curiosity encountered around sol 753 was key for developing our understanding of Gale's past environment. Here the rover observed thinly layered mudstones, which represented mud particles settling out from suspension within the deeper lake. The Gale Lake has been a long-standing, deep body of water.\n\nAn unconformity: At Mount Stimson, the rover identified from sol 980 a thick sandstone unit overlying the lake deposits, separated by a geological feature called an unconformity. This unconformity represents a time where erosive processes took over after millions of years when the lake had finally dried up - to form a new land surface. This shows evidence of events happening over \"deep time\", similar to those that the pioneering geologist James Hutton described in his field work in the late 18th Century at Siccar Point on the Scottish Coast.\n\nDesert sands: The Namib dunes encountered close up by Curiosity at sol 1192 is a small part of the great Bagnold dune field. Its the first active dunefield explored on the surface of another planet and Curiosity had to pick its way carefully along and through the field as moving sands are an obstacle for rovers. Although the Martian atmosphere is a fraction of the density of that of Earth's, it is still capable of transporting sediment and is capable of creating such beautiful structures akin to those we see in the deserts of Earth.\n\nWind sculptures: The Murray Buttes, photographed by Mastcam on sol 1448, formed of the same sandstones observed at Mount Stimson and represent a lithified dune field created by dunes similar to those in the present day Bagnold dune field. These desert-formed sandstones sit above an unconformity, and this suggests that after a long period with a humid climate, the climate became drier and wind became the dominant agent shaping the environment at Gale Crater.\n\nDried muds: Curiosity is able to perform detailed analyses of the Gale rocks with the ChemCam laser and telescope mounted on its mast. Here on sol 1555 at Schooner Head we came across a set of ancient mudcracks and sulphate veins. On Earth, lakes typically dry up in places around their margins and here on Mars the Gale lake was no different. You can see the red crosses where we fired the laser at the rock, creating a small plasma spark, with the wavelength of light in the spark telling us the composition of the mudstone and veins.\n\nCloudy skies: This sequence of images was taken with Curiosity's Navigational Cameras (NavCam) on sol 1971 as we pointed them towards the sky. Occasionally on the cloudiest of Martian days we are able to make out faint clouds in the sky. These images are processed to highlight differences, allowing us to see the clouds move across the sky. This sequence shows previously unseen cloud features with prominent zig-zag patterns visible. The three images, from start to finish, cover approximately 12 minutes on Mars.\n\nObligatory 'selfie': The Curiosity rover has gained a reputation over the years that rivals those of Instagram users for its many \"selfies\" taken along its traverse. These selfies are not all for show though as they help the team track the state of the rover throughout the course of the mission for changes such as wheel wear and dust accumulation. Curiosity's self-portraits are taken using the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) situated on its robotic arm and are generated by merging a series of high-resolution images into a mosaic. This one taken on sol 1065 at the Buckskin locality shows the main mast of Curiosity with its ChemCam telescope used to determine rock compositions, and the Mastcam cameras. In the foreground you can see that Curiosity has just been drilling, leaving a small grey pile of tailings.\n\nLong drive: This panorama taken with the rover's Mastcam shows Curiosity's 18.4km drive over the last 5 years from the Bradbury landing site to its current location on the Vera Rubin Ridge (VRR). VRR was formerly known as Hematite Ridge due to the high concentrations of the iron oxide mineral hematite detected here from orbit. As hematite largely forms in the presence of water, this location was a high-priority target for the Curiosity rover science team to investigate in order to assess how the conditions in Gale Crater changed over its geological history. This key location is the perfect spot for Curiosity to spend its 2000th sol, and for all of us to look back on the many discoveries made so far in the mission.",

I reckon if they start bringing in a couple of rules, they can build on them and bring in a total ban further down the line\".\n\nHe also thinks President Trump's suggestion of training school staff to handle guns would end up \"making more of a problem\".\n\nAndrew's hoping to attend Saturday's March for Our Lives in Edinburgh, set up in solidarity with the Never Again campaign.\n\nHis mum was involved in campaigning for gun laws to change in the UK - back then he says it was all about handing out flyers and petitions.\n\n\"It's even more admirable in my opinion that it's young people that are doing the campaigning [in America] and they're not getting shut down by adults.\"\n\nAmanda Krp is 23-years-old and lives in Orlando, Florida.\n\nShe's a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and believes the answer \"is what our founding fathers figured out a long time ago - arm the people\".\n\nAmanda hunts animals and tells Newsbeat she also enjoys practising her \"marksmanship skills\".\n\nHer dad's a police officer and she says she was taught the responsible use of firearms from a young age.\n\n\"Honestly, I wish there were no bad guys, no crime and no explosions in the world.\n\n\"But the reality is there are bad people, and there are criminals.\n\n\"Because of my dad's profession, I have heard so many stories and witnessed first-hand the evil in the world.\n\n\"And because of that, I believe in the right to defend my life and my property,\" she says.\n\nAmanda believes future tragedies can be prevented by making sure \"prohibited people\", such as those with mental health concerns, don't have access to guns.\n\n\"So-called 'assault weapons' are the functional equivalent of millions of commonly held rifles used in hunting, competition, and sport shooting.\n\n\"They are no more lethal than other rifles,\" she says.\n\nCaroline is 25 and from North Carolina. She's a certified accountant but her favourite hobbies are hunting and fishing.\n\nShe got her first gun as a present from her parents when she was seven - a double-barrelled shotgun.\n\n\"If you grow up in a hunting family this is pretty normal,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\nSpeaking to Newsbeat about the bear she killed above, Caroline said \"it fed at least eight families, several times over\".\n\nShe also made a rug out of the hide.\n\n\"We have to manage our bear population on our land - if you let too many bears grow on your land it can become a problem for other wildlife, disease can spread, and it can become dangerous for us.\"\n\nCaroline isn't a member of the NRA but doesn't agree with the Never Again campaign, which wants stricter gun controls.\n\nShe agrees more background checks are needed but doesn't think the government should raise the age of purchase to 21-years-old - a suggestion Donald Trump made and then went back on following a lack of support.\n\n\"I don't think raising the age is going to fix anything.\n\n\"It's the parents' responsibility to secure their guns and to not store loaded guns, or bullets with the guns.\n\n\"It's really precautions you take in the home that will help fix things - not necessarily the way you purchase guns.\"\n\nAt the moment Caroline only uses guns for hunting. She says her family doesn't tend to buy meat from the supermarket because they hunt what they want to eat.\n\nBut she has got a license to have a handgun if she wants to buy one for protection.\n\n\"We live in a very safe area so I don't think it's super necessary for me to carry one around or keep one by bed because I feel safe.\"",

He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the money came from the sale of two paintings.\n\nFrench daily Le Monde reported that Bashir Saleh, who ran Libya's sovereign wealth fund at the time, had confirmed that Gaddafi had financed Mr Sarkozy.\n\nPossible charges in this case would be influence peddling, fraud, handling of stolen goods and money laundering.\n\nCriminal proceedings have been launched against Mr Sarkozy in one other case of alleged illicit campaign financing.\n\nIt is alleged that he engaged in accounting fraud to overshoot the ceiling for campaign expenditure in 2012, which was ?22.5m.\n\nMr Sarkozy denies he was aware of the overspending.\n\nThe affair is known as the Bygmalion scandal.\n\nIn connection with his 2007 campaign, Mr Sarkozy was previously cleared over claims that he had used secret funding from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and that he had tried to influence investigating magistrates.",

                "title": "Why is Picasso so popular in Asia?",
                "body": "Pablo Picasso is more than just a household name in the West. The Spanish master has long been adored in the East and such affection shows no sign of subsiding. Asian travellers are flocking to museums in the West to admire his artistic creations. Multi-million dollar paintings by the prolific artist have become the most sought after objects of desire among affluent Asian collectors in recent years. The reputations of other Western artists are no match to that of Picasso's in this part of the world. Picasso is simply a synonym for Western art.\n\nOne Picasso work was sold in 2015 for $67.4m (?48.2m)\n\nThe bold colours, the Cubist portraits of deconstructed faces and chaotic pictorial compositions appear to resonate very little with the traditional Asian notion of beauty. But Asians' love for Picasso has reached a simply mind-boggling level. Why is a Spanish painter who was born over a century ago so appealing to those from such a different cultural background?\n\nOne would immediately turn to the surging monetary value of Picasso's paintings for an easy explanation, particularly in money-conscious Asia. Collectors there, led by the ultra-rich Chinese and others from Hong Kong and Taiwan, have been showing a large appetite for Picasso's artworks, particularly those assessed to have the highest value in recent years. Femme assise, robe bleue (Seated Woman in Blue Robe) from 1939 was sold to one of these collectors at a Christie's New York sale in 2017 for $45m (?32.24m). Another bought Buste de femme (Femme ?la r?ille), (Bust of a Woman - Woman with Fishnet) (1938) from a 2015 Christie's New York sale for $67.4m (?48.2m). Earlier in 2012, China's Dalian Wanda Group splashed $28.2 million (?20.2m) on Claude et Paloma (1950), also at a Christie's New York sale.\n\nThe market potential is confirmed by how the late master's works are set to take the centre stage of Hong Kong's art month in March, when Art Basel and a number of gallery openings and art auctions collide.\n\nAuction house Sotheby's will bring a Picasso painting, Juan-les-Pins (1924), to its Hong Kong evening sale for the first time on 31 March, unlike the usual practice of selling Western masterpieces in New York and London.\n\nThis coincides with the auction house's selling exhibition Face-Off: Picasso/Condo, which juxtaposes 20 of Picasso's paintings with those by George Condo, the largest showcase of Picasso's works in the city since the 2012 travelling exhibition of the collection from Paris' Musee National Picasso that took place at Hong Kong Heritage Museum as well as Shanghai and Chengdu. Seven of the Picasso paintings on show are on loan from private collections in Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan, including Femme ?l'oiseau (Woman sitting with bird) (1939) from Taiwan's Yageo Foundation and Femme assise, robe bleue.\n\nBlue-chip period\n\nJonathan Wong, director of Sotheby's S|2 Gallery in Hong Kong, says Chinese collectors' passion for boldly priced Picasso paintings only began three to five years ago, and Picasso is the name to own. The brand name effect of Picasso could be the art market's answer to Birkin bags, and according to Wong, the versatility of Picasso's creations, from paintings to sculptures and ceramics, offers buyers a range of choices. But money aside, says Wong, \"the colourful life of Picasso strikes a chord with how the Chinese romanticise the life of a great artist.\"\n\nBorn in 1881, Picasso was known for not only constantly reinventing his artistic expressions in different periods but also his romantic affairs with women. He had four children with three women, including Olga Khokhlova and Fran?ise Gilot, who were his wives, and Marie-Therese Walter. His love affair with photographer and artist Dora Maar was also well documented.\n\nPicasso's carefree lifestyle resonates with that of famous ancient Chinese scholars such as Ming painter and poet Tang Yin (1470-1524), who was renowned for his poetry and ink paintings and was married to three women. Modern Chinese artist Zhang Daqian (1899-1983), who met Picasso in Nice in 1956, also displayed a similar persona. Equally prodigious and prolific, Zhang was one of the biggest names in Chinese modern art. Not only did he inherit the roots of traditional Chinese landscape paintings and invent new artistic language in his bold, splash-ink paintings and portraits of women, he was also known for his affairs with many women and had four wives.\n\nBut beyond the romantic details of his biography, the aesthetics of Picasso's paintings are what appeal to the Chinese - much more so than other big names of Western art such as Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh. Wong says Picasso's portraits speak to modern China, as portraits have played an important role in modern and contemporary Chinese art, particularly since 1949. \"Mainland Chinese artists were trained to follow the Soviet school of social realism, where portraits play a key role in the works of Chinese artists from Chen Yifei to Zhang Xiaogang. Chinese people, over the past century, are accustomed to the appreciation of portraits,\" he says.\n\nBut that's not the only factor, says Wong. Chinese people who grew up with the multiple-perspective style in traditional landscape paintings would find it easier to connect with Picasso's Cubist portraits. In their research into multi-perspective images, Scott Vallance and Paul Calder of the School of Informatics and Engineering at Flinders University of South Australia noted the similarities between Chinese landscape paintings and Cubism: \"Chinese landscape paintings contain different focuses, or sub-images, which are seamlessly joined.\" While multi-perspective has been deep in Chinese aesthetics for centuries, its introduction to the Western art world through movements such as Cubism led by Picasso came much later.\n\nIt's not surprising if Picasso was under certain Asian influences at some point. His encounter with Asian art was probably earlier than his highly publicised meeting with Zhang. Masayuki Tanaka, professor of art history at Musashino Art University in Tokyo, Japan, says Picasso revealed his connection with Asian art to Japanese painter Taro Okamoto when the latter visited the Spanish artist's studio in Vallauris in the early 1950s. Okamoto was under a great deal of influence from Picasso, and one of his most famous works, Myth of Tomorrow, is his response to Picasso's Guernica, with both being artistic representations of the horrors of war.\n\n\"Picasso told Okamoto that he possessed several Japanese woodblock prints, and that they were not refined ones, but earlier, more primitive ones,\" he says.\n\n\"To Picasso 'primitive' does not mean something uncultured, but rather it is the other way of representation than the traditional Western style based on perception and accurate realistic description. Asian tradition of representation is different from the Western style, and it is not perceptional but more conceptual. In that sense, Picasso's way of expressing something is familiar with Asian people. You can still find the same way of expression in manga today as Picasso did.\"\n\nAn Asian sensation\n\nWhile Chinese people's love for Picasso is a more recent phenomenon, Picasso's rendezvous with Japan appears to date back much earlier. Prof Tanaka says books on Picasso were first published in Japan in the 1920s and one of the first Western art exhibitions after World War Two was a Picasso show in 1951. Many Japanese corporations also acquired a lot of Picasso's paintings in the 1980s, according to Prof Tanaka. \"But most of them were sold in the '90s when the Japanese economy declined.\" His paintings can still be found in the Pola Museum of Art in Hakone, a private museum, which keeps a strong collection, he says.\n\nMuseu Picasso in Barcelona first loaned a collection of 60 works to Japan in 1964 for a Picasso exhibition at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo and Kyoto, as well as the Prefectural Museum of Art in Nagoya. In the following decades, the Museu Picasso has been lending works to exhibit in Japan, including the 2000 exhibition Picasso's World of Children at the National Museum of Western Art in Ueno Park, Tokyo, where Prof Tanaka was a curator. The show drew more than 300,000 visitors.\n\nPicasso's art has also left its footprints in South Korea. In 2013 and 2014, the Picasso Foundation brought the exhibition Picasso from M?aga, Picasso Absolute to Incheon, Seoul, Daegu and Suwon, showing 226 works by the Spanish master and 100 photographs of the artist by Juan Gyenes to more than 300,000 visitors.\n\nMuseu Picasso, Barcelona, also reported a significant increase in Asian visitors, particularly South Koreans. The Barcelona museum said it welcomed 38,591 individual visitors from South Korea, jumping from 15th to the seventh highest in the museum's ranking, followed by the Chinese (34,011) and Japanese (30,662). Tour operators also brought an additional 100,000 Asian visitors to the museum.\n\n\"The globalised world means Western values assimilated in Asia are an important part of today's culture,\" says Jos?Mar? Luna Aguilar, director of the Picasso Foundation. \"Picasso, as the maximum incarnation of creative freedom, is appreciated in today's society as one of the most admired and loved characters. His uninhibited way of living and expressing life in his works makes it seem a reference for a freer life.\"\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

                "body": "Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams copied one of Marvin Gaye's songs to create their 2013 smash Blurred Lines, an appeal court has ruled.\n\nThe court upheld a 2015 verdict against the stars, which means Gaye's family will get to keep a $5m (?3.5m) payout.\n\nIn addition, the family will receive 50% of future royalties from Blurred Lines.\n\nYet one judge dissented from the verdict, saying the two songs \"differed in melody, harmony and rhythm\".\n\nCircuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen added that the ruling \"strikes a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere\".\n\nIn the original 2015 trial, a jury found that Blurred Lines had copied Gaye's 1973 hit Got To Give It Up - despite many observers claiming the songs were only similar in feel, rather than composition.\n\nThicke, Williams and rapper TI, who contributed a verse to the track, launched an appeal in 2016 and were backed by 212 fellow songwriters, among them John Oates, Jason Mraz and members of Linkin Park.\n\nThey argued the verdict \"threaten[ed] to punish songwriters for creating new music that is inspired by prior works.\"\n\nBut the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the decision, while clearing TI - real name Clifford Harris Jr - of any copyright infringement.\n\nThe judges rejected Williams and Thicke's request to order a new trial, saying Gaye's copyright was entitled to broad protection.\n\nThey also accepted the original judge's decision to instruct the jury to reach their verdict based only on the sheet music to the songs and not the recordings.\n\nYou can see the full ruling here.\n\nWednesday's decision prompted a strong dissent from Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen.\n\nShe said the decision let the Gayes \"accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style\" and expanded the potential for further copyright litigation.\n\n\"The Gayes, no doubt, are pleased by this outcome,\" she wrote. \"They shouldn't be.\n\n\"They own copyrights in many musical works, each of which (including Got To Give It Up) now potentially infringes the copyright of any famous song that preceded it.\n\n\"That is the consequence of the majority's uncritical deference to music experts.\"\n\nHoward King, a lawyer for Thicke and Williams, said Judge Nguyen's comment \"enhances the prospects\" his clients might prevail in an appeal.\n\n\"These are two entirely different songs,\" he said.\n\nTwo of Gaye's children, Frankie and Nona, called the decision \"a victory for the rights of all musicians.\"\n\nTheir mother Jan added it was a \"wonderful recognition of Marvin's creativity and the lasting value of one of his greatest songs.\"\n\nMusicologists have reacted with disappointment to the ruling, saying it might hinder creativity in the future.\n\nJoe Bennett, a professor at Berklee College of Music, wrote a note-by-note comparison of the two songs in 2014 and concluded they only shared a groove.\n\n\"What they have in common is indicative of the time period,\" he told Forbes this week.\n\n\"If my favourite artist uses a cowbell and I use one too, can you copyright the cowbell? Both are arguing that their side is good for creators.\n\n\"That's why so many of the young songwriters are concerned. What's the threshold? How much can I be influenced by my favourite artist?\"\n\nSince the Blurred Lines trial, there have been a number of similar cases against such artists as Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Madonna and Miley Cyrus.\n\nOthers have sought to pre-empt any copyright claims - including Taylor Swift, who gifted Right Said Fred a writing credit on her single Look What You Made Me Do after noticing a passing similarity to their hit I'm Too Sexy.\n\nMeanwhile, Thicke, Williams and TI issued a joint statement about Wednesday's ruling, claiming it set a \"horrible precedent\".\n\n\"Blurred Lines was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and TI and not taken from anyone or anywhere else,\" they said.\n\n\"We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.\"",

                "body": "Advertisers are telling Facebook that \"enough is enough\" following a data breach that left millions of users' information open to exploitation.\n\nISBA, a trade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook on Friday.\n\nIf it fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may spend money elsewhere.\n\nM&C Saatchi boss David Kershaw said: \"I don't think they're bluffing. They are going to exert real pressure.\"\n\nConsultancy Cambridge Analytica is accused of improperly using data from millions of Facebook users on behalf of political clients.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke cover for the first time since the scandal erupted to say that a \"breach of trust\" had occurred and he was \"really sorry\".\n\nMr Kershaw, the boss of one the world's most recognised advertising agencies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think that clients have come to a point, quite rightly, where enough is enough.\"\n\nHe said that advertisers putting pressure on Facebook would help bring about change at the social networking business.\n\n\"It is much more likely to be hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtags on Twitter,\" he said, referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular.\n\nFacebook's share price has fallen since the scandal broke, wiping more than $40bn off the value of the business.\n\nThe Times reported that ISBA, whose members represent more than 3,000 brands, is demanding answers from Facebook about the breach.\n\nPhil Smith, director general of ISBA, said: \"What we are hearing at ISBA is that advertisers are concerned. When we meet with Facebook tomorrow we want to understand the scope of the inquiry Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday.\n\n\"We want reassurances for our members that it will get to the bottom of the issues and any implications for the public and for advertisers.\"\n\nMr Kershaw said: \"From the consumers' point of view, you have these extraordinary services you get from your social media and there's an exchange, you're giving your data.\n\n\"I think that most consumers accept that deal unless it comes to where we are now where that data is abused.\"\n\nLast month, consumer goods group Unilever threatened to withdraw advertising from Facebook and internet giant Google if they did not do more to police extremist and illegal content on their platforms.\n\nAt the time, Unilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed, said: \"We cannot have an environment where our consumers don't trust what they see online.\"\n\nCommenting on where else companies could advertise, Mr Kershaw said there are alternatives: \"But we live in a very strong oligopoly with Facebook and Google.\"\n\nHe said M&C Saatchi is forecasting that digital media advertising will grow by 10% this year.\n\nHowever, he said: \"60p in every ?1 of that increase will go to Facebook and Google and that's not healthy\".\n\nWhile there is much debate about media plurality with newspapers, \"in the digital space, plurality doesn't exist\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that its application to search Cambridge Analytica's offices had been adjourned by a High Court judge until Friday.\n\nOn Monday, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she was seeking a warrant to search the consultancy's premises after Channel 4 News secretly recorded the firm's executives boasting about their abilities to sway elections by using tactics such as sending Ukrainian sex workers to an opponent's residence.\n\nA spokesperson for the ICO said: \"A High Court judge has adjourned the ICO's application for a warrant relating to Cambridge Analytica until Friday.\n\n\"The ICO will be in court to continue to pursue the warrant to obtain access to data and information to take forward our investigation.\"\n\nHave you deleted your Facebook account?

                "title": "Inside a hidden studio making intricate ?50,000 watches",
                "body": "Down a rain-soaked alley in Birmingham's jewellery quarter, I find a simple green door. There is no sign, no obvious marker. Just a small, brass \"2\", the studio number, which is modestly affixed to the front. Hidden inside is a frankly magical little place - a watchmaker's workshop run by Craig and Rebecca Struthers, a husband and wife team.\n\nRebecca welcomes me into the largest of three rooms - a warm space filled with antique bits of furniture and bookshelves. The walls are painted dark green, a shade labelled \"Dragon Song\" that caught Rebecca's eye when the duo were decorating. Archie, a young Staffordshire terrier, snoozes on his blanket. It has the feel of a Victorian study, but the old factory building housing the studio gives nothing away to the passer-by.\n\n\"All of our clients at the moment are pretty much word-of-mouth,\" says Rebecca when I ask if this layer of mystique is intentional. \"So they feel like they've 'found' us. Then they come out to our location - our workshops have very much been designed to fit in with that.\"\n\nEach watch is priced at ?50,000 and to produce all five will take two years\n\nTo many, the whole industry of watchmaking, repair and restoration may seem equally inconspicuous, perhaps even obscure. The Struthers (pronounced Struh-thers), however, are among a few who are keeping old skills and practices alive. Now, they are about to embark on the production of their first five complete watches for clients. Each watch is priced at ?50,000 and to produce all five will take two years. As well as the case, dial and hands, they'll also be making the internal movement - the system of gears and springs at the heart of any mechanical watch.\n\nBut it has taken 15 years for the Struthers to reach this point - with their fair share of ups and downs on the way. For anyone wanting to become a watchmaker in the 21st Century, there are plenty of hurdles to overcome. How, then, does one do it?\n\nRebecca was just 16 when she applied to study a two-year course at the School of Jewellery at Birmingham City University. Back then, she had no idea that watchmaking was a career, but students studying horology, the art of making clocks and watches, suggested it might be a good fit for her. It was around this time, in 2004, that she first met Craig. He had begun a course run by the British Horological Institute (BHI) that was also based at the School of Jewellery.\n\nA current BHI veteran and tutor, Alan Burtoft, tells me that there are just a handful of places in the UK where budding watch- and clockmakers can do this sort of course. There's the British School of Watchmaking in Manchester and the BHI offers various programmes, including distance learning, for example. Then, there is a clock restoration course at West Dean College near Chichester and some classes offered by Epping Forest Horology Centre near London.\n\n\"It's not a very well-known or advertised trade to go into,\" admits Burtoft.\n\nRebecca found this out fairly quickly when she tried to find horology courses that weren't based at Birmingham City University. \"They were just like, 'No, you can't do horology here',\" she remembers.\n\nShe trained in various crafts useful to her trade, however - from diamond grading to silversmithing. And she says she was able to \"tailor\" a history of art and design masters to suit a horology theme in order to take her studies further. After that, she completed a PhD in horology as well.\n\nCraig came to his studies a little later, having already worked for a spell in government IT - which he freely says he \"absolutely hated\".\n\n\"I was ready to do anything,\" he adds.\n\nWhile both were learning, they were also able to work in related fields. Struthers' first job in the watch industry was in a jewellers in Birmingham.\n\n\"It was a really good opportunity to start seeing how people buy watches,\" she recalls.\n\nAs for a full-blown watch-making project, however, that didn't come until 2013 when the pair won the Lonmin Design Innovation Award for their pendant watch, named \"Stella\", crafted in platinum. They were already repairing and restoring watches by this point, but making a completely original case and dial of their own was a huge challenge. After submitting their design, they only had 10 weeks to pull it off. \"It was this mad moment,\" remembers Rebecca.\n\nNearly five years later, this gradual build-up of experience and know-how is beginning to pay off. The five clients who have signed up to buy their first five watches made from scratch have agreed to pay half the cost of each in advance ?- ?25,000.\n\n\"We're aware it's quite a big ask, we've got some incredibly loyal and supportive clients,\" says Rebecca.\n\nInvestment allows them to plan for this special project, but it also enables them to employ an apprentice - an enthusiastic 19-year-old named Heather Fisher, who is currently studying for her degree in horology.\n\nIt's quite satisfying as well when you finally get a watch ticking. That's the best part isn't it?\n\nHer A-levels were art, textiles and computing - \"not really related to it so much\", she tells me. But now that she's learning how to service watches, by taking them apart, cleaning and fixing any broken parts inside, she seems to have found her vocation.\n\n\"I like more practical stuff; being hands-on,\" she says. \"It's quite satisfying as well when you finally get it ticking,\" she adds with a laugh. \"That's the best part isn't it?\"\n\nFisher points out that apprenticeships are hard to come by - her classmates generally have had to contact jewellers or watch restorers directly to ask if they can take them on. The Struthers themselves seem to have used as many avenues as possible to improve their knowledge of the craft.\n\nThat resourcefulness is, in fact, evident in almost everything they do. Craig eagerly shows me around his workshop, where drawers are stuffed with tools he has found on Ebay or at scale modellers' fairs. \"These two tools were rescued from the floor of someone's shed,\" he says, pointing to two electrical lathes. Some of his tools are practically antiques themselves - dating back to the late 19th Century.\n\nHe flicks open a drawer in his workbench and points to a compartment with what looks like about 40 files. Each one produces a finish of varying roughness on metal. There are boxes of components, tools for picking watches apart, and widgets for drilling or bevelling holes. He jiggles a box with tiny rings made of gemstones that supply the coloured \"jewel holes\" on the outside surface of watch movements. These are often visible via transparent panels on the back of the case.\n\nThere are boxes of components, tools for picking watches apart, and widgets for drilling or bevelling holes\n\n\"Occasionally I might break a jewel, not often,\" he says. \"It can be a nuisance because they're not readily available - especially certain sizes, so you have to be really careful.\"\n\nHe's even met an Austrian engraver via Instagram who will work on their series of five watches over the next two years. The Struthers have designed a William Morris-style, curled leaf pattern to decorate one side of the movement.\n\nAlan Burtoft at the BHI has seen his fair share of students seek out apprenticeships or entry-level jobs at servicing centres in the UK and further afield. Despite the relative obscurity of the trade these days, there are still jobs to be had, he says.\n\n\"There's quite a demand for skilled watchmakers and clock-making,\" he explains.\n\n\"People say that watchmaking skills are a dying art - to a certain extent they are, but there are still people making watches by hand.\"\n\nHe thinks the vast majority of students he's taught have found employment that makes use of the skills they've learned.\n\nOne of the most straightforward routes into the industry, he says, is to do a horology course of some kind and then gain a few years of experience at a servicing centres, perhaps one run by a large Swiss brand. That provides additional experience without much business risk. Trying to kick off your own watchmaking outfit immediately is trickier, given the additional complexities of running your own business, he says.\n\nRebecca Struthers points out that vintage or antique watch restoration - something she and her husband do regularly - is a good way to begin learning skills that could one day make you a watchmaker in your own right.\n\n\"If you can make any part for someone else's watch, you can do it for your own,\" she says.\n\nBefore anything else, though, it seems you have to discover - no matter your age - that you are fascinated by the intricacy of watchmaking. Looking around the Struthers' smoky-green studio, I see ancient tools peppered on little shelves here and there, and a library of watchmaking books stashed on the shelves. It's hard not to be sucked in yourself.\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.",

                "body": "Police have discovered a 25-minute recording on the phone found on the body of the Austin bomb suspect, which they are treating as a confession.\n\nMark Anthony Conditt, 23, died in his car after detonating an explosive as officers approached after a chase - days after a spate of deadly parcel bombs in the Texas city.\n\nThe video recording did not mention hate or terrorism as the motive.\n\nCondit's death ended a three-week reign of terror which killed two people.\n\nAnother five were injured.\n\nThe video is an \"outcry of a very challenged young man\", Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters.\n\n\"We're never going to be able to put a (rationale) behind these acts.\"\n\nInvestigators say with a \"reasonable level of certainty\" there are no more devices to endanger the public.\n\nBefore his death Conditt had been criminally charged with one count of unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device, the US attorney for the Western District of Texas said in a press release on Wednesday.\n\nConditt lived with two flatmates in Pflugerville, north of Austin, says investigators.\n\nThe flatmates have been talking to authorities, but were not suspected of any crimes.\n\nAuthorities said they found several components inside the property that match the devices used in the other attacks.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbot told Fox News that the suspect had not erased his online footprint, which may provide a \"treasure trove of information that should shed light on who he is, what he did, and why he was doing it\".\n\nConditt attended the Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012, but did not graduate.\n\nThe Austin American-Statesman newspaper reports he was home-schooled by his mother during his high-school years.\n\n\"I officially graduated Mark from High School,\" his mother wrote on Facebook in a 2013 post showing her son.\n\n\"He's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do... maybe a [religious] mission trip,\" his mother wrote.\n\nThe newspaper reports that he had recently worked for Crux Semiconductor in Austin as a \"purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving\", citing a profile on a job recruiting website.\n\nUS media have uncovered a 2012 blog which was written under the suspect's name and appeared to be for a university course that he attended.\n\nIn the blog called Defining my Stance, he purportedly describes beliefs that \"gay marriage should be illegal\", opposition to abortion and why the sex offender registry should be eliminated.\n\nIn the blog, he defines himself as \"a conservative\".\n\n\"But I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended,\" he says, adding that he is taking the course \"because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance\".\n\nThe Austin police department on Tuesday used footage from a FedEx store in south Austin, the scene of the latest parcel bomb explosion, to identify the suspect.\n\nPolice found several pieces of evidence to lead to Conditt, including unusual batteries and screws used in each device, according to CBS News.\n\nAfter using the Google search engine to gather information on the suspect's online browsing history, authorities later managed to locate his vehicle.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, local and federal officers took up positions around a parking area near a hotel in Round Rock.\n\nAs they waited for tactical teams to arrive, the vehicle started to drive away and officers pursued it.\n\nWhen the vehicle eventually pulled over, armed officers approached, but the suspect then detonated a bomb, injuring one officer.\n\nPolice later confirmed that the blast had killed the suspect.\n\nBy Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin\n\nThis was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror.\n\nIt was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation.\n\nBut the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide.\n\nAnother crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office.\n\nAs police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas.\n\nAuthorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related:",

Probably not.\n\nWitness an exchange in the House of Commons this week between two unionists, the North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon and the DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds.\n\nLady Hermon referred to the anniversary of his death and \"the remarkable generosity of spirit\" shown in government by Mr McGuinness and former DUP leader Ian Paisley and asked if the DUP could show the same generosity in getting back into talks about restoring devolution without any red lines.\n\nMartin McGuinness' old nemesis, Gregory Campbell, reminded her that \"he collapsed the institutions\".\n\nThe devolved government collapsed in January 2017 after Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in protest against the handling of a flawed green energy scheme.\n\nSubsequent talks have failed to restore the institutions.\n\nMr Dodds in reply referred to the anniversaries of the Warrington bombing and the murder of two army corporals at an IRA funeral.\n\n\"We should remember that in the eulogies to Martin McGuinness the movement he lead carried out those atrocities,\" he added.\n\nMichelle O'Neill, who became Sinn F?n's northern leader shortly before Mr McGuinness died, admits she found succeeding him to be \"daunting\".\n\nShe questions the response of unionists to the work of her former leader.\n\n\"Martin McGuinness led the way in reconciliation,\" she said.\n\n\"In order for reconciliation to be successful you need a unionist partner to work with in order to bring forward that excellent work.\n\n\"Martin stretched republicans time and again but he did it because it was the right thing to do.\n\n\"When I succeeded him one of the things he made (clear) to me was that you need a unionist partner if you're going to be able to make the Executive and the Good Friday Agreement institutions work and that remains the case today.\n\n\"I will carry on his good work because its necessary work if we're going to create a better society for all of our people to live side by side.\"\n\nSo, although he brought Stormont down, if he had lived, would the presence of Martin McGuinness have made it easier to bring it back?\n\nI asked a man who saw both sides of the former Sinn F?n leader, the former police chief, Peter Sheridan, who believes that when he was stationed in Londonderry Martin McGuinness tried to have him killed on a number of occasions.\n\nBut in subsequent years, the years of the peace process, Peter Sheridan and Martin McGuinness formed a bond.\n\nAs chief executive of Co-Operation Ireland, Mr Sheridan was instrumental in bringing about that famous first handshake between Martin McGuinness and the Queen.\n\nHe hedges his bets on the Stormont question, saying: \"I am not sure.\n\n\"He certainly had a personality that helped things over the first twenty years of the peace process.\n\n\"He certainly was a character who was able to bring people with him and if he'd been around the table over this last few weeks and months would he have made things different? Perhaps.\n\n\"We will never know though I guess his own party would say that he has set his stall out in January last year when he collapsed the institutions and that things would not have changed if things hadn't changed within the talks.\n\n\"But I think it's one of those conundrums that we will never know, but he certainly had a personality that could have made things different.\"\n\nYou couldn't make up the story of Martin McGuinness.\n\nThe young IRA commander who made peace with one of his greatest enemies, Ian Paisley.\n\nAnother thing the young Martin McGuinness would probably have laughed at was the fact that a portrait of him would one day hang in Stormont's Great Hall.\n\nBut that's what is about to happen.\n\nOf course, a portrait of his fellow Chuckle Brother Ian Paisley is already there.",

                "title": "Marielle Franco: Vivacious fighter shaped by the favela",
                "body": "Marielle Franco's life had been on an up until she was shot dead in Rio de Janeiro on 14 March.\n\n\"She was doing everything she had set out to do,\" says her sister, Anielle Silva. Two years ago, Ms Franco was elected Rio city councillor, the very first time she had run for office.\n\nThe 38-year-old had ambitious plans for this year. The left-wing Party for Socialism and Liberty (PSOL) she was a member of had chosen her as its candidate for the post of deputy governor of Rio de Janeiro state in October's election.\n\n\"She was so excited, she seemed like a child,\" Ms Silva recalls. She is sitting in her parents' flat in northern Rio which is full of photos of her sister.\n\nOn 14 March, Ms Franco was being driven home from an event promoting black empowerment when a car pulled alongside hers and shots were fired from inside it.\n\nShe was hit four times in the head and her driver, Anderson Gomes, was also killed.\n\nThe crime has sent shockwaves through the country and beyond, with people gathering in Brazil and cities as far apart as New York, London and Stockholm to pay tribute to Ms Franco.\n\nIn Rio, crowds took to the streets in the city centre shouting \"Marielle presente!\" (Marielle is here!) and demanding justice be done.\n\nMs Franco has been embraced by the many different movements she fought for - black, feminist, LGBT and human rights.\n\nMs Franco, who often wore a bright hairband around her afro, was the only black woman among Rio's 51 councillors, even though half of Brazil's population are black or mixed race.\n\nDescribed by friends and fellow politicians as a brave and vivacious fighter, she had grown up in Complexo da Mar?\n\nThe sprawling set of favelas is home to 140,000 people, two drug gangs and a paramilitary group, and has one of the lowest human development indexes (a composite statistic of life expectancy, education and per capita income indicators) in Rio.\n\nBeing raised in Mar?had a big influence on the sisters, Ms Silva says. recalling how they had to cope with school being cancelled because of shoot-outs or walking past bodies lying on the streets.\n\nDespite her humble origins, Ms Franco made it into university, getting a masters degree and becoming the councillor who won the fifth most votes in Rio in 2016.\n\nHaving been born and grown up in a favela, she was a powerful advocate for the rights of the people living in Rio's poor neighbourhoods.\n\n\"I think she was becoming a menace,\" her sister says.\n\n\"She may have come from the bottom but she was growing more and more influential. She defended minorities and spoke her mind fearlessly. They wanted to shut her up before she went further,\" her sister says of the motives that may have been behind her killing.\n\nPolice have said that hers was a targeted killing and the federal prosecutor's office told BBC Brasil that evidence suggests the crime was committed by corrupt police officers.\n\nMs Franco often denounced police violence and extrajudicial executions carried out by the security forces.\n\nShe was particularly critical of President Michel Temer's recent decision to deploy the army in Rio state to boost security.\n\nThe deployment, in response to a surge in crime around carnival, caused grave concerns among rights groups who fear residents could face harassment or worse.\n\nMs Franco had been chosen to oversee a commission monitoring the deployment of the military.\n\n\"How many more will have to die before this war ends?\" she asked on Twitter a day before she was killed, referring to the fatal shooting of a young man after he left church in a favela.\n\nAt a march in Complexo da Mar?on Sunday, protesters chanted \"black lives matter\" and warned that those who had \"messed with\" Ms Franco had stirred up a hornet's nest.\n\n\"She was a minority within Brazil's political institutions, but represented the majority of Brazilian people, many of whom are female, black and live in favelas,\" says fellow black politician Taliria Petrone.\n\n\"We need people like Marielle to have space in politics and to implement public policies that represent this diversity,\" Ms Petrone, who was elected councillor in the city of Niteroi in 2016, says.\n\nBut on social media there have also been those questioning why Ms Franco's death should have received so much coverage when so many others have gone unreported.\n\nHer sister says people should not forget her murder was \"political\". \"She was a leader who fought for minorities and against violence in Rio. She was elected. All I want is for her legacy to be respected,\" Ms Silva says.\n\nShe says her family has been moved by the widespread tributes. \"This soothes us and shows us how big Marielle was,\" her sister says.\n\nAnd in a country where many murders, especially those of black and disadvantaged people, go unsolved, Ms Silva is hoping for closure.\n\n\"I want to believe that they will solve the crime. I have to believe.\"",

                "title": "South Africa and the fable of the Guptas",
                "body": "An ambitious family arrived from a distant land, wormed its way into the heart of a young democracy, became unimaginably rich and influential, stood accused of trying to hijack the state itself, and then, overnight, vanished into thin air, leaving those who had fallen under the family's spell - and those who had warned against it from the start - to wonder how anyone could have got away with so much, for so long.\n\nToday, South Africans - by turns stunned, humiliated, and vindicated - are still trying to digest the impact of the Guptas, and to assess what harm they have done to the country's institutions, politicians, and democracy.\n\n\"I think the damage can be reversed,\" said the political analyst Prince Mashele - but only if the authorities here move fast, and aggressively, against those who allegedly conspired with the Indian-born family.\n\n\"Society must see people going to jail. Once you do that, you're sending a message that if you do what... the Guptas did, there will be consequences.\"\n\nIt was last month that the South African police's elite Hawks unit shocked the nation by arriving at the Guptas' lavish compound in Johannesburg before dawn, looking to make arrests.\n\nFor years the family had seemed untouchable, repeatedly implicated in corruption by state officials, email leaks, and senior politicians, but apparently protected by their close friendship with President Jacob Zuma.\n\nThe Gupta brothers were accused of vetting ministerial appointments and of using their influence to siphon money from state contracts. They hired the president's son, Duduzane, to work for them, and repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBut everything changed on that dramatic day, 14 February. Within hours of the police raid, President Zuma had announced his resignation, and the three Gupta brothers were found to have vanished abroad.\n\n\"I think they will only return if they're extradited,\" said the legal campaigner Mark Haywood, whose Section 27 organisation had been among many groups pushing the South African authorities for years to confront the Guptas.\n\n\"It's a victory... We mobilised on (so many) fronts to expose what was going on. We eventually made it untenable for this sort of 'capture' of the state to continue. We forced the authorities to do what they should have done right from the beginning.\"\n\nToday, South Africa's law enforcement agencies are keeping quiet about their plans. The Gupta brothers are widely thought to be in Dubai, where they reportedly own a house.\n\nThe oldest Gupta brother, Ajay, is officially a \"fugitive from justice\", but the police here will not discuss any extradition plans, or say which other family members they may be targeting, or on what grounds.\n\nIn the meantime, the Guptas' business empire appears to be crumbling fast in South Africa. A coal mine, a television station, a luxury jet, a friendly bank, a dairy farm, and half a dozen other Gupta-linked companies are either closing down, changing hands, or being targeted for seizure by the authorities.\n\nAt the same time, an increasingly uncomfortable spotlight is being shone on prominent politicians who, it is alleged, either partnered the Guptas, or turned a blind eye to their alleged misdeeds.\n\nSenior figures have already been removed from the board of the badly compromised state energy company, and the controversial head of the country's revenue collection service, SARS, has just been suspended.\n\n\"I've no doubt this new chapter... means that those Zuma and Gupta-linked crony networks are going to be very quickly, and effectively uprooted,\" said the Democratic Alliance's shadow police minister Zakhele Mbhele, who nonetheless warned that other corrupt patronage networks would continue to thrive at a provincial and regional level within the structures of the governing ANC.\n\nMr Zuma, now an ordinary citizen, is facing separate legal troubles as a much older corruption scandal - involving alleged bribery by a French arms company - comes back to haunt him. But a judicial inquiry into \"state capture\" - allegedly involving the Guptas and Mr Zuma - is also likely to begin soon. The former president's retirement seems likely to be busy, and eventful.\n\nAs gloomy as many South Africans are about the damage the \"Zuptas\" have done to their young institutions, there is also a mood of relief here, and, for some, a belief that the Guptas have, unwittingly, played a useful role.\n\n\"If you told South Africans that this could happen, we'd say 'no!' But the Guptas... proved that it is possible - that you could come in from outside and capture an entire democratic state and control it. It means we are now much more careful as a society. So they have actually woken us up,\" said Prince Mashele.",

But he said that should not stop the US from taking action.\n\n\"I don't think it is a sufficient worry that therefore we're not going to stand up for intellectual property but we're trying to do everything in a measured and appropriate way,\" he said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.\n\n\"If there is retaliation, then the United States is going to have to take action to stick up for our farmers.\"\n\nChina has said there would be no winner from any trade war.\n\nOn Tuesday, the last day of the annual sitting of the National People's Congress, China's Premier Le Keqiang said he hoped both sides could remain \"calm\".\n\nHe also said he hoped the US would ease restrictions on exports of high-tech goods to China.",

So when your children's school is losing teachers and sending begging letters or their youth centre is closed - that's because the Conservative priority is tax breaks for big business,\" he said.\n\n\"And when your elderly relatives are neglected because of a lack of social care, that's because the Conservatives want another tax giveaway for a few people at the top.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be like this - Labour in government would do this very differently.\"\n\nHe said homelessness \"has more than doubled\" under the Conservatives, claiming that 120,000 children were in temporary accommodation \"without a home to call their own - that's gone up by two thirds since 2010\".\n\nMr Corbyn said local businesses were also facing an increased tax burden, with business rates rising by more than ?3,000.\n\n\"The message from Theresa May's government could not be clearer,\" he said. \"Pay more to get less under the Conservatives.\n\n\"Labour will give dignity and support to those in need, rebuild our communities and transform our country for the many, not the few.\"\n\nResponding to Labour's local election launch, Conservative local government minister Marcus Jones said: \"Labour councils cost you more and deliver worse local services.\n\n\"Under Labour, rubbish has piled in the streets due to bin strikes in Birmingham. New homes are blocked from being built in London. And across the country, council tax costs on average ?102 more under Labour.\n\n\"It's Conservative councillors that are delivering for their communities, provide high quality local services while keeping council tax down.\"\n\nThe 38,000 member Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Momentum group's national coordinator Laura Parker said they would \"launch digital platforms, experiment with new organising techniques and mobilise tens of thousands of activists to knock on doors and make this vision of municipal socialism a reality\".\n\nElections are taking place in 32 London boroughs and 119 other councils around England on 3 May, alongside mayoral ballots in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Watford and the Sheffield City region.",

He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the money came from the sale of two paintings.\n\nFrench daily Le Monde reported that Bashir Saleh, who ran Libya's sovereign wealth fund at the time, had confirmed that Gaddafi had financed Mr Sarkozy.\n\nPossible charges in this case would be influence peddling, fraud, handling of stolen goods and money laundering.\n\nCriminal proceedings have been launched against Mr Sarkozy in one other case of alleged illicit campaign financing.\n\nIt is alleged that he engaged in accounting fraud to overshoot the ceiling for campaign expenditure in 2012, which was ?22.5m.\n\nMr Sarkozy denies he was aware of the overspending.\n\nThe affair is known as the Bygmalion scandal.\n\nIn connection with his 2007 campaign, Mr Sarkozy was previously cleared over claims that he had used secret funding from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and that he had tried to influence investigating magistrates.",

There's very little evidence base to support their use.\"\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \"One size does not fit all.\"\n\n\"We know that being active and working is good for our patients' health, so GPs and our teams will readily advocate lifestyle changes to patients that can help ease their pain and keep them in work, but for some patients, particularly in more serious cases, there is a limit to how realistic a significant amount of exercise is.\n\n\"For these patients whilst not a cure, drug-therapy can provide a great deal of relief and should not be dismissed entirely - the most effective approach, as with any medication, is that it should be prescribed at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is also the case that access to psychological treatments, such as talking therapies, which we know can be beneficial for patients suffering from lower back pain, is patchy across the country.\"",

                "body": "Hillary Yip is a 13-year-old student from Hong Kong. She's also an ambitious app developer and CEO.\n\nDesigned by a kid, for kids, her smartphone app, Minor Mynas, connects children from around the world for a specific purpose: to learn each other's mother tongue.\n\nYip epitomises the globalised, digitally connected teen of today's youngest generation, which has grown up through the unique conditions the 21st Century - technology that connects people all over the world, an increasingly culturally diverse global population, and the rise of personalised educational apps and games.\n\nCould these factors combine to create the most multilingual generation yet?\n\nA more diverse world\n\nThe youngest generation is growing up in a time in history that provides a lot of opportunity.\n\nCultural diversity is increasing globally, especially due to increasing levels of international migration, says professor Steven Vertovec, managing director of the Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity in G?ttingen, Germany. He points to the latest UN World Migration Report, which found that 258 million people live in a country other than their country of birth -- an increase of 49% since 2000.\n\nPeople, from more diverse backgrounds, are coming into contact with each other in cities around the world - Steven Vertovec\n\n\"Hence more people, from more diverse backgrounds, are coming into contact with each other in cities around the world,\" he says. \"This is set to continue, again globally.\"\n\nThis increased migration, especially in cities, brings people with a wide variety of cultural and linguistic backgrounds into close contact. Could a more multicultural world lead to a more multilingual generation?\n\nIt's likely to contribute to an environment with more opportunities for language learning, says Angela Creese, professor of educational linguistics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"What it's likely to do is have a positive orientation to differences, both social and linguistic, so that people are more likely to be creative and interested in other languages.\n\n\"They have a connection and access to linguistic resources - they're not going to be fighting them as in a monolingual environment, where people are slightly nervous about different languages.\"\n\nYounger generations are more likely to speak a foreign language\n\n\"I think it's certainly true, at least in Europe, that young people know more foreign languages than before,\" says Antonella Sorace, a professor of developmental linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. She points to a 2011 study that found that 77% of EU millennials speak more than one language. \"This share fell for each successive age group, with the lowest proportion recorded among those aged 55-64,\" she says.\n\nAt least in Europe, young people know more foreign languages than before - Antonella Sorace\n\nThose numbers were high in young professionals with high levels of education, suggesting that at least some firms prioritise foreign language training among staff, the study says. It also says that as globalisation has fuelled economic growth in less developed countries, as well as prompted travel for both business and pleasure, more people are speaking more languages, especially English.\n\nIn the US, a record 65.5 million US residents speak another language at home, a number that has doubled since 1990. Many of these foreign language speakers are not immigrants: the study found half of the growth in foreign language speakers since 2010 was among those born in the US. What's more, the study found nearly one in four American public schoolchildren spoke a foreign language, a higher proportion than the average for all age groups.\n\nA similar trend is happening in Canada, where the number of people who speak a language other than English or French has risen by 14.5% since 2011.\n\nTom Roeper, a linguistics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, says that classrooms around the world could soon be filled with more children who, across the whole class, might speak six or more languages combined. He points to the idea of the \"translanguaging classroom\", in which students who speak different languages can pick up bits and pieces of the language from their classmates in an increasingly diverse classroom.\n\n\"[Teachers] should figure out a way to include that in class,\" Roeper says. \"What does a teacher do when he's faced with a bunch of African kids, or Turkish kids, Asian children? The challenges teachers are facing is [figuring out how] that should be part of the class.\"\n\nConnecting to others in a flash\n\nAnother factor that could count toward today's generation of young polyglots? Any teenager with a smartphone and an internet connection can have a video conversation with their multilingual peers oceans away. Twenty years ago, such a thing was unfathomable.\n\nThe Pew Research Center says that in the US, 57% of teens have made new friends online, with \"social media and online gameplay [as] the most common digital venues for meeting friends.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Yip's app taps into these behavioural trends.\n\nUntil not very long ago, making friends in another language was a bit of an enterprise. Now it's much more immediate - Antonella Sorace\n\n\"Until not very long ago, making friends in another language was a bit of an enterprise,\" says Sorace. \"You had to go to the other country, spend some time there, have your parents organise this - now it's much more immediate with all these technological means.\"\n\nPlaying games to boost fluency\n\n\"Edutainment\" as a learning tool is nothing new. Video games with an educational slant - think The Oregon Trail - have existed for decades.\n\nBut with the internet and handheld smart devices, this kind of tech-forward education has reached new heights: hundreds of language apps which have gamified learning make it convenient to practice on the go and are cheaper than pricy PC games. They're also popular: Duolingo, perhaps the best-known, has 200 million users worldwide, and another, busuu, has more than 80 million.\n\nThe rise of cheap or free apps that make learning fun has big implications for children who, unlike adults, are often not even aware that they're learning something, when they actually are.\n\nExperts point out that kids are good at implicit learning (doing something like playing games without realising they're absorbing information or sharpening skills), versus explicit learning (physically going to a classroom and doing drills a teacher gives you in a constructed environment).\n\n\"That's why this technology helps,\" says Sorace, referring to apps and games. \"They get hooked doing something they like, and in fact they're learning another language.\"\n\nAs children become teenagers, they are more likely to be self-conscious and fear making mistakes in front of others. That's where technology can also help, says Matthew Maclachlan, CEO of UK-based Learnlight, a platform geared toward adults learning a second language.\n\n\"I'm not standing in front of a class of 29 other teenagers while I decline the verb,\" Maclachlan says. \"I'm doing it in an online environment, where I'm getting instant feedback and I can experiment. I'm more inclined to guess, because it's a computer. When you're with a real person, you won't guess - you'll just say, 'I don't know.'\"\n\nThe limits to tech\n\nDespite the many new ways that technology can aid these wired kids growing up in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world, experts say it works better as a complement to, rather than a replacement for real-life, in-person contact.\n\nAnd when you look at language specifically, learning apps still need to be thought of as complementary tools. Duolingo users may well have brag-worthy scores in French, Danish, or Hungarian, but if you genuinely want to get better, there comes a point where you need to start practising with native speakers.\n\n\"I can get on Skype with my teacher based in Mexico City, and I have a real conversation with a native speaker,\" Maclachlan says. \"I get the best teacher, not just the best Spanish speakers here [in my English village].\"\n\nLooking forward? Today's children have already moved on from fiddling with smartphones and tablets and have moved to summoning voice-activated assistants like Cortana or Alexa. That kind of AI, along with increasingly sophisticated chatbots, could appear as new language-learning tech tools.\n\nMaclachlan reckons we're 12 to 18 months away from it. \"It's not going to be long where I can actually have a conversation with my technology, and it catches all my mistakes when I'm talking to it,\" he says.\n\nWhy language learning matters\n\nThe benefits of speaking many languages are well-documented. It staves off dementia, sharpens concentration and problem-solving skills, and can earn you more money.\n\nFor Hillary Yip, more communication and greater understanding between today's youth could help tear down barriers society springs around them as they get older - even as they're using the app continents apart.\n\n\"In the adults' world, there's a ton of things about race, gender, and other stereotypes,\" she says. \"But for kids, everyone is just a kid.\"\n\n--\n\nBryan Lufkin is BBC Capital's features writer.

                "title": "The secret cherry taking over Canada",
                "body": "My eyes drifted toward a mound of pastries on the counter of 33 1/3 Coffee Roasters, a cafe in downtown Regina, Saskatchewan, and my stomach growled with hunger. But a simple handwritten card piqued my interest, distracting me for a moment.\n\nPlaced directly in front of a large pile of bulbous-shaped scones, it read 'Prairie Cherry'.\n\nThey grow them everywhere around here\n\nAs a first-time visitor to this western Canadian province, I didn't know it was possible for this fruit, which traditionally thrives in temperate regions, to grow out on the prairies. During winter, temperatures can drop to as low as -40C, while drought-like conditions can persist for months during summer. Such extremes, I thought, would limit what farmers could harvest.\n\nSo somewhat meekly, I asked the barista, \"What's a prairie cherry?\"\n\n\"It's a variety of the fruit we're known for in Saskatchewan,\" he said, handing me my coffee. \"They grow them everywhere around here.\"\n\nMore than just a clever rhyme to lure hungry tourists, these dwarf sour cherries have been a culinary staple on the prairies for decades. Growing hardy and plentiful on short, stout bushes, their ornamental blooms and glossy leaves produce a deep-red fruit that is fully ripe from late July to early August. They're tarter than traditional sweet cherries, and can be eaten straight from the tree.\n\nOne reason for their popularity can be attributed to the region's immigrant communities who commonly incorporate them into their diets, according to Bob Bors, assistant professor and plant scientist at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\n\"The people who love it the most are the people who come from Eastern Europe and settled down here,\" he explained. \"They get totally thrilled that they have a sour cherry.\"\n\nBors leads the Fruit Programme for the university - one of the largest of its kind in North America - which has been breeding a variety of hardy, cold-weather plants for the last 90 years. As well as overseeing a dozen crops across 50 acres of property, the programme also includes a Prairie Fruit Genebank that preserves plants suited for prairie life. While their work focuses primarily on crops that can be commercialised, the university has also spent the last two decades marketing these tart and tangy fruits to the public to help distinguish them from other varieties.\n\n\"A lot of people don't understand what a sour cherry is,\" Bors said. \"In my early years of promoting it here, I had to take our cherries physically around places before they would try growing them because they didn't believe it was possible.\"\n\nThat's not the case anymore. In recent years, these cherries have become near ubiquitous on menus across the province due to their high sugar content, powerful antioxidants and durability. Unlike other varieties, these cherries maintain their intense flavour and colour even when cooked at high temperatures. Locals gloat over their medicinal properties, said to help treat things like inflammation. Regional chefs and bakers pop them in everything from cookies to pies to ice cream, while orchards and restaurants combine their juice into things like wine, beer and even whisky.\n\nToday, dwarf sour cherries may be grown in abundance by a wave of new commercial farmers, but it's the storied history of how they came to be that has become a local legend.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, professors and plant technicians at the university began growing dwarf-sized sour cherry plants from seedlings they'd collected from the Siberian Botanical Garden in Russia. When even these plants struggled to survive an entire Saskatchewan winter, the programme, led at the time by Dr Stewart Nelson, didn't bother cross-breeding them with other hardy varieties, assuming they would never survive the extreme cold weather found in this part of the world.\n\n\"Those cherries were crap except one tree,\" said Rick Sawatzky, research technician for the university for the past 46 years, who worked with the early generations of these plants. \"I made no headway.\"\n\nBut that was all about to change. Unbeknown to most of the growers and farmers in the area, a local federal government employee named Dr Les Kerr had been working in private since the 1940s to improve the quality of sour cherries. As a lone grower, he was doing work no-one else thought could be done.\n\nA lifelong horticulturist, Kerr had developed a keen interest early in life for breeding new fruits, especially those that needed improvements to outlast the cold weather. He experimented (with varying degrees of success) with a multitude of plants, such as crab apples, hazelnuts and peaches, and even dabbled in hybridizing dogs and coyotes, a project that didn't go very far.\n\n\"He probably just did it out of curiosity,\" Bors said. \"Maybe that's the key to his psyche. That he just did stuff just because he was curious.\"\n\nHe probably just did it out of curiosity\n\nIt was his work breeding and crossing sour cherries that Kerr longed to perfect. Not only was the fruit the right size to be mechanically harvested - key to large-scale, commercial fruit production - but there was nothing else on the market like them. This financial viability was something Kerr understood from the beginning.\n\n\"I'm sure that was his goal right from the get-go,\" Sawatzky said. \"He was a very capable man.\"\n\nEven though Kerr's initial attempts proved futile, he continued crossing his hardiest selections with other varieties, including some it's believed he acquired from Siberia.\n\n\"His first crosses didn't result in food quality that was all that great,\" Sawatzky said. \"But it made that very important first step.\"\n\nOver several generations, his plants improved to commercial quality. All the while, only a handful of his closest friends knew about his fruit-breeding projects; as a government employee who was mandated to grow shelterbelt trees, a type of shrub used for land borders and protection from wind and snowstorms, Kerr believed that if his superiors found out about his work they would put a stop to it immediately. So he kept his work secret from the public.\n\n\"He didn't want to see it wasted,\" Sawatzky explained. \"He saw the value in it for the future.\"\n\nBut eventually Kerr had no choice but to share his success. In 1983, when he was nearing death, he invited several people to his hospital bedside to provide them with details of where they could find his work. Kerr had kept virtually no records, and only he knew where the several hundred plants were dispersed and hidden among two farms in the province.\n\n\"He may have had some in other places, but I was never made aware,\" said Sawatzky, who helped locate the trees.\n\nBefore this discovery, the university had no longer been pursuing its own cherry breeding programme. But with Kerr's bequeathal, along with an additional financial donation for research, the students were able to pick up where he left off.\n\nAnd it's those plants that not only live to this day, but continue to inspire new growers, some of whom have built entire businesses around them.\n\n\"I do tours of the orchard, and I explain how it all started with Les Kerr,\" said Dean Kreutzer, owner of Over the Hill Orchards in Lumsden, Saskatchewan.\n\nAlong with his wife Sylvia, Kreutzer opened the farming business in 1999 after retiring from his job as a computer programmer to pursue fruit breeding full time.\n\n\"I basically learned through trial and error how the actual trees worked and the different issues that horticulturists or orchard growers have to face,\" he said. \"I had absolutely no agricultural background at all.\"\n\nToday, Over the Hill Orchards produces more than 50 different products, many of which are cherry flavoured, and hosts suppers on their 40 acres of property. They even had some luck feeding the Royal Family when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip visited the province for its 100th anniversary in 2005.\n\n\"When I heard that she was coming, I said, 'She's gotta eat something!'\" Kreutzner exclaimed, explaining that he supplied 500 chocolate-covered cherries for the event.\n\nKerr's the man with the vision. And the rest of us are just technicians just working on it\n\n\"It's one of those things when you sit back and think, 'I was a computer programmer and I just fed the Queen'. Quite a cool thing.\"\n\nAnd while the cherry industry continues to make strides improving the hardiness of these extraordinary plants, Kerr's legacy will always remain strong.\n\n\"He had a vision that this could be carried. He's the man with the vision. And the rest of us are just technicians just working on it,\" Sawatzky said.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

                "body": "US officials have identified the suspect linked to a series of deadly parcel bombs targeting the Texas city of Austin as Mark Anthony Conditt, 23.\n\nThe man was killed after he detonated an explosive as officers approached his car following a chase in Round Rock, north of the Texas state capital.\n\nOfficials say he lived about 20 miles (30km) from Austin in a shared home.\n\nThe incident follows four bomb attacks in the Austin area. Officials warn he may have placed more bombs in the area.\n\nBefore his death Conditt had been criminally charged with one count of unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device, the US attorney for the Western District of Texas said in a press release on Wednesday.\n\nThe US attorney's office for the Western District of Texas named him on Wednesday Mark Conditt, aged 23.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbot told Fox News that he lived with two flatmates in Pflugerville, about 20 miles north of Austin.\n\nHe added the two flatmates have been talking to authorities, but were not suspected of any crimes.\n\nMr Abbot said the suspect did not destroy his online footprint, which may provide investigators with a \"treasure trove of information that should shed light on who he is, what he did, and why he was doing it\".\n\nAccording to USA Today, he attended the Austin Community College from 2010-2012 but did not graduate.\n\nThe Austin American-Statesman newspaper reports that he was homeschooled by his mother during his high school years. His parent's home is now being searched by authorities, according to the newspaper.\n\n\"I officially graduated Mark from High School,\" his mother wrote on Facebook in a 2013 post showing her son.\n\n\"He's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do...maybe a [religious] mission trip,\" his mother wrote.\n\nThe newspaper reports that he had recently worked for Crux Semiconductor in Austin as a \"purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving\", citing a profile on a job recruiting website.\n\nUS media have uncovered a 2012 blog which was written under the suspect's name and appeared to be for a university course that he attended.\n\nIn the blog called \"Defining my Stance\", he purportedly describes beliefs that \"gay marriage should be illegal\", opposition to abortion and why the sex offender registry should be eliminated.\n\nIn the blog, he defines himself as \"a conservative\".\n\n\"But I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended,\" he says, adding that he is taking the course \"because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance\".\n\nThe Austin police department on Tuesday used footage from a FedEx store in south Austin, the scene of the latest parcel bomb explosion, to identify the male suspect.\n\nPolice found several pieces of evidence to lead to the suspect, including unusual batteries and screws used in each device, according to CBS News.\n\nAfter using the Google search engine to gather information on the suspect's online browsing history, which showed searches on facilities which were used to ship packages, authorities later managed to locate his vehicle.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, local and federal officers took up positions around a parking area near a hotel in Round Rock, about 20 miles (32km) north of Austin.\n\nAs they waited for tactical teams to arrive, the vehicle started to drive away and officers pursued it.\n\nWhen the vehicle eventually pulled over, armed officers approached, but the suspect then detonated a bomb, injuring one officer. Another officer opened fire.\n\nPolice later confirmed that the blast had killed the suspect.\n\nAustin police chief Brian Manley said that local residents should \"remain vigilant\", and urged anyone who noticed a suspicious package to contact the authorities.\n\n\"We don't know where the suspect has been over this past 24 hours,\" he said, adding that it was possible that additional devices may have been distributed.\n\nEarlier, CCTV images of a \"person of interest\" were shared on US media showing a white male with blond hair carrying a number of large packages at a FedEx store in Austin.\n\nTwo people have been killed and six injured in the bombings.\n\nBy Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin\n\nThis was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror.\n\nIt was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation.\n\nBut the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide.\n\nAnother crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office.\n\nAs police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas.\n\nAnd while this might feel like it's over, the admission from police that they don't know where the suspect was for the past day means more devices could be out there and it is too soon for Austin to completely relax.\n\nAuthorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related:",

                "body": "The US central bank has said it will raise its benchmark interest rate citing a strengthened economic outlook.\n\nThe Federal Reserve said it had decided to raise the rate by 0.25% to a target range of 1.5% to 1.75%.\n\nPolicymakers also signalled they would increase rates twice more this year, while raising the forecast for rate hikes in 2019.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome \"Jay\" Powell also sounded a warning about rising trade tensions.\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced steel and aluminium tariffs and is weighing sanctions against China, actions that have led to threats of retaliation.\n\nMr Powell said some Fed members are worried about the possibility of a trade war, referencing conversations between central bankers and business leaders.\n\n\"They're seeing it as a risk to the outlook,\" Mr Powell said at a press conference at the close of the Fed's two-day meeting in Washington.\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which votes on rates, predicted the US economy will grow by 2.7% this year, faster than the 2.5% predicted in December.\n\nOfficials are also expecting slightly higher interest rates in 2019 and 2020 than they did in December, according to projections released after the meeting, which reflect the median of estimates by committee members.\n\n\"This is clearly a firming up of the future trajectory of policy tightening,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\n\nThe Fed has been raising rates slowly since 2015, moving the US away from the ultra-low levels put in place following the financial crisis.\n\nThe central bank is trying to balance a low unemployment rate with the potential for higher inflation.\n\nWednesday's rate increase was widely expected, but there are new faces on the committee, raising questions about whether policymakers will move more quickly in coming months.\n\nEconomic conditions have also shifted. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of more than 3% during some quarters last year, while the unemployment rate is hovering at 4.1% - the lowest since 2000.\n\nInflation has continued to lag the Fed's 2% target rate, but analysts have said they expect wages and prices to increase this year.\n\nMr Powell said the Fed is \"alert\" to the possibility of inflation and expects inflation to rise in coming months, but is not expecting a sharp increase.\n\n\"There's no sense in the data that we're on the cusp of an acceleration in inflation,\" he said.\n\nAn increase in the Fed's benchmark federal funds rate typically leads to higher rates for consumers and businesses.\n\nSavers benefit, but borrowing becomes more expensive, which can dampen activity in industries such as housing and car sales and raise costs for businesses that rely on debt.",

                "body": "The foreign secretary has agreed that President Putin is using the World Cup in Russia as a \"PR exercise\" akin to how Hitler used the 1936 Olympics.\n\nLabour MP Ian Austin put it to Boris Johnson that the Russian president wanted to \"gloss over [his] brutal corrupt regime\".\n\nMr Johnson replied: \"I'm afraid that's completely right, completely right.\"\n\nHe added that he would have an \"urgent conversation\" with Russia about the safety of fans at the tournament.\n\nThe foreign secretary said it was of \"crucial importance\" in light of 23 British diplomats being expelled from Russia - including the individual responsible for football fans.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson was speaking on behalf of the government and that they were working closely with police on plans for the World Cup.\n\nThe Foreign Office will produce detailed travel advice closer to the time.\n\nThe exchange came as the Foreign Affairs Select Committee discussed the Salisbury spy attack.\n\nSergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital after being poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok.\n\nThe former military intelligence officer and his daughter were found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March.\n\nEarlier, Boris Johnson described it as \"a sign\" from President Putin that \"no one could escape the long arm of Russian revenge\".\n\nHe also claimed Russia chose the UK for the attack because it had \"called out\" Russian abuses \"time and again\".\n\nHitler became German leader in 1933 and used Berlin's hosting of the Summer Games of 1936 as part of the propaganda for his Nazi regime.\n\nHe had already brought in rules in the country to ensure all athletics organisations had an \"Aryan-only\" policy, which led to international backlash.\n\nBut despite threats of boycotting, the games went ahead.\n\nMr Austin told the foreign secretary he loved football and watching the England team, but was \"filled with horror\" over how President Putin would use the event.\n\n\"The idea of Putin handing over the World Cup to the captain of the winning team; the idea of Putin using this as a PR exercise to gloss over the brutal, corrupt regime for which he is responsible; it fills me with horror,\" he said.\n\nMr Johnson could be heard saying, \"I'm afraid that's completely right, completely right\", during Mr Austin's comments.\n\nThe foreign secretary then added: \"Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right.\n\n\"I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event.\"\n\nHowever, when Mr Austin said he believed the football team should pull out of the competition, Mr Johnson disagreed.\n\n\"On balance it would be wrong to punish them [the fans] or the team who have worked on this for an incredibly long time, given up their lives to it,\" he said.\n\nOn the issue of fan safety, Mr Johnson said he needed to have an \"urgent conversation\" with the Russians around how they \"propose to fulfil their obligations under their FIFA contract to look after all fans\".\n\nHowever, he admitted this conversation had yet to take place.\n\nSpeaking at the start of the committee, Mr Johnson discussed how he felt the attack in Salisbury was arranged as a warning to others.\n\nHe said: \"[The attack] was a sign that President Putin or the Russian state wanted to give to potential defectors in their own agencies: 'This is what happens to you if you decide to support a country with a different set of values, such as our own. You can expect to be assassinated'.\"\n\nHe repeated comments from fellow Conservative MP, Ken Clarke, who described the use of the nerve agent Novichok as a \"Russian signature on the deed\".\n\n\"By using a specific type of nerve agent known to be developed in Russia, it was a sign that no former Russian agent was immune and no-one could escape the long arm of Russian revenge,\" added the foreign secretary.\n\nHe also claimed the UK was chosen for the attack because of its \"particular set of values\".\n\nMr Johnson said the UK believes \"in freedom and in democracy, and in the rule of law, and has time and again called out Russia over its abuses of those values.\n\n\"It is Britain that has been most forthright and most obstinate in sticking up for our values and I think that is the reason it was decided to make that gesture in this country.\"\n\nHowever, he said the overall aim of improving relations with Russia - as discussed during his trip to Moscow in December 2017 - remained \"effectively unchanged\".\n\nMr Johnson said: \"No one can say that we haven't been trying. That was the reason for going to Moscow, to show we are willing to engage.\n\n\"Things are going to be very difficult politically for a whole time to come, but that doesn't mean all contact must be stopped or engagement stopped.\"\n\nHe claimed the UK had \"many admirers among the Russian people\" and the UK wanted to \"hold out the hand of friendship\" to them, as the quarrel was with the Kremlin, not the citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, the British ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has snubbed a meeting called by the foreign ministry in Moscow to discuss the attack.\n\nThe ministry had invited all ambassadors in the country to attend the meeting, but reports suggested a number of Western diplomats refused to attend.\n\nDmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, criticised the decision.\n\nHe said: \"Perhaps this is another eloquent demonstration of the absurdity of the situation when questions are being asked but the unwillingness to hear some answers is being shown.\"\n\nIn Salisbury, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived to begin work at the site of the attack.\n\nThey have been seen outside The Mill pub, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal are believed to have visited, before later being found on a bench.",

                "body": "The danger may be over but a string of bombings have rattled Austin's belief in itself as a laid-back oasis, as it now confronts the sort of stomach-churning headlines usually associated with bigger American cities.\n\nAround the Texas state capital, the sound of sirens has been more frequent over the past few days.\n\nHundreds of personnel including police, FBI agents, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and bomb technicians have been working the case.\n\nIt appears that investigation has finally proved successful as a man suspected of the bombings detonated a device killing himself on Wednesday morning as officers attempted to arrest him at a hotel north of the city.\n\nIf, as seems likely, that brings to an end three weeks of uncertainty and fear, Austinites are still left trying to unravel events and come to a better understanding of what happened to their city usually famed as a liberal oasis.\n\nThree parcel bombs and a trip-wire device exploded over the course of 17 days in early March, then on Tuesday morning a fifth device exploded at a FedEx facility in the city of San Antonio - the package containing it was en route to Austin.\n\nBefore the news emerged overnight that the suspect had been killed, there was a sense of unease.\n\n\"I drive down the street where the trip-wire one exploded, so to have something like that five minutes from my house is a shock,\" says 31-year-old Jesse O'Brien.\n\n\"You hear about this type of thing with other cities not Austin,\" says Brittaney Parsons, sitting opposite Mr O'Brien at Caffe Medici in West Austin.\n\n\"We're only known for music festivals and people drinking.\"\n\nA few blocks from the caf?a UPS van pulls up to make an afternoon delivery to a house.\n\n\"It's on my mind obviously,\" the driver says, adding he can't give his name as management have banned talking to press.\n\n\"I'm not that worried about myself, but I don't want to be the one to deliver one of these packages to a family with children and have to live with that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the neighbourhood's Fire Station No 4, two firemen lift weights in the gym.\n\n\"We've scaled back our daily tasks such as fire drills and building inspections as in the current climate we don't want to increase public unease by being too visual,\" says 30-year-old Alex Paranagua.\n\n\"Also, it means we are ready to respond more quickly if needed.\"\n\nIn downtown Austin, the normal hustle and bustle continued during Tuesday afternoon, with people sat outside bars, cafes and stores making the most of the sunshine.\n\n\"I am not that surprised given the current political climate of divisiveness that is encouraging so much hate and violence,\" says 68-year-old Don Rypka outside the flagship Whole Foods Market.\n\nOthers, however, are more taken aback.\n\n\"Texas is so friendly and community orientated,\" says mother-of-two Camille Carson at Whole Foods. \"Of all the places, Austin is the last one where I'd have thought this could happen.\"\n\nBefore the trip-wire device in southwest Austin that injured two white men, the first three bombs targeted African-American households on the city's less affluent east side that historically has housed black and Latino residents.\n\nAustin has a long-chequered past of racial tensions and inequities at odds with its laid-back reputation.\n\nAfter the first bomb, people began to question whether Austin's police would have more readily sounded the alarm if the victim had been white and it had happened in a more affluent neighbourhood.\n\n\"When does a story pick up stream and why - is it simply because of the volume or because the problem left East Austin [and threatened the rest of the city],\" says Kevin Foster, a professor in the African and African Diaspora Studies department at the University of Texas at Austin, and who is involved in community programmes on the East Side.\n\n\"I don't know the answer, but we need to ask the question. This community is used to institutional neglect and being marginalised.\"\n\nOthers more closely affected by the bombings' aftermath have been left also mulling on the potentially problematic role of the media.\n\n\"The coverage could be making it worse, calling it a serial bomber, with the bomber getting a thrill from it,\" says Adriana, the 25-year-old grand-daughter of the woman living opposite where the second parcel bomb detonated March 12 killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason.\n\n\"We've seen it happening with shootings increasing - people can get the idea from media.\"\n\nPolice say they still don't know the overall motive of the individual who blew himself up this morning, and are looking into whether he had any accomplices. The have also warned that people in Austin need to stay vigilant as they don't know how the suspect has spent the previous 24 hours.\n\nWith the dramatic turn of events this morning, the city's residents face remaining in the national and international spotlight for a bit longer yet.\n\n\"I've been getting lots of messages from friends in other states checking in with me,\" says 37-year-old Blair Wagonen, walking her dog in East Austin.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I'm not shocked by what's happened given the world we live in. But it is a bit weird given how liberal and community-based Austin is, unlike other big cities - most of my friends here have had the same reaction.\"\n\nAs this week began, most Austinites repeated the refrain heard in other cities hit by attacks - life has to go on as normal as possible. That should be easier now that it appears the bombings are over.\n\nBut there remains a sense that people feel caught out and almost let down to find that terrible events can happen in Austin too.\n\n\"The more time goes by, this world doesn't seem to be getting better,\" says 57-year-old John Doyle, a retired firefighter, leaving an HEB supermarket on the east side.\n\n\"It makes me think of the Bible's words: We live in perilous times.\"",

And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin's regime,\" Mr McCain said in a statement.\n\nMr Trump's decision to ignore his aides' recommendations to avoid congratulating Mr Putin was first reported by the Washington Post newspaper.\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington\n\nDonald Trump reportedly went off script. Again. Or perhaps he never read the notes that he should avoid a congratulating a foreign leader accused of overseeing a multi-pronged effort to influence US politics and assassinate a former spy on the soil of a close US ally.\n\nWhy? During the campaign, Mr Trump praised Vladimir Putin and compared him favourably to Barack Obama. Even now, as evidence mounts of nefarious Russian activities, Mr Trump's attitude seems unchanged. At the White House yesterday, he was more interested in discussing plans for meeting Mr Putin face-to-face.\n\nAgain, it seems, Mr Trump is at odds with his own administration. Where the US has been forceful in condemning the Salisbury attack and has imposed sanctions against Russians tied to 2016 election meddling and hacking, the president - in public statements and tweets - has taken a softer tone.\n\nThese latest developments will do nothing to quiet talk a rift between Mr Trump and his national security adviser, HR McMaster. Not only is Mr Trump reportedly disregarding his national security staff's advice, the news leaked just hours after the Putin call. The president is already seemingly suspicious of his foreign policy team's loyalty. This will make matters worse.\n\nThe US recently imposed sanctions on a group of Russians over alleged interference in the US presidential election in 2016.\n\nThe Kremlin said the conversation between the US and Russian presidents was \"constructive and business-like\", adding that Russia hoped to \"overcome problems\" that had arisen between the two nations.\n\nMr Putin was re-elected by a landslide, with more than 76% of the vote, for a fourth six-year term.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel was among the first Western leaders to \"warmly congratulate\" Mr Putin on Monday - a day after his re-election - stressing the need to continue dialogue \"to address important bilateral and international challenges and find viable solutions\".\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron wished Mr Putin success in \"modernising Russia\", but urged Moscow to shed light on the \"unacceptable\" attempted assassination of an ex-spy in Britain.\n\nThe US president said the pair would meet in the \"not too distant future\" to discuss limiting a growing arms race, Ukraine and Syria.\n\nDuring the call, Mr Trump did not mention the issue that has sparked growing Western tensions with Moscow - the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain.\n\nBut Mr Trump on Wednesday agreed with Mr Macron on the need to \"hold Russia accountable\" for the spy attack, according to the White House.\n\nThe UK government blamed the nerve agent attack on Russia, which denies any involvement.\n\nOn Tuesday, 23 Russian diplomats expelled by the UK left London.\n\nMoscow has also ordered 23 British diplomats to leave in a tit-for-tat response.",

They cite staffing and facilities as specific issues.\n\nHowever, it is understood a women's side is part of the discussion around potential development of United's training site at the Cliff in Salford.\n\nFans' groups are apparently looking into whether it would be possible to replicate the atmosphere at grounds in countries such as Germany and Italy, where crowd involvement is 'conducted' by supporters with megaphones, backed by other fans with instruments.\n\nUnited did introduce a singing section in the north-east corner of the ground but it has not made a significant improvement.\n\nBoth the club and fans' groups felt the situation was far better on Saturday, when the singing section was moved to the south-east corner of the stadium for the FA Cup quarter-final with Brighton.\n\nHowever, this is the area normally reserved for away supporters and it is felt moving that section for league games is impractical given the number of season ticket holders in other parts of the ground.",

People with Down's syndrome live typical lives. They can get jobs, live independently and can get married.\"\n\nJulie, from Tongue in Sutherland and who appears in the video with her son Ruben, said: \"It's just so exciting that the video has gone out.\n\n\"Having a child with Down's syndrome is not the end of the world, it's the beginning of a new world.\n\n\"The hashtag that goes with the video, #wouldntchangeathing, is just so true.\n\n\"We have a great little family here and I wouldn't change it for the world.\"",

                "title": "India takes down Cambridge Analytica site",
                "body": "India has taken down the local website of Cambridge Analytica following allegations the company used personal data of 50 million Facebook members to influence the US presidential election.\n\nSCL India, a venture between the SCL group in London and Ovleno Business Intelligence, says both India's major political parties are its clients.\n\nThe company has no charges against it.\n\nThe country's IT minister also warned Facebook of \"tough action\" if it was found to have misused data of Indians.\n\nBoth the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and main opposition Congress deny links with SCL India but have accused one another of utilising the services of the company.\n\nCambridge Analytica has also consistently denied any wrongdoing and most recently suspended its boss Alexander Nix, after footage by Britain's Channel 4 News showed him appearing to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.\n\nAmrish Tyagi, the head of SCL India, in a 2016 interview with a regional channel, spoke about his involvement with Mr Trump's presidential campaign. Mr Tyagi told the BBC that he could not comment on the controversy, but said the removal of Mr Nix would pave the way for a \"fair investigation\".\n\nOn Wednesday, India's law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said there were \"numerous reports\" of Congress involvement with Cambridge Analytica and called upon its leader Rahul Gandhi to \"explain\" the company's role in his social media outreach.\n\nMr Prasad also issued a public warning to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, saying that Facebook was welcome in India but: \"If data theft of Indians is done through the collusion of the Facebook system, it shall not be tolerated. We have got stringent power in the IT Act, we shall use it, including summoning you in India.\"\n\nThe Congress, for its part, hit back saying that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who used the firm and not them.\n\nThese claims appear to be backed by Himanshu Sharma, the vice president of SCL India, who says on his publicly available LinkedIn profile that the company has \"successfully managed four election campaigns for the BJP\" and among them names the 2014 general election which swept Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the head of the BJP's social media unit Amit Malviya told the BBC that the party had \"not heard of SCL Group or Amrish Tyagi so there is no question of us working with them.\"\n\nCongress social media strategist Divya Spandan said they had never used SCL or any of its affiliate companies as it has its own data analytical team.\n\nSCL India claims it has 300 permanent employees and more than 1,400 consulting staff in offices across 10 Indian states.\n\nIt offers a range of services in India, among them \"political campaign management\" which includes social media strategy, election campaign management and mobile media management.\n\nUnder social media strategy it offers services such as \"blogger and influence marketing\", \"online reputation management\" and \"daily management of social media accounts\".\n\nJagdeep Chhokar, the head of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a non-governmental organisation that works in the area of electoral and political reforms, told the BBC that while political parties were required to include expenses on social media campaigns as part of a sworn affidavit to be submitted after every election, it was unclear as to how many of them actually were doing that.\n\n\"As far as the question of political parties' payment to data companies is concerned it should indeed be declared properly in the sworn affidavits but there is no proper authority to implement it,\" he added.\n\nFurthermore, even if SCL India were running a similar campaign to what they have been accused of doing in the US, it is unclear how much of that activity would even be considered illegal.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Smriti Parsheera, a technology policy researcher at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi said that the current law as laid down in the Information Technology Act, 2000, provides for compensation for losses caused due to inadequate protection of \"sensitive personal data\".\n\nMs Parsheera said that the law goes on to define sensitive data to mean information such as passwords, financial information, health conditions, biometric information, etc..\n\n\"The problem with the current framework lies in both the narrow scope of the protections as well as the inadequate implementation of these limited protections. Information such as a person's name, location, general preferences, friend's list, are clearly powerful tools for analytics and profiling of users but do not qualify for protection as sensitive data under the present law,\" she added.",

                "body": "A British surgeon who helped Syrian doctors online has told the Telegraph he fears his computer was hacked, leading to an air strike on a hospital.\n\nDavid Nott, who has performed surgery in various war zones, helped his Syrian colleagues during an operation, via Skype and WhatsApp, on just one occasion.\n\nThe 2016 operation was later broadcast by the BBC's Newsnight programme.\n\nWeeks after this, the Aleppo hospital was hit by a \"bunker buster\" bomb.\n\nDr Nott thinks the hackers were able to discover its location via his computer.\n\nCyber-security professionals say his theory is plausible, but the BBC has spoken to two experts who think another approach - if hackers were involved at all - would have been more likely.\n\nCyber-security researcher and blogger Graham Cluley pointed out that at one point in Newsnight's broadcast, a Syrian telephone number had been visible on David Nott's computer screen.\n\nRather than target Dr Nott, he thinks hackers may have tried to infect the smartphone of the Syrian at the hospital who used that number.\n\n\"Newsnight should have obscured that number in their report,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAdditionally, Matthew Hickey, at cyber-security company Hacker House, said that because it appeared to be a mobile phone number, it may have been possible for a nation state to hack into the Syrian carrier network, ping the mobile and receive its location.\n\nThat in turn may have given away the coordinates of the part of the hospital where the operating theatre was located.\n\n\"It sounds more likely as opposed to [Dr Nott's] laptop being hacked that someone used that,\" said Mr Hickey.\n\n\"It would have taken a matter of minutes.\"\n\nNewsnight journalist John Sweeney tweeted: \"Did Russian/Syrian bombs target this hospital in Aleppo because of our @BBCNewsnight film with @NottFoundation? If so, a sickening act of inhumanity.\"\n\nIn a statement, the BBC said: \"The bombing of the M10 hospital in Aleppo was a tragedy, but we haven't seen any evidence to suggest that the attack was linked to the Newsnight report or the many other media stories about the work of David Nott and the doctors in the hospital.\n\n\"The hospital had already been targeted many times before our report, and the suggestion of such a link remains purely speculative.\"\n\nThe air strike in 2016 caused a direct hit to the M10 hospital's operating theatre, resulting in the deaths of two patients.\n\nThe hospital was subsequently closed permanently.\n\nDr Nott has said that, following advice from people working in war zones, he will not offer help to surgeons via the internet again.\n\n\"It is a crime against humanity that you can't even help a doctor in another country carry out an operation. It is a travesty,\" he told the Telegraph.\n\nThe hospital had previously been bombed 17 times, but Dr Nott has said he thinks it was by hacking him that the attackers were able to direct the bomb accurately at the operating theatre.\n\nMr Hickey pointed out that there were many other ways in which an aggressor could have spied on the hospital.\n\nWithout accessing the computer devices used and analysing them forensically, there was no way of knowing what actually happened, he told the BBC.\n\nBut technology such as a virtual private network - which uses a third party's servers for private access to the internet - and secure laptops could in theory be used to allow pioneering surgeries like this to happen again.\n\nMr Hickey added: \"The lesson should be learned, building a more secure solution for doing that kind of work would be advantageous.\"",

                "body": "The South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, once known only as a quirky week of musical performances, has become a showcase for national pride and self-promotion.\n\nIn the past few years SXSW, as it's abbreviated, has grown into a technology summit, a film festival and - thanks to the increasing presence of foreign governments - a mix of Disney-style paeans to cultural identity and the kitsch of a world's fair, with a heavy dose of booze and partying.\n\nAll across downtown Austin, national tourism and trade bureaus have rented out entire restaurants, bars and even homes and changed them, for more than a week of events, into miniature embassies of culture and business.\n\nSeveral national airlines have even offered a handful of special non-stop flights from their home nations to Austin just to help their residents make the trip to the heart of Texas.\n\nDenmark brought Michelin-rated chef Mads Refslund from New York to create Nordic-inspired appetisers for visitors to the Scandinavia House and cook a multi-course dinner - with offerings like raw sweet shrimps with fermented plums and oxalis and fire-roasted bone marrow - for select guests in a private dining room.\n\n\"We're a very small country, and the competition is harsh,\" says Anja Hartung, head of business development at VisitDenmark. \"But on the food scene, I think we have some strong offerings.\"\n\nDenmark also provided seminars in hygge - the lifestyle and attitude that Hartung says is the key to her nation's happiness.\n\nFor a week and a half in Austin, at least, every country at South by Southwest is promoting something - whether it's happiness, technology, art or music.\n\nThe German Haus offers sausage and giant pretzels along with a heavy dose of techno music. Belgium's pavilion serves up flights of its traditional wheat beers. Australia opened with a barbecue party - shrimp, barramundi and lamb - while a giant screen replayed coverage of an Australian surfing competition. The following day it plied visitors with a selection from their top vineyards.\n\nBut what exactly do the various countries hope to get out of their presence here? (Besides, of course, the not-to-be-discounted opportunity for various foreign officials to enjoy Austin's mild climate and sample the city's extensive assortment of breakfast tacos.)\n\n\"It's a great chance to show off what's good about the UK,\" says Ross Allen, director of the British Department for International Trade for North America. \"It's a chance to generate concrete business leads, to make new export opportunities and new investments.\"\n\nThe UK has the biggest foreign presence in Austin again this year, with hundreds of companies and over a thousand people. Unlike some countries, Allen says, they don't have to be quite as rah-rah about their presentations.\n\n\"Sometimes we're really in-your-face British, and stick the flag all over it,\" he says. \"And sometimes we push the British stuff back a little bit because you want it to be much subtler.\"\n\nThe UK's opening reception, for instance, featured Mexican food along with music from British DJs.\n\nOne of the UK's flagship exhibits, a virtual-reality art installation called Colossal Wave, was a collaboration that arose when UK-based Marshmallow Laser Feast met a Canadian team at last year's South by Southwest. Participants don headsets that let them float like musical angler fish or rise above a surreal sea as geese fly by and a psychedelic wave crashes overhead.\n\nEvery year new nations join the Austin frenzy. Peru rented out a house on Rainey Street, not too far from Australia's home - a veritable embassy row a few blocks from downtown. Visitors can pose with a giant stuffed llama, take a virtual tour of Machu Picchu and sip an alcohol concoction called Pisco punch.\n\nAfrica also has its first-ever presence at the festival. A group of African nations opened with a late-night dance party featuring regional performers, followed by a series of lectures on the continent's growing business enterprises.\n\nIn a panel on Nigerian technology companies one morning, moderator Aubrey Hruby explained that Americans and Nigerians have a lot in common. They both can be assertive and boisterous. They're entrepreneurial and ambitious. As Nigeria grows, they could form valuable business partnerships.\n\nThere's more that unites us than divides us, she concluded.\n\nIf that sounds a bit like a Disney World slogan, it probably is.\n\nAfter a week of music, libations and decadence, however, it starts to make perfect sense.",

                "body": "The majority of the Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by militants from the town of Dapchi last month have been returned, the government says.\n\nNigeria's Ministry of Information says 76 of the 110 schoolgirls were brought back in the early hours of this morning following \"back channel efforts\".\n\nThe army then \"paused\" its operations in the area to ensure \"lives were not lost\", the statement continued.\n\nHowever, the statement did not address reports a number of the girls had died.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said in the statement that girls were released \"unconditionally\" and \"with the help of some friends of the country\".\n\n\"The government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option,\" Mr Mohammed added.\n\nHe also revealed the numbers could go up because the girls were not handed over to anyone in particular, allowing for an official count.\n\nParent Kundili Bukar told the BBC the militants - understood to be Boko Haram - drove into the town in a motorcade in the early hours of Wednesday morning and surrendered the girls to the community.\n\nThe militants are said to have left immediately. He said the girls were looking haggard and tired - although some reportedly found the strength to run home to their families after being released.\n\nAnother parent, Manuga Lawal, said he had managed to speak to his daughter, who was among the kidnapped girls, on the phone.\n\nThe girls were taken from their school on the evening of Monday, 19 February, by a group of militants who had attacked the town of Dapchi.\n\nOriginally, it was claimed many of the girls had escaped and no-one had been kidnapped. But a week later, authorities admitted they were taken by the Islamist militants.\n\nNigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, who called the kidnappings a \"national disaster\" and apologised to the girls' families, indicated on 12 March that the government was negotiating with the militants to secure girls' release and were not seeking a military solution.\n\n\"We are trying to be careful. It is better to get our daughters back alive,\" he said in a press release seen by news agency AFP.\n\nTomi Oladipo, the BBC's Africa security correspondent, explains why an IS-backed faction of Boko Haram, suspected to be behind the Dapchi girls abduction, is using a different playbook.\n\nThe return of more than 70 Dapchi schoolgirls indicates that a Boko Haram faction, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is taking a different approach to kidnappings.\n\nNegotiations for the Chibok girls' release proved difficult under Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau. More than 100 of them still remain in captivity.\n\nBut despite reports, Wednesday's release did not come free. Boko Haram definitely got something in return for waltzing back into Dapchi and dropping off the girls.\n\nThe problem going forward is that this will encourage the IS-linked militants to hit jackpot once again by raiding another community and abducting another set of people.\n\nThe Nigerian government might feel like it has averted the kind of global disrepute that plagued the administration of the former president, Goodluck Jonathan, following its poor response to the kidnapping of the Chibok girls.\n\nBut this is only a minor PR victory for President Muhammadu Buhari's administration. Boko Haram and its various factions suffered no losses on Wednesday and they will remain a scourge in Nigeria.\n\nThe kidnapping raised uncomfortable parallels with the abduction of the Chibok girls, who were taken from their school in neighbouring Borno state in April 2014.\n\nThe military and the government initially denied the kidnappings in Chibok, some 275km (170 miles) south-east of Dapchi.\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan was criticised for not doing enough to recover the girls.\n\nThe Chibok abduction sparked global outrage and led to one of the biggest social campaigns in recent years.\n\nMore than 100 of the 276 kidnapped schoolgirls remain in captivity.",

                "body": "The head of the Vatican communications department has resigned after coming under fire for doctoring a letter sent by retired Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nA brief Vatican statement said Pope Francis had \"accepted\" the resignation of Msgr. Dario Vigano.\n\nIt comes after the Vatican admitted blurring part of a letter about Pope Francis written by his predecessor, in a picture sent to the media.\n\nThe tampering caused controversy amid concern over so-called \"fake news\".\n\nProfessional standards of photojournalism forbid adding or removing anything from photographs, especially manipulations that alter their meaning. Media outlets covering the Pope often rely on handout images from the Vatican.\n\nThe row began after Msgr. Vigano, whose official title was prefect of the Vatican Secretariat for Communication, asked Pope Benedict XVI to write some \"dense theology\" to be read at a presentation event for a new series of books about Pope Francis.\n\nIn his letter, Pope Benedict welcomed the publication of the volumes, but said he would not be able to write a reflection because he would not have time to read them.\n\nMsgr. Vigano read selected passages from the letter at a presentation on 12 March. Then journalists received a doctored image of the letter, which blurred out the lines where Pope Benedict explained he would not be reading the books.\n\nIn his letter of resignation (in Italian), Msgr. Vigano told Pope Francis that although it was not intentional, his actions had \"destabilised the complex and great work of reform\".\n\n\"I think that for me stepping aside would be a fruitful occasion for renewal,\" he said.\n\nThe Vatican press office has not explained why the picture of the letter was doctored. It told the Associated Press that it was never intended for full publication.\n\nThough Pope Benedict is often characterised as a more hardline, doctrinaire pontiff than Francis, he has spoken warmly of his successor and his \"goodness\".\n\nFor his part, Francis has praised Benedict's decision to resign from the papacy in 2013 as \"courageous\".\n\n\"I think that a Pope emeritus should not be an exception,\" he told reporters in August 2014. \"You can ask me: 'What if one day you don't feel prepared to go on?' I would do the same, I would do the same!\"",

                "body": "This might be the biggest crisis Facebook has faced since its founding, and the company's initial response has not helped.\n\nThe proposed departure of the company's data security chief, Alex Stamos, has spread anxiety through the company internationally, and it is being reported that this opened up already significant divisions within the company about just how transparent it should be.\n\nThe leadership question goes higher, however, to Mark Zuckerberg. When it was first suggested that Russia may have used the platform to interfere in the 2016 election, Zuckerberg initially described that as a \"pretty crazy idea\". Months later he recanted, and announced a raft of measures to address the viral spread of disinformation.\n\nThis time, following the dogged and undercover reporting of Channel 4 News, The Observer and The New York Times, Facebook has responded with the bold assertion that tens of millions of people having their data scraped and passed on to a third party does not constitute a data breach.\n\nBoth Facebook and Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing or breaking the law.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub. If this indeed isn't a data breach; if it doesn't strike these companies as a cause for alarm; and if what has happened is legal, then that might be the very reason that Facebook's users - all two billion of them - should be worried.\n\nFacebook has grown dizzyingly rich by operating what is in effect a mass surveillance tool. Most users have no idea just how much social media companies know about them. The business model that has made Facebook very rich is based on the quality of that data. Facebook uses that data to sell your attention to advertisers. Advertisers use smart messaging to influence behaviour, and try to get us to buy their products.\n\nAs Hugo Rifkind wrote in The Times, what has happened now is that Facebook, the biggest and most powerful social media platform, has gone from selling mere products to selling politics, too. Political operatives, whether they be from democracies or not, also want to use smart messaging to influence behaviour, in order to get us to vote for a particular candidate, or to undermine a consensus and degrade the truth.\n\nA smart corporate response from Facebook would grant that the remarkable innovations and technology that have created its news feed, an often addictive and for now free product, are now being exploited for goals that are not always socially desirable.\n\nInstead the company's instinct was to alight on a technicality, and say this was no data breach, despite the fact that it suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its whistleblower, Chris Wylie. Now at last the company is stepping into gear, calling a meeting of all staff to address concerns and answer questions.\n\nSeveral different investigations on both sides of the Atlantic are now underway. Mark Zuckerberg may not want to appear before the DCMS Select Committee, but he will have to make a public pronouncement soon enough. Blog posts alone won't do.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that, with all the zeal that has become customary in the world of superstar tech firms, Facebook executives talk about their company in missionary terms. We're on a mission, they say, to make the world more open and connected.\n\nThere is a tension, then, between the liberal inclinations of some Facebook staff - though of course the company as a whole is politically neutral - and the fact that a British company on whose board Steve Bannon sits may have used the platform to help President Trump gain office. Of course, Cambridge Analytica's power could be wildly over-stated, and we don't yet know sufficient detail on Russian misbehaviour on the platform.\n\nThere is a tension between the globalist outlook of a company that hires supremely clever graduates from around the world, and the more nationalist tendencies of the current White House administration.\n\nAnd there is a tension between the self-declared mission to champion openness, and the fact that Mark Zuckerberg, for reasons still unclear, seemed to be unavailable for comment as lawmakers demanded to hear from him.\n\nAt some point, these tensions become unbearable. A month ago ago, I said Facebook may have peaked, in influence if not in wealth. I wonder if Alex Stamos's departure will persuade some staff there of this thesis.",

Another officer opened fire.\n\nPolice later confirmed that the blast had killed the suspect.\n\nAustin police chief Brian Manley said that local residents should \"remain vigilant\", and urged anyone who noticed a suspicious package to contact the authorities.\n\n\"We don't know where the suspect has been over this past 24 hours,\" he said, adding that it was possible that additional devices may have been distributed.\n\n\"We do not understand what motivated him to do what he did,\" Chief Manley added.\n\nMr Manley also praised his colleagues in a tweet. \"I can't thank the men and women of #AustinPD or our Federal partners enough for their tireless work in restoring peace to our community,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, CCTV images of a \"person of interest\" were shared on US media showing a white male with blond hair carrying a number of large packages at a FedEx store in Austin.\n\nAustin has been on edge amid the attacks, which have led to the deployment of hundreds of police officers in the city.\n\nTwo people have been killed and six injured in the bombings.\n\nAuthorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related:\n\nBy Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin\n\nThis was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror.\n\nIt was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation.\n\nBut the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide.\n\nAnother crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office.\n\nAs police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas.\n\nAnd while this might feel like it's over, the admission from police that they don't know where the suspect was for the past day means more devices could be out there and it is too soon for Austin to completely relax.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has praised the work of the authorities in Austin.\n\n\"Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!\" he tweeted.\n\nMr Trump said earlier that \"a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals\" carried out the blasts and pledged justice for the victims.",

                "body": "In the Middle East, the word 'belly-dancing' is never used for this languorous dance form; it's called 'baladi' - best translated from Arabic as 'folk' - and was originated in Egypt, though several variations exist throughout the Arab world.\n\nIn the 40s and 50s, Egyptian cinema was full of curvaceous baladi dancers who were respected as the Marilyn Monroes and Sophia Lorens of Middle Eastern cinema. But as the golden age of Egyptian cinema faded and religious conservatism increased in society, baladi was marginalised and associated one-dimensionally with male arousal.\n\nAlexandre Paulikevitch is one of the few male baladi dancers in the Middle East. He learned how to dance from watching Egypt's black and white movies and now performs as a soloist, challenging his audiences to think differently about baladi - not only as a post-colonial dance that's distant from 'belly-dancing' or 'danse orientale' but as a dance that men and women alike can perform. Though Beirut is one of the region's most open-minded cities towards the LGBT movement, Alexandre has had to fight to be respected as a gay performer that's freely expressing his feminine side.\n\nWe went to his class in Beirut to find out what he's doing to revolutionise this Eastern dance.",

Reports say the number killed may rise.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility. Sectarian attacks on Shias have increased in recent years.\n\nMany have been claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\nAn interior ministry spokesman told the BBC a suicide attacker approached the Sakhi shrine on foot and detonated his explosives when identified by police.\n\nThe blast occurred outside Ali Abad hospital, close to Kabul University in the west of the city, he said.\n\nScores of people were killed in a wave of Taliban and IS attacks on Kabul in January, underlining the city's fragile security.\n\nOne attack, claimed by the Taliban, was the deadliest for months. An ambulance packed with explosives killed more than 100 people in the Chicken Street shopping area.\n\nBoth the Taliban and IS seem to be focusing their energies on carrying out attacks in Kabul, correspondents say.\n\nUS and Afghan officials say this is in response to air strikes and other security operations which have pushed the militants back in some areas.\n\nBut it's also possible the militants see attacks on the capital as a more effective way of undermining confidence in the government than trying to capture and retain territory in rural areas.\n\nThe Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan - and IS militants hold sway in a much smaller number of districts.\n\nHowever, both groups have demonstrated their ability to hit targets across the country.\n\nThey have often come into conflict with each other, too.",

                "body": "The number of women using donated eggs has risen sharply in the past 10 years, latest figures show.\n\nThere were 1,912 women who had IVF using a donor egg in 2006, compared to 3,924 in 2016, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said.\n\nIt attributed the rise to a greater awareness of donation as an option, more donors, and more same sex couples, single and older women using them.\n\nThe number of women donating their eggs is also on the increase.\n\nWomen usually need to be between 18 and 35 to donate their eggs and the process for donating is similar to the early stages of IVF, involving hormone injections and egg removal.\n\nHFEA, the UK fertility industry's regulator, said there were 3,924 IVF treatment cycles in women using donated eggs in 2016.\n\nOf these, the largest group of women using donated eggs were those over 44 years old.\n\nHFEA said about one in three IVF treatment cycles resulted in a birth for patients under 35, with current treatments now 85% more likely to succeed than they were when records began in 1991.\n\nChair Sally Cheshire said: \"There are more options these days for people to be able to create their own families.\n\n\"We have seen an increase in egg donation and sperm donation, and in people who use both.\n\n\"Generally there is a greater awareness of donation, we have seen a rise - about a third up - in same sex couples and single women coming forward for donation but it's important to say that they still represent a very small percentage of the number of IVF cycles that take place.\"\n\nUnder UK law, women cannot be paid for egg donation but can receive compensation of up to ?750 per cycle to cover their expenses.\n\nCathy Nicholson, from York, has donated her eggs five times, donating every year for five years since she was 27.\n\nShe has helped a family where the woman had undergone cancer treatment, a same-sex couple and couples with fertility problems.\n\nThe 38-year-old, who is expecting her third child in May, said: \"People that receive eggs are absolutely amazed that other women want to give them, but that is because at the end of their process they get this amazing baby.\n\n\"It's an involved process, it's a commitment, but really it is a drop in the ocean compared to what couples have to go through to make their babies possible.\n\n\"I didn't feel I was giving anything away that I was going to use for myself.\"\n\nAmanda Mitcheson, 49, from Doncaster, started trying for a baby at 38 but she struggled to conceive and was told she had no egg reserves.\n\nShe started IVF and went to America to find an egg donor, spending ?30,000, but without success.\n\nShe eventually used an egg donor from the UK and now has a four-year-old son, Max.\n\n\"It's the greatest gift that any woman can give to another,\" she said.\n\n\"People take it for granted they can have kids and when you find out you can't it's absolutely devastating.\n\n\"If Max wants to meet the donor when he's 18, in the same process as adoption, he can do that if he wishes and I'll support him in that,\" she said.\n\nSource: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK\n\nAltrui, in Hawes, North Yorkshire, is the only company in the UK to recruit egg donors.\n\nFounder Alison Bagshawe said: \"We get people who are on the bone marrow register, blood donor register, people who just genuinely want to help someone start a family.\n\n\"They may have actually seen a friend or family member struggling with fertility issues and it's that which gives them a trigger to find out more and come forward.\n\n\"It's extraordinary how many recipients we actually have coming to us who didn't even know they could have the help of an egg donor - that they've even got a finite number of eggs and there is a time clock ticking for them, so yes I think people are far more aware now.\n\n\"That's what has changed in the last five years or so, this general awareness that fertility is finite and you need to get on with it.\"",

                "body": "An academic who created an app which harvested data from 50 million users says he has been made \"a scapegoat\" for Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nDr Aleksandr Kogan completed work for Cambridge Analytica in 2014, but said he had no idea the data would be used to benefit Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nThe psychology academic said he wanted the data so he could model human behaviour through social media.\n\nFacebook says Dr Kogan violated the site's policies.\n\nThe Cambridge University researcher developed a personality survey called This is Your Digital Life.\n\nAbout 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends.\n\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie said that, as a result, the data of about 50 million users was harvested for the analysis firm.\n\nDr Kogan said he was \"stunned\" by the allegations made against him as he was advised the app was entirely legal.\n\nHe said: \"The events of the past week have been a total shell shock, and my view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica when... we thought we were doing something that was really normal.\n\n\"We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the terms of service.\"\n\nThe firm's chief executive Alexander Nix - who was suspended on Tuesday - was secretly recorded in a Channel 4 investigation saying the London-based company ran Donald Trump's digital campaign during the 2016 US election.\n\nHe said that the work the company did, including research, analytics and targeted campaigning, allowed the Republican candidate to win with a narrow margin of \"40,000 votes\" in three states.\n\n\"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\" he added.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies doing anything wrong and on Monday said the executives had \"entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\" in order to \"play along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment\".\n\nBut Dr Kogan said the accuracy of the dataset had been \"exaggerated\" by Cambridge Analytica, and said the dataset was more likely to hurt Mr Trump's campaign.\n\nA spokesperson for Facebook said the academic was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes.\n\nThey added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's fundamental principles.\n\nDr Kogan said he was following advice given to him by Cambridge Analytica, and added he had \"no reason to doubt\" that was breaking any policy with Facebook.\n\nOn Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had \"sought and received assurances\" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to \"request all relevant evidence in their possession\".\n\nBefore Channel 4 News had broadcast any of the secret filming, Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been \"deliberately entrapped\".\n\nThere have now been calls for an investigation into the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya.\n\nOn Tuesday a parliamentary committee called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence about the use of personal data by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDamian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of previously \"misleading\" the committee, and said it was \"now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process\".\n\nFacebook shares fell by a further 5% on Tuesday, following a 6.7% drop on Monday, meaning that in total, about $50bn has been wiped from its market value.\n\nThe UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she would be applying to court for a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission - which has the power to levy large fines - has also reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook.",

                "body": "There is a technical solution to keeping an open border in Ireland after Brexit, a customs expert has suggested.\n\nLars Karlsson, a former senior officer in Swedish customs, was giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee.\n\nThe elements of a \"smart border\" would make it possible to have no physical infrastructure at the frontier, he said.\n\nBut he agreed that a fully operational \"smart border\" is not currently in use anywhere in the world.\n\nHe described the current Sweden-Norway border as \"60-75% a smart border with the potential to be improved further\".\n\nHe was asked about a report that he had written for a committee of the European Parliament.\n\nThe Smart Border 2.0 report was based on an enhanced version of the Sweden-Norway border arrangements.\n\nMr Karlsson said that for a smart border to work, there would need to be a comprehensive \"trusted trader\" scheme which covered small businesses.\n\nTrusted trader schemes, also known as Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, allow companies to benefit from reduced physical checks.\n\nHowever, they also impose an administrative burden meaning that usually only large companies participate in the schemes.\n\nFor companies which are not part of a trusted trader scheme, Mr Karlsson suggested their goods could be inspected at facilities away from the border.\n\nHe also suggested there would also have to be mobile cross-border controls to tackle smuggling.\n\nHe used the example of Sweden and Norway where there are cross-border \"intervention zones\".\n\nHe said it was also a \"political issue\" to decide on the level of risk management required at each border.\n\nLast week, the Irish government said ideas in Smart Border 2.0 would not be enough to prevent a hard border after Brexit.\n\nIn a letter to The Times newspaper, Ireland's ambassador to the UK Adrian O'Neill, said proposals in the report \"rely on both physical infrastructure and staffed border posts.\"\n\nMr Karlsson was asked about the letter and said the shape of the border would depend on what was negotiated.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be gates, it's doesn't have to be number plate readers, it doesn't have to be CCTV readers, it's up to both sides to decide on the security level,\" he said.\n\nThe EU and UK have not reached agreement on the Irish border despite \"decisive\" progress on other Brexit issues.\n\nThe EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said the two sides had agreed on a transition period.\n\nIt will begin from Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - and is designed to smooth the path to the future permanent relationship.\n\nThe so-called backstop option for the Irish border remains a sticking point.",

He was widely seen as quiet and dependable, and someone she could trust entirely.\n\nMs Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy had a landslide win in elections held in November 2015.\n\nBut the leadership has been dogged by issues since it took power, most prominently the crisis in Rakhine state.\n\nTens of thousands of stateless Rohingya migrants have fled amid a military crackdown sparked by deadly attacks on police stations.\n\nThe government said it was targeting militants, but the scale of the operation has led to accusations that it could amount to genocide.\n\nIt has also seen Ms Suu Kyi's global popularity plummet, and she has found herself increasingly isolated by her former international allies.",

It is long been thought Israel was responsible, but it never acknowledged this until now.\n\nSyria has repeatedly denied that the bombed site was a nuclear reactor.\n\nThe admission comes after Israeli military censors lifted an order banning officials from discussing the operation.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has said in the past that the site was \"very likely\" to have been a nuclear reactor.\n\nIt has also suggested that it was being built with the help of North Korea.\n\nSyria, which has joined the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has denied this.\n\nIt released newly declassified materials related to the air raid on 5-6 September 2007.\n\nThey included what Israel says was footage of the strike on the al-Kubar facility in Syria's desert region, as well as photographs of the covert operation.\n\n\"On the night between 5-6 September 2007, Israeli Air Force fighter jets successfully struck and destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor in development,\" the Israeli army said in a statement.\n\n\"The reactor was close to being completed.\"\n\nIsrael said four F-16 and four F-15 fighter jets bombed the facility.\n\nAt the time of the attack it was clearly in Israel's interests to have a lack of clarity over who was behind the incident - to deter Bashar al-Assad's regime from having open grounds for retaliation.\n\nA blackout was imposed on Israeli media, and stories concerning the affair were censored or sat on for years to come - although it was freely discussed in the foreign media.\n\nBut as fears of Syrian retaliation dimmed, official reticence about the event eased, with censors finally relaxing restrictions over a decade later.\n\nAnd Israeli ministers now say the attack serves as a present-day message to its enemies - foremost among them its arch-enemy Iran, whose influence Israel fears is growing.\n\n\"The operation and its success made clear that Israel will never allow nuclear weaponry to be in the hands of those who threaten its existence - Syria then, and Iran today,\" Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael has recently intensified its warnings over the growing military presence of Iran in Syria.",

                "body": "When the German army attacked the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, tanks were a crucial factor in their initial success. German tanks roared across the Soviet border giving the enemy no time to recover.\n\nAs the Soviets reeled under the surprise attack, the most powerful German formations swept through what is now Belarus. Huge battles were fought, leaving the land strewn with dead bodies and ruined machines.\n\nNow, more than 75 years after the fighting, both Soviet and German tanks are being lifted from the marshes in Belarus. One Belarusian family has been looking for tanks littered all over the country's vast marshes and restoring them. With photographer Anton Skyba, I was able to witness one heavy Soviet tank, a KV-1, being restored after its recovery - and its participation in a re-enactment of a World War Two battle.\n\nThe family, the Yakushevs are the most famous \"tank-hunters\" in Belarus.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nSome years ago Vladimir Yakushev worked as a collective farm engineer. One day, some people asked him to find and lift up a BT-7 tank, that had been stuck in the marshes since 1942.\n\nOlder locals said the vehicle had sunk into soft ground near a spring, but nobody knew the exact location. Vladimir suggested that the tank had been blocking the spring and the water had found a new route. He was absolutely right - the BT-7 was discovered 10 metres (33ft) away from the current spring.\n\nThis was almost 20 years ago. Since then, Vladimir and his sons have taken dozens of armoured vehicles and almost every one has been restored to working condition. Now Vladimir works as the chief mechanic and renovator in a historic and cultural complex called the 'Stalin Line' near the country's capital, Minsk.\n\nBoth of his sons, Aleksei and Maxim have been working together with their father in the museum's hangar. The Yakushevs use a rotation scheme. They work and live on the museum's territory for nine days and then take a 270km (168 miles) trip home to their native village and stay there for five days.\n\nThe family has a small flat with a kitchen and a big common room with beds while they are based in the workshops.\n\n\"There was the time when we slept in vans,\" says Vladimir, who has been commuting from Stalin line to his home village for nine years. One son joined him in 2010, and the other in 2012.\n\nThe Yakushevs are not the only tank hunters in Belarus. Other amateurs also search for the lost vehicles. However, recovering such finds is time-consuming and the license for searching and recovering military equipment is only issued personally by the country's president, Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nOnly two teams have such a licence. The Yakushev family and a specialist in renovation, Alexander Mikalutski, are the first. The second team, an amateurs club called Poisk, which is where Vladimir and Mikalutski started to learn their trade almost 20 years ago.\n\nThe main object of these tank hunts is the armoured vehicles that became mired in marshes, many of which fell off bridges into the soft ground\n\n\"From the very beginning we worked without a salary. We thought, we would lift up tanks, renovate them and get money for this. But we had worked in Poisk for nine years and only received a salary for one year. I was growing potatoes, cucumbers, and selling them to make money for living,\" says Vladimir.\n\nNow the team works for an official fixed salary. The hobby has turned into their job, but the work itself feels like a holiday.\n\n\"When you have a good job, you don't need holidays,\" they joke. \"We want to create.\"\n\nThe main object of these tank hunts is the armoured vehicles that became mired in marshes, many of which fell off bridges into the soft ground. Those that slipped underneath the water were preserved. Tanks, even when set on fire by enemy guns (known as \"brewed up\" by tank crews), were seldom abandoned. If it was possible to lift up and fix it, it was removed by a maintenance battalion. The Germans were especially good at it. If they could not pull out the tank, it was filled with explosives and destroyed to stop it falling into enemy hands.\n\n\"We raised two brewed-up Panzers 38(t)s, and a German StuG III self-propelled gun [a tank-like vehicle with an artillery gun], all of them piece-by-piece,\" say the renovators. Throughout this period, the hunters lifted up only five tanks that were intact. \"Almost intact,\" Vladimir says. \"We put new turrets on them.\"\n\nThe crew collect data for months before they raise a tank\n\nOften they have to assemble a working model made up of pieces from several tanks. One Czech vehicle, now at the history of engineering in Tolyatti in Russia, was built from three separate vehicles.\n\nThe crew collect data for months before they raise a tank. They find help in archives and from older residents, some of whom were children during the war. Then they wander through forests and marshes searching for machines.\n\nVladimir has the most experience of walking through the mire. When it is very deep they put on chemical protection suits. They use metal detectors and feel into the mire with special 8m-long (26ft) probes.\n\n\"It is easy to hunt when you are shown a definite point,\" says Mikalutski. \"But to get to the point you may have to go five kilometres through marshes or snow. You reach the place and then you have to crawl back...\"\n\nFor the sake of their own safety, the tank hunters never go into the marshes alone.\n\nThey often spend nights near the marshes in a van. \"The strongest frost we have ever had when sleeping in a van is -33C. You used to come, change clothes and hide inside your house on wheels,\" says Vladimir.\n\nThere is a different problem in the summer. \"What a buzz it is at night. It seems mosquitoes will overturn the van.\"\n\nInsect repellents do not help in marshes. The conditions are extremely difficult in hot weather: they have to work in thick jackets and hats even when it is 30C because of clouds of insects.\n\nWhen a tank is being lifted up, the officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs arrive, take the ammunition, and seal off the area so that nobody has \"their head shot off\". The Ministry of Emergency Response officers drain the area the tank is stuck in. Then there are mine clearers sent by the Ministry of Defence; they clear the area of mines, while ammunition is removed and destroyed.\n\n\"It has never exploded,\" says Vladimir, as he superstitiously knocks on wood three times.\n\nLater, a tank is hooked by steel hawsers and pulled by a large lorry. One example, a KV-1, was lifted up in November 2015 near Senno, in the Vitebsk region of Belarus. The KV-1 got stuck there in July 1941, when one of the biggest tank battles of the Second World War took place. The battle involved about 2,000 tanks from both sides, including this KV-1.\n\nAfter a long fight, the Soviet forces had to retreat, with tanks ordered to drive through the forests to avoid air attack. This 47-tonne jumbo became stuck in a swamp. The tankmen tried to pull it out, asked the local villagers for help by putting logs under the caterpillar treads. But the tank was still stuck and they had to blow it up. A powerful blast threw the turret several metres away and it drowned in marshes - but survived to this day. During its recovery, eight unexploded shells were taken from it.\n\nWe even ate the German chocolate from this tank - Alexander Mikalutski\n\nIt is not just shells that see the light of day. Chocolate, hair brushes, and other personal items are found. Vladimir Yakushev recollects a unique discovery when they recovered a German Panzer III medium tank which fell into swamps in Vitebsk region.\n\n\"The tank was absolutely new, it ran only 400km. The crew was leaving it in a hurry, all things were left in their places.\" A pair of binoculars, socks, textbooks on agronomy (plant sciences) and accounting were all found in the upended tank. It seems that the Germans were sure that they would conquer the USSR and were already making plans for after the conflict.\n\nA parcel to one of the tankmen from Germany was discovered in the tank. Inside there were Soviet hair brushes and shaving razors.\n\n\"We even ate the German chocolate from this tank,\" says Mikalutski. Now the renovated tank is in the Belarusian State Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Minsk.\n\nOne tank, Vladimir says, was found with its entire crew still inside it. The bones were taken away to the Belarussian Ministry of Defense.\n\nIt has always been easier to lift up tanks than to restore them. During the war, tank-building made a giant leap both in the USSR and in Germany, with much less time between initial designs and construction. Sometimes tanks entered production too early; when the Soviet T-34 was rushed into production in 1941, more than 800 corrections had to be made to the design by the end of the year, some of them requiring entirely new parts. When renovators assemble one complete tank from several machines it can turn into quite the puzzle.\n\n\"You take the idle sprocket front jockey wheel from a T-34 launched in 1942 to put it on the model launched in 1941. But it doesn't match,\" says Vladimir.\n\nSometimes, he is the only person who knows how to fix a spare part or understand why the tank won't start. Vladimir was trained as mechanic. In order to help his father, his son Maxim became a welder and Aleksei a painter. Mikalutski is a former marine engineer, who worked in the navy search and rescue service for eight years.\n\nNot all tanks are built the same. \"If you want to change one spare part in a German tank you have to dismantle half of the machine,\" says Vladimir. \"Soviet tanks were made to be assembled and fixed fast, because in the war time even children were welding such machines.\" The restoration team claims that some hulls they found were clearly made by children.\n\nThe KV-1 was feared by the Germans because its armour was too thick for their standard shells\n\nThe KV-1 that they found needed five months of restoration.\n\nThe state military and industrial committee donated a self-propelled gun with similar parts, and the Belarussian Railways presented a traction engine converted from a self-propelled gun. These machines became the donors for the tank.\n\nNow the KV-1 differs from an original vehicle in only a handful of parts.\n\nThe KV-1 was feared by the Germans because its armour was too thick for their standard shells. In August 1941 the crew of the Soviet tank commander Kolobanov in a KV-1 knocked out 22 German tanks within 30 minutes after setting an ambush near the city of Leningrad. The KV-1 we have followed in this story was restored to help mark the 75th anniversary of Kolobanov's battle.\n\nWhere do these tanks go, after they have been restored? Some of them settle on plinths as monuments (practically every Belarusian town has one), while some become museum exhibits in Belarus or Russia. It is not easy to sell them abroad. Not every fighting machine can be sold. The sales permit is only issued if there are more than two examples in the country. The BT-7 the team helped bring back to life is the only working specimen in the world. \"It works, runs. On the wheels it can go 70km/h and on its tracks 55km/h,\" says Vladimir. At the time it was built [1935] it was the fastest tank. It could fly across bridges.\"\n\nWhen working for the club, they sold a German armored vehicle, an SdKfz 252, to a collector in Britain, and a Soviet heavy tank IS-2 went to a private collection in Latvia. This did not make the renovators rich. Vladimir drives an old Soviet Niva four-by-four. Occasionally they have to fix the car with their own hands; fortunately, they are very good at welding.\n\nThe BT-7 the team helped bring back to life is the only working specimen in the world\n\nThe biggest number of tanks are left in the Stalin Line museum complex. Working models live in the repair hangar. When they are not gathering dust they are participating in parades or filming. The developers of the computer game World of Tanks have even visited to record the sounds of different tanks.\n\n***\n\nAt least 15 times a year the complex, having built up a collection of working machines from the Second World War, shows battles re-enactments.\n\nThe restored KV-1 leaves the hangar to take part in a re-enactment. The team of renovators put on helmets and turn into the tank crew. They take part in the show, too.\n\n\"At first we always drive the last restored tank, break it in,\" they say. \"We do not trust the machine to the others: if they burn the engine clutch, it turns into a monument.\"\n\nThe performance in the open air shows an episode from the life of a Belarusian village during World War Two. This event is a reenactment of Operation Bagration in 1944, which saw the liberation of what is now Belarus.\n\nTanks are roaring and shooting, though thankfully all the ammunition is blank.\n\nAfter the re-enactment, the renovated tank is washed.\n\nToday the KV-1 has pretended to destroy two German tanks, a Panzer III and Panzer 38(t). But the tank renovators do not play favourites. \"All our tanks are our favourites, even the German ones,\" says Mikalutski.\n\n\"Earlier we restored mainly Soviet machines but as the re-enactments started, German tanks became necessary. To find and make a 'German' is such joy,\" he says. \"When a machine leaves the workshop, a tear of happiness drops on the metal.\"",

                "title": "Before Rosa Parks, there was a 15-year-old girl",
                "body": "In March 1955, nine months before Rosa Parks defied segregation laws by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, 15-year-old Claudette Colvin did exactly the same thing. Eclipsed by Parks, her act of defiance was largely ignored for many years. She herself didn't talk about it much, but she spoke recently to the BBC.\n\n\"There was segregation everywhere. The churches, buses and schools were all segregated and you couldn't even go into the same restaurants,\" Claudette Colvin says.\n\n\"I remember during Easter one year, I was to get a pair of black patent shoes but you could only get them from the white stores, so my mother drew the outline of my feet on a brown paper bag in order to get the closest size, because we weren't allowed to go in the store to try them on.\"\n\nGoing to a segregated school had one advantage, she found - her teachers gave her a good grounding in black history.\n\n\"We learned about negro spirituals and recited poems but my social studies teachers went into more detail,\" she says.\n\n\"They lectured us about Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth and we were taught about an opera singer called Marian Anderson who wasn't allowed to sing at Constitutional Hall just because she was black, so she sang at Lincoln Memorial instead.\"\n\nOn 2 March 1955, Colvin and her friends finished their classes and were let out of school early.\n\n\"We walked downtown and my friends and I saw the bus and decided to get on, it was right across the road from Dr Martin Luther King's church,\" Colvin says.\n\n\"The white people were always seated at the front of the bus and the black people were seated at the back of the bus. The bus driver had the authority to assign the seats, so when more white passengers got on the bus, he asked for the seats.\"\n\nThe problem arose because all the seats on the bus were taken. Colvin and her friends were sitting in a row a little more than half way down the bus - two were on the right side of the bus and two on the left - and a white passenger was standing in the aisle between them.\n\nThe driver wanted all of them to move to the back and stand so that the white passenger could sit.\n\n\"He wanted me to give up my seat for a white person and I would have done it for an elderly person but this was a young white woman. Three of the students had got up reluctantly and I remained sitting next to the window,\" she says.\n\nUnder the twisted logic of segregation the white woman still couldn't sit down, as then white and black passengers would have been sharing a row of seats - and the whole point was that white passengers were meant to be closer to the front.\n\nBut Colvin told the driver she had paid her fare and that it was her constitutional right to remain where she was.\n\n\"Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder. I felt inspired by these women because my teacher taught us about them in so much detail,\" she says.\n\n\"I wasn't frightened but disappointed and angry because I knew I was sitting in the right seat.\"\n\nThe driver kept on going but stopped when he reached a junction where a police squad car was waiting. Two policemen boarded the bus and asked Colvin why she wouldn't give up her seat.\n\n\"I was more defiant and then they knocked my books out of my lap and one of them grabbed my arm. I don't know how I got off that bus but the other students said they manhandled me off the bus and put me in the squad car. But what I do remember is when they asked me to stick my arms out the window and that's when they handcuffed me,\" Colvin says.\n\nInstead of being taken to a juvenile detention centre, Colvin was taken to an adult jail and put in a small cell with nothing in it but a broken sink and a cot without a mattress.\n\n\"I was scared and it was really, really frightening, it was like those Western movies where they put the bandit in the jail cell and you could hear the keys. I can still vividly hear the click of those keys.\n\n\"I waited for about three hours until my mother arrived with my pastor to bail me out. My mother knew I was disappointed with the system and all the injustice we were receiving and she said to me: 'Well, Claudette, you finally did it.'\"\n\nAfter Colvin was released from prison, there were fears that her home would be attacked. Members of the community acted as lookouts, while Colvin's father sat up all night with a shotgun, in case the Ku Klux Klan turned up.\n\nColvin was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, so her story made a few local papers - but nine months later, the same act of defiance by Rosa Parks was reported all over the world.\n\nLike Colvin, Parks was commuting home and was seated in the \"coloured section\" of the bus. When the white seats were filled, the driver, J Fred Black, asked Parks and three others to give up their seats. Like Colvin, Parks refused, and was arrested and fined.\n\nAt the time, Parks was a seamstress in a local department store but was also a secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP).\n\nColvin knew her very well.\n\n\"I became very active in her youth group and we use to meet every Sunday afternoon at the Luther church,\" she says.\n\n\"Ms Parks was quiet and very gentle and very soft-spoken, but she would always say we should fight for our freedom.\"\n\nColvin says Parks had the right image to become the face of resistance to segregation because of her previous work with the NAACP. The organisation didn't want a teenager in the role, she says.\n\nAnother factor was that before long Colvin became pregnant.\n\n\"They said they didn't want to use a pregnant teenager because it would be controversial and the people would talk about the pregnancy more than the boycott,\" Colvin says.\n\nOn the night of Parks' arrest, the Women's Political Council (WPC), a group of black women working for civil rights, began circulating flyers calling for a boycott of the bus system. Soon afterwards, on 5 December, 40,000 African-American bus passengers boycotted the system and that afternoon, black leaders met to form the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), electing a young pastor, Martin Luther King Jr, as their president.\n\nThe boycott was very effective but the city still resisted complying with protesters' demands - an end to the policy preventing the hiring of black bus drivers and the introduction of first-come first-seated rule. To sustain the boycott, communities organised carpools and the Montgomery's African-American taxi drivers charged only 10 cents - the same price as bus fare - for fellow African Americans.\n\nA year later, on 20 December 1956, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on the buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Claudette Colvin.\n\n\"The NAACP had come back to me and my mother said: 'Claudette, they must really need you, because they rejected you because you had a child out of wedlock,'\" Colvin says.\n\n\"So I went and I testified about the system and I was saying that the system treated us unfairly and I used some of the language that they used when we got taken off the bus.\"\n\nColvin says that after Supreme Court made its decision, things slowly began to change. However, some white passengers still refused to sit near a black person.\n\nWhen Colvin moved to New York many years later to become a nurse, she didn't tell many people about the part she played in the civil rights movement.\n\n\"New York is a completely different culture to Montgomery, Alabama. Most of the people didn't have problems with us sitting on the bus, most New Yorkers cared about economic problems. I didn't want to discuss it with them,\" she says.\n\nIn 2009, the writer Phillip Hoose published a book that told her story in detail for the first time.\n\n\"He said he wanted the people to know about the 15-year-old, because really, if I had not made the first cry for freedom, there wouldn't have been a Rosa Parks, and after Rosa Parks, there wouldn't have been a Dr King.\n\n\"And I lived to see that change.\"\n\nListen to Claudette Colvin's interview on Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nFifty years have passed since campaigners overturned a ban on ethnic minorities working on buses in one British city. Today their boycott, modelled on the one in Montgomery, is largely forgotten - but it was a milestone in achieving equality.",

                "title": "Corrie: The story behind David Platt's rape",
                "body": "This week Coronation Street aired its first male rape storyline, proving to be one of its most controversial topics to date.\n\nThe scenes, which see newcomer Josh Tucker drug and sexually assault hairdresser David Platt, have generated over 100 complaints to Ofcom.\n\nIt has also caused a debate on social media about the place of difficult real-life issues on light entertainment programmes.\n\nDavid's storyline has gone some way to highlight how seriously soaps take issue-based storylines and how much work goes into them.\n\nRyan Clayton - who plays Josh - tells the BBC he \"can't stress the importance\" of why stories like this need to be aired and brought to a wider audience.\n\n\"The great thing, with whatever soap is covering it, is you've got millions of people tuning into a programme,\" he says.\n\nThe story of male rape is not new to soaps and Hollyoaks was the first to cover it - first in 2000 with Luke Morgan and in 2015 with John Paul McQueen.\n\nClayton says the reason the David Platt story has caused such a stir is because \"Corrie targets an older generation\" who he says can be \"naive\" about such issues, in comparison to the younger audience of Hollyoaks.\n\nHe also hopes that the difficult scenes could encourage viewers who have been victims of sexual assault to speak out for the first time.\n\nClayton worked with Duncan Craig, who used his own experience of rape and sexual assault to advise on every part of the story - from the moment the idea was discussed to the day it was filmed and edited.\n\nHis charity, Survivors Manchester, has also been involved in offering advice to victims off the back of the show.\n\n\"I wanted it to be like real life,\" Craig tells the BBC.\n\n\"Not the rape on Friday, telling the police on Monday and punishing the perpetrator on Tuesday.\"\n\nHe says that the team at Coronation Street, headed up by executive producer Kate Oakes, listened to his ideas throughout the entire process.\n\nCraig - who has waived his right to anonymity - was involved in script-writing, filming scenes and working with actors on the show to make sure everything felt like an accurate portrayal.\n\nHe first got involved in advising soaps on rape storylines by working on the John Paul scripts with a team of Hollyoaks writers.\n\n\"When I found out the character was David Platt, I knew this was so vitally important as he's someone viewers have grown up with - it feels like he's part of their family,\" says Craig.\n\n\"Corrie is an institution and a national treasure and I thought we had a real opportunity to show that rape can happen to anyone.\"\n\nHe highlights certain aspects of the story as being significant, including the fact that David is straight and raped by a man whose sexuality is unknown - adding that in many instances, it is assumed that the rapist is gay.\n\n\"It was important that David was not raped by a stranger because that story's been told in drama a few times - victims are more likely to know the perpetrator,\" Craig adds.\n\nSomething both Craig and Clayton also mention is the importance in the story of accurately portraying male mental health.\n\n\"David's never had a positive relationship with men. Recently his half-brother has disappeared and he's never really known his dad,\" Craig adds.\n\nClayton says he made sure to correctly portray the most sensitive aspects of the story - including grooming David and slipping the drug GBH into his drink - when playing Josh.\n\n\"Every bit of information from David's past, Josh laps up and takes to his advantage,\" says Clayton.\n\n\"He's very manipulative and takes an opportunity - David needs a new male role model.\n\n\"In Josh's mind he won't accept that he's raped David - he sees it as a night of fun, (that) David is the one with a troubled past.\"\n\nThe storyline also brought a new element to the soap - looking at the idea of male vulnerability.\n\n\"Maybe there's a crisis in masculinity,\" Craig adds, when asked why some people are reacting negatively to the plot.\n\n\"Men don't know what it means to be a man or how they should be and this is a huge story to talk about.\n\n\"It's about shame, guilt, anxiety and depression, sense of self and worthlessness, not being able to be a 'man' and is connected to psychological wellbeing.\n\n\"Rape and sexual assault is about power and control and when someone's had this asserted over them, you're left with a sense of nothingness.\"\n\nClayton adds: \"If you look at the figures for male rape, on average it takes men 20 years to open up.\n\n\"When you think about the way men deal with it, some will take it to the grave.\"",

                "title": "The secret science that rules crowds",
                "body": "Sometimes, being part of a large crowd can be worse than uncomfortable: it can turn lethal. Deadly crowd crushes that occurred in 2017 include incidents in an Angolan football stadium, an Italian piazza and a Moroccan food aid centre.\n\nThese events are tragic and mostly avoidable. Scientists in the UK around the world are figuring out new ways to minimise the chance of them happening again.\n\nMost of human behaviour is very predictable, because we are very rational beings\n\n\"Most of human behaviour is very predictable, because we are very rational beings,\" says Shrikant Sharma, Smart Space Group Director of UK engineering firm BuroHappold. This predictability allows data analysts to envision how people will move through space - and how that can be affected by changes to their environment.\n\nCrowd psychology has been around since the 19th Century. But it's only in the last few decades that there's been a major shift to seeing crowds as more than mindless masses. \"The crowd is as psychologically specific as the individual,\" says the University of Sussex's John Drury, an expert on the social psychology of crowd management.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n* The benefits of being a loner\n\n* When personalities go from bad to good\n\n* What not to do in a disaster\n\nIn the 1980s, psychological findings were applied to riots, in the 2000s to mass emergencies, and in the 2010s to music festivals and large events. Now, crowd psychology is being used in more specialised emergencies - such as CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear) attacks.\n\nIn fact, the work of psychologists and disaster specialists shows that a collective identity often emerges during emergencies. This identity is key to determining how cooperative and resilient a crowd will be in a given situation. In their interviews with survivors of the 2005 7/7 London bombings, for example, Drury and colleagues found that there had been lots of cooperation between members of the crowd: they comforted each other, shared water, and provided basic first aid.\n\n\"It's important not to do things that would undermine the emergence of this shared kind of social identity,\" Drury says. Because crowd identity comes to supersede other affiliations, for example, it would be unhelpful to divide the crowd into religious or ethnic groups in the hope of making it more manageable. These findings have been integrated into emergency response guidelines of organisations like the UK's National Health Service (NHS).\n\nIt's also key to understand the 'rules' that govern a given kind of crowd. Take moshpit behaviour at a punk or metal gig. There's a logic to this seething mass of bodies, though it might not be visible to outsiders. This logic keeps fans from being trampled. Remarkably, it even means that moshers moving in a rough circle often will end up right where they started. \"Crowd safety managers know that when you see slamdancing and moshing, that is rule-bound,\" Drury says.\n\nBut if inexperienced security officers who don't know the scene assume that this behaviour is dangerous and start applying physical force, this could be what actually makes the situation dangerous. This happened at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when 96 people died after being crushed in a football stadium in Sheffield, UK. Some police and stewards were so preoccupied with possible hooliganism that their actions, like penning fans into tight packs, made things worse.\n\nIf people are primed to believe that others will panic in a crowd, they're more likely to panic themselves\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint it is also important not to overstate the dangers of a crowd. Drury explains that despite how rare disasters are, the media and popular culture often exaggerate the dangers. It's more dramatic for storytelling purposes to use a term like \"panic\" rather than \"sudden evacuation\", for example, even though mass panic is rare.\n\nThe problem is that if people are primed to believe that others will panic in a crowd, they're more likely to panic themselves - even in the absence of actual danger.\n\nAdvance plan\n\nWhen it comes to a particular event or building, research also is helping the development of ways to keep crowds safe. Often, the best measures are the most unexpected.\n\nFrom a light-filled office overlooking the River Avon in Bath, Sharma's Smart Space team gathers abundant data on factors that influence crowd behaviour, from wind conditions to cultural preferences for personal space. Using their own crowd simulation software package, they plot these variables in different scenarios to show how even simple steps - like moving an exit in a block of flats - can avoid overcrowding.\n\n\"Data will often challenge your assumptions,\" Sharma says. Hospital staff may report that one area of their floor is the busiest, for example. But placing tracking tags on staff might show that the centre of activity is elsewhere. This would suggest a different way of organising the space.\n\nSometimes recommendations are even simpler. One Newcastle school faced a crush of students each time the school bell rang. Sharma's team watched students struggling to walk down a corridor in multiple directions. They realised that the school's idea - widening the corridor - would be both unnecessary and costly.\n\nInstead, Sharma's team recommended something far simpler: get rid of the school bell. Once teachers were able to wrap up their lessons within a range of a few minutes, classes didn't all let out at precisely the same time. Suddenly, moving down the corridor was relatively smooth.\n\nAs a result, even in places with limited resources, Sharma believes that asking the right questions could help avoid crowd crushes. Mumbai's train stations are notoriously overcrowded, for instance. Ensuring that correct information is shared, and paying attention to how passengers are diverted from the exits, could help avoid more tragedies like the 2017 stampede on the stairs of Elphinstone Road station, which resulted in at least 22 deaths.\n\nDespite the progress that crowd management science has made, there's still more scope for improvement.\n\nThe work of psychologist Anne Templeton of the University of Kent, for example, shows that many crowd simulation tools fail to account for the way members of a crowd interact with each other. A 'physical crowd' (basically just a group of bodies in the same space) would be modelled differently to a 'psychological crowd' (where a crowd has a shared sense of identity). For instance, Templeton says, \"at a fundamental movement level, psychological crowds will walk slower and further in order to keep close formation with fellow crowd members.\"\n\nThe increasing sophistication of data modelling may allow for these harder-to-see factors to be incorporated into scenario planning. \"Physical crowds can become psychological crowds in emergencies, and so computer models should also be versatile to accommodate the change in group identity and behavioural changes that come with it,\" Templeton says. Interviews (what people say) could be combined with sensors (what people do) to achieve a fuller understanding of human behaviour and needs.\n\nCrowds are surprisingly complex and sophisticated. But so, increasingly, are techniques for understanding them.\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\n\nThis story is a part of BBC Britain - a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

But the latter \"initiated\" it, causing the incident.\n\nThe unnamed member of staff was now \"recovering well\", the police said.\n\nEarlier in the day, a parcel bomb had exploded at a FedEx depot in Schertz, near Austin, slightly injuring one person.\n\nFBI officials said another package at a separate FedEx facility in the area \"was disrupted by law enforcement\" on the same day. It did not explode.\n\nThey began in early March, with police confirming four attacks in Austin and one in Schertz, 65 miles (104km) south of the state capital.\n\nFour of the five devices were hidden in parcels and one was probably activated by a tripwire:\n\n\"The bombings in Austin are terrible,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals.\n\n\"We will get to the bottom of it.

                "body": "Dinosaurs like the Triceratops may have had horns and frills to attract a mate, a new study suggests.\n\nCeratopsian, or horned dinosaurs, were previously thought to have developed this ornamentation to distinguish between different species.\n\nThis has now been ruled out in a study published in a Royal Society journal.\n\nInstead, the aggressive-looking armour may actually have evolved to signal an animal's suitability as a partner, known as socio-sexual selection.\n\n\"Individuals are advertising their quality or genetic make-up,\" explained Andrew Knapp, lead author of the research reported in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\n\"We see that in peacocks too, with their tail feathers.\"\n\nFeatures that can differentiate between species are usually less elaborate than those distinguishing males and females.\n\nTo prevent mating with other species, only subtle indications are needed. When the goal is to repel, not attract, it is not worth putting in the extra evolutionary effort.\n\nThe study's original design was to determine whether the distinctive horns and frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs were for this inter-species purpose.\n\nPrevious research had ruled out their use for predator defence and regulating body temperature.\n\n\"It is exciting that dinosaur fossils are being examined more and more exhaustively in order to further understand their palaeobiology,\" commented Dr Darla Zelenitsky, from the University of Calgary, Canada, who was not involved in the study.\n\nFossil records for all known ceratopsian species were analysed by location and time period.\n\n\"Some of these ornaments were also likely used at times for defence against predators or, to some extent, for recognition of members of different species, but these were apparently not the primary driver in their evolution,\" added Dr Zelenitsky, who teaches palaeobiology.\n\nFurther work will now be done to test whether socio-sexual selection is the motivating factor behind the evolution of these ornaments.\n\nMr Knapp points out that there is not a massive amount of evidence for species recognition even in living animals. Instead, there may be some more innate understanding at work.\n\n\"Individuals within large herds such as reindeer don't have trouble distinguishing their siblings,\" the Queen Mary University of London, UK, researcher said.\n\nThe study did find that male and female ceratopsian dinosaurs could not be distinguished from each other in the fossil record. If there were physical differences, they may have been very subtle.\n\n\"The fact that they both have these large ornaments is very interesting in itself. If it is sexual selection, that will tell us a lot about how these animals lived,\" added Mr Knapp.\n\nCeratopsians are egg-laying, and the female does not need to carry young to term in the way that mammals do. This could point to a different breeding system with more mate co-operation.\n\n\"Possibly they're both quite invested in raising their young, like we see in birds,\" said Mr Knapp.",

                "body": "A longer transition period after Brexit may be needed to guarantee continued security co-operation, MPs have said.\n\nThe Commons Home Affairs Committee said the UK and EU should remain open to extending the transition phase after the UK's exit beyond December 2020.\n\nIt warned the EU against limiting co-operation to existing law enforcement and intelligence sharing and said the UK must go beyond its own \"red lines\".\n\nTheresa May wants a new security treaty to take effect at the start of 2021.\n\nThe UK's decision to leave the EU in March 2019, following the 2016 referendum vote, has called into question its future participation in EU-wide crime-fighting bodies such as Europol and law enforcement agreements such as the European Arrest Warrant extradition scheme.\n\nThe government has said it wants a new special security partnership with the EU which will maintain the existing level of co-operation on tackling serious crime and terrorism.\n\nIn a new report, the cross-party committee welcomed efforts to replicate current ties on Europol, the European Arrest Warrant and data sharing, but warned of complex legal and technical barriers in the way.\n\nIt said the UK should not assume that because it played a leading role in Europol and in intelligence-led policing on the continent that it would secure a more far-reaching deal than the EU has with other countries.\n\n\"This attitude, along with lack of planning for alternative scenarios, suggests that the government is at risk of sleep-walking into a highly detrimental outcome,\" it said.\n\nYvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said \"just because we all want something, it doesn't mean it will happen, unless enough work is put in in time to overcome the genuine legal, constitutional and political obstacles we have uncovered\".\n\nThe EU and UK have agreed, in principle, to a time-limited transition or implementation period that will last until the end of 2020 - during which the UK will abide by EU rules and regulations.\n\nThe government said both sides were committed to maintaining \"deep levels\" of co-operation after Brexit and that it expected formal negotiations on a new security partnership to begin soon.\n\n\"The draft agreement reached with the European Commission earlier this week means security cooperation with the EU can continue through the implementation period up to December 2020,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"We will be looking to secure a comprehensive new treaty on internal security co-operation that can begin directly after.\"",

                "title": "UK will lead European exoplanet mission",
                "body": "A telescope to study the atmospheres of planets beyond our Solar System will be launched by the European Space Agency in the late 2020s.\n\nThe mission, to be known as Ariel, was selected by the organisation's Science Programme Committee on Tuesday.\n\nThe venture will be led scientifically from the UK by University College London astrophysicist Giovanna Tinetti.\n\n\"In the next decade we will see many, many planets being discovered - thousands, actually,\" she said.\n\n\"All this is amazing, but we want to go beyond that and start to understand the nature of those planets, how they formed, how they evolved, and ultimately to put our Solar System in the bigger picture,\" the principal investigator told BBC News.\n\nAriel will use a metre-sized mirror and instrumentation designed to analyse, in visible and infrared light, the chemical make-up of the gases that shroud distant worlds, or exoplanets as they are known.\n\nThis information should provide insights on how certain types of planets come to form around particular stars.\n\nProf Tinetti explained: \"We want to sample lots of planets - some that are small like the Earth or very big like Jupiter; and at different temperatures - extremely hot, warm or temperate - around very different types of stars.\n\n\"We want to sample all the extremes and the more normal cases, because what we want to try to understand is the 'standard model' for planets, if such a model even exists.\"\n\nAriel (Atmospheric Remote-Sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey)\n\nAriel is the latest selection in Esa's Medium Class portfolio. To win the launch opportunity in 2028, the proposal had to beat competition from an X-ray telescope (Xipe) and a mission to study energetic particles around the Earth (Thor).\n\nA detailed technical assessment will now be conducted before the Ariel project is formally \"adopted\" - Esa legal-speak for \"final go-ahead\". This sign-off, which should happen in the next two years, paves the way for manufacture of the flight hardware.\n\nAriel is the third exoplanet venture chosen by Esa in recent years.\n\nAlready coming down the line is a small telescope called Cheops that should go up next year to better measure the size of these far-off worlds; and this will be followed in 2026 by Plato, a telescope that aims to find \"true Earths\" - planets the same size as our home world that orbit at the same distance from Sun-like stars.\n\nAnd the Americans, too, have their dedicated planet-hunters, with the newest, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), launching in the next few weeks.\n\nBut at some point, the science of exoplanets has to move beyond simply finding and counting objects; their chemical compositions and physical conditions have to be determined.\n\nThe telescope that will start to make big inroads into this problem is the James Webb observatory, the successor to Hubble.\n\nDue in orbit next year, it will study planetary atmospheres in exquisite detail with its 6.5m-diameter mirror. But the US space agency-led mission will probably only get to look at perhaps 150-200 exoplanets in its first five years of operation because of all the other demands on its time from astronomers.\n\nAriel, on the other hand, will have the single quest and that should see it characterising in the region of 500-1,000 planets during its primary years in orbit.\n\nAnd one aspect that would work in Ariel's favour is the absence of any moving parts in its build, commented Plato team-member Dr Don Pollaco from Warwick University, UK.\n\n\"The issue with all of these planet experiments is that the signals you are looking for are so incredibly small that any systematics in the instrument itself will dominate the signal,\" he explained.\n\n\"And the systematics are often associated with bits that move. So the great thing about Ariel is that it is fixed-format - nothing changes,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAriel is likely to cost Esa about ?460m (?405m) for the spacecraft chassis, the launch vehicle and operations. As is customary for science missions like this, the agency's individual member states pick up the cost of the scientific payload.\n\nThe UK will have the technical lead on the project and the instrumentation therefore will be assembled at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory at Harwell in Oxfordshire.\n\nDr Graham Turnock, the chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: \"It is thanks to the world-leading skills of our innovative space community that a UK-led consortium has been chosen to take forward the next ESA science mission. This demonstrates what a vital role we continue to play in European collaboration on research in space.\n\n\"The Ariel mission is a prime example of the scientific innovation underpinning the wider economy. It relies on the UK's science and engineering expertise, which are at the forefront of the government's Industrial Strategy.\"",

                "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the firm involved in a row over its use of Facebook data, has suspended its boss Alexander Nix.\n\nThe chief executive's comments, secretly recorded by Channel 4 News, \"do not represent the values or operations of the firm,\" it said.\n\nIn the footage, Mr Nix appeared to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.\n\nHowever, Cambridge Analytica said the report had \"grossly misrepresented\" the conversations caught on camera.\n\nThe London-based firm, along with the social network, is under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHe alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life.\n\nHe claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks.\n\nMr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFacebook has said the data was obtained legitimately, but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when subsequently ordered to do so.\n\nFor its part, Cambridge Analytica says it deleted the data when Facebook told it to.\n\nFacebook said on Tuesday that the entire company was \"outraged we were deceived\".\n\n\"We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,\" it added.\n\nThe firm will send representatives to Washington on Wednesday to answer questions before the US Congress.\n\nFilming by Channel 4 News, broadcast on Tuesday, showed Mr Nix claiming his firm had run Mr Trump's digital campaign.\n\nHe said that the work the company did, including research, analytics and targeted campaigning, allowed the Republican candidate to win with a narrow margin of \"40,000 votes\" in three states.\n\n\"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\" he added.\n\nA statement from Cambridge Analytica's board of directors said Mr Nix had been suspended with \"immediate effect, pending a full, independent investigation\".\n\nIt added: \"In the view of the board, Mr Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\"\n\nThe firm's chief data officer, Dr Alexander Tayler - who was also filmed discussing campaign strategy for Mr Trump - will serve as acting CEO.\n\nThe undercover report shown on Monday saw Mr Nix describing how he could target individuals.\n\nHe said one way was to \"offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that video's recorded\".\n\nHe also said he could \"send some girls around to the candidate's house...\" adding that Ukrainian girls \"are very beautiful, I find that works very well\".\n\nMr Nix continued: \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done.\"\n\nThe managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division, Mark Turnbull, was also shown saying the company could create proxy organisations to spread negative material about opposition candidates online without being traced.\n\nOn Monday, Cambridge Analytica said the executives had \"entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\" in order to \"play along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment\".\n\nAnd Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been \"deliberately entrapped\".\n\nThere have now been calls for an investigation into the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya.\n\nEarlier, a parliamentary committee called for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence about the use of personal data by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nDamian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of \"misleading\" the committee previously, and said it was \"now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process\".\n\nFacebook shares fell by a further 5% on Tuesday, following a 6.7% drop on Monday, meaning that in total, about $50bn has been wiped from its market value.\n\nThe company held an open meeting with its employees on Tuesday to discuss the matter, but the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee said neither Mr Zuckerberg nor his deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, chaired it.\n\nFacebook said: \"Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue.\"\n\nThe UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she would be applying to court for a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission - which has the power to levy large fines - has also reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook.\n\nDr Aleksandr Kogan, who created the personality app from which the data had been harvested, is a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge.\n\nA spokesman from the university said they had \"sought and received assurances\" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to \"request all relevant evidence in their possession\".",

                "body": "The company accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to influence how people vote is not shy about its international portfolio.\n\nPolitical consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is facing questions over whether it used personal data to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum.\n\nBut its reach extends well beyond the UK and US, with its website boasting of supporting more than 100 campaigns across five continents.\n\nThe company has suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, who was filmed as part of a Channel 4 investigation giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps.\n\nThe UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of work abroad. Here's what we know about it.\n\nAs part of the Channel 4 investigation, executives said Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) had worked in more than 200 elections across the world, including in the Czech Republic.\n\n\"We've just used a different organisation to run a very, very successful project in an Eastern European country where... no-one even knew they were there,\" company executive Mark Turnbull said.\n\nCambridge Analytica's website also says it was involved in political campaigning in Italy in 2012., on behalf of a \"resurgent political party last successful in the 1980s\".\n\n\"CA's suggested reforms allowed the party to perform beyond its initial expectations at a time of turbulence in Italian politics,\" it says.\n\nBut the role of SCL goes back much further. It claims to have helped the Orange Revolution in 2004 in Ukraine which helped bring the pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko to power.\n\n\"SCL succeeded in maintaining the cohesion of the coalition to ensure a hard-fought victory,\" an old post on the SCL website reads.\n\nMore recently, SCL says it was hired by the Ukrainian government to provide \"localised communications campaigns\" to help them win back control of Donetsk during the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The final project report was delivered to the President of Ukraine...this report was pivotal in later national decisions,\" the company says.\n\nCambridge Analytica was used twice to help secure victory for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta - first in 2013, then again in 2017.\n\nOfficially, the company's website boasts of doing in-depth research to uncover the issues driving voters in the country.\n\nBut Mr Turnbull told Channel 4 their input actually went much further.\n\n\"We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing - so just about every element of this candidate,\" he said.\n\nMr Kenyatta's Jubilee Party has downplayed the impact of the group, saying it employed the company's parent company, SCL, to help with branding.\n\nBut the country's main opposition coalition - the National Super Alliance (Nasa) - has called for a full investigation to be carried out.\n\n\"This was a criminal enterprise which clearly wanted to subvert the will of the people - through manipulation, through propaganda,\" official Norman Magaya told the BBC.\n\nIn July 2017, Cambridge Analytica revealed that it had teamed up with a phone app in Mexico and Colombia called Pig.gi, which gives users free service in exchange for watching adverts and taking surveys.\n\nThe firm was hoping to use data mined from Pig.gi to help a candidate in Mexico's July 2018 presidential election, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"There's a huge opportunity in this country to find the issues that are important for people and actually turn people out to vote,\" Cambridge Analytica's vice-president of business development, Brittany Kaiser, said.\n\nSeparately, it was reported in October that the head of operations for Cambridge Analytica in Mexico, Arielle Dale Karro, had posted an advertisement on a Facebook page for foreigners living in the country.\n\nThe post sought people \"with significant political experience\" who were interested in becoming a campaign manager in one of eight Mexican states, Buzzfeed reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica later denied that Ms Karro was carrying out any political work for the firm. Mr Nix also stated that \"Cambridge Analytica is not working for any political party in Mexico\".\n\nCambridge Analytica was reportedly \"prospecting for clients in Brazil's presidential race\" that is due to take place later this year.\n\nCA Ponte, a partnership between Cambridge Analytica and Brazilian consultancy firm Ponte Estrategia, \"had been in touch with representatives of three potential candidates\", according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe partnership's director Andr?Torretta told the El Pais newspaper [in Portuguese] that he had been approached by two presidential campaigns but had not reached a deal with either.\n\nCambridge Analytica is part of the India branch of the SCL group which offers \"political campaign management\" among its services.\n\nIt lists India's two main political parties - the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress - among its clients.\n\nHimanshu Sharma, the firm's vice president says on his publicly available LinkedIn profile that the company has \"successfully managed four election campaigns for the BJP\".\n\nHe names among them the 2014 general election which swept Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power.\n\nBut the Congress party has told the BBC that it has never used SCL or any of its affiliate companies as it has its own data analytical team.\n\nIn the Channel 4 investigation, Malaysia was named as one of the countries in which Cambridge Analytica had operated.\n\nA member of the country's opposition party is now calling on Prime Minister Najib Razak to reveal if he used the firm in the 2013 general election.\n\n\"Prime Minister Najib Razak must explain if he used Cambridge Analytica to manipulate voters... and whether he is using unethical manipulation techniques in the upcoming [election],\" Wan Saiful Wan Jan said in a statement.\n\nMr Razak has denied using the company, although its website says it supported his party \"with a targeted messaging campaign highlighting their school improvements since 2008\".",

                "body": "There was a beat of silence as the room's atmosphere shifted from inward reflection to jittery disbelief. \"How is that even possible?\" said one visitor, waving a pointed finger at the living-room ceiling. \"Is it still accurate?\" asked another. \"Why have I never heard of this before?\" came the outburst from her companion. Craning my neck, I too could hardly believe it.\n\nOn the timber roof above our heads was a scale model of the universe, painted in sparkling gold and shimmering royal blue. There was the Earth, a golden orb dangling by a near-invisible, hand-wound wire. Next to it, the sun, presented as a flaming star, glinting like a Christmas bauble. Then Mercury, Venus, Mars, and their moons in succession, hung from a series of elliptical curves sawn into the ceiling. All were gilded on one side to represent the sun's illumination, while beyond, on the outer rim, were the most-outlying of the planets, Jupiter and Saturn. Lunar dials, used to derive the position of the zodiac, completed the equation.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n* The cliff that revealed Earth's history\n\n* The clock that changed the meaning of time\n\n* The island that forever changed science\n\nThe medieval science behind the Royal Eise Eisinga Planetarium is staggering, no matter how one views it. Tucked away in a gabled canal-side house in the tiny town of Franeker, in the Netherlands' north-west Friesland province, it is the world's oldest working planetarium, or orrery. The origins of Western astronomy date back to ancient Mesopotamia along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. But it took a Frisian amateur - Eise Eisinga - to trap the universe in his living room. And the science behind it is still precise today.\n\nHow accurate? Look up, and every planet, star, sun and moon moves exactly as they do in reality, albeit reduced in scale by a factor of one trillion, meaning 1mm on the ceiling represents one million km. Jupiter takes 12 years to orbit the sun. Saturn, 29 years. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are missing, of course, because they hadn't been discovered when Eisinga hammered in the final nail in 1781. Even so, it is astonishing: a Baroque theatre for stargazers, crowning the living room of a modest wool comber who lived shortly after the Dutch Golden Age. All told, an unfathomable undertaking considering Eisinga quit school aged 12.\n\nEvery planet, star, sun and moon moves exactly as they do in reality\n\nThe Royal Eise Eisinga Planetarium, today an astronomy museum and centre for space exploration, has been drawing people from around the world ever since it opened in 1781. It's listed as a Rijksmonument, a national heritage site in the Netherlands, and stargazers, layman astronomers and mission astronauts have visited, hoping they, like Eisinga, can be inspired.\n\nOne such individual is Adrie Warmenhoven, the museum's director, who never fails to be astonished by its accuracy. At certain times of year, Warmenhoven explained, he can see the sunrise above IJsselmeer bay when he crosses the Afsluitdijk causeway on his way to work. \"When I step into the planetarium later, I can see the same time of the morning on the dial,\" he said excitedly when I visited on a clear February afternoon. \"A few years ago, Venus transited the sun, a rare astronomical phenomenon, yet even it was visible inside the planetarium. Incredible, right?\"\n\nWhile Eisinga's story is well known within his home province of Friesland, it's a tale that would be lost to the rest of us without the planetarium - and the well-thumbed handbook he left behind. Filled with sketches and drawings, it explains in minute detail how to maintain the orrery, long after its inventor was gone.\n\n\"The planetarium is very exact, but not perfect,\" Warmenhoven said, explaining the clockwork-like mechanism. \"The pendulum, for instance, is made of a single type of metal so it's influenced by temperature fluctuations. Then there are the planet wheels themselves, which create problems because of their size. So according to Eisinga's manual, we have to adjust them every 10 to 12 years.\"\n\nIt was on 8 May 1774 that Eisinga first put his self-taught knowledge to good use. Panic had erupted among the villagers of Franeker when a doomsday scenario was presented to them by Eelco Alta, a Frisian clergyman and theologian. An upcoming planetary alignment, they were told, meant the Earth would burn to ashes in the sun.\n\nIt must have felt - if only just for a moment - that time had stopped\n\nEisinga, little more than a hobbyist, wanted to show them the truth. His aim was not to make a mockery of the church, but to predict future planetary movements and show the townsfolk how wrong they were.\n\n\"Eisinga knew every planet had its own orbit around the sun,\" tour guide Mascha Noordermeer told me as she traced complex circles across the ceiling as Eisinga once did. \"That [the project] would take seven years to complete, and nearly bankrupt him, was just an afterthought.\"\n\nFor nearly a decade, Eisinga worked on the project in his spare time, the planetarium slowly evolving above the box-sized kitchen and cupboard bed where he slept with his wife and son. Then, as dawn broke one morning in 1781, everything looked just right. He had entered that liminal space, where he could touch the stars from his living room. It must have felt - if only just for a moment - that time had stopped.\n\nHere's a tip should you decide to visit: don't rush. As well as displays of Georgian telescopes, 18th-Century octants and a tellurium (an educational model of the Earth, moon and sun, the latter represented by a flickering candle), the mathematical ingenuity required for the planetarium's design takes time to process.\n\nAnother discovery comes in the attic. Hard-wired by a complex system of clockwork wooden hoops and disks, tightly bound by cables bathed in dusty gloom, Eisinga's model of the solar system is held together by more than 10,000 homemade nails, which serve as gear teeth. So impressed was William I, Prince of Orange and the first King of the Netherlands, when he climbed into this same pitched loft 200 years ago, he decided to buy it outright. For the vast sum of 10,000 guilders - a fortune in the early 19th Century - Eisinga's house became a royal planetarium for the State, the only stipulation being that its inventor should live in it for free to provide explanation.\n\nI emerged blinking back onto Franeker's streets. As ivy-draped houses caught the last of the day's light, a slew of stars began to appear. Cyclists pedalled along cobbled canal ways and in front of the medieval Martinus Church a newly installed basin fountain sat in darkness. Built in honour of another great Dutch astronomer, it is dedicated to Jan Hendrik Oort, born in Franeker in 1900, whose assumption that the Milky Way moves around our solar system - and not the sun - was proved correct. Only then did I realise that for such a small town, Franeker has made the universe so much larger, so much brighter, for everyone.\n\nEisinga died aged 84, buried in nearby Dronrijp, 7km away, where he first grew up. Today a bronze statue, dedicated to this extraordinary wool comber, looks enduringly to the skies in the shadow of the house in which he was born. As tributes go, it's one he'd surely be proud of.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

Remarkably, a showdown between Jenkins and La La Land's Damien Chazelle is possible once again next year.\n\nWe just finished this year's Academy Awards, but it's never too early to start prognosticating about the next awards season. And indeed, two top contenders will be Jenkins' If Beale Street Could Talk, an adaptation of James Baldwin's novel, and First Man, Chazelle's biopic about Neil Armstrong, with Ryan Gosling taking a giant leap as the first astronaut to walk on the moon.\n\nIn the Talking Movies video above, BBC Culture's Christian Blauvelt talks to Mike Hogan, digital director at Vanity Fair and co-host of the Little Gold Men awards podcast, who points out that 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen's heist thriller Widows could be a best picture favourite. And Eric Kohn, deputy editor and chief critic at Indiewire, says that Martin Scorsese's The Irishman, about a mob-connected union official (Robert De Niro) and his ties to the murder of Jimmy Hoffa, could also be in the running.",

                "title": "Google to News: can we be friends?",
                "body": "One of the deepest frustrations at the top of Google is the regularity with which it is coupled with Facebook. I plead guilty. Talk of \"the digital duopoly\" pervades the news industry, which rightly argues that these two superstar firms are gobbling up a growing proportion of advertising revenue. But it masks huge differences between the companies.\n\nJust as Facebook is principally a proprietary news feed, so Google is principally a tool for Search. But Google has a big and growing range of products. Central to the company's PR strategy is a desire to shift the focus back to those products. According to this line of thought, the more people think of Google as the way they send emails, navigate while driving, or share documents, the less they'll think about issues like tax, privacy, and extremist content on (Google-owned) YouTube.\n\nAnother key difference is the relationship with the news industry. Some executives at Google were taken aback when, earlier this year, Facebook announced changes to its news feed that would prioritise \"meaningful interactions\" from family and friends over content from publishers.\n\nFacebook would argue this is a return to their routes, and a pro-social move. Publishers, many of whom built business models dependent on viral traffic, certainly felt the pinch quickly. One website, Little Things, went out of business, citing the changes to News Feed.\n\nFor Google, this looked like an opportunity. Their launch in New York today was in the works before Facebook announced its changes. But its timing is cute. The message is, as Facebook seems to lean back from news, Google is leaning in. Long seen by many media as the enemy, Google is now saying, let's be friends.\n\nI spoke at length last week to Richard Gingras, who runs Google News, and Ben Gomes, who runs Google Search. They are two of the most powerful men in media. It is clear that, in that phrase beloved of American journalists, they want to \"reach out\" to the news industry.\n\nTheir main vehicle is the Google News Initiative. It mainly consolidates existing efforts, and has three fronts, chosen partly for their alliterative effect. Google say they want to\n\nMore important than any of that is the launch of Subscribe with Google. The company already supports subscriptions in a few ways, but this new tool to encourage frictionless payments could be significant for many publishers.\n\nI met up with Mark Thompson, the former BBC Director-General who now runs the New York Times, a few hours after he'd signed his company up for the service, and there's no doubt he sees it as a welcome first step. But the next thing he wants to talk to Google about is clawing back some of the advertising revenue that they, together with Facebook, are gobbling up.\n\nThat dominance in advertising means that, despite this glitzy launch in New York, Google is likely to be seen as the enemy in many parts of the media for some time yet. The tech giant protests that it sent $12.6bn to partners in the news industry, and generates 10bn clicks for publishers each month. It has no legal obligation to do this of course, though some would argue that it does have a moral obligation.\n\nThe way the company sees it, it provides (principally through Search) an extraordinary tool for accessing the world's information - and does so for free. This won't necessarily last: someone else could come along and do it better. Perhaps a Chinese firm, for instance.\n\nBut the news industry feels differently. While Google has no newsroom, the advertising they used to rely on to fund journalism now seems locked up in a few tech companies far away. That's the cause of antagonism. Still, the moves Google has made today are based on a couple of important principles that much of the news industry can get on board with.\n\nFirst, there is such a thing as high-quality journalism. This is obviously a composite idea: you can be a high-quality tabloid or a high-quality broadsheet, for instance. But in accepting that some journalism is more socially valuable than others, Google is moving into the terrain of editorial judgements. That's somewhere technology companies have traditionally considered hostile terrain.\n\nSecond, quality costs. I asked Gingras specifically if Google believes that information should be free. His instinctive answer was no. He said Google believes it should be accessible, but they accepted that investigative reporting, for instance, needed to be well funded.\n\nA new deal is emerging within the news industry, in which growing evidence that audiences will pay for content - if it's unique, personalised, and good enough - mixes with the realisation that advertising revenue is disappearing.\n\nMany publishers will remain openly hostile to Google. But Google has moved toward their position, not only in relation to the above two principles, but also in committing this $300m as part of the GNI.\n\nThe news industry will now either accept this offer of collaboration, or bite the hand that feeds them and say 'we don't want your morsels, after you've stolen our lunch'. Different institutions will adopt radically different approaches. Some may now change their mind. None can avoid making a choice, because while the other half of the digital duopoly goes into crisis mode, Google is making, and remaking, the news.",
