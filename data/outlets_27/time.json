                "body": "When the week began, Kayla Wells, a senior at Great Mills High School in Maryland, had no plans to participate in the March for Our Lives on Saturday.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, her classmate, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey, was shot in the head in the hallway of their high school just before class began. Wells went home restless, unable to sleep or make sense of what had happened, and she changed her weekend plans.\n\n\"That night, I went out and got posters because I knew that I had to be there,\" Wells, 17, told TIME.\n\nWilley -- a swimmer and a sister to eight siblings -- was critically wounded in the shooting by 17-year-old Austin Wyatt Rollins, with whom she had a \"prior relationship\" that recently ended, authorities said. She died Thursday night after being taken off life support.\n\nWells did not know Jaelynn personally, but she said she broke down when she heard the news. \"It shouldn't happen again. It shouldn't happen to anyone,\" Wells said. \"How did we become so desensitized to shootings happening?\"\n\nShe organized a poster-making session on Friday night. And on Saturday morning, she was among dozens of Great Mills students and alumni who drove to Washington, D.C. to march for Willey, carrying posters that said, \"It happened at my school\" and \"Justice for Jaelynn.\"\n\nJillian Carty, 18, graduated from Great Mills High School last year and is now a student at Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire. But when the shooting happened on Tuesday, she thought immediately of her younger sister at the school, and she decided to drive back home and march, calling for a comprehensive solution to stop gun violence.\n\n\"I see a lot of good points that are made with people who are pushing for gun reform, I see good points that are made by people who are pushing for mental health reform,\" Carty told TIME. \"I don't see why there is any reason why they can't combine.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of students are expected to participate in the march in Washington, D.C. and in sibling rallies around the country on Saturday. The movement was organized by student survivors of last month's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, many of whom spoke out for Willey this week.\n\n\"We will march for you, Jaelynn Willey,\" Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior Jaclyn Corin said in a tweet on Thursday. \"We will march for all the students of Great Mills who will forever be traumatized because of what happened on Tuesday.\"",

                "body": "Nine-year-old Yolanda Renee King invoked the famous words of her grandfather Martin Luther King, Jr. - and gave them a 2018 twist - as she spoke to the tens of thousands of protesters demanding gun control at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., Saturday.\n\nIn a surprise appearance amid a series of speeches from students impacted from gun violence in Parkland, Chicago, southern California and elsewhere, Yolanda spoke on a similar platform as her grandfather did 55 years early when he inspired generations with his historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the March on Washington in 1963.\n\n\"My grandfather had a dream that his four little children will not be judged by the color of the skin, but the content of their character,\" said Yolanda, standing alongside Parkland shooting survivor Jaclyn Corin. \"I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun-free world, period.\"\n\n\"Will you please repeat these words after me?\" Yolanda asked the crowd. \"Spread the word, have you heard? All across the nation we are going to be a great generation.\"\n\nBut one repetition of her rallying cry wasn't enough. \"Now, I'd like you to say it like you really, really mean it,\" Yolanda said before launching into the affirmation once again.\n\nYolanda was one of many young speakers at the rally in Washington, D.C. -- and at 800 other protests around the world Saturday -- to advocate for stricter gun control amid a growing number of mass shootings at schools, churches and other venues around the country.\n\nYolanda's aunt Bernice King attended the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., as well, and posted tweets that quoted student speakers whose messages echoed those of her late father's.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Bernice King wrote that she was a \"very proud Aunt\" after Yolanda's speech. \"My niece, Yolanda Renee King, truly represented the King family.\"\n\nAfterward on CNN, alongside her father Martin Luther King III, Yolanda said her school had a lockdown drill on Friday.\n\n\"We do all these lockdown drills because it's unfortunate that people have guns and they use them to hurt people,\" she said.",

                "title": "Here's What a Trade War Would Look Like",
                "body": "In a two-week span, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered up an array of tariffs against numerous countries, blocked Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies and sought new restrictions on future Chinese investment. Economists are warning that the world is on the verge of an all-out trade war, featuring tit-for-tat reprisals, heated rhetoric and appeals to the World Trade Organization, which may be ill-equipped to respond. If Trump's trade provocations mushroom out of control, dozens of border-opening trade deals negotiated over several decades could be shoved aside. The prospect of slower economic growth has stock markets worldwide reeling.\n\nThe dictionary says it's \"an economic conflict in which countries impose import restrictions on each other in order to harm each other's trade.\" Trump's tariffs and the threatened retaliation from other countries meet this definition, but so do centuries of protectionist skirmishes by numerous countries in countless sectors. The recent escalation is stoking fears that Trump has touched off a full-blown trade war by singling out of China for retaliation for intellectual property theft. The quid-pro-quo actions by the U.S. and China over steel tariffs, Trump's invocation of national security to justify some of his moves -- which could open a Pandora's Box of similar claims by other nations -- and Trump's threat to further punish the EU if it imposes counter-duties also add to the trade-war atmospherics.\n\nOne of the most notorious examples is the Smoot-Hawley Act passed by Congress in 1930 and often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. The law hiked U.S. tariffs by an average of 20 percent, initially to protect American farmers but then broadened as other industries lobbied for protections. As demand collapsed, countries scrambled to maintain their gold reserves by devaluing their currencies or imposing even more trade barriers. Global trade fell off a cliff.\n\nNo one, if history is any guide. When President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about 200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate. A report by the pro-free trade Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that Bush's tariffs cost about $400,000 for every steel-industry job saved. The World Trade Organization also ruled that the Bush tariffs were illegal.\n\nHe's imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion of as-yet unspecified products imported from China in retaliation for what he calls decades of intellectual property theft. He imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on steel and aluminum imports, which prompted China to say it could hit back with tariffs of its own. While he temporarily exempted allies, including the European Union, from the metals tariffs, he expects them to grant concessions to the U.S. to maintain the exemption.\n\nIn a March 2 Twitter post, he declared trade wars \"good, and easy to win.\" His focus remains reducing the U.S. trade deficit, which shows the country imports hundreds of billions of dollars more than it exports. Stepping back from trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership also appeals to Trump's base of voters in America's Rust Belt. But talk of a trade war is alarming to many U.S. business leaders, who largely support existing trade deals, and the securities markets, which fear lower profits and slower economic growth if the U.S. turns protectionist and other countries retaliate.\n\nSo far, China said it would hit $3 billion of U.S. wine, fruit, steel pipe and other exports with tariffs. The bigger worry for the U.S. is that China, the U.S.'s biggest creditor, will scale back purchases of Treasuries in retaliation. China's ambassador to the U.S. doesn't rule out the option. Other countries haven't retaliated for the steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect March 23, largely because Trump temporarily exempted many of them. Still, the EU is unhappy and warned it will respond with its own 25 percent tariffs on $3.5 billion of American goods, particularly iconic U.S. brands produced in states that are part of Trump's political base. The list includes motorcycles, blue jeans and bourbon whiskey. In turn, Trump warned that he would impose a 25 percent penalty on European car imports if the EU carried out its threat.\n\nThe U.S. took the first step on March 23, filing a \"request for consultations\" with China at the WTO on technology licensing. China also notified the WTO how it could respond to the steel tariffs with levies of its own. But retaliatory actions that unfold quickly can test the WTO's somewhat ponderous deliberative process. The arbiter of international trade disputes was born in 1995 out of a set of agreements struck by countries trying to reduce trade barriers. If a government's complaint about another nation's trade barriers is seen as grounded, the WTO recommends acceptable retaliation. In the case of steel, Trump is invoking a seldom-used clause of a 1962 U.S. law that gives him the authority to curb imports if they undermine national security. Under WTO rules, countries can take trade actions to protect \"essential security interests.\" Other nations could challenge the validity of the U.S. use of that clause. They also could copy the U.S. move by citing national security to block imports themselves.\n\nYes. Take steel tariffs. Many more people are employed in industries, such as auto manufacturing, that buy steel to make products, than in steel-making itself. Some consumers may also have to pay higher prices. Trade tensions could boost inflation more than desired by Federal Reserve policy makers, who might feel the need to raise rates more aggressively than planned. On the other hand, if the tariffs result in job losses and the economy slows, the Fed might want to ease the pace of rate hikes.\n\nNo, there are many others. Clamping down on Chinese investments in the U.S., which Trump is already doing, is one example. Talking down, or manipulating lower, one's currency is another. Countries through the years have used other means to keep foreign goods out and protect homegrown companies, a practice known as mercantilism. Trump accuses China of using government subsidies to prop up its domestic industries. Some practices are overt, such as quotas, and others covert, such as unusual product specifications, lengthy inspections of goods at entry ports and intricate licensing requirements.",

                "body": "Wielding handmade posters and their anger after the deadly Florida school shooting, hundreds of thousands of protesters piled into the nation's capital and other major American cities Saturday to demand an end to gun violence during the highly anticipated March For Our Lives rally.\n\nCrowds of students from across the country converged in cities like Washington, D.C., New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland to take a stand against what they believe are lax gun control laws after 17 students and faculty members were killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland last month.\n\nAt least 150 student survivors from Stoneman Douglas were among the demonstrators in Washington, D.C., where the crowds stretched from the foot of the U.S. Capitol to the White House, according to Jose Iglesias, a peer counselor at Stoneman Douglas. Dozens of Parkland students flew to Washington, D.C. on at least four different planes Friday. Many awoke Saturday morning from their hotel rooms bubbling with energy and optimism.\n\n\"I'm feeling excited for this,\" said Iglesias, 17. \"We're actually making changes. No one thought we could do this because we're students. We're students, but we know what we're doing. We're the generation that's going to make change.\"\n\nAt the foot of the stage, where superstars like Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato were set to perform, 16-year-old Jack Macleod stood in anticipation with seven other Parkland students and his 20-year-old sister, who had graduated from Stoneman Douglas.\n\n\"We're getting people rallied up,\" he said. \"We're all ready.\"\n\nSeveral Parkland students at the march wore bright orange tags on their clothes that said $1.05 -- the cost they say they're each worth to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, after dividing the amount of money Rubio apparently received from the National Rifle Association by the number of total students in Florida. The NRA was portrayed as a common villain by many marchers at rallies across the country.\n\n\"In the past, if the NRA didn't own the politicians, we would have seen gun reform years ago,\" said Janice Williams, 57, who traveled to the nation's capital from Boston. \"My youngest has been out of college for two years and she's spent her entire life learning how to do lockdowns. It shouldn't be this way.\"\n\nParkland student Aaliyah Eastmon, 17, said she was inspired to march in D.C. after feeling outraged and frightened about school safety. \"Me, personally, I'm petrified,\" she said. \"Nothing has changed security-wise. The fact that students can still come on campus with a knife -- that's petrifying.\"\n\n\"I'm upset that this was the turning point,\" she added. \"The turning point should have been years ago.\"\n\nCries for change were also heard in New York City, where demonstrators chanted, \"Hey ho ho! The NRA has got to go!\"\n\n\"Every time someone goes on the announcements, I think it's going to be a lockdown, and it's just really scary being at school,\" said Julie Korgen, an 18-year-old high school senior from Montclair, N.J. \"I don't want to die at school.\"",

Indeed, that rally was just one of 800 to take place around the world Saturday, with hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding stricter gun control legislation and holding signs reading \"Never Again\" and \"Not One More.\"\n\nMarch For Our Lives was organized by the students who survived the February mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., where a former classmate opened fire with an AR-15 and killed 17 students and faculty. Still mourning the loss of their friends and grappling with their own survival, students quickly mobilized and created the #NeverAgain movement, demanding gun control from politicians in the days following the shooting and organizing the March for Our Lives protest and school walk-outs earlier this month.",

Kazi had no known links to terrorism, did not leave behind a manifesto or any threats or explanation, and a video found on a cellphone provided no clue.\n\n\"Why did this individual end up at the front gate of Travis Air Base on fire and now deceased? We don't have the answers to that,\" Ragan said. \"We've got a significant amount of investigators assigned to it night and day since this occurred.... They will continue at it until we get those answers.\"\n\nInvestigators know of no one else associated with the incident nor any threats to air base or the community.\n\nAir Force gate personnel initially thought they were dealing with a vehicle accident when Kazi crashed and they realized he was on fire. No shots were fired as he entered the base, and it was only after the fire was out and they broke through the locked minivan doors to aid Kazi that they realized it was loaded with five propane tanks, three gallon-size gasoline cans and several cigarette lighters, Ragan said. Also found was a gym bag with personal effects and three cellphones.\n\nKazi's body was so badly burned that he had to be identified by fingerprints. Ragan said he is a native of India who has lived in the United States since 1993 and was a permanent legal resident. He never served in the military and has no known ties to the air base, he said.\n\n\"We know what happened,\" Ragan said. \"Now the question is why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don't know the answers to that, quite frankly. So the investigation that we're doing right now is trying to piece together his life, trying to piece together what led up to this event, and attempt to determine why he was there and why he had those items in his vehicle ... They will continue at it until we get the answers.\"\n\nRagan said they have been unable to find any of Kazi's family living in the United States. A family member in India has been notified of Kazi's death, Ragan said. He said Kazi appeared to work as a cab driver in the past, but that investigators haven't determined if he was currently employed. It's not clear if he owned the minivan.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence of any religious affiliation or anything at this point,\" Ragan said. \"As of right now, we know of no other associates.\"\n\nInvestigators have interviewed some of Kazi's acquaintances and are working on some search warrants, he said. They also are scouring social media, so far without result.\n\nCalls to several numbers associated with Kazi were not returned Friday.\n\nAbout 10,000 people live and work on the base 55 miles (88 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.",

If an armed intruder attempts to gain entrance into any of our classrooms, they will face a classroom full students armed with rocks and they will be stoned,\" Helsel said.\n\nHelsel noted that schools also conduct active shooter and evacuation drills, but the stones are available if a teacher puts a classroom on lockdown, according to the affiliate station.\n\nWhile debates have emerged on whether or not to arm teachers as a line of defense, Helsel said that's being considered, though Blue Mountain High School does have an armed security guard. The school also has devices in its doors to help keep them secure, and trains its students on how to barricade doors to help prevent the need for the stones, Helsel said, according to the network.\n\n\"At one time I just had the idea of river stone, they're the right size for hands, you can throw them very hard and they will create or cause pain, which can distract,\" Helsel said.",

                "body": "DuShon Monique Brown, an actress best known for her role on NBC's Chicago Fire, died Friday. She was 49.\n\nThe actress died after 12 p.m. on Friday at the Franciscan St. James Health Olympia Fields hospital just outside of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reported. Brown's cause of death was not immediately disclosed.\n\nOn Chicago Fire, Brown played the witty and pragmatic Connie, the assistant to Chief Boden, and appeared on the show since it began in 2012.\n\n\"The 'Chicago Fire' family is devastated to lose one of its own,\" Dick Wolf, the show's executive producer, said in a statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with DuShon's family and we will all miss her.\"\n\nIn a 2016 interview with the Huffington Post, Brown described the cast and crew of Chicago Fire as a family. \"I'm not on set every day, but people are always asking me about my kid and how my day is going and they are all so very sweet and kind,\" she said.\n\nRecently, the actress told Hidden Remote that Connie, her character on the show, wasn't supposed to be a series regular initially. When auditioning for the role, she said, she realized the \"one-liner\" role could develop into something more. The character then became more complex and served as sort of a mother figure, Brown said.\n\n\"They've done this beautiful dance with Connie where you see her soft moments, you see how she cares about the kids in the firehouse,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown had a similar experience during her 13-episode stint on AMC's Prison Break, where her character, initially just called \"Nurse,\" developed into a larger role, later named Katie Welch. She appeared on that show from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThroughout her career, Brown also appeared in a number of other TV shows and films, including Shameless and Empire. When not in front of the camera, Brown worked as a crisis counselor at Kenwood Academy High School in Chicago and led its drama program, according to the Tribune.\n\nGrowing up, Brown attended Whitney Young Magnet High School in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in psychology. She is survived by her daughter, Zoe.\n\n\"We are devastated by the loss of a very talented and kindhearted soul,\" Robert Shroeder, Brown's manager at Grossman & Jack Talent in Chicago told the Tribune. \"She brought laughter and joy to many, and she will be greatly missed.\"",

                "body": "(TREBES, France) -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage has died, raising the death toll in the attack in southern France to four. He was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was among the first officers to respond to the attack Friday on the supermarket in the southern French town of Trebes.\n\nBeltrame, who joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to the Depeche du Midi newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket, he gave up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born hostage-taker, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nIn addition to the four people killed by the gunman in his rampage Friday, the attacker was killed by police. Fifteen others were injured.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nFrench police and soldiers have been a prime target of attacks by extremists, with 10 killed in recent years, including Beltrame. Other victims include three soldiers killed near Toulouse in 2012, three police officers shot to death in 2015, a police couple killed in their home in 2016 and a police officer killed on Paris' Champs-Elysees in 2017. Dozens of others have been wounded.\n\nAccording to Macron's statement, Beltrame also served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday that his brother died \"a hero.\"\n\n\"He was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing,\" Cedric Beltrame said.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio that, for her son, \"to defend the homeland\" was \"his reason to live.\"\n\n\"He would have said to me, 'I'm doing my job, Mom, nothing more,'\" she said.\n\nPeople were placing flowers in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in the French medieval city of Carcassone to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Beltrame. Flags at all gendarmeries were ordered to fly at half-staff.\n\nMacron says investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, 25, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live. Two people were detained over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and a friend of his, a 17-year-old male, Paris prosecutor's office said.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, hitting one in the shoulder, said Yves Lefebvre of the SGP Police-FO police union.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking hostages. He shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for God is great -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\nSpecial police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nGuibbert said he put his wife, sister-in-law and other shoppers in the meat locker for safety.\n\nThe manager of the supermarket, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"Call the gendarmes,\" she told her employees. \"There's a terrorist in the store.\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" Samia said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.",

The move would lengthen the amount of sunny hours in the winter and no longer require Floridans to set their clocks back an hour in the fall -- and, as a result, move them forward in the spring.\n\nScott said observing daylight saving time year round would mean people in Florida could \"enjoy everything our beautiful state has to offer later in the day,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe implementation of the legislation, however, would only happen if approved by Congress on the federal level, the bill says. Since the federal government determines the nation's time zones, it also controls the start of daylight saving time and the return to standard time, Florida included.\n\nNo states have independently been able to observe daylight saving time year round. But states like Hawaii and parts of Arizona, as well as U.S. territories like Puerto Rico and Guam, have opted not to observe daylight saving time since those areas get sunshine year-round. In Arizona, for example, not engaging in daylight saving time means that waking hours can be less hot for residents.\n\nOther states like Maine and Massachusetts have explored trying to permanently move their clocks forward year-round. With the dark evening hours of the winter, residents in those states have said they use more electricity. The darker hours also can impact those with depression and seasonal affective disorder.",

                "body": "The Peace Warriors, a group of predominantly black high school students from Chicago, have been fighting gun violence for 10 years without garnering much attention from the outside world. The students from Parkland, Fla. brought the issue to national prominence in a matter of days.\n\nSo when the Chicago youth group from North Lawndale College Prep High School met the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teens in Florida last month to discuss their common cause, many in the room had the same unspoken thought. Parkland, a wealthy suburb of Broward County, had been named one of the safest communities in Florida before a gunman killed 17 students and faculty in a mass shooting last month -- while more than 3,400 people were shot in Chicago in 2017 alone, according to police.\n\n\"It was like one of those elephants in the room that no one wanted to talk about,\" said Gerald Smith, 47, who advises the Peace Warriors, a group that teaches students how to resolve conflicts peacefully through Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s teachings of nonviolence.\n\nTwo hours into the meeting, Parkland student Sarah Chadwick stopped ignoring what they all felt was obvious. \"I acknowledge my white privilege,\" she said. It was a breakthrough for both groups of teens, and the admission rendered most of the Chicago visitors emotional and speechless.\n\n\"It was like the room just went silent,\" Smith said. \"I got choked up. When that came to light, there were tears. That was kind of an olive branch moment. That was just profound.\"\n\nThe meeting with the Peace Warriors is one of the ways that Parkland's student activists say they are are working to use their influence to advance minority groups that have been working for years without national attention. \"I said it because it's true. White privilege does exist and a lot of us have it,\" Chadwick told TIME in a recent interview. \"If we could use our white privilege to amplify the voices of minorities, then we're going to use it. The more we ignore it, the worse it gets.\"\n\nThe Peace Warriors had reached out to the Parkland students, after receiving a nudge and sponsorship from Barack Obama's former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who works with the Chicago students. \"We were wondering how could we sort of feed off of their energy,\" said Arieyanna Williams, a 17-year-old Peace Warriors member. The Parkland students immediately accepted the request and invited them to Florida to discuss coordinating their efforts.\n\n\"We found our voice in Parkland,\" Arieyanna added. \"We felt like we weren't alone in this situation and we finally can use our voices on a bigger scale.\"\n\nIn the two years Arieyanna has been a Peace Warrior, she said she struggled to find ways to stop gun violence in her hometown, which this year alone has so far seen more than 300 shootings and at least 90 murders, according to the Chicago Police Department. Arieyanna said the Parkland students taught her to erase her self-doubt and stop accepting that gun violence is normal.\n\n\"We just felt there wouldn't be a way to stop it. We grew up into that and we evolved around that,\" the Chicago teen said. \"Now, I see the world through a different way.\"\n\nIn return, the Chicago students taught their Parkland counterparts how to believe in achieving peace through nonviolence, as King had preached. \"I feel like what we're trying to do is take Martin Luther King Jr. as an example,\" Jaclyn Corin said during an interview for TIME's latest cover story. \"We are seeking peace through a nonviolent manner, just as he was. We learned his peace principles. We know exactly how he was successful and we're trying to do exactly what he did so we can be successful also.\"\n\nSenior Emma González added: \"We learned them from the kids from Chicago when they came to visit.\"\n\nThe Parkland and Chicago teens needed to first discuss their differences before they were able to move forward and build a strong friendship, said D'Angelo McDade, a senior Peace Warrior. The students soon realized they had a lot more in common.\n\n\"Parkland is one of the safest cities in Florida,\" Arieyanna, one of the Peace Warriors, said. \"It's a different moment for them to realize that just because they had that title that it wouldn't happen to them. The students in Chicago see it every day. The difference is the amount of violence going on, the similarity is the hurt. They thought for so long they'd never see the violence and we thought for so long that we couldn't see it stopped.\"\n\n\"We're fighting for the same thing,\" she added. \"They are lifting us up.\"\n\nThe Parkland students have also been working with the Dream Defenders, a Florida-based civil rights group founded in 2012 after Trayvon Martin's shooting death, to ensure their movement is inclusive of the black and Hispanic advocates in under-resourced communities whose longtime campaigns against gun violence have received less recognition.\n\n\"They've grown up watching Black Lives Matter and the national tension surrounding Black Lives Matter and other activist groups during their formative years. The students from Parkland are a culmination of all these movements right now,\" said Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers, 30. \"They're trying to make sure everybody's issues are talked about.\"\n\n\"They know that they're from Parkland. They are aware of privilege. They know that they're white. They know they come from a safe place,\" Summers added. \"But they get it.\"",

Facebook unveiled a cheaper virtual-reality headset that works without being tethered to a computer, rounding out its plan for pushing the emerging technology to the masses.\n\nFacebook's stock plummeted this week following news that Cambridge Analytica misused 50 million Facebook users' data. And the controversy also hit Mark Zuckerberg's wallet.\n\nThe CEO, whose wealth largely comes from his roughly 403 million shares of Facebook stock (he only takes a $1 salary), lost $10 billion over the past week as the Cambridge Analytica crisis played out.\n\nFacebook's stock closed on Friday at 159.39, down 5.50 from its open on Friday and down 17.44 points from the week. As such, Zuckerberg lost more than $2 billion on Friday alone.\n\nThe decline in Facebook stock and Zuckerberg's wealth started earlier in the week. By Monday afternoon, Zuckerberg already lost $6.06 billion after the Cambridge Analytica news sparked controversy over the handling of personal data.\n\nIt's been a rough week for the Facebook CEO. By Monday, Zuckerberg had already lost $6.06 billion after the Cambridge Analytica news sparked controversy over the handling of personal data. Zuckerberg's total net worth, estimated by Bloomberg, went from $74.8 billion on Thursday, March 8, to $67.3 Thursday, March 15. Zuckerberg still ranks as one of the richest people in the world, though, currently sitting in the number seven spot, even with the recent dip.\n\nFacebook announced last Friday it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, a group that has claimed to have helped get President Donald Trump elected, after learning that the group misused the data of up to 50 million users. Cambridge Analytica said it deleted the data and none of it was used for its services with Trump. However, the company also suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending an investigation.\n\nZuckerberg waited until Wednesday to respond to the controversy, at which point he issued a statement on Facebook and gave interviews outlining how the incident happened and a three-step plan to prevent a similar situation.\n\nZuckerberg said the app \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" originally created by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan, was released in 2013, before Facebook rolled back access that apps had to users and their friends lists, which is why 50 million users were affected when only about 300,000 people downloaded the app. The data was then passed on to Cambridge Analytica, which was instructed to delete the information years prior.",

                "title": "Trump Order Would Ban Most Transgender Troops From Serving",
                "body": "(PALM BEACH, Fla.) -- President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.\n\nThe White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" -- those who may require substantial medical treatment -- \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nTrump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards -- including those regarding the use of medical drugs -- equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nThe new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nJoshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\nUnder guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.",

                "title": "A Republican Donor Launched a Gun Control Advocacy Group",
                "body": "A major Republican donor fed up with congressional inaction has launched a gun control advocacy group with support from both Republican congressmen and other donors and fundraisers to persuade Congress to pass comprehensive gun control reform.\n\nCalled Americans for Gun Safety Now, the group is spearheaded by Ambassador Al Hoffman Jr., a Florida estate real developer and GOP donor who served as Ambassador to Portugal under George W. Bush.\n\nHoffman made headlines in the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida - an area where he has personal and professional ties - when he said he would refrain from donating to politicians who do not back a ban on assault weapons.\n\nThe group has devised a six-point plan for comprehensive gun legislation, which is outlined in an ad it ran in the Wall Street Journal Saturday, urging Congress to pass it as soon as possible. The plan includes expanding background checks, raising the age limit for all gun purchases to 21, eliminating bump stocks, and limiting high capacity magazines, while explicitly retaining support for Second Amendment rights.\n\n\"The federal government better pass legislation that is readily available right now .... and get it done now, before November,\" Hoffman told TIME in his first interview since launching the group. \"If they don't do this, my guess is that they will lose big in November.\"\n\nThe details of the group were first reported by TIME earlier this month, but Hoffman officially launched the group Saturday, to coincide with the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington D.C., which he is attending.\n\nThe group has 21 supporters, according to the advertisement that ran in the Journal Saturday, which describes them as \"a committed group of people representing a wide variety of stakeholders. They include Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was killed in the shooting; Republican Congressmen Carlos Curbelo and Brian Mast, who authored a New York Times op-ed last month supporting a ban on assault weapons; and Dennis Blair, who served as Director of National Intelligence from 2009 to 2010. In addition to Hoffman, Other prominent Republican donors who are supporting the initiative include Cathy Bailey, Mel Sembler, and Howard Leach, all of whom, like Hoffman, served as Ambassadors under George W. Bush, as well as billionaire Norman Braman and retired professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Hoffman said the group has been established as a 501c4 organization, a non-profit group that does not have to disclose its donors. Presumably, this could provide cover for other Republicans who want to contribute to the group but don't want to disclose that they have done so.\n\nIn total, those supporting the initiative have donated at least $600,000 alone to Republican candidates and committees in the 2017-2018 election cycle. Hoffman said the next step is using this influence to personally lobby the leaders of Congress, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, along with Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\n\"What [this group] intends to do is show those who are not on the right side of the movement, that maybe you're fearful of the money from the NRA, then get on the right side of this movement. But there's a movement elsewhere that can help. That those who stay on the wrong side of this movement they're [going to] lose their traditional donor money,\" Guttenberg said in an interview with TIME. He was introduced to Hoffman through a mutual friend a week after his daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting, and the two are attending the March For Our Lives demonstration together in Washington D.C. \"He is a man who no one ever would have expected this from which is what I think makes it so powerful,\" said Guttenberg.\n\nBut Hoffman has already said his efforts to get more lawmakers to sign on as supporters of this group were fruitless, a hint at the difficulties he will nearly inevitably encounter in getting Congress to act. \"We're in deep limbo with a number of congressmen and Senators right now, but we've got to kick them in the butt and get it going on this. For our own sake,\" Hoffman said. \"I'm going to encourage anyone whose involved with giving money to any member of the Republican party not to give money to these candidates that will not endorse this plan,\" he said.\n\nAnd convincing Congress to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation may seem like a breeze compared to the ultimate objective of the group: implementing a complete ban on assault weapons which is what Hoffman originally said was his red line for supporting candidates and lawmakers following the Parkland shooting. But Hoffman says the group will conduct polling and hold focus groups to gather evidence which he says will hopefully show Congress a majority of Americans support such a ban.\n\nOverall, Hoffman does not seem oblivious to the mountainous challenges that lie ahead of this group, despite the influence some of the supporters hold within the Republican party. There are, for instance, numerous other donors who could fill candidate's campaign coiffures without mandating But he says he still holds out hope something can be done.\n\n\"I believe we can ultimately [succeed] and we will succeed. It's just going to take a long time,\" he said. \"But you know, this is my swan song, and I'm going to give it everything I've got.\"",

                "body": "Caucasian teenage girl diving into water Aliaksandr Liulkovich -- Getty Images/Blend Images\n\nIt's the eve of your departure -- the day before you leave for that long-overdue vacation you've been dreaming of for months. But before you embark on your trip, there are some important steps for you to take.\n\nHere are 11 items to cross off your to-do list before you head out.\n\nTo ensure your credit card works while you're traveling, your credit card company needs to know your travel plans. If you've waited this long though, you may have to call instead of submitting an online form.\n\nRelated: Budgeting for Vacation Never Works -- Here's What You Should Do Instead\n\nAnd there's one other very important thing. \"Make sure you have enough available credit on your credit cards,\" said Tammy Levent, CEO at Elite Travel Management Group.\n\nTraveling abroad? Call your service provider to help you set up the cheapest plan for making calls, sending text messages, and accessing Internet from your smartphone. Many cell phone companies -- including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile -- offer affordable day passes to U.S. customers for International talk, text, and data plans.\n\n\"If you're leaving two weeks or longer, it's a good idea to tell your local police department you'll be gone,\" Levent said. \"If you ask, they may do extra runs by your house.\"\n\nDouble-check all your reservations: your flight, hotel, car rental, restaurants, attractions, and any other services or experiences you've planned. You don't want any surprises at a check-in counter.\n\nIf you have access to a printer, it's not a bad idea to print out confirmations. If you don't, write down confirmation numbers (and customer service phone numbers) and keep the paper easily accessible in your wallet or carry-on.\n\nDon't want to get hit with late fees? Make sure all credit cards, housing expenses (e.g., rent, utilities), and other monthly bills will be paid on time.\n\nThis may seem like an obvious one, but \"many travelers forget to do it,\" said Levent. Check the forecast for your destination and your hometown when you'll be returning, and pack appropriately.\n\nThe last thing you want is to return home to a stinky fridge. Also, run the dishwasher, take out the trash, and clean the sink to be sure there's no food in the drain that could rot or attract bugs while you're away.\n\nYour emergency contact should have a copy of your travel plans, Levent advises.\n\nSift through your wallet and remove any items you don't need on your trip. Leave loyalty cards, gift cards, extra credit cards, and any other unnecessary contents at home.\n\nThis is a smart move if you're going away for more than a couple days, Levent says. Alternatively, you could arrange for a neighbor to collect your mail until you get home.\n\nDon't leave any outdoor wares (e.g., patio chairs, cushions, pool equipment) unguarded, especially lightweight items that are easy for thieves to steal.",

                "body": "The 2018 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament has been full of stunning upsets that no one saw coming: After the first round of March Madness games, not a single person still had a perfect bracket.\n\nThe upside of everyone's NCAA brackets being busted is that Little Caesars is giving away free pizza to all customers on Monday, April 2. That was the March Madness deal promised if a No. 16 seed in the NCAA tournament made history by beating a No. 1 seed -- which is exactly what happened when the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, beat the top-seeded University of Virginia last Friday.\n\nFans can expect more madness and excitement ahead now that we're heading into the Sweet 16. The NCAA Sweet 16 games tip off on Thursday, March 22, and Friday, March 23. The winners of those matchups play again on Saturday and Sunday for the right to go to the Final Four on the following weekend at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. (The NCAA tournament ends on Monday, April 2; a full schedule of the remaining games is below.)\n\nIf you want to know how to watch remaining March Madness games live online for free, or how to watch March Madness on TV, we've got you covered.\n\nFrom now on, all March Madness games are being broadcast on either CBS or TBS. TBS is a pay channel, so to watch on TV you must have a cable or satellite TV package that includes TBS. On the other hand, CBS is a network, and you should be able to watch your local CBS station on TV either with a basic cable package or for free with a digital antenna.\n\nThere are many options for live-streaming remaining March Madness games. First off, the NCAA March Madness Live app has a new Fast Break feature allowing anyone to stream games for free -- at least for a limited time. After a preview period -- which could be long enough to catch an entire game of your choosing -- you will be required to log in with a pay TV account number and password. Viewers can use the Fast Break feature on a browser in your desktop or on any device after downloading the NCAA March Madness Live app.\n\nYou can also use streaming services that include CBS and TBS to watch March Madness online. CBS live-streams all of its content via CBS All Access. The service costs $5.99 per month, and new subscribers can try it out for free during a one-week trial period.\n\nOther, more comprehensive streaming services come with packages that include TBS, CBS, and dozens more channels. Among the options are DirecTV Now, Hulu Live, Playstation Vue, Sling TV, and YouTube TV. These services all include Turner-owned pay TV channels like TBS in their packages, and in most of the country subscribers can also stream local broadcast channels like CBS.\n\nStreaming TV packages cost roughly $20 to $40 per month, but all have free trials. If you're a new subscriber who qualifies for a free trial, you can stream as much as you want for a week or so before being charged the regular monthly rate. Just remember to cancel before the free trial ends if you are not interested in becoming a paid subscriber.\n\nSo which games are on CBS, and which are on TBS? Here is the broadcast schedule for all the remaining games in the 2018 March Madness tournament, including the Sweet 16, Elite 8, and Final 4, courtesy of ncaa.com.",

                "body": "(KANSAS CITY, Mo.) -- A Kansas waterslide hyped as the world's highest was a \"deadly weapon\" that had already injured more than a dozen people before a 10-year-old boy was decapitated on it in 2016, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Friday that charges the water park operator and an executive with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nOperators of the Verruckt waterslide at the Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas, also knew that the raft Caleb Schwab and two women used during the deadly accident was prone to go faster and become airborne more than others. It was removed twice in 2016 but quickly put back into circulation, the indictment says.\n\n\"The ride was never properly or fully designed to prevent rafts from going airborne,\" the indictment said.\n\nThe waterpark and Tyler Austin Miles, 29, a former operations director at the park, were indicted Friday on involuntary manslaughter and several other charges in Caleb's death. The indictment alleges that a company co-owner and the designer of the Verruckt rushed it into use and had no technical or engineering expertise related to amusement park rides.\n\nThe charges come after a 19-month investigation into the death of Schwab, the son of Kansas Rep. Scott Schwab. The raft he was in went airborne, hitting a pole and netting designed to keep riders from being thrown from the ride.\n\nThe indictment says a video shows Caleb was following all rider instructions when he died.\n\nThe death seemed like an isolated accident until whistleblowers from Schlitterbahn revealed that experts who examined the slide found evidence indicating other rafts had gone airborne and collided with the overhead hoops and netting before the fatality, according to the indictment.\n\nThe ride complied with \"few, if any\" longstanding safety standards established by the American Society for Testing and Materials, and corporate correspondence found that \"the child's death and the rapidly growing list of injuries were foreseeable and expected outcomes,\" according to the indictment.\n\nInvestigators found 13 injuries to others during the 182 days the ride operated, including two concussions and one case where a 15-year-old girl went temporarily blind.\n\nA spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn did not immediately return a request for comment after the indictment against the company was unsealed.\n\nThe other charges in the indictment include aggravated battery and aggravated endangering a child. Miles was indicted on two counts of interference with law enforcement and Schlitterbahn was indicted on one count of interference with law enforcement.\n\nThe ride was created after Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeffrey Wayne Henry made a \"spur of the moment\" decision in 2012 to build the world's largest water slide to impress the producers of a Travel Channel show. The indictment says Henry's desire to \"rush the project\" and his and his designer's lack of expertise caused them to \"skip fundamental steps in the design process.\"\n\nThe indictment also said not a single engineer was directly involved in Verruckt's engineering or slide path design.\n\nMiles pleaded not guilty Friday during a brief court appearance. His attorneys asked that his bond be reduced to $15,000 from $50,000 but that request was denied. A trial was scheduled for Sept. 10.\n\nMiles allegedly avoided or delayed repairs that would take Verruckt out of commission during the active park season and the ride's brake system failed 10 days before Caleb's death, investigators said. He also is accused of telling a police detective that he was unaware of any complaints about the ride and of withholding \"thousands\" of incriminating daily reports from lead lifeguards and supervisors.\n\nSchlitterbahn, which is based in Texas, said in a statement after charges against Miles were announced that it was \"deeply disappointed to learn any individual is being personally charged for the terrible accident on Verruckt.\n\n\"Our review of the facts and circumstances of the accident has never shown any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of anyone,\" spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said.\n\nScott Schwab and his attorney, Mike Rader, didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nThe waterslide has been closed since Caleb's death. Schlitterbahn has said it will dismantle the ride when the investigation into the boy's death is complete.\n\nCaleb Schwab's family reached settlements of nearly $20 million with Schlitterbahn and various companies associated with the design and construction of the waterslide. The two women who rode with Caleb suffered serious injuries and settled claims with Schlitterbahn for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBefore the boy's death, Kansas law allowed parks to conduct their own annual inspections of rides. Lawmakers last year nearly unanimously approved stricter, annual inspection requirements for amusement park rides that set qualifications for the inspectors and required parks to report injuries and deaths to the state.\n\nBut only weeks later, lawmakers passed a follow-up bill delaying the enforcement of criminal penalties for operating a ride without a state permit until this year. And this year, the Senate and a House committee have approved legislation to lessen regulation for \"limited use\" rides at events like county fairs and exempt some amusements, such as hay rides, from regulation.",

The new emojis (which can be viewed here) include a seeing eye dog, a service dog, the sign for \"deaf,\" both a mechanized and manual wheelchair, and more. Apple collaborated with American Council of the Blind, the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, and the National Association of the Deaf to create the emojis.\n\n\"Adding emoji emblematic to users' life experiences helps foster a diverse culture that is inclusive of disability,\" says the proposal to the Unicode Consortium -- the gatekeeper for new emojis. \"Emoji are a universal language and a powerful tool for communication, as well as a form of self-expression, and can be used not only to represent one's own personal experience, but also to show support for a loved one.\"\n\nThe proposed emoji, which were first reported by Emojipedia, would be available in different genders and skin colors, though Apple acknowledges that the potential emojis are \"not meant to be a comprehensive list of all possible depictions of disabilities, but to provide an initial starting point for greater representation for diversity within the emoji universe.\"\n\nBefore the accessibility emojis could be released to the public, the proposal would have to be accepted by the Unicode Consortium. And the process is no walk in the park. Fortune detailed the steps that an emoji must go through before users can happily send the images to friends. Proposals for new emoji must make a compelling argument as to why they should be made. In Apple's proposal, for example, they note that \"One in seven people around the world has some form of disability.\"\n\nAn emoji subcommittee and then a technical committee select emojis, which are then put on the Unicode Consortium site for six months for public comment, finally they go to an annual committee, where the final decision is made.\n\nThere were initially 176 emojis, which were released in 1999.

                "title": "Trade War Fears Deal U.S. Stock Market Its Worst Week in 2 Years",
                "body": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 5, 2018.\n\nStocks around the world plunged Friday as investors feared that a trade conflict between the U.S. and China, the biggest economies in the world, would escalate. A second day of big losses pushed U.S. stocks to their worst week in two years.\n\nInvestors fear that if China responds in kind to sanctions on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports the White House announced on Thursday, it will be a first step toward a full-blown trade war that could damage the global economy and slash profits at big U.S. exporters like Apple and Boeing.\n\nThe market's two biggest sectors slumped the most. Technology stocks have made enormous gains over the past year, but since they do so much business outside the U.S., investors see them as particularly vulnerable in a trade dispute. The sector dropped 7.9 percent this week.\n\nBanks also fell sharply. Amid the trade-war rumblings, investors fled to the safety of bonds and drove down yields, a potential negative for bank profits. That marked a reversal from earlier in the week, when banks rose as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates.\n\nIt wound up being the worst week for U.S. indexes since January 2016. The S&P 500 index sank 6 percent. Among notable decliners was Facebook, which lost 13.9 percent, or $68 billion in value, as outrage mounted over its handling of user data. That's about as much as the company was worth in in 2012, the year of its initial public offering.\n\nStocks sagged at the start of this month after tariffs on aluminum and steel were announced, but they quickly recovered as the administration said the tariffs wouldn't be as severe as they first looked. The losses this week were worse, and investors are hoping for hints the sanctions on China are more of a negotiating tactic.\n\n\"There could be a possibility of a bounce back if, as this progresses, both sides look like they're negotiating,\" said Lisa Erickson, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"There could be further decline if people get a sense there could be more trade restrictions in place.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 index dropped 55.43 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,588.26 on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 424.69 points, or 1.8 percent, to 23,533.20. The Nasdaq composite fell 174.01 points, or 2.4 percent, to 6,992.67.\n\nGermany's DAX lost 1.8 percent and the French CAC-40 fell 1.4 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.4 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 4.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi tumbled 3.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 2.5 percent.\n\nBig U.S. companies tend to get more of their revenue from foreign customers than small companies do, and that makes them more vulnerable to damage from a trade war. With nearly 1.4 billion people, China is a big market for the largest U.S. businesses.\n\nNot every company breaks out how much of its revenue comes from abroad, but FactSet estimates that 30.5 percent of revenue at big companies in the S&P 500 comes from outside the United States. For the smaller companies in the S&P 600 index, it's just 19.5 percent. Smaller companies are also getting a bigger benefit from the recent cut in corporate tax rates.\n\n\"We think a lot of the areas in the market with the greatest potential for earnings improvement this year are small- and mid-cap stocks, things that have the biggest benefit from tax reform and are less subject to trade wars,\" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges mutual funds.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 33.79 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,510.08, but it's flat this month while the S&P 500 is down 4.6 percent.\n\nSales outside the U.S. are especially important for technology companies. Roughly $1 of every $5 in Apple's sales came from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in its last year. That doesn't take into account how much of the manufacturing and assembly of Apple products is done in Chinese factories, which could be affected if trade restrictions start piling up. On Friday chipmakers fared especially badly.\n\nInvestors kept buying bonds, sending prices higher and yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.81 percent from 2.83 percent.\n\nIn another sign investors are nervous, gold and silver prices jumped. Gold climbed $22.50, or 1.7 percent, to $1,349.90 an ounce and silver gained 20 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.58 an ounce. The dollar fell to 104.82 yen from 105.61 yen. The euro rose to $1.2367 from $1.2307.\n\nDefense contractors including Raytheon and Lockheed Martin climbed after President Donald Trump signed a new government funding bill that provides increases in military spending. He had tweeted a threat to veto the measure.\n\nThe price of oil climbed $1.58, or 2.5 percent, to $65.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, added $1.54, or 2.2 percent, to $70.45 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $2.04 a gallon. Heating oil added 3 cents to $2.02 a gallon. Natural gas dipped 3 cents to $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet.",

                "title": "What Americans Think About Presidential Scandals Like the Stormy Daniels Story Has Changed. But Not How You'd Expect",
                "body": "When Stephanie Clifford appears on CBS' 60 Minutes on Sunday, the woman known in her porn career as Stormy Daniels, will be adding a chapter to a very long history of the American public's fascination with Presidents' private lives.\n\nClifford is not the only woman who says she had an affair with President Donald Trump before he took the office -- Anderson Cooper recently interviewed former Playboy model Karen McDougal about something similar -- but this story is much older than just a decade or so. In some ways, it goes back more than 200 years.\n\nFor about as long as the country has existed, the public and the press have imposed few consequences on Presidents for what they do behind closed doors, even when those actions become public, as long as those actions don't affect the rest of the government. What has changed is the perception of when that line gets crossed.\n\nIn the nation's earliest years, newspapers were associated with political parties, so accusations of infidelity were often brought up to slam political opponents but dismissed by loyalists. \"The golden age of America's founding was also the gutter age of American reporting,\" as pundit Eric Burns put it in his book Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism.\n\nThe most notorious scandalmonger of that period was James Callender, a Federalist newspaper editor, who, for example, spread stories of Thomas Jefferson's fathering children with Sally Hemings, a woman enslaved at his estate, and also making a move on the wife of his good friend from college. Of the latter accusation, Jefferson wrote in a July 1, 1805, letter to his Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith, \"I plead guilty to one of their charges, that when young & single I offered love to a handsome lady. I acknolege it's incorrectness; it is the only one, founded in truth among all their allegations against me.\" (However, Monticello, the museum at the site of his former home, now acknowledges that the charge about Hemings is true too.)\n\nBut such claims about Jefferson didn't seriously damage his career. The times when personal stories like those did make a difference was when there was concern over whether public figures' personal lives affected their jobs.\n\nThe most famous political sex scandal Callender revealed was the extramarital affair that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton -- who wasn't president, but proves the point -- had with Maria Reynolds between 1791 and 1792, details of which Callender published in his anthology The History of the United States for 1796. In that case, it wasn't the affair that was controversial so much as the concern that Hamilton may have used federal funds to pay hush money to her husband. In a 1797 pamphlet, he attempted to set the record straight, clarifying that while the affair was shady, he didn't do anything illegal.\n\nHistorian David Eisenbach, an author of One Nation Under Sex: How the Private Lives of Presidents, First Ladies and Their Lovers Changed the Course of American History, argues that examining presidents' personal lives was also a way to judge \"how someone would behave in office,\" in the absence of other information about their character: \"In European countries, politicians came from distinguished families, but in America, you didn't have the old families to rely upon.\"\n\nThis was particularly true for candidates who came from humble backgrounds, such as Andrew Jackson. During his rise to power, the media drew conclusions about his fitness for office from speculation on the legality of his marriage. During the 1828 election, John Quincy Adams' campaign is said to have helped spread speculation about whether he and his wife eloped while she was still married to her first husband, in an attempt to prove that Jackson lacked a moral compass. First-Lady-elect Rachel Jackson died shortly before Jackson's inauguration, and it's believed that her stress over the public dissection of their marriage had exacerbated her ailments.\n\nBut, again, the charges against Jackson's marriage didn't actually keep him from office -- and in some cases such uproar could actually help.\n\nFor example, Grover Cleveland is believed to have won the 1884 presidential election in part because of the grace under pressure he exhibited after a Buffalo newspaper revealed that he had fathered a child out of wedlock. The story was made famous by a Sep. 27, 1884, editorial cartoon published about a month before Election Day, which gave rise to the \"Ma, Ma, Where's My Pa?\" chant at rallies for his opponent James Blaine. But he was above-board about the issue, and ordered party leaders to tell the truth, including about the child support that he paid. The decision reflected well on him, and he became President.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nThe period around the turn of the 20th century marked a major change in journalism, as it became professionalized -- with trade organizations and professional schools -- and, in many cases, divorced from outright association with a political party. As part of that reform, journalists backed off their scrutiny of presidents' personal lives.\n\nIn fact, one of Warren Harding's mistresses couldn't even find anyone to publish her tell-all about her sexual relationship. It was after his death that Nan Britton published The President's Daughter, which is considered one of the first graphic tell-all political memoirs. As the title suggests, she claimed she gave birth to a child that was his in 1919 -- a claim that DNA testing appeared to confirm in 2015. Evidence of the affair was in a trove of explicit letters that a historian found in the early '60s. His family, however, successfully sued to keep them sealed until 2014.\n\nThe press likewise stayed away from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's relationship with Lucy Mercer, Eleanor Roosevelt's social secretary, and President John F. Kennedy was spared scrutiny of his trysts, too -- or rather his \"extracurricular screwing around\" as Ben Bradlee, the Washington Post editor of Pentagon Papers fame, once put it.\n\nThe reasons for keeping a lid on presidents' personal lives were many. For one thing, some of the predominantly male political journalists could be seen as hypocrites if they made a big deal out of presidents' affairs.\n\n\"Many of the men in the White House press corps were carrying on dalliances of their own, so if they went public with the President, there would be blowback, and their wives would find out,\" says Barbara Perry, the Director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs, who spoke to TIME as part of a new presidential-history partnership between TIME History and the Miller Center.\n\nBut it's significant to note that -- perhaps not coincidentally, given the lives of those shaping the media narrative -- those dalliances weren't generally seen as affecting the public at all. They were secret, but also trivial.\n\nThe writer Marvin Kalb once recalled a night in 1963 when he was covering one of President Kennedy's New York visits for CBS, and was tackled by a Secret Service agent right outside an entrance to Kennedy's private elevator at the Carlyle Hotel. While on the floor, he looked up and caught a glimpse of a woman going into the private elevator. He did not even consider pursuing the story. \"In those days, the possibility of a presidential affair, while titillating, was not considered 'news' by the mainstream press -- not when the Cuban missile crisis was still a fresh and frightening memory of the nuclear dangers of the Cold War, not when racial tensions were again clawing at the soul of the nation,\" he wrote.\n\nThe moral panic of the 19th century had faded, and concerns about the possibility of harassment had not yet come up on a major scale. So the affairs stayed secret -- even when, in some cases, they did have implications for government or security. For example, though one of Harding's mistresses couldn't find a publisher, it was later revealed that the Republican National Committee had to pay hush money to another mistress of his.\n\nIn the late 20th century, things changed again. In 1969, after Teddy Kennedy drove a car into the water off Chappaquiddick, leading to the death of his passenger Mary Jo Kopechne, a TIME essay posited that the public was asking about what public figures did in their private lives because those figures had gotten more powerful, so it mattered more. In general, that was true -- the office of the President became more powerful in the 20th century than it had previously been -- but perhaps the bigger change was in the perception of what truly qualified as private. The things that were secret were no longer seen as quite so meaningless to politics.\n\nThat difference was thrown into relief in 1987, when Colorado Senator Gary Hart was the frontrunner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. He told New York Times reporter E.J. Dionne that he didn't care if people followed him around, and that anyone who did so would be very bored. So the Miami Herald staked out his Washington townhouse until they got a photo of Hart with Donna Rice, a 29-year-old Miami model who was not his wife. Two days after refusing to answer a Washington Post reporter's question, \"Have you ever committed adultery?\" at a televised press conference, he suspended his campaign.\n\nTIME's cover story on Hart's fall from grace cited the Herald's stakeout as \"a watershed moment in political journalism.\" It wasn't just a matter of public willingness to talk about sex or the fact that Hart had been caught in hypocrisy, the story pointed out: \"[With] the changing status of women, society has grown less tolerant of the macho dalliances of married men.\" (It's worth remembering, as TIME pointed out in that 1969 essay, that when scandal helped bolster Cleveland, women couldn't even vote.)\n\nThat shifting line -- the shared feeling that it doesn't necessarily matter what the President does in private, but that some things that seem private really aren't -- is also illustrated by what is probably the 20th century's most famous White House sex scandal: President Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. With Clinton, it wasn't the affair itself but rather the attempt to cover it up that would lead to his impeachment, points out political scientist Alison Dagnes, co-editor of Sex Scandals in American Politics. Clinton's job approval ratings remained consistently high during the scandal, suggesting that the public didn't think it was affecting the way he did his job. \"People felt good about where they were and where America was in the world and gave Clinton credit for that,\" Perry explains.\n\nIt has been more recently, as public conversations about sex in the workplace have evolved, that some have come to rethink the implication of a relationship between a President and an intern, and the power dynamics entailed.\n\nThroughout, from Jefferson to Clinton, the takeaway is the same: when the public thinks that the President's private life will get in the way of governing -- whether as a matter of 19th-century morals or 20th-century gender dynamics -- such a scandal can truly damage a presidency. If there's no perception that an affair or similar scandal will impact the government, historically the political fallout has been minor. The real change has been that what people do in private has once again, over the last few decades, come to be seen as relevant to a person's fitness to lead.\n\nSo what does that mean for Trump?\n\nHe may actually benefit from the fact that -- given that a range of sexual misconduct allegations already surfaced during his campaign, and just this past week a judge ruled that Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, who claims that Trump groped her, can move forward with her defamation suit -- claims of consensual affairs may not change public opinion in any significant way, though that could change if campaign-funding laws get drawn in.\n\n\"There is a genius in Trump's run for the presidency in that he starts with the premise that all politicians are crooked, and I'm not one, so you don't need to judge me the way you judge politicians,\" Perry points out.\n\nHistorian Thomas A. Foster, author of Sex and The Founding Fathers, suggests looking not at what the President does but how his actions compare to his reputation. Shock and hypocrisy, he argues, are more damaging than adultery. Trump -- who has owned beauty pageants and has been married three times -- built his brand partially on his virility and what Foster calls an emphasis on \"conquests.\" Now it remains to be seen how he will conquer these most recent allegations.",

Prosecutors allege he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old disabled woman who had told him to use a different entrance to access the field.\n\nThe charge of injury to the elderly can be filed if a person intentionally or knowingly causes injury to a person 65 or older. It carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nHarris County authorities say they're talking with Bennett's legal team about surrendering on the charge.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles earlier this month acquired Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks, where he became one of the dominant defensive linemen in the game. The Eagles and Bennett's agent, Doug Hendrickson, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBennett had 8 ½ sacks last season and has 54 in his nine-year career. The 32-year-old Bennett has three years remaining on his contract, with a base salary of just $1.65 million in 2018. That number jumps to $6 million in 2019 and $7.5 million in 2020.",

                "title": "Trump Says Tariffs Will Help Americans. But U.S. Farmers Fear They'll Be Hurt",
                "body": "Truck driver Marion Howard watches soy beans load into his truck on October 1\n\nWall Street isn't the only place where President Donald Trump's tariffs have struck a nerve. Agricultural communities across the U.S. fear escalating trade tensions will increase prices of U.S. goods abroad and harm their business.\n\nTrump announced plans for tariffs on a slew of products from China this week with a value of at least $50 billion, the latest in a string of tariffs the White House has described as key to protecting the U.S. economy. Previous tariffs hit imported aluminum, steel, solar panels and washing machines, raising the prices for domestic consumers and causing the stock market to dip.\n\nBut what worries U.S. agriculture is the threat of retaliation that could reduce demand for U.S. agricultural products. China is the greatest U.S. agricultural export market with more than $21 billion in products sent there in 2016, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n\"I'm very concerned,\" says John Heisdorffer, a soybean producer from Iowa and president of the American Soybean Association. \"If we lose trade to China, our neighbors to the south will be glad to take up that trade.\"\n\nChina has so far issued a measured response to Trump's first move with $3 billion in tariffs of its own on products including wine, fruit and pork. But the specter of more lingers on the horizon. The country has hinted that soybeans -- the largest U.S. agricultural export -- are a likely next target.\n\nThat threat has led to a decline in futures for soy beans, among other products, at a time American farms are already struggling. The USDA projected last month that U.S. farm income is expected to decline nearly 7% this year.\n\nThe mess over tariffs -- and the threat of a trade war -- came the same week as Trump declared on Twitter that the Administration is \"delivering\" for farmers.",

                "title": "President Trump Bashed Wasteful Spending. Then He Praised Over-Budget Military Projects",
                "body": "President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill into law at the White House on Friday, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown, despite concerns it was full of what he deemed wasteful programs.\n\n\"I was thinking about doing the veto,\" Trump told reporters. \"But because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our thinking.\"\n\nThe president read a laundry list of multi-billion dollar weapons purchases included in the bill, rattling off battleships, warplanes and submarines. However, many of the programs he listed by name have been plagued with cost overruns, programmatic delays and the very taxpayer waste that he criticized.\n\nThe F-35 fighter jet. The KC-46A aerial refueling tanker. The P-8A Poseidon submarine-hunting jet.\n\n\"We're very proud of many of the items that we've been able to get,\" Trump said. \"We're very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider in many cases them to be bad or them to be a waste of money. But that's the way unfortunately right now the system works.\"\n\nThe more than 2,200-page bill includes nearly $700 billion for the military and $591 billion in non-defense spending. At least $2.9 billion of that money will be invested into what's known as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.\n\nThe radar-evading fighter jet, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., has been beset by problems since it first began in 2001. It has been delayed by glitches in its onboard computer systems, cracks in structural components and even bugs with the pilots' high-tech helmets. The price tag, meanwhile, has nearly doubled to more than $400 billion for 2,456 jets.\n\nRobert Behler, the Defense Department's director of operational testing, said in an annual report released in January that there are about 1,000 unresolved deficiencies with the aircraft nearly two decades after it started.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and frequent critic of defense spending abuse, once called the F-35 program \"both a scandal and a tragedy\" and a \"predictable consequence of a broken defense acquisition system.\"\n\nIt took the Air Force three attempts and a decade to begin replacing its fleet of 415 Eisenhower Administration-era refueling tankers. The process, which also began in 2001, failed two times amid accusations of underhanded politics and discriminatory rule-making.\n\nBoeing Co. was finally declared a winner over rival Northrop Grumman Corp. for the $35 billion contract in 2011, yet the planes still aren't operational. The spending budget has set aside $510 million in taxpayer money for three KC-46A tanker aircraft, despite the chagrin of military leadership with the program.\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson laid out the concerns Tuesday during testimony with the House Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"One of our frustrations with Boeing is they're much more focused on their commercial activity than on getting this right for the Air Force and getting these aircraft to the Air Force,\" she said. \"And that's the message we took to them in Seattle last week. We have asked them to put their A-team on this to get these problems fixed and get this aircraft to the Air Force.\"\n\nBoeing has amassed around $2 billion in charges on the program related to delays and cost overruns. The P-8A Poseidon, another Boeing-made plane, has also been criticized although to a much lesser degree. The program previously had deficiencies anti-submarine warfare and wide area reconnaissance capabilities, two of its main missions.\n\nWilliam D. Hartung, director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, said the cost and performance problems with programs like the F-35 and KC-46 are notorious and shouldn't be overlooked.\n\n\"If the President wanted to talk about waste he should have referenced the ramping up of these programs, which are clearly not ready for prime time,\" Hartung said. \"What's not clear is whether the president has any sense of the strategic value of any of the items he reeled off, or a sense of whether the programs in question are well managed.\"\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis, who appeared alongside Trump at the White House, said it was \"the largest military budget in history, reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding.\"\n\nMost military spending has been capped for the past few years under budget controls meant to rein in government debt. Trump blamed this on the Democrats but, in fact, it was Republicans' doing.\n\nIn July 2011, now-House Speaker Paul Ryan locked his veteran Budget Committee staff director, Austin Smythe, in a room for 48 hours with his aides and had them rewrite the 1985 Budget Control Act that first created the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester. That modified bill became the $1.2 trillion end-of-the-year spending-cut threat that is caused the GOP so much grief as the nation annually hung on a fiscal cliff.\n\nThe new infusion of cash gives the military invites waste and abuse, according to critics like Hartung, because it's more money than the Pentagon can absorb. But to arms manufacturers and the defense industry, it is a welcome reprieve after the many years of living under the sequester.\n\nJohn Luddy, vice president for national security policy at the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents the defense industry on Capitol Hill, said in a statement that the bill was \"a big step in the right direction\" for the Pentagon.\n\n\"It makes significant investments in vital acquisition programs and provides necessary flexibility on operations and maintenance spending, he said. \"To meet the strategic objectives outlined in the National Defense Strategy, we'll need to continue to increase investment for at least the next five years.\"",

                "title": "Here's How Much Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Wedding Invitations Cost, According to Experts",
                "body": "Hands hold invitations just printed at the workshop of Barnard and Westwood for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding on March 22, 2018 in London, England. The couple will marry in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19.\n\nRun, don't walk, to your mailbox. Invitations to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming royal wedding went out this week to 600 lucky guests, and they look elaborate -- and expensive.\n\nThe Kensington Palace confirmed on Twitter Thursday that the invitations were printed in American ink on English paper (get it? Because she's American and he's British). They're gilded around the edges and were made in a process called die stamping on a machine from the 1930s. And like everything else about the upcoming ceremony, their creation was top secret. The woman who oversaw the printing, a Barnard and Westwood worker named Lottie Small, couldn't even tell her mom she got the job.\n\nWe may not know the exact price of the invitations, but we do know the May 19 wedding is on track to cost an estimated $2.8 million, according to the U.K.-based wedding planning app Bridebook. Experts in the U.S. have their own guesses about the invitations' value.\n\nSarah Sadler, a client coordinator with New York printer Bella Figura, tells MONEY that she thinks printing 600 of Harry and Markle's invitations probably cost about $7,500. With inserts or envelopes, the total was likely about $10,000.\n\nThe bulk of the cost came from the die stamping, also called engraving. Sadler said it's more expensive than letterpress because \"it requires a lot more work and a lot more high-end materials.\" It's an older, traditional process that involves someone making each invitation by hand.\n\nDie stamping isn't easy. Small likely had to keep checking the color and making sure the pressure was consistent. She also likely had to print double the amount of invitations just to get 600 good ones to send out.\n\n\"It's truly a labor of love, and that's why the price is so high,\" Sadler added.\n\nKristen Armstrong, the chief financial officer of Cheree Berry Paper in St. Louis, Missouri, pointed out that the invitations' design also probably forced the company to create two metal plates for the engraving. That can be costly, but it also probably benefited Harry and Markle in the long run.\n\n\"With printing, the more you order, the less the price per piece,\" Armstrong tells MONEY. \"It costs almost the same to run the first as it does the 400th.\"\n\nThe seal at the top of the invitation required extra attention to detail, as did the hand-painted gold edges. Armstrong's estimate for the invitations cost came to about $6,000 for 100, but without knowing all the specifications she couldn't come up with a final figure.\n\nHeather Wiese Alexander, the creative director and owner of Bell'INVITO in Dallas, noted that everyone's prices are a little different because couples don't just pay for the literal invitations. They also get customer service, various designs and some hand-holding.\n\n\"It's about having systems in place that keep highly detailed orders like this from getting messed up,\" she said, adding that ordering 1,000 similar invitations from her company would likely cost about $24,000.\n\nAlexander also mentioned that although the royals' invitations are beautiful, they're not over-the-top. In keeping with Harry and Markle's down-to-earth style -- she loves messy buns; he proposed while cooking dinner -- their invitations don't have \"all the bells and whistles that we sell on a regular basis,\" Alexander said.",

                "title": "Lawmakers Mostly Ignored Trump's Empty Veto Threat",
                "body": "After President Donald Trump threatened on Friday morning to veto a massive spending package, you might have expected a bit more chaos on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter all, when the House and Senate left the Capitol on Thursday evening, they were leaving for a two-week recess, and many of them headed straight to the airport for overseas trips with other members of Congress. Had Trump vetoed the bill, there would have been a mad scramble of lawmakers returning to town to cobble together a new bill; in the meantime, the government would run out of money at midnight on Friday and shut down.\n\nBut the Capitol Building was quiet on Friday morning, confirming what many on the Hill told TIME: that they never really took Trump's threat all that seriously.\n\nSent just before 9 a.m., Trump's tweet lamented the lack of funding in the bill for a wall on the Mexican border and criticized Democrats (somewhat inaccurately) for failing to reach a compromise on the undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.\n\nBut many in Congress, on both sides of the aisle, simply rolled their eyes at another flash of empty drama.\n\n\"No one thought he would go through with it,\" one senior aide to House Democratic leadership said. \"There were no conversations about [members] coming back.\"\n\nAnd so the Capitol Building was still in the hours after Trump sent his tweet. The automated subway that links the legislative building to the adjacent Senate office buildings was running, but its cars were mostly empty, a ghost train humming along the tracks. Members of the Capitol Police wondered to one another whether they'd be off by 3 o'clock; congressional staffers, without any instruction from their superiors to stand by, got in their Ubers and headed to Reagan National Airport. Reports that Arkansas Republican Sen. John Boozman was seen in the hallways could not be independently confirmed by TIME.\n\nThe response -- or non-response -- to Trump's tweet is a testament to how many members of Congress have chosen to operate amidst the deluge of bluster and contradictory signals spewing from the Oval Office: keep your head down, do your job as always, and trust that the president's staff will help keep him from following through.\n\nIn this case, Trump and his team were clearly at odds. His threat to veto the bill contradicted the official stance presented by the White House just hours earlier.\n\nSpeaking in New Hampshire on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence praised the legislation as \"the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.\" (The bill allocates $650 billion in military spending, up $61 billion from last year, and in a concession to Democrats, also increases funding for domestic programs.)\n\nMick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, was less equivocal. \"Let's cut right to the chase: Is the President going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,\" Mulvaney said on Thursday. \"Is it perfect? No. Is it exactly what we asked for in the budget? No. Were we ever going to get that? No. That is not how the process works.\"\n\nBut Trump was reportedly furious over the $1.6 billion allocated for border security, a paltry sum compared to the $25 billion he'd wanted. (Of that $1.6 billion, only $38 million goes to the \"planning and design\" of a \"border barrier,\" i.e. a wall; most of it is for fences.) Still, his veto threat on Friday morning didn't add up. He fumed in his tweet that \"800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats,\" referring to the executive immigration program he repealed in September, but in reality the Democrats had been so eager to reach a compromise on a legislative solution for these immigrants that they had initially offered full funding for Trump's border wall. (Republicans refused.)\n\nStill, most chose to assume he was bluffing, and they were right. Trump gave televised remarks shortly after lunchtime, telling reporters that he had signed the bill, while also criticizing it. Trump said he was signing the bill out of concern for the military, but he described the drafting of the 2,232-page legislation -- a hasty process that also upset several members of Congress -- as a \"ridiculous situation.\"\n\n\"I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump said. \"Nobody read it. Its only hours old.\"\n\nTrump was not alone in his ire. A faction of conservative Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus penned a letter to Trump earlier in the week lamenting, paradoxically, the bill's \"record levels of wasteful spending\" and its inadequate funding for border security. On Thursday night, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky delayed the Senate vote by instead live-tweeting his reading of the lengthy bill, which he called a \"sad excuse for legislation.\"\n\nStill, even those who opposed the package expected Trump to blink. \"We never thought the President would veto this horrendous piece of legislation,\" one senior Republican aide told TIME in an email. \"We sure wished for it to be vetoed. The White House needs better legislative staff to ensure nothing similar to this ever makes it to his desk. They should have raised red flags all along the way. Simply put, conservatives got screwed. \"\n\nIn any event, crisis was averted. And on Capitol Hill, another brief flash of drama had passed without too much heartburn. \"No one expected it, but no one was that surprised by it,\" one Senate Democratic aide told TIME. \"This is what he does.\"",

                "title": "A New TV Series Will Make You Believe the Earth Is an Organism",
                "body": "One of the dreamier conceits of the early environmental movement was that the Earth was not merely one of the solar system's many planets. It was, instead, a living organism.\n\nKnown as the Gaia hypothesis, named after the Greek goddess of the Earth, the idea was that all of the uncounted quintillions of organisms, from bacteria to blue whales, that make up the Earth's bio-mass interact with the planet in ways that weave everything together into a living, breathing, reproducing whole.\n\nLess-romantic minds did not think much of the theory. That bio-mass is really more of a bio-film, a thin skin of biology that can reach no further than perhaps a couple dozen miles below ground and a couple dozen into the sky (airborne microbes account for the flying population). That's a maximum biological reach of 24 miles on a planet with a diameter of 7,918 miles. The so-called living Earth is, in reality, 0.3 percent alive and 99.7 percent dead.\n\nBut the few hundred human beings who have left the planet see things differently -- and we would too if we'd been where they've been. It's something that's made plain in the intoxicating new National Geographic series One Strange Rock, premiering on March 26.\n\nDirected by Darren Aronofsky, the 10-part series comes at the planet from very much the Gaia perspective, but takes it further, devoting each episode to one thing -- organic or inorganic -- that makes life on Earth possible. The first episode -- straightforwardly titled Gasp -- is devoted to the chemistry and complexity of the atmosphere. The second -- called Storm -- explores the billions-year-old bombardment of meteors and asteroids to which our planet has been subjected, and the ways it has (sometimes just barely) survived. The third episode -- Shield -- examines both the life-giving and planet-killing power of the sun, and how the Earth has managed to come out on the positive side of that mortal equation.\n\nAronofsky has approached this material before, but in a bank-shot sort of way. His 2017 thriller Mother! was an allegorical tale of the power of mother nature and the wages of incurring her wrath. This time he takes a more straightforward approach, relying on science and dazzling cinematography to tell his tale.\n\nThere's wit in the series, much of it provided by host and narrator Will Smith. The sun, Smith says in the Shield episode, is \"not this big, jolly ball of nice.\" There's wow in the series too -- the flying river above the Amazon (really) that helps keep Earth hydrated, the 40 tons of space debris that pound the planet every day. But it's the on-camera accounts of seven astronauts -- Peggy Whitson, Mike Massimino, Chris Hadfield, Mae Jemison, Jerry Linenger, Jeff Hoffman and Nicole Stott -- that give the film its authority.\n\n\"I remember looking back at Earth and thinking, 'I live on a planet; I'm an Earthling,'\" says Stott, who spent 104 days in space over two missions. \"It looked alive -- the way storms move, the nervous system of lightning. There was never a stillness.\"\n\nBut a living thing -- whether planet or microbe -- is also a destructible thing, and the act of leaving Earth has often left astronauts both in awe of the planet and in fear for it. It was the iconic \"Earthrise\" picture, taken by the crew of Apollo 8 from lunar orbit on Christmas Eve 1968, that is credited with helping to kickstart the environmental movement. The view from even the much closer-to-home 250-mile altitude at which the International Space Station orbits can have a similar effect on astronauts and on anyone who contemplates the pictures they bring home.\n\n\"From space, you see the whole of the planet, the thinness of the atmosphere,\" says Whitson, who holds the NASA record for time spent in space, with 665 days over three missions -- so far. \"You realize how hard it is to make life happen, and you appreciate that we have to take care of it. On the station we have managed to recirculate 85 percent of our water; the Earth recirculates 100 percent. It's not easy to build an ecosystem.\"\n\nInevitably, One Strange Rock also raises questions not so much about the function of Earth as its place in the cosmos. Stott recalls being a young girl, opening a map of the known universe and being less drawn to the oval-shaped image itself than to the white space beyond it on the rectangular paper. \"I was asking myself, 'What's all that white paper? Is is heaven?'\" she says.\n\nGood question. If it is, it needn't be the heaven of scripture. It can be the heaven of order, of reason, of trillions of other living worlds scattered across billions of light years, all forming a Gaia-like web of life vastly larger than Earth alone. Whitson admits to feeling a certain intellectual push-pull after all of her time in space -- the contradiction between the apparent randomness of existence and the systemic order of life.\n\n\"I'm a believer in science and proving origins,\" she says. \"But there are a lot of things in evolution that contradict entropy.\"\n\nColonel Frank Borman, who just turned 90, was the commander of Apollo 8, and as such was one of the first three people in history to move far enough away from the planet to see it as an entire sphere, hanging in space. His words, captured by the cockpit voice recorder, were, \"What a view.\" His thoughts, as recounted in his autobiography, were: \"This must be what God sees.\"\n\nWhether God sees such a thing or not is an unanswerable question. What is certain is that the great mass of humanity will never see it. A show like One Strange Rock, however, offers us all at least a bit of the view -- and a lot of the wonder.",

                "body": "(BEIJING) -- China announced a $3 billion list of U.S. goods for possible retaliation in a tariff dispute with President Donald Trump and girded Friday for a bigger battle over technology policy as financial markets sank on fears of global disruption.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry said higher duties on pork, apples, steel pipe and other goods would offset Chinese losses due to Trump's tariff hike on steel and aluminum imports. It urged Washington to negotiate a settlement but set no deadline.\n\nTrump said Friday that he was not concerned that the tariffs would be a drag on the stock market. He added: \"China is going to end up treating us fairly.\"\n\nIn a separate and potentially bigger dispute, the ministry criticized Trump's decision Thursday to approve a possible tariff hike on Chinese imports worth up to $60 billion over Beijing's technology policy. It gave no indication of a possible response but a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Beijing was \"fully prepared to defend\" its interests.\n\n\"We don't want a trade war, but we are not afraid of it,\" said the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.\n\nOn Wall Street, stocks were mixed Friday, but Asian financial markets sank on concern the escalating tensions might disrupt the biggest global trading relationship or lead other nations to raise import barriers.\n\nTokyo's benchmark tumbled by an unusually large 5.1 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index closed down 3.4 percent.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 104.90 yen as investors shifted into the Japanese currency, which is viewed as a \"safe haven\" from risk.\n\nChina's response Friday appeared to be aimed at increasing domestic U.S. pressure on Trump by making clear which exporters, including farm areas that voted for him in 2016, might be hurt.\n\n\"Beijing is extending an olive branch and urging the U.S. to resolve trade disputes through dialogue rather than tariffs,\" said economist Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in a report. \"Nevertheless, the first volley of shots and retaliatory response has been set off.\"\n\nThe list announced Friday was linked to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs , but companies already were looking ahead to a battle over complaints Beijing steals or forces companies to hand over technology.\n\nThe tensions reflect the dueling nationalistic ambitions of Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.\n\nU.S. efforts to boost exports of technology-based goods, begun under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, conflict with China's plan for state-led development of global competitors in fields from robotics to electric cars. Foreign business groups complain Chinese regulators are trying to squeeze them out of promising industries.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry announcement Friday made no mention of jetliners, soybeans or other products that are the biggest U.S. exports to China by value. That leaves Beijing room to take more drastic steps.\n\nChinese officials are trying to figure out how to address U.S. concerns, said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China.\n\n\"Until the Trump administration articulates those concerns and how China can address them, it's going to be very, very difficult for China to make those changes,\" said Parker.\n\nWashington doesn't believe it needs to give Chinese leaders another list of requests because they already know what the United States wants, said a senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified further. He said Trump and Xi agreed last year on a 100-day agenda of trade-liberalization measures but Beijing failed to act on about half of them.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration wants Chinese leaders to address more basic structural issues that interfere with market forces, said the official.\n\nThe official cited Beijing's \"Made in China 2025\" plan as \"hugely problematic.\" It calls for creating Chinese competitors in electric cars, robots, artificial intelligence and other fields. Business groups complain it will hamper or outright block foreign access to those industries.\n\nThe latest proposed Chinese tariffs would add a 25 percent charge on pork and aluminum scrap, mirroring Trump's 25 percent duty on steel, according to the Commerce Ministry. A second list of goods including wine, apples, ethanol and stainless steel pipe would be charged 15 percent.\n\nChinese purchases of those goods last year totaled $3 billion, the ministry said.\n\nThe U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs also have irked Japan, America's closest ally in Asia.\n\n\"We have repeatedly told the U.S. side that steel and aluminum imports from its ally Japan will not adversely affect America's national security, and that Japan should be excluded,\" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.\n\nChina's top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, appealed to Washington on Tuesday to \"act rationally\" and said, \"we don't want to see a trade war.\"\n\nThe United States buys little Chinese steel or aluminum, but analysts have said Beijing would feel obligated to take action to avoid looking weak.\n\nBeijing reported a trade surplus of $275.8 billion with the United States last year, or two-thirds of its global total. Washington reports different figures that put the gap at a record $375.2 billion.\n\nTrump's technology order is in response to \"unfair and harmful acquisition of U.S. technology,\" said a statement by the U.S. Trade Representative's office. It said USTR would pursue a World Trade Organization case against Beijing's \"discriminatory technology licensing.\"\n\nA USTR statement said possible measures include a 25 percent tariff on Chinese-made aerospace, computer and information technology and machinery but gave no details.\n\nChina is unlikely to respond until Washington acts but might launch an investigation of imports of U.S. corn and soybeans \"as a warning shot,\" said Parker. He noted Beijing began a probe of U.S. sorghum in February after Trump announced the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Chinese premier promised at a news conference Beijing will \"open even wider\" to imports and investment as part of efforts to make its state-dominated economy more productive.\n\nLi said Beijing would \"fully open\" manufacturing, with \"no mandatory requirement for technology transfers.\" However, Chinese officials already insist companies aren't required to hand over technology, so it was unclear how policy might change.",

                "body": "The following feature is excerpted from TIME Coffee: The Culture. The Business. Your Health available at retailers, on Amazon, and at the Meredith Shop\n\nIf you've ever done any investigating into the world's most expensive coffees, you know about Kopi Luwak. This is a bean that grows primarily in Indonesia and is harvested only after it has been eaten, and then digested and egested, by an Asian palm civet -- a weasel-like creature that lives and you-know-what-elses in the woods. It's believed a) that the beans must be pretty tasty for the civet to eat them in the first place and, more important, b) that the insides of the civet add a little je ne sais quoi to the flavor. Seriously. Kopi Luwak is so coveted it can run up to $600 a pound, for a coffee that on its best day and when brewed to perfection is meant to taste like crap.\n\nThere's been some pop-culture hype about Kopi Luwak -- it wound up, inevitably, on an episode of 2 Chainz's don't-miss Most Expensivest Sh- series -- but what drives the price are the scarcity and the, well, unique taste of the bean. Those factors are pretty much what leads to demand for all high-end beans, such as the famously aromatic Esmeralda Geisha (grown on the slope of a volcano in Panama) or the jackfruit-and-guava-tinged Wush Wush Reserve, a bean native to Ethiopia that's now grown on a farm in Colombia and is the source of, bar none, the best cup of coffee I have ever drunk in my life.\n\n\"That's the idea; that is the hope,\" says Maya Albert, the coffee director at Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan. Albert is the woman behind what is currently the most expensive brew of coffee in New York -- no small distinction in a city where more than 25 million cups of joe are knocked back each day. \"We want to make this a cup of coffee you will always remember.\"\n\nEleven Madison Park is a very classy restaurant. Its logo consists of the outline of leaves from the four trees -- linden, ginkgo, maple, London plane -- that grow in the namesake park outside its doors. It has also been named, on more than one occasion, and by more than one bureau of judges, the best restaurant in the world. It offers an 11-course tasting menu that changes with the seasons, and that recently included apples dipped in foie-gras caramel, followed soon after by smoked-sturgeon cheesecake with caviar.\n\nThat tasting menu costs $295, which does cover a cup of coffee (even espresso!), but if you want Albert's special tableside coffee service and the delivery of that incomparable cup of Wush Wush -- well, that will cost an additional $34. Along with the rare bean, you're also paying for that service, the experience, the setting, the entire happy shebang.\n\nThere's more than one tableside option, and Albert brews the selected bean according to the method she has determined will extract optimum flavor. She prepares the cup of Wush Wush via Silverton immersion, which involves a contraption that looks to have been stolen from a high school chemistry class. The machine's glass dripper includes a mesh filter and is stopped by a valve that can be manually opened and closed. This lets the brewer either immerse beans or do pour-over or, in this case, a combination of both.\n\nAfter allowing the customer to smell the freshly roasted and freshly ground beans (oh, sweet mystery of life!), Albert puts grinds in the Silverton dripper and adds water that she has brought to a temperature of, not to put too fine a point on it, \"somewhere between 202 and 203 degrees.\" She immerses the grinds for 30 seconds and then opens the valve. Then she does a little pour-over. Then more immersion. Then more pour-over. \"We tried brewing the Wush Wush with 100% immersion,\" Albert explains, \"but the flavor was a little too powerful, especially for an unaccustomed palate. The pour-over tempers that.\"\n\nWhile preparing the coffee, Albert, schooled in the art, produces an abundance of bean-related -information -- about origins, processes, roasting nuances and so on. The mini master class builds to the presentation of a coffee that, in the case of the Wush Wush, has subtle creaminess, the unmistakable wisp of fresh blueberry and a faint earthiness -- the \"terroir of -Colombia,\" as Albert says.\n\n\"It's a super-complex, super-rare flavor,\" says Steve Sutton, the founder and CEO of Devoción Coffee, which sources, imports and roasts all of the specialty beans for Eleven Madison Park. \"Each time you cup it, you experience something new. The flavors are immensely layered. It's as good as great coffee can get.\"\n\nDevoción gets its beans from Colombia, canvassing the country's microclimates to harvest year-round. After being dry-milled in Bogotá, the beans are sent by FedEx to Devoción's shop in Brooklyn, where they are immediately roasted and sent out to U.S. clients. In short, a coffee cherry can be picked off a branch in the Colombian Andes and 10 days later be in your cup, finishing off a Manhattan meal of sturgeon terrine. The Wush Wush grows on a farm in Tolima, at an altitude of 5,900 feet. \"The story of a coffee is part of the experience, and so is the setting, and so is how you drink it,\" says Sutton. \"If you gave a cup of Geisha, which is very light and almost tea-like, to a customer at Dunkin' Donuts, they'd be upset that their coffee was messed up. But it is an exclusive and sought-after bean, a delicacy.\"\n\nYes, that Esmeralda Geisha is rare, and pricey -- it went for $601 a pound at an auction last year, and cups of it were sold for $55 at Klatch Coffee in Southern California. Indeed, if you want to spend big on coffee, there's never been a better time. Yet a service like the one at Eleven Madison Park, grand fuss and all, remains as rare as high-end beans themselves. The restaurant delivers 8 to 10 cups a night via tableside service (that recently included a $22 Villa Flor \"Natural Heirloom Blend\" as well as the $34 Wush Wush) and may add a decaf option.\n\n\"In the restaurant business, you learn that you are going to get some complaints, especially when you try something new or expensive,\" says Billy Peelle, Eleven Madison Park's general manager. \"But since we rolled this out [in 2017] I haven't heard complaints at all. Not one. People seem interested. Then thrilled.\"",

You will not immerse, but you will have a true, true adventure.\"\n\nHere are the top five experiences Bourdain recommends for a first-time visitor.\n\nIt's \"touristy as hell,\" Bourdain says, but you've got to go to Robot Restaurant. Located in the Shinjuku nightlife district, the venue offers dinner and a 90-minute cabaret-style show that incorporates robots, dinosaurs and dancers. But Bourdain says you don't have to eat in Robot Restaurant. Decline the meal, but just go for the experience, he says.\n\nSimilar to a 7-Eleven (which Japan also has), Bourdain recommends checking out this convenience store chain for its incredible egg salad sandwiches and little tonkatsu -- or as Bourdain puts it, \"little fried chicken cutlets under light bulbs.\"\n\nThere's not really a direct English translation, but Izakayas are essentially pubs that serve shared dishes that pair well with alcohol. The best ones, Bourdain says, are in the Golden Gai district -- an area consisting of six alleys lined by almost two hundred tiny bars.\n\nFood halls (called depachika) are located in the basement of many of the Japanese department stores are a great way to try a variety of dishes. \"The food centers in the department stores are pornographic,\" Bourdain says. Takashimaya and Isetan are good ones to check out, as both are located in the Shinjuku shopping district.\n\nWhile in the Tokyo area, first-time visitors should take a day trip outside the city to visit a traditional Japanese country inn (called a ryokan) and have the full experience, Bourdain says. That typically includes Japanese baths fueled by hot springs (onsen) and high quality meals. \"That's pricey as hell, but at least one night in a traditional ryokan with the baths, particularly the outdoor ones, you gotta do it.\"",

                "body": "Time Life Pictures/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nHistorians have resolved a 70-year-old mystery surrounding USS Indianapolis and the number of World War II troops who survived when the Navy cruiser was torpedoed by the Japanese on July 30, 1945.\n\nThe sinking of the ship, which went down in under an hour, has been called the U.S. Navy's worst-ever disaster at sea. Out about 1,200 crewmen aboard, it was long believed that 880 sailors and Marines lost their lives during the attack itself or in the water following the ship's sinking, due to extreme conditions including shark attacks, dehydration and saltwater poisoning.\n\nHowever, thanks to new research by the Naval History and Heritage Command Communication and Outreach Division, officials have since confirmed that 879 people died following the attack on USS Indianapolis. In addition, the number of people who survived is 316, as the Navy has long said, and not 317 as some have posited over the years.\n\nThe problem was always a matter of math. Now, the reason the number of survivors was revised downward by one is that the total number of people on board was revised too, from 1,196 to 1,195. A search of available public records found that Clarence William Donnor (pictured below), a Navy radio technician believed to have been among the Indianapolis crew, had continued to serve until he was discharged in 1946. But he wasn't a 317th survivor. In fact, he had not been on the ship in the first place.\n\nEven though Donnor's parents informed that Navy that their son was still alive, the initial clerical error remained in the historic Navy lists with no explanation, according to new a paper produced by historians Richard Hulver and Sara Vladic.\n\nThis recent review of the number of people who perished following the disaster was ordered by the director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, following the discovery of the USS Indianapolis wreck last summer.\n\nA research vessel owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen discovered the wreck in the Philippine Sea, 5,500 meters below the surface on Aug. 19. The ship, which remains the property of the U.S. Navy, was left undisturbed by Allen's team following the discovery.",

Its only hours old.\"\n\nThe bill funds the government for the next six months, and includes $1.6 billion in funding for border security. But Trump had tweeted Friday morning that he was considering a veto of the bill, which lawmakers had approved on Thursday, because it did not include a solution for the recipients of the DACA program, and money for a border wall.\n\nThe tweet contradicted what members of his administration had said he would do. \"Is the President going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,\" Mick Mulvaney, the Director of Office Management and Budget. Trump vetoing the bill after Congress had approved it would have likely spurred a government shutdown, since funding expires at midnight on Friday and the majority of lawmakers had left the Capitol for a two-week recess.\n\nTrump called on Congress to give him a line item veto for spending bills, and, as he has before, called for the removal of the filibuster, a rule requires 60 votes to pass legislation in the U.S. Senate. He lamented the sentiments from his early morning tweet that the bill did not include a solution for DACA recipients.\n\nTrump had announced the news conference at 12:32 p.m. Eastern Time on Twitter, less than a half hour before the event was supposed to occur. The White House sent out updated guidance less than 10 minutes after the tweet stating that the press briefing was being replaced by a \"press availability\" from the President.\n\nAt the beginning of the news conference, he disparaged the bill multiple times, calling it a \"ridiculous situation that took place over the last week. \"You tell me -- who can read that quickly?\" he said, presumably referring to the fact that the bill was over 2,000 pages.\n\nTrump told reporters after the press conference that he was \"thinking about doing the veto\" but ultimately decided against it because of the support for the military.",

                "title": "Babies 'R' Us Owes These Expecting Mothers Hundreds Of Dollars And They Are Furious",
                "body": "At about 5 months pregnant, Johanna Santana clutched her growing bump as she serpentined through the aisles of a Babies \"R\" Us in Florida in mid-January, scanning more than 200 of the best and safest items for her baby registry.\n\nIn addition to some smaller items that would help her out when she welcomes her first child in May, the 33-year-old expectant mother had her eye on a few expensive items -- specifically a $380 stroller and carseat set. But she wasn't expecting her family or friends to purchase those for her off her registry -- instead she was planning on using the \"Endless Earnings\" rewards program offered by Babies \"R\" Us.\n\nThe \"Endless Earnings\" rewards program is a cash-back incentive that usually is worth hundreds of dollars -- given as a gift card 12 weeks after a child's birth to help ease the financial burden -- depending on the total value of the registry. In fact, the rewards program was the whole reason she chose to do her baby registry at Babies \"R\" Us. But now Santana's financial strategy will no longer be possible -- as she is now one of thousands of expecting mothers and families struggling to figure out how Toys \"R\" Us's liquidation filing will impact their baby registries -- and the cash-back benefits they were counting on.\n\nToys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us are closing the more than 700 U.S. stores that are still open following a tumultuous last year for the toy giant. And in addition to the elimination of the baby registry perks, other Toys \"R\" Us rewards program benefits and gift cards will only be valid at locations until April 20. That also applies to expecting mothers or those who just welcomed their child in recent weeks -- meaning they can no longer expect to save hundreds of dollars on future purchases since their cash-back gift cards would not arrive in time for them to still be valid. Toys \"R\" Us declined to comment as liquidators determine the next steps for the company.\n\n\"We had been holding off to buy our most expensive items with that,\" Santana, who works full-time as the manager of marketing communications at NASCAR, said of the rewards card. \"But it's not going to happen now.\"\n\nBabies \"R\" Us has been a popular destination for families creating baby registries for years. According to a recent survey from WeeSpring, a baby product website, Babies \"R\" Us was among the top three most popular retailers for baby registries in 2018, behind Amazon and Target. The registry program also includes in-store help and options to test out strollers and other big-item purchases -- a perk expecting parents could rely on that is, for obvious reasons, unavailable from fast-growing online retailers.\n\nLike Santana, Sarah Maiellano, a 32-year-old living in Philadelphia who is expecting her first child in May, told MONEY the rewards program was the dominant feature that brought her to Babies \"R\" Us over other registry options. She registered for more expensive items with the expectation of a $344 gift card coming her way.\n\nWhile she didn't have specific plans for that card, Maiellano said she could have used it for the constant stream of diapers and other essential products she'll have to buy. Ideally, Maiellano said, getting some kind of gift card of any price would be helpful for expecting mothers who say they weren't warned of the rewards program disappearing before their due date. But \"even if you get the gift card, there's not that much left to buy,\" Maiellano said. \"My registry is quickly selling out online.\"\n\nThe same goes for Santana, who before Toys \"R\" Us's liquidation announcement last week had family and friends contacting her about how her registry items were in low stock or sold out. Her confidence in the store stayed strong thanks to an email she received in February notifying her there were no plans to shut down the rewards program as Toys \"R\" Us took its first hit of store closures this year. She said she heard nothing from the store about the changed programs and benefits before she called her local location herself.\n\n\"It has been stressful, especially as a first-time mom,\" Santana said. \"Before this happened, I could say that I picked everything out carefully and was really happy with the registry.\"\n\n\"Now,\" she added, \"I'm still looking for a pediatrician, daycare and so many other things while working full-time. So when this happens, I can't add something else to my plate.\"\n\nThe fall of the retailer opens the door for other competitors to entice parents-to-be. Santana and Maiellano both started making baby registries elsewhere, like on Amazon, at Target and on Babylist, a universal, online baby registry that shows price comparisons from major retailers. Natalie Gordan, the CEO and founder of Babylist, said she expects thousands of expecting parents with Babies \"R\" Us registries to come to her website to manage and re-do them. (Santana is one of the expecting mothers who has already moved her registry to Babylist.)\n\n\"It feels like it's the end of the era,\" Natalie Gordon, the CEO and founder of Babylist, told MONEY. \"They were kind of this default option and people always assumed it was going to be part of their journey to parenthood.\"",

                "title": "Peru's Congress Allows Embattled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to Resign",
                "body": "LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's congress voted Friday to accept President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's resignation, paving the way for his replacement by a politician who most voters never even heard of until recently.\n\nBy a vote of 105-12, congress granted Kuczynski's request to step down after just 20 months in power, but rejected his written arguments that he was doing so as a result of his opponents' constant plotting to undermine his rule.\n\nCongress' action cleared the way for Vice President Martin Vizcarra to be sworn in later Friday.\n\nVizcarra received something of a hero*s welcome shortly after midnight Friday when he arrived to Peru from Canada, where he had been serving as ambassador, amid one of the most politically turbulent periods in Peru's recent history.\n\nSupporters welcomed him at the airport with a large cake in the red and white colors of Peru's flag celebrating his 55th birthday Thursday. A marching band was on hand and some people carried signs reading \"Peru is with Vizcarra.\"\n\n\"With faith and optimism, Peru will always move forward,\" he said in brief remarks from his home.\n\nA last-minute hitch Friday had threatened to delay the transition of power.\n\nKuczynski said in a tweet that the proposed language of a congressional resolution approving his resignation is \"unacceptable,\" and if lawmakers press forward with the wording he would reverse his decision to quit, forcing congress to go forward with plans to try and impeach him.\n\nIn the end, the language was removed. But congress nonetheless rebuked the 79-year-old Kuczynski, scolding him for a \"political crisis that that is the result of wrongful acts that the president himself has committed,\" according to the final text of the resolution.\n\nEfforts to oust the unpopular Kuczynski led by the daughter of former strongman Alberto Fujimori have been building for months. But the campaign went into overdrive this week after the emergence of secretly shot videos showed allies of Kuczynski, including Fujimori's son, allegedly attempting to buy the support of an opposition lawmaker to block the president's impeachment.\n\nTo stem off an even more disgraceful exit, Kuczynski delivered a resignation letter to congress Wednesday, blaming relentless attacks by his opponents for making it impossible to govern.\n\nKuczynski's downfall was his association with Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant that has admitted to spreading some $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America, including $29 million in Peru.\n\nFor months, even as three of his predecessors became ensnared in the bribery scandal, Kuczynski vehemently denied having any business or political ties to the company. But documents presented by Keiko Fujimori's Popular Force party showed his consulting firm had received $782,000 in payments from Odebrecht a decade ago, some of them when he was a government minister.\n\nThe former Wall Street investor said he wasn't then managing the day-to-day affairs of his consulting business and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nStepping into the void left by Kuczynski is Vizcarra, whose name wasn't recognized by 81 percent of Peruvians in a March poll by Ipsos. His only previous experience in public office before becoming vice president in 2016 was as governor of Peru's second-least populated province.\n\nWhile Vizcarra is expected to continue Kuczynski's pro-business agenda, he will face a tough challenge building consensus with a hostile congress and growing public anger at Peru's political class. Protesters scuffled with police Thursday night while calling for new elections for both president and congress.\n\nThe new president's first test on the international stage will come in three weeks when he is expected to host President Donald Trump and other Western Hemisphere leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Lima.",

                "body": "Nothing is more frustrating than getting bumped off a flight -- but a massive travel voucher may ease the pain.\n\nUnited Airlines gave passenger Allison Preiss a $10,000 travel credit after removing her from an overbooked flight on Thursday, representatives confirmed to MONEY. United couldn't board her because a seat broke on the plane, according to Preiss, and no one volunteered to give up a seat. Preiss said the airline chose to remove her because she paid the lowest fare.\n\nWashington Dulles International gate agents originally offered her $1,000 in travel credits, but bumped her voucher up to $10,000 when she asked for cash, Priess told NBC. MONEY reached out to Preiss for additional comment.\n\nPreiss may not be the only recipient of a lofty travel voucher from United. The airline changed its policy last year to allow customers up to $10,000 in travel vouchers if they volunteer to give up their seat on an overbooked flight. The policy change came after a video of airline officials dragging a passenger off a plane circulated on social media.\n\nDespite her hefty compensation, Preiss' circumstance is not unusual. When a passenger is bumped, airlines are by law required to rebook and compensate passengers who involuntarily give up their seat. The company must also offer a check if the passenger does not want a travel voucher.\n\nUnited is the second-most likely airline to bump passengers for overbooked flights, according to data from MileCards.com.",

                "title": "Why John Bolton Couldn't Get Confirmed as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations",
                "body": "Though he won't start in his new job for several weeks, John Bolton -- who will replace Gen. H.R. McMaster in the role of National Security Advisor, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday -- isn't exactly an unknown quantity when it comes to his views on diplomacy and security. The ambassador, also a regular Fox News presence, has been a polarizing public figure in American international relations for more than a decade, and behind the scenes for even longer.\n\nNotably, Bolton worked as under secretary of state for arms control and international security under President George W. Bush, and was picked to be the nation's ambassador to the U.N. in 2005. And, during that era, he made clear his views about more than one subject that remains central to U.S. security.\n\nFor example, during a 2003 speech, Bolton famously took a hard line on North Korea, calling life there a \"hellish nightmare,\" right on the eve of talks with the country's leaders. And, though he seemed somewhat optimistic about diplomatic solutions to the problem of Iran's nuclear weapons in a 2006 interview with TIME, in 2007 he said that \"Iran is not going to be chatted out of its nuclear-weapons ambitions\" and the time had passed for trying to work out a deal.\n\nAs TIME reported while the Senate debated whether to confirm Bolton to the U.N. role, those hard-line views weren't the only reason why his appointment was so controversial. Nor was the fact that he had once said that if the U.N. headquarters \"lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\" Rather, it was a question of character that led Senators to block votes on his confirmation for months, such that he ultimately got the job via a recess appointment by Bush.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nBolton had offended a host of Washington characters in his decades in government. Colin Powell had confessed to Senators that he was worried about the way Bolton mistreated subordinates, TIME reported, and 60 retired diplomats had sent a letter to the committee speaking out against the nomination. One former ambassador sent a note to Joe Biden, who was then the top Democrat on the committee considering the nomination, saying that Bolton \"dealt with visitors to his office as if they were servants with whom he could be dismissive, curt and negative.\"\n\nBut the problem wasn't just that people were mad at him, the article explained:\n\nAs one State Department official put it, \"John was always a strong friend of his own opinion.\"\n\nThe nature of Bolton's recess appointment meant that his tenure at the U.N. was relatively short, but his time in the public eye didn't end when that job did. He is to officially take over the job of National Security Advisor on April 9.",

                "title": "I Found Out Everything Facebook Knows About Me  --  And You Can Too",
                "body": "Assuming I was one of them, I dove deep into my privacy settings this week. What I found surprised me. Although most of my interests (Brooklyn, yorkies, One Tree Hill) were scarily accurate, a few were not. My ad preferences page inexplicably showed that I like trap music, gambling and toe (not plural -- just the singular word \"toe\").\n\nUh, what?\n\nIf you're morbidly curious like me, here's how to see the facts Facebook knows about you (or what it thinks it knows about you).\n\nIf you go to Facebook's Accessing Your Facebook Data page, you can download all the data Facebook has collected on you. It'll take a few minutes to assemble an archive, but while you're waiting the page lays out the information you can expect to see.\n\nA lot of it is unsurprising. There's the \"About Me\" data you probably put in when you made your account, like work, education, hometown, gender and birthday. An \"Active Sessions\" category warns you that Facebook has been tracking the date, time, IP address, device and browser from every recent time you've logged on. It knows the pages you've liked (I, for one, am a fan of the \"Applesauce\" account) and the places you've checked into.\n\nThings get interesting when your download finishes and you open the HTML folder. Mine was divided into \"ads,\" \"apps,\" \"contact_info,\" \"events,\" \"friends,\" \"messages,\" \"photos,\" \"pokes,\" \"security,\" \"timeline\" and \"videos.\" They may seem self-explanatory, but they contain a ton of information.\n\nMy \"friends\" file, for example, has not only every friend I've ever accepted -- in order according to the date that I accepted them -- but also everyone I've ever declined and deleted. \"Contact_info\" has all of my friends' phone numbers. \"Events\" has every Facebook event I've been invited to (which apparently includes \"Quidditch Practice\" in September 2012, the \"Chili Chompin' Challenge\" in February 2013, and the eloquently titled party \"It's my birthday or something\" in March 2017.)\n\nYour photos and videos are there, too. And if you click on \"messages,\" it not only has all the messages you've sent but also every file you included and a copy of every sticker you added.\n\nIf you want to get really freaked out, navigate to Facebook's Ad Preferences page. That's where Facebook puts all of the items it thinks you like based on your past activity.\n\nMost of mine made sense, or I could at least figure out why Facebook predicts I like them. Origami, while not one of my actual interests, shows up probably because I took an origami class in college. Adventure travel probably comes up because I recently checked in at a brunch restaurant in Montreal. Versace is there not because I like the brand's clothes but probably because I've been binge-watching American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace and frequently Googling the facts of the case.\n\nFacebook swears it doesn't sell your data directly. But it does allow advertisers to target their ads based on conclusions they've drawn from your activity, as Terry Rice, a digital marketing instructor at New York University, tells MONEY.\n\nA marketer looking to reach a liberal voter, for example, could tell Facebook it wants to show its ad to people who like MSNBC host Rachel Maddow or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\nThat's one reason the Cambridge Analytica scandal is such a big deal: It took the insights collected from unwitting Facebook users and gave it to Ted Cruz's and Donald Trump's campaigns. The Trump team's digital media director, Brad Parscale, told Wired that Cambridge Analytica aided them with \"persuasion online media buying ... and they created a visualization tool that showed in each state which areas were most persuadable and what those voters care about.\"\n\nRice tells MONEY that Facebook doesn't just know your explicitly volunteered information. It also finds out other facts a bit more sneakily. There's a tool called Facebook Pixel, code that some companies have on their websites that tell Facebook what you do when you visit them. Basically: Facebook can draw conclusions about your personality when you're not on Facebook. (To my knowledge I haven't been visiting podiatry websites, though, so I still don't really know where the toe thing came from.)\n\nFacebook can even build a profile of you based on other people's habits by creating what are called Lookalike Audiences. If most users who have historically shopped for diapers and researched breastfeeding turned out to be moms, and you're doing the same, you are probably a mom, too.\n\n\"It's like the birds of a feather thing,\" Rice said. \"They were able to model your personality based on how similar you were to other people.\"\n\nIf you really want to dig deep, Popular Science recommends using a third-party program that will locate your data. Try Stalkscan, which promises to show you \"all 'public' info Facebook doesn't let you see,\" or check out Data Selfie, a browser add-on that follows your Web activity and \"reveal[s] what machine learning algorithms could predict about your personality based on that data.\"\n\nBut before you get mad, remember that in most cases you gave these apps access. You were complicit every time you quickly clicked \"OK\" when asked for access to your smartphone's microphone just so you could play Angry Birds faster, Rice said.\n\n\"We gave up all this data willingly not really knowing what the impact is,\" he added. \"We should take more control of our data and be curious as to how it's going to be used.\"\n\nIf the Cambridge Analytica drama has you spooked, you can always tweak your privacy settings (instructions here). You can join the #DeleteFacebook movement. You can contact your local representative and give your thoughts on how the government should regulate social media.\n\nOr, like me, you can just take a strange comfort in the fact that Facebook clearly doesn't know everything. I know more about myself than Facebook does. I don't like albatrosses, crabs or the 1991 film Lovers -- all of which show up as my interests.",

Their trip to the U.K. territory included a visit to one of Harry's own charitable projects, a program called \"Amazing the Space\" that encourages young people to \"become ambassadors for peace within their communities,\" as Kensington Palace puts it.\n\nIt's a noble cause -- but of course we can't help but pay attention to Markle's flawless fashion choice for the day as well. She may have chosen a simple skirt and jacket with a cozy sweater, but it turns out that the cream-colored sweater is by none other than designer and previous Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.\n\nThe former Posh Spice is a favorite of the royal family: she was the only one of her girl group to get invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton's royal wedding back in 2011. Some speculate that the singer-turned-designer will also be receiving an invitation to Harry and Meghan's big day, although nothing has been confirmed. In any case, by taking a page out of Posh's design book, Markle kept cozy in the cool Irish spring -- and provided a neutral palette for bouquets of gifted flowers to pop against while chatting with crowds before she and Harry stopped by a local historic saloon. Looks like she's learning these royal photo op ropes quite rapidly.",

                "title": "'Letterman' Veteran Nell Scovell: There's Nothing Funny About How Women Are Treated in Comedy",
                "body": "Nell Scovell is the author of Just the Funny Parts: ... And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club.\n\nI became an executive producer over 20 years ago and happily joined a small group of upper-level female TV writer/producers who would meet every few years over brunch. We'd unload stories about the unfairness we'd encountered. I'd tell my story about the time I was renegotiating to stay on a show and the executive producer stopped by my office to check on the deal.\n\nI looked at my boss, incredulous. \"Yeah, I'm just here for the salty snacks,\" I said.\n\nMy favorite stories are ones where the sexism is blatant. As Co-EP on a show, I was asked to rewrite the script of a low-level writer. I did a big pass over the weekend and then sent the new draft to the EP on Sunday night for a polish. The next morning, the EP pulled me aside.\n\n\"Great job, Nell,\" he said. \"But if you don't mind, I think it's better if I tell Mike that I did the rewrite. I don't want him to feel emasculated.\"\n\nThe women at the brunch would gasp at these anecdotes before telling their own gasp-inducing tales. And the stories would keep coming. And coming. By the time the frittata was served, the relief of realizing the bias wasn't personal was replaced by the horror of knowing it was so pervasive.\n\nAround 2010, I finally started hearing some positive news about late night staffing. Jay Leno added a female writer to The Tonight Show staff and Late Show with David Letterman added one, too. And although there'd been hundreds of dads writing comedy for late night, I believe Laurie Kilmartin holds the distinction of being the first mom when she joined Conan's staff in 2010.\n\nOver the years, I've seen how women advocating for other women in late night can make a difference. When Jimmy Kimmel Live! moved from 12:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., ABC Entertainment President Anne Sweeney took an interest in adding more women to the staff. Head writer Molly McNearney, the only female writer on Kimmel at the time, reached out to me to get names of women who might want to submit packets. I compiled a list and encouraged Bess Kalb, a sly and hilarious writer at Wired magazine, to give it a shot. Dozens of other funny women applied. Standup Nikki Glaser was on my list but passed to focus on her performance career. The night before submissions were due, Nikki emailed me.\n\nIf women who don't help women get a special circle in hell, I think women who do help women should get a special cloud in heaven. Thanks to Nikki, Joelle Boucai's packet made it to the show. And thanks to Anne and Molly, both Joelle and Bess were hired and have worked at Jimmy Kimmel Live! for more than five years.\n\nIn 2013, Laurie Kilmartin suggested I check out the Twitter feed of Jill Twiss, who made quirky observations like, \"I'm just going to say it. Bananas are cliquey\" and \"Pretty worried for gluten-free pigeons.\" I messaged Jill to learn more about her. During the day, she tutored kids for standardized tests and moonlit as a standup comedian and actress. When Last Week Tonight began staffing up, Tim Carvell asked for names and I mentioned Jill. That show reads submissions \"blind,\" removing any identifying details about the writer. Out of about a hundred submissions, Jill was one of eight people hired. She now has more Emmys than I do. (Although to be fair, anyone with a single Emmy has more Emmys than I do.) Unfortunately, my system for tracking down funny female writers isn't methodical. It's mainly based on word-of-mouth, which can cast a limited net. I always wish that I could help more women, and especially women of color.\n\nIn an ideal world, awareness would lead to action, which would lead to change. But in the real world, awareness more often leads to defensiveness, which leads to excuses. Emboldened by the forward motion in late night, I called a showrunner who ran a popular sitcom with a huge staff and only one female writer. We knew each other socially so I thought he'd be open to a discussion. I got as far as my observation that his staff had a gender imbalance before hitting a nerve.\n\n\"How dare you accuse me of being sexist,\" he said. \"My mother was the breadwinner in our family and my wife is one of the strongest women on the planet.\"\n\nI tried to salvage the phone call. \"I didn't call you sexist. But just look at the numbers on your staff -- \"\n\n\"You think I don't notice?\" he said, ire rising. \"I look around the room and notice it every . . . single . . . day.\"\n\nThis showrunner bringing up his breadwinner mother and strong wife is a perfect example of \"moral licensing.\" Everyone -- male and female -- is biased. But no one wants to admit it, so our brains search for examples that disprove the accusation.\n\nMoral licensing comes into play when people rely on past behavior to dismiss current prejudiced behavior. This is better known as the \"Some of my best friends are . . .\" defense. People who believe they are unbiased turn out to be more biased so it's not enough to be aware that there's a lack of women in a room; you must also be aware that your knee-jerk defensiveness is part of the problem.\n\n\"When you're used to privilege,\" the saying goes, \"equality feels like oppression.\" My showrunner friend felt under attack and our call ended on a sour note. I was angry with myself for coming on too strong. On the plus side, it taught me what not to do. It would be so helpful if blurting out, \"Obviously, there's a problem so just fix it!\" worked. It doesn't. Ask anyone fighting climate change or gun violence.\n\nPeople insist the lack of women and people of color in Hollywood is \"a pipeline problem.\" Instead, I think it's \"a broken doorbell\" problem. Competent and talented women are right there on the doorstep, leaning on the buzzer, but no one is answering the door. This fault lies in our culture's misperceptions. Studies show that employers routinely perceive men as more competent leaders than women even when the data doesn't support the claim. For example, software code written by women is routinely rated as higher quality by male engineers -- unless the raters know who wrote it. Once gender is identified, the raters devalue the female-generated work. Men applying for jobs also benefit from being able to openly acknowledge their success. Too often women are taught to downplay their success with statements like, \"I got lucky,\" or, \"I had help.\" Guess what? The men got lucky and had help, too.\n\nThe numbers for female writers in the top late-night shows were just under 20% as recently as 2016, and mothers -- who represent a truly essential point of view -- remain in short supply. Some in the business still view being maternal as the antithesis of funny, since moms are associated with nurturing, gentleness and safety, while comedy wants to be twisted, dangerous and mean. But attitudes are evolving. I cheered in 2009 when a very-pregnant Amy Poehler rapped a boisterous tribute to Sarah Palin on Weekend Update. Ali Wong filmed her 2016 standup special Baby Cobra while seven months pregnant. Samantha Bee did stellar work as a correspondent for The Daily Show while pregnant and, in a New York magazine interview, urged others to try. \"It'll add to your comedy in ways that you never expected,\" Bee said.\n\nAll these women are both hilarious and tough -- or what I call, \"maternal.\"",

The two had been in a \"prior relationship\" that recently ended, according to the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"This past week, our lives changed completely and totally forever. My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives,\" Willey's mother, Melissa, said at a press conference Thursday night. \"We will be taking her off life support this evening. She is brain dead and has no life left in her.\"\n\nUsing a handgun legally owned by his father, Rollins also shot a 14-year-old male student in the leg, but he was released from the hospital on Wednesday. Rollins died Tuesday after being confronted by a school resource officer, less than a minute after he shot Willey. Police are still investigating whether Rollins died after being struck by the officer or by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n\"It is with terribly broken hearts that we learn of the tragic news regarding Jaelynn Willey. No parent should ever be faced with a decision like this,\" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said, after Willey's mother announced the family was taking her off life support. \"There are no words adequate to express our compassion for her loving family and the entire Great Mills community. All of Maryland grieves with them, and they will remain in our thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nThousands of students are set to march in Washington, D.C. on Saturday to call for action on gun control -- an effort led by students who survived last month's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.",

'Bless his heart,'\" she said. \"A phoenix rising from the ashes. Am I the ashes in this scenario? I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.\"\n\nJennifer Lopez, the original Jennifer in Bennifer, didn't mince her words when it came to her critique of the tattoo during an episode of Watch What Happens Live.\n\n\"It's awful!

Though it does include $1.6 billion for border security, including some spending for \"border barrier planning and design,\" that amount is far short of the $25 billion Trump has said he wants.\n\nPresident Trump ended the DACA program last September and has since outlined strict pillars he wants addressed in any deal to offer deportation protections, or a path to citizenship, for the population of immigrants who have and would benefit from it. Those pillars have stymied Congressional efforts to fix DACA, even as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have worked to find a compromise.\n\nDuring an early round of negotiations, Trump told lawmakers he would work with them on a \"bill of love,\" only to throw cold water on plans that didn't include his wants, including cuts to family-based migration and the diversity visa lottery program.\n\nThere were reports that the White House and congressional leaders were discussing a plan to push through a short-term extension of the DACA program that was tied to border funding, but no such plan was included in the omnibus package.\n\nAs the spending deadline rapidly approached, the White House had proposed tying $25 billion in wall funding to a three-year extension of DACA. Democrats, however, could not agree to that plan because it did not include a path to citizenship for the nearly 1.8 million people who are considered Dreamers, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe Post reports that Democrats proposed tying the $25 billion in border funding to a path to citizenship for the entire Dreamer population, but the White House would not agree to protecting all 1.8 million without broader immigration changes.\n\nTrump has lashed out at Democrats on Twitter as a result of the impasse.",

The game between the Kings and Atlanta Hawks started about 20 minutes late and was played before about 2,000 fans in the 17,000-seat arena.\n\nThe protesters eventually dispersed and no arrests were made.\n\nAfter the game, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive addressed the small crowd from center court, surrounded by Sacramento's players and coaches. He expressed sympathy for the family of Stephon Clark, 22, who was shot Sunday in the backyard of his grandparents' home.\n\n\"We are so very sorry for your loss,\" Ranadive said. \"We at the Kings recognize people's abilities to protest peacefully and we respect that. We here at the Kings realize that we have a big platform. It's a privilege but it's also a responsibility. It's a responsibility that we take very seriously and we stand here before you, old, young, black, white, brown, and we are all united in our commitment.\"\n\nClark was suspected of breaking into cars in a South Sacramento neighborhood. Police were called and as a helicopter hovered overhead, Clark ran. Officers on the ground cornered him and, believing he had a gun in his hand, fired 20 rounds.\n\nAfterward, police found no weapon, only a cellphone.\n\n\"We are at a place of deep pain\" because of recent violence directed at black people in Sacramento and elsewhere, said the Rev. Les Simmons, a community leader who joined the protest. He commended the city's first black police chief, Daniel Hahn, for doing the best he could in the aftermath but criticized officers for their actions.\n\nClinton Primm said he was friends with Clark, who was nicknamed \"Zoe.\"\n\n\"He was a great dad,\" he said of Clark, the father of sons ages 1 and 3. \"He loved both of them to death.\"\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said he was horrified by Clark's death but won't second-guess the \"split-second decisions\" of the officers.\n\nHe praised Hahn for quickly releasing videos of the shooting and said the department has improved its policies since the fatal shooting of a mentally ill black man in 2016.\n\nIndependent experts said the footage from body cameras and the police helicopter raise more questions than they answer.\n\nThe officers appeared to believe they were in danger, they said, and if so the shooting was likely legally justified.\n\nOne officer is heard \"doing a mental inventory to make sure there's no holes in his body\" because the officers appear to think Clark shot at them, said Peter Moskos, a former police officer and assistant professor in the Department of Law and Police Science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nGeoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina and an expert on police use of force, said the officers may have a tough time explaining why they jumped to the conclusion that Clark had a gun.\n\nHe also questioned why an arriving backup officer had the two original officers turn off the microphones on their body cameras, eliminating what he called \"important evidence.\"\n\nIn an ideal world, the two officers should have immediately provided first aid instead of waiting five minutes for backup, said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\"But that could be more the product of hope than reality,\" he said, with the officers still in shock and worried about their own safety.\n\nThe Sacramento Police Department said officers were responding to reports of a man seen breaking into at least three vehicles and later into a neighbor's home. The police said deputies in the helicopter saw Clark break a neighbor's sliding glass door before jumping a fence.\n\nAs a result, \"their threat radar is really high,\" said Plumas County sheriff's deputy and special prosecutor Ed Obayashi, who trains officers and testifies in court on police use of force.\n\n\"They have to assume that their lives are in danger at that very second,\" he said.",

The little starter salad, the greek salad -- they're kind of of tiny for how expensive they are,\" Stratigos says. Move forward instead to the appetizers, which include some rich favorites. She recommends the messy-in-an-awesome-way Factory Nachos ($12.95) and the Avocado Eggrolls ($11.95), which \"are probably going to be on the menu forever.\"\n\nIf you are drinking adult beverages or even just eating, the happy hour at Cheesecake Factory is a relative steal. While the restaurant basically never offers discounts, that changes on weekdays from 4 to 6 p.m. in the bar area. Margaritas, Long Island Iced Teas, and Cosmopolitans will only run you just $5.95. Even better, those popular apps like those nachos and avocado rolls are the same price.\n\nIf you've eaten at Cheesecake Factory, you probably know the feeling of leaving the restaurant with what feels like a bowling ball sitting in your stomach. For the average person, the entrees provide a meal and then some. \"Every entree is a value\" based on its size, Stratigos says, and they're best shared. She loves the Steak Diane ($20.95) and Hibachi Steak ($21.50), both served with mashed potatoes. A couple could nosh on a couple appetizers and a single entree and feel more than satisfied. And Cheesecake, unlike some other restaurants, doesn't charge a table for an extra plate to split portions.\n\nOf course, if your body resists ingesting everything you order at Cheesecake Factory, the natural thing to do is take food home. But in that case, order wisely. Ask for sauces on the side, Stratigos advises, and veer toward certain dishes. \"The pastas and chicken all reheat very nicely if someone wants to take something home,\" she says. Salads, however, should be gobbled up in one sitting. Get the best of all worlds with the profoundly indulgent Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($17.95), featuring parmesan-crusted fowl, or the even spicier Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($19.95), which has linguine tossed with chicken and shrimp. You'll thank yourself when you take a bite the next day, after the spices have had time to settle.\n\nCheesecake Factory does give the public a price break once a year. Every year on National Cheesecake Day, July 30, the restaurant sells any cheesecake slice for half off and debuts a new flavor. Certain customers swear by the seasonal varieties, but Stratigos recommends the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (normally $7.95) and the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($8.50). \"You can have a full three-course experience -- just share it all,\" she says. \"You'll save an extra couple inches in your pants and leave not feeling disgusting.\"",

                "title": "H.R. McMaster's Retirement From The Military Reveals A Lot About Trump",
                "body": "Admiral Stavridis was the 16th Supreme Allied Commander at NATO and is Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University\n\nI met Colonel H.R. McMaster in 2004, when he was in command of the Third Calvary Regiment in Tal Afar, Iraq. It was a hot and dusty day, and I was a three-star Vice Admiral traveling with my boss at the time, Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld. McMaster, who looks like he ought to be working as a bouncer in a city bar in the Badlands neighborhood of his Philadelphia hometown, briefed us on his work in pacifying the violent region with an adept blend of hard and soft power -- what some have called \"smart power.\"\n\nThat is one smart Colonel is what I thought, and it solidified in my mind the superb intellect combined with operational skills that have characterized his career. Barrel-chested, shaven head and direct of manner, he radiates both brains and brawn. As the NATO Commander a few years later, and wearing four stars, I requested his assignment to my Afghan command as a one-star to take on the dark heart of our challenges there: corruption in the Afghani government. He did hard work in a difficult place there, and my respect for him grew.\n\nMcMaster's 1997 book, Dereliction of Duty, is in many ways a stinging indictment of the Washington culture of subtle deceit, hidden agenda and back-stabbing that helped pull the U.S. into a quagmire in Vietnam. It tells the story of the malfeasance of the uniformed senior military in misleading the nation and the President about the true state of affairs as the war spiraled down to defeat. It is also a cautionary tale for McMaster himself. In his time in the White House, he tried to rise above what Rex Tillerson called in an outburst of candor (and an understatement, frankly) this \"mean-spirited town.\" McMaster's short tenure as President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor certainly reinforced that assessment.\n\nThe media accounts of his relationship with the President are largely true. McMaster is a good judge of character and certainly knew what he was getting into when the President tapped him as his second National Security Advisor. When we get an assignment in the military, we call them \"orders,\" and this was a set of orders he would gladly have passed on. But like a good soldier, he shouldered the pack and stepped into the White House to do what he could to create at least part of a guardrail system around this mercurial and unstable President.\n\nFrom the beginning, he knew he would deal with whipsaw views on the key elements of foreign policy, like watching North Korea policy lurching from \"fire and fury\" one minute to accepting a meeting with Kim Jong Un to cut a big, beautiful deal the next. No National Security Advisor could bring order out of the policy chaos any more than his fellow General John Kelly could bring order to the process chaos. This is a President who loves and revels in chaos. For a national security team, that gives birth to the worst quality of all from an international and especially an allied perspective: inconsistency. Trump has famously said he doesn't want our enemies to know what we are thinking; the problem is, neither do our friends nor even, it seems at times, do we ourselves.\n\nMcMaster worked hard to bring talent to the National Security Council staff, avoid turf battles and generate a coherent National Security Strategy. When the strategy came out, I chatted with McMaster about it, and he said, \"America First doesn't have to mean America Alone.\" He managed to make the document shockingly normal. While dropping out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord were battles he could not win, he managed to at least keep a sense of mainstream foreign policy choices in play: a strong NATO, Asian alliances, countering a resurgent Russia and a rising China, a focus on cyber and energy, and other reasonable positions.\n\nBut by the end of a year, both the pace and above all the bureaucratic stresses in the White House were beginning to show. Over time, the insulation started to come off his wires; disagreements with cabinet departments started to undermine his position. He began to receive less support from the Pentagon and the Chief of Staff in the White House, and his solid, thoughtful and measured personality naturally grated on the boss. The rumors of his dismissal have been circulating seriously for months. The fact that he has chosen retirement instead of moving on to a fourth star speaks volumes about how this journey has concluded.\n\nGoing forward, I suspect and hope we will see more of H.R. McMaster. His intellect and depth of experience will be valuable assets for the private sector, and hopefully he will eventually return to government in an administration more in line with both his sensible, centrist views and, perhaps more importantly, with his rational personality. In shifting to John Bolton, we go from a centrist to a neo-con; from a calming personality who builds teams to a harsh ideologue who drives them into the ground; and from a practitioner of smart power to a theorist of hard power. The drums of war are beating louder, and in the Pentagon they are taking a deep breath and preparing for conflict not only on the banks of the Potomac in the interagency but also, more dangerously, around the world. We are poorer for the departure of H.R. McMaster. He deserved a better ending to his short, strange voyage.",

The Slice of Sauce creator and her business partner, Thac Lecong, have recently launched a Kickstarter in hopes of crowdsourcing funds to get their product into production.\n\n\"The slice is going to revolutionize the way that we sauce,\" Williams says of the portable ketchup slices in the video promoting the campaign. \"But it's also all-natural, no preservatives. This flavor is the real deal.\"\n\nUnfortunately, some skeptics aren't so sure about this new method of ketchup consumption. \"I just discovered something called a ketchup slice and it's an absolute abomination. A crime. Just don't do it,\" Twitter user Ari Shapiro wrote. \"I don't want a ketchup fruit roll-up or anything that resembles a processed slice of ketchup. If someone I know is using this new product, I will disown them in public.\"\n\nHowever, others are totally on board with the product. \"I am so ready for a ketchup slice on my bacon & egg burger my mouth watering at the prospect,\" tweeted user Supergoodplus.",

                "title": "Here's Why Trump's Spending Bill Veto Threat Is So Baffling",
                "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to guests during a Greek Independence Day celebration in the East Room of the White House, on March 22, 2018 in Washington, DC.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's threat to veto a massive spending package Friday morning rattled Capitol Hill and upset his own White House's carefully presented pledges of support.\n\nDespite earlier statements that he would sign the $1.3 trillion omnibus bill, which lawmakers approved on Thursday before leaving for a two-week vacation, Trump argued that the bill did not include money for a border wall with Mexico or a solution for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe tweet alarmed many on Capitol Hill, which was otherwise quiet: many members of Congress already had left town for the recess period, which would make it more likely that a veto could end in a government shutdown. \"Most people are gone,\" one senior congressional aide tells TIME. \"If this happens, we're having a shutdown.\"\n\nIt also left many scratching their heads. Trump blamed Democrats for the absence of a DACA solution, but it was the Democrats who earlier this week offered the president what many in their party considered a generous compromise: full funding for Trump's border wall, to the tune of $25 billion, in exchange for a path to citizenship for the 1.8 million young immigrants known as Dreamers.\n\nIn the end, no compromise on immigration was reached. (Trump got just $1.6 billion for border security, most of which was allocated for fencing.) But the bill nevertheless had adequate bipartisan support to pass -- and, it should be stressed, the vocal backing of the Trump Administration. On Thursday, the White House described the omnibus bill as \"a victory for the American people and supports President Trump's priorities.\"\n\nIn remarks at an event in New Hampshire on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence praised the package, commending its emphasis on military funding.\n\n\"President Trump promised to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy,\" Pence said. \"And in just a day he's going to have on his desk a bill that will make the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.\"\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase: Is the President going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,\" Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday. \"Is it perfect? No. Is it exactly what we asked for in the budget? No. Were we ever going to get that? No. That is not how the process works.\"\n\nLawmakers and their staffs are now steeling for a contingency plan should Trump indeed veto the package. Democrats saw a possible silver lining: if the government shuts down, they will have new leverage to negotiate.\n\n\"One of two things will happen,\" a senior Democratic leadership aide told TIME. \"Either he'll sign the bill by the end of the day, or he'll sign a bill that's worse for him after the Republicans come to the Democrats to end a shutdown.\"\n\nBut when it comes to this administration, predicting the future is more often than not a futile exercise.\n\n\"No one expected it, but no one was that surprised by it,\" the aide said of Trump's veto threat. \"This is what he does.\"",

                "title": "Apple Is About to Release a Cheaper iPad to Take on Microsoft and Google",
                "body": "Apple Inc. is preparing to introduce new low-cost iPads and education software next week in a bid to win back students and teachers from Google and Microsoft Corp.\n\nIn its first major product event of the year, Apple will return to its roots in the education market. The event on Tuesday at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago will mark the first time Apple has held a product launch geared toward education since 2012 when it unveiled a tool for designing e-books for the iPad. It's also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.\n\nIn Chicago, the world's most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.\n\nSteve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.\n\nApple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google's operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple's sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.\n\nA new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won't be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn't seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.\n\nRival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.\n\nWith a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That's helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.\n\nApple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company's Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There's also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.\n\nMore software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that's more in line with the design of the App Store, though it's unclear if it'll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.\n\nIn an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \"creative new ideas for teachers and students.\" Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.\n\nNext week's event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it's doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city's public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.\n\nAccording to Apple's website, the school where the event will take place is not an \"Apple Distinguished School,\" a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.\n\nApple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.\n\nSuch a deal won't be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, the company could be eyeing the Midwest for a major new office.",

                "body": "Take Chloe and Halle Bailey at their word: as the title of their debut album claims, these kids are alright. At just 19 and 17 years old, the sisters have staked their territory as two of pop's most ethereal rising voices. First finding an audience with a series of YouTube covers as kids, Chloe and Halle (stylized Chloe x Halle) also caught the ear of their idol Beyoncé, leading her to sign them to her record label, Parkwood Entertainment. A few years later, they've uprooted from Atlanta to L.A., landed roles in the Black-ish TV show spinoff Grown-ish, opened for Beyoncé and put out an EP and a mixtape. Now, they're finally releasing their debut album -- all while making at least a song a day together in their family's living room.\n\nIf it sounds like a modern-day fairytale, perhaps it's because they have Beyoncé as their fairy godmother. \"One of the things [Beyoncé] says is to let the world catch up to you; don't dumb down your art,\" older sister Chloe told TIME of her mentor's best advice. \"As fans of hers and two young girls, hearing that from her was an 'aha' moment -- and a confirmation that we were headed in the right direction.\"\n\nThat precocious message is heard loud and clear on The Kids Are Alright, a haunting meditation on growing up and finding their footing as young women. The duo shines as vocalists and hands-on musicians on the album: Chloe plays guitar while Halle is the production whiz, and both are credited as songwriters on every track.\n\nJust after a morning dance class, Chloe and Halle chatted with TIME about the making of The Kids Are Alright, the important role their generation is bound to play and the lessons they've learned from Beyoncé -- who, clearly, has helped set them up for a bright future.\n\nTIME: Your family isn't originally from California; you were first raised in Atlanta. Why did you move out west?\n\nHalle Bailey: We moved to L.A. about five and a half years ago on the dream of living out what we want to do. We knew that being out here was definitely better for the music scene. Our mom and dad made the decision to move us with our family. We instantly fell in love; the sun was shining. It makes you a happier person.\n\nWhen did you two decide that music was something you wanted to pursue as a career?\n\nChloe Bailey: We started off performing around Atlanta. It was fun, but deep in our hearts we always knew it was something we wanted to take seriously. But how it actually happened was when we posted our YouTube covers. The very first YouTube cover we ever posted was to \"Best Thing I Never Had\" by Beyonce. I think I was 13 years old, and my sister was 11. We were in our basement; our older sister recorded it for us. We didn't expect much; we were happy about the first 100 views. But then our covers started blowing up. From there we went to the Ellen Show, we did some stuff with Radio Disney, and then we just kept singing our hearts out and it opened up so many doors for us.\n\nHow long has The Kids Are Alright been in the works?\n\nHalle: We've been working on this album since three years ago, since before our EP, and before our mixtape. We were choosing from a catalogue of over 400 songs, since we were creating every day. But we think of all our songs as our babies, so it's really hard to choose. That's why the mixtape, we put it out there as the album rejects -- but we still love those songs. Working on the album, it took a lot of preciseness to figure out what we wanted to include. We feel like this album is our baby.\n\nYou two are mostly self-taught, and you've written and produced on every song on this album, with just a few other collaborators. How did you learn?\n\nChloe: Ever since we were little girls, our dad instilled in us the importance of not having to rely on anyone, and having a do-it-yourself attitude. So since he saw how much we loved to sing, he was like, \"Well, girls, why don't you learn how to write a song?\" So we all sat at the dining room table in Atlanta, when I was 10 and my sister was 8, and our dad would research song structure. He printed out all these things to read about applying figurative language to your lyrics -- like using similes and metaphors and personification -- because really a song is just poetry put to music.\n\nSo from 10 and 8 we just wrote our own songs, and that's how we learned. And the more we did it, the better we got. And how I learned to play my keys and do production -- it was on YouTube or Google. If I didn't know something, I'd just research it, and that's how I picked it up. I think our production and music style sounds different and out-of-the-box because we're just such big fans of music and we never force it, so it just naturally comes out like a big fusion of all these genres.\n\nTell me about the things that musically inspired you in the making of this album.\n\nHalle: Our experiences in our life as we're growing into young women, because every day the world seems newer and more exciting. For me, I'm 17 and turn 18 on March 27. I'm already thinking about what can I do when I'm 18! It's funny because our music documents this time in our lives so perfectly. When I'm older, I can look back on a song like \"Grown\" [the Grown-ish theme song] and remember feeling an exact way.\n\nBut in terms of music, I've always been inspired by jazz. Billie Holiday is one of my biggest influences. I discovered her voice when I was 5 years old. Just that sound she emits and the feeling she gives you is pure love and joy and relaxation. I feel like I've taken those melodies that she's given me and incorporated them into my repertoire. It comes out when we're doing songs together. Chloe brings her awesome hard beats and 808s to it, and incorporating that with some classic melodies, it turns it into a really different and interesting sound.\n\nWhat does the phrase The Kids Are Alright mean to you two?\n\nChloe: The title means so much to us; we're speaking about ourselves as we're growing into young women, telling ourselves we're going to be OK. We'll make mistakes and we'll have obstacles, but we'll overcome them. But then also in a general sense, with this generation and how the world has gone mad and all these crazy things that are left for this generation to handle, it's just proclaiming that we will be alright no matter what, and they shouldn't worry about us. I love being part of this generation because we're not afraid to let our voices be heard, and we're not afraid to speak our mind.\n\nDo you feel like you're part of a generational shift?\n\nHalle: We feel like the youth are definitely going to make a change in everything that we're doing. We're just happy to be a part of that conversation, and use our art as a gateway for people to see our message of love and empowerment. We hope it inspires other young people. I hope it's a ripple effect.\n\nWhat has been the hardest part for you two, growing up in the spotlight and becoming these voices that speak for other young women?\n\nChloe: Sometimes it's been hard for us to believe in ourselves, but we have such a great support system in our parents and Beyoncé, who's always letting us know to trust our art and our instincts. As women growing up in this male-dominated industry, sometimes we're like, \"Well, we're just two young girls making music in our living room, what do we know?\" But as we've experienced more and worked with really great musicians, we've learned that, You know what? We do have this. We're figuring this out within through music.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice that Beyoncé has given you?\n\nHalle: Beyoncé has always relayed that same message to us: your music is ahead of its time, and it's beautiful in that way, and we need more of that. Because our music is not the status quo, it's not like everything you hear. It's different for your ear. We make it because we like different stuff, but sometimes other people are like, \"Oh...that's interesting.\" But that's what we want -- that's what's exciting, when music is evolving in that way. That's definitely taught us to stay true to ourselves.\n\nHas she ever given any advice that hasn't worked out for you?\n\nChloe: No, that's impossible for her! She's been in this game for so long, she's learned so much herself and is just passing off the knowledge to us. We love her.\n\nHow did your collaboration with Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay come together?\n\nChloe: We love Miss Ava DuVernay so much! We've always been such fans. We look up to her because she's such a strong black woman -- and she has locs, just like us, so she's been such a big inspiration. One day she reached out to us looking for music for A Wrinkle in Time. My sister and I were like, \"What? That's so cool!\" We looked through our current catalogue of songs, but we didn't really find anything that spoke to us for this movie. So we were like, \"You know what, let's just write another one!\"\n\nWe were in our living room; we watched the trailer and we wrote the song in an hour. We sent it to her and she loved it, she just asked for it to feel a little more cinematic and a little more universal because [the character in the movie] was talking to her dad, not just a lover. And we made those tiny notes and, bam, it was in a movie! It was our first movie placement. The video just dropped; Storm [Reid] and our dear friend Rowan [Blanchard] [both of whom star in A Wrinkle in Time] are in it.\n\nWith movies like Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time and shows like Grown-ish becoming so popular, it seems like young women of color are finally getting to be seen. What does this wave mean to you?\n\nHalle: I think that's a beautiful thing where you can think, \"Wow, I see Lupita [Nyong'o] up there, I can go for that audition. I can do music because I see Beyoncé, and she's succeeding, and she's confident in herself.\" I think we definitely need that representation, and I'm just proud to be alive during a time when it's being shown.",

                "body": "Katharine Hepburn as Mary, Queen of Scots in 'Mary of Scotland', directed by John Ford.\n\nFor more than three decades, March has been designated as Women's History Month. You would think that a historian like me, who has devoted 15 years to trying to win recognition for the many female sovereigns whose achievements and influence have been grievously overlooked, would be heartened by this attempt to combat the prejudices of the past. But I am not happy about Women's History Month. I think it is a mistake, just as I think having a separate Women's Studies curriculum or building a National Women's History Museum in Washington, D.C., is a mistake.\n\nIt's not that I think feminine accomplishments should be ignored, that students should not be required to study and learn about them. But by allowing women to be shunted off to the side in this way -- for no matter how impressive the academic department, or how large the museum, or how many previously unknown females are highlighted in the month of March, that is what we are doing -- we ensure that women remain a subset of history rather than integral components of recognized major events.\n\nIn my field in particular -- European history -- the almost complete exclusion of female leadership from survey courses has ingrained in the general population the idea that (with the possible exception of Elizabeth I and now, thanks to PBS and Netflix, Victoria and Elizabeth II as well), women played no role in the momentous wars and political intrigues that are ticked off one by one in the average Western Civilization lecture series. This casual diminishing of half the population has led to all sorts of ludicrous explanations for pivotal episodes, one of the most droll being that angels led Joan of Arc to the court of the hapless dauphin, Charles VII. In fact, it was Yolande of Aragon, queen of Sicily, the dauphin's mother-in-law and one of the most competent and effective politicians in world history, who was responsible for recruiting Joan of Arc, just as it was Yolande who financed and organized the army that relieved the siege of Orléans, universally recognized as the turning point in the Hundred Years' War. Yet when this period is covered in high schools and colleges, you won't find any of this on the syllabus.\n\nI have experienced this sort of careless historical chauvinism personally. Three years ago, the radio talk show host Leonard Lopate (since removed for sexual harassment charges), while interviewing me about the 16th-century French Queen Catherine de' Medici, fatuously observed that Catherine was best known for having brought \"fine cuisine to France.\" Since Catherine de' Medici, who ruled for nearly three decades, was responsible for the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre at which thousands of French Protestants, known as Huguenots, were slaughtered in Paris, this was akin to saying that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's major achievement is importing a French chef to Damascus. I was shocked that he said this, but Lopate didn't seem embarrassed, because as an educated person he felt that if Catherine de' Medici had actually been a figure of real historical significance, he would surely have learned about her in school.\n\nI could list dozens of examples of women who have changed the course of western civilization, exercised real power, divided up Europe, restored the papacy to Rome, started major wars, ended major wars, conducted complex political and financial negotiations at the very top levels of government, and dictated political and economic policies that affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of their subjects. Yet hardly any of these women rate even two sentences in a textbook or as part of the core curriculum in an AP European history or university course, so they remain invisible.\n\nA good part of the reason for this is that we have allowed ourselves to be contented with the sop of parallel studies and a single month devoted to women's achievements. It takes the heat off conservative academics who think that female influence is overrated and that in any event there is no need to incorporate these figures further as a separate discipline exists to address this subject. So what looks like inclusion is actually exclusion.\n\nOf course, no scholar will go on record as not wanting to change a course to include women; and their feelings on the subject may well be subconscious, or unconsidered. But the survey courses and textbooks have not been changed to include female leadership (except for Elizabeth I), which means that there has been at best general ignorance or at worst deliberate omission. This is obvious from even the most cursory perusal of on-line college syllabuses and sample test questions for A.P. European history.\n\nWhen Women's History Month -- or Black History Month for that matter -- was initiated it was a necessary first step towards remedying inequality. But it has been over 30 years now and the achievements of powerful women of the distant past are still almost totally unrecognized. As Morgan Freeman said in a 2005 interview with Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes, \"I don't want a Black History Month. Black history is American history.\" That is exactly how I feel about Women's History Month. Women's history is world history.\n\nLike so many others, I have been inspired by the recent #MeToo and Time's Up movements. They are to today what feminism was to the 1970s. But they also show that we still have a long way to go, and part of that means rethinking how we teach history. We cannot hope to lay claim to the future if we don't start owning the past.",

                "title": "How Early Warnings About the Effect of Television on American Politics Came True",
                "body": "Edward Murrow as the host of 'See It Now' in the 1950s. John Springer Collection/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nWhen new technology or new economic innovations first emerge, smart people often sense where they might lead -- even though their most profound consequences might be decades away. Karl Marx wrote large volumes about the consequences of capitalism -- volumes that in many ways are still being vindicated -- when capitalism and industrialization were only just getting off the ground. Tocqueville did something similar in the 1830s about democracy, which at that time only really existed in the United States.\n\nIn the same way, the advent of television, in the 1950s and 1960s troubled a great many people who thought it would tend to debase public life. In 1958, Edward R. Murrow, the great newsman, warned that television threatened the nation's survival because it was using its power to distract the citizenry from painful realities. And more than 40 years ago my father, a civil servant and diplomat, who was then about 60, made a related remark. \"One of the things we feared about television,\" he said, \"was that it would produce a great demagogue. But apparently, such men lose their appeal when you see them up close.\"\n\nBoth of those fears seemed to be exaggerated at the time, because the customs and restraints that kept civilization and the American political system in place were still effective. Now however, decades later, the early warnings about the medium seem to be bearing fruit. The world of television has indeed taken over American political life, increasingly replacing political parties and local politics as the road to political power.\n\nDuring its first two dominant decades in American life, the 1950s and 1960s, television functioned within the consensus culture that had grown out of the era of the Second World War. Its situation comedies gave us typical families with which to identify, the laugh tracks taught us what was funny, and its news organizations gave us the facts in calm, stentorian tones, rarely questioning what the nation's political leadership was telling the people. No demagogue could use raw emotion to win the support of a whole major political party in those days because the people trusted the government.\n\nFissures caused by the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, sadly, broke up that postwar consensus, and in the presidential election of 1968 a regionally based demagogue, George Wallace, managed to carry five states and 13.5% of the popular vote. The major parties managed to re-absorb his votes during the next three elections, but meanwhile, television was demonstrating an ability to elevate its own stars above any political figures. Walter Cronkite reigned for many years as the most trusted man in America, while numerous sitcom stars occupied a far larger place in the American imagination than any U.S. governor or Senator.\n\nBy the 2000s, changes in television, including the end of the Fairness Doctrine that required equal time for different views, had opened up a new route to fame, power and influence. People like Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity became national figures and, eventually, powers within the Republican Party. Reality television opened the door for Americans who were neither newsmen nor actors, and Donald Trump took spectacular advantage of the medium to turn himself into a national hero on The Apprentice.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nMeanwhile, America's old political system was suffering from hardening of the arteries. Two major paths to the White House emerged in recent decades. One was to become Vice President, the way followed, with more or less success, by men ranging from Richard Nixon to Al Gore. The second was to be closely related to a former President, as was the case for George W. Bush or Hillary Rodham Clinton. Both these routes gave candidates connections to the party's leading donors and national name recognition. The older method of becoming a national candidate through a distinguished record of public service was falling rapidly out of fashion.\n\nDonald Trump followed a new, third path. His nomination and election in 2016 confirmed the early predictions about television's power. Trump had connected with tens of millions of his fellow citizens on The Apprentice, while both of the favored candidates of the two major parties -- Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton -- had built political careers and reached the threshold of the White House thanks in large part to their family connections. Although the general election was quite close, neither party's traditional procedures produced a candidate who could defeat Trump. The least experienced candidate in American history was elected President in November 2016. No matter what one thinks of the President, it's hard to argue with the idea that he fulfilled the early predictions that television would help those who might qualify as demagogues, people who use popular prejudices to gain power.\n\nThe impact of the cable-TV-dominated culture, moreover, has continued to grow during Trump's presidency. The President's tweeted insults of not only of his opponents but also his own subordinates has been widely compared to reality television, and the news focuses on the revolving door for White House operatives and leaked predictions of one another's departure. And, even among those who don't admire Trump, the idea of non-political celebrity candidates has gotten more, not less, popular in his wake, as illustrated by the Oprah presidential boomlet, Cynthia Nixon's candidacy for governor of New York, and talk of Tom Hanks as a possible candidate. Last but not least, the world of cable television is making new inroads into Trump's government. Now that Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn has left the Administration over the decision to impose tariffs, his place as Chief Economic Adviser will be taken by Larry Kudlow, long a fixture at CNBC. In the same week, Heather Nauert of Fox and Friends, one of the President's favorite shows, was named Undersecretary of State for Public Affairs.\n\nThe United States began as an attempt to create a new political reality based on certain ideals. It renewed itself in the service of different ideas during the Civil War era and again in the era of the Depression and the New Deal. Now, once again, the old order has atrophied. Television did not cause the breakup of the old political system, but it stepped into the void. It is hard to see how any of today's new media will help restore a new national consensus.",

                "title": "This KGB Chief Rang the Alarm About Russia-U.S. Cyberwars. No One Listened.",
                "body": "In the late 1980s, when he helped oversee information security at the KGB, Vladimir Rubanov already had a grasp of what cyber wars would look like in the future -- and they terrified him.\n\nThe Americans had far surpassed the Russians by then in most types of technology, not least with the invention of the internet and the personal computer. At the KGB headquarters and other facilities around Moscow, Rubanov had a chance to study these machines -- slow, ugly and cumbersome things by today's standards, but still advanced enough for him to realize their potential in everything his agency did best: subversion, sabotage, intelligence gathering.\n\n\"From the very beginning it was clear,\" he tells TIME by phone from Moscow, where he now works mostly in the private sector. \"We told our people, 'Look, the public may not realize yet what's going on. But we need to raise the alarm on a political level, because this stuff is a danger to our vital infrastructure.'\"\n\nThe tables appear to have turned since then. The vital infrastructure now at risk is in the U.S., according to a March 15 report from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which found that Russian hackers had penetrated deep into the control rooms of U.S. power stations, putting a finger on the light switch of American homes. \"Since at least March 2016,\" the report states, \"Russian government cyber actors...targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors.\"\n\nThese were precisely the sorts of attacks that Rubanov had feared from the Americans. He wouldn't comment on whether Russia was in fact responsible this time; his old habits of discretion die hard, and he still serves as an occasional adviser to the Russian government. But he did note, with a tone of regret rather than self-satisfaction, that the Americans should have listened to his warnings two decades ago.\n\nAfter the KGB was dissolved in 1991 along with the rest of the Soviet Union, Rubanov went to serve on the Kremlin's Security Council, where he was also in charge of information security. He soon got to work, along with some colleagues at the Foreign Ministry and other agencies, on drafting rules of engagement for cyber space -- a \"code of conduct\" of the type that governs the use of nuclear and chemical weapons.\n\n\"The point was to have a kind of non-aggression pact in the cyber sphere, one that would prohibit such attacks against sovereign nations,\" he says. Their hope was that these rules would eventually be adopted by the United Nations and become international law. But the effort stalled, says Rubanov, in large part because the world's last remaining superpower wasn't interested. \"Each country wants to have guarantees of security, but it does not want to extend those guarantees to others. So this is where we ended up. In a place where no one is safe.\"\n\nSoon after Vladimir Putin took office in 2000, Russia's cyber strategy got an overhaul. The new doctrine on information security that Putin signed at the end of that year did not explicitly blame the U.S. for menacing Russia. But the implication was clear when document referred to the \"desire of some countries to dominate and infringe the interest of Russia in the global information space.\"\n\nA reputed technophobe, Putin had always been mistrustful of the Internet, which he has called a \"CIA project.\" And like many of Russia's spy chiefs, he feared that microchips and operating systems imported from the U.S. were designed to function as secret tools of American sabotage, surveillance or both. But there was little he could do about it. In the field of cyber weaponry, \"Russian generals felt they were losing the global arms race,\" Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan wrote in their recent book, The Red Web, a history of Russian cyber policy. So instead of trying to match American technology, Russia tried using diplomacy \"to put some limits on the United States' offensive capabilities.\"\n\nThese limits would have amounted to cyber disarmament. As outlined in 2009 by one of Rubanov's successor at the Security Council, Vladislav Sherstyuk, Russia wanted a ban on cyber implants, which can act as remote-controlled bombs inside an enemy's computer networks; a ban on the use of deception to hide the source of an attack; and, a rule that would extend humanitarian law into cyber space, effectively banning attacks on civilian targets like banks, hospitals or power stations.\n\nBut the Kremlin did not have the leverage to get broad support for such a deal during the first half of Putin's tenure. In virtually all areas of digital technology, Russia still lagged far behind the U.S., and it was hopelessly dependent on foreign imports even when it came to satellite navigation for its military. Despite Putin's wish to be treated like the leader of a superpower, Russia's technological backwardness forced his diplomats to continue asking the U.S. for a peace accord in cyber space.\n\nU.S. officials described one of these overtures in a cable dated March 2009, and despite the reserved tone of the document, it seems to suggest that the Russians were practically groveling. Andrey Krutskikh, the head of the delegation from Moscow, \"gave a long monologue about how he thought the U.S. and Russia could work together in the area of cyber security,\" the cable states, according to a copy published the following year by Wikileaks. \"He said that Russia was willing to demonstrate flexibility and 'listen to the American experience.'\"\n\nThe U.S. side was unimpressed. Michele Markoff, then the acting chief of cyber affairs at the State Department, told the Russians that cyber threats could not be \"usefully addressed by traditional arms control-type constraints.\" According to the cable, she noted that it would be \"meaningless\" to restrict the cyber arsenals of nation states, because they would still be able to use \"proxies\" to conduct their attacks in secret. The best way for Russia to deal with its concerns, Markoff suggested, would be to build up its own defenses. In other words, prepare for war.\n\nPutin has done exactly that. Over the last five years, his armed forces have raced to close the gap with the U.S. in cyber defenses. Russia's Defense Ministry and its main intelligence agency, the FSB, have both established new units devoted to this task since 2013. During a televised interview that year, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu expressed awe at the power of what he called the new \"weapons of mass destruction\" in cyber space. \"They can stop the water supply in major cities,\" he said. \"They can turn off the electricity. They can block the sewer systems.\"\n\nUnder Shoigu, who took up his post in 2012, the Russian military has set up new \"scientific squadrons\" to recruit computer programmers from around the country, giving them much higher salaries and better living conditions than most other branches of the Russian armed forces. The results of such efforts have been impressive. As James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence under the Obama Administration, told the Senate in early 2015: \"The Russian cyber threat is more severe than we had previously assessed.\"\n\nThat was putting it mildly. By the fall of that year, the U.S. and its allies in NATO had seen a barrage of attacks attributed to Russia's new cyber forces. Among the reported targets in 2015 alone were the White House, the U.S. House of Representatives, a German steel plant, the Polish stock exchange, a French TV channel and the New York Times. The Russian cyber operation to sway the U.S. presidential race was up and running by the end of that year, and according to U.S. intelligence assessments, it involved hackers working both for the Russian Defense Ministry and the FSB.\n\nAs details of those intrusions have emerged over the past year and a half, some American officials and experts have come around to the idea of an international agreement on the rules of cyber war. \"We went through a couple decades of essentially Wild West in this area,\" Aston Carter, who served as Secretary of Defense during Obama's second term, told a panel hosted by TIME in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos. As the discussion turned to the need for a \"Digital Geneva Convention,\" Carter said, \"Norms and rules do matter. They define when a transgression has occurred, and they create at least potentially the possibility for collective response. I'm all for that.\"\n\nBut Russia isn't so sure anymore. As its own cyber arsenal has grown in strength, the Russian government has cooled on the idea of letting international law constrain it. One of the ironies of this apparent role reversal between the U.S. and Russia has been the position of Michele Markoff, the State Department official who essentially told the Russians to get lost when they pleaded with her for cyber disarmament in 2009.\n\nHer more recent efforts at the U.N. have focused on much the same goal: getting international laws to apply to cyber conflict, including humanitarian laws that could ban attacks on civilian targets. But Russia has reportedly stood in her way. Last summer, when the talks on this issue broke down, Markoff wrote an impassioned complaint against the states that do as they please in cyberspace, \"with no limits or constraints on their actions.\" She continued: \"That is a dangerous and unsupportable view, and it is one that I unequivocally reject.\"\n\nRubanov rejects it, too. But in Moscow his voice no longer counts for much. The men who sit on the Security Council today are mostly inclined to see the tools of cyber warfare as a cheap and effective way of hurting an enemy. They are not likely to give up those tools, especially since there is no treaty prohibiting them. \"If we had that document, and enough trust to verify compliance, we would be a lot better off,\" says Rubanov. Now he fears it's way too late.",

The largest such repository, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, has amassed so much plastic pollution that if it was heaped together it would amount to twice the size of Texas, according to research by Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch nonprofit.\n\nAfter a three-year study, Ocean Cleanup found the amount of plastic amassing in the Pacific could be as much as 16 times higher than previously reported. Trawling the seas for floating plastic waste, the research team retrieved bottle caps, discarded fishing nets, toys and degrading containers. The 80,000 tons of litter estimated to have gathered in the patch translates to 250 discarded pieces per person around the world.\n\n\"Plastic concentration is increasing -- I think the situation is getting worse,\" Laurent Lebreton, an oceanographer at Ocean Cleanup, told the BBC.\n\nSince plastic degrades into smaller and smaller pieces, the waste afloat in the Pacific may end up breaking down into many more bits of potentially harmful microplastics. These tiny particles of plastic smaller than the width of a human hair already account for 8% of the total debris, and could increase to 50 trillion particles, the study says. High levels of microplastics have already been found in the stomachs of fish for sale at supermarkets. It's unclear what affect ingesting microplastics may have on humans.\n\nOcean Cleanup called for urgently stopping the new inflow of plastic waste, and removing \"the existing mess accumulating in the environment.\" The organization estimates it could reduce the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by 50% in just 5 years.",

                "title": "Congress Approves $1.3 Trillion Budget, Averting Shutdown",
                "body": "(WASHINGTON) -- Congress gave final approval Friday to a giant $1.3 trillion spending bill that ends the budget battles for now, but only after late obstacles skirted close to another shutdown as conservatives objected to big outlays on Democratic priorities at a time when Republicans control the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate passage shortly after midnight averted a third federal shutdown this year, an outcome both parties wanted to avoid. But in crafting a sweeping deal that busts budget caps, they've stirred conservative opposition and set the contours for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe House easily approved the measure Thursday, 256-167, a bipartisan tally that underscored the popularity of the compromise, which funds the government through September. It beefs up military and domestic programs, delivering federal funds to every corner of the country.\n\nBut action stalled in the Senate, as conservatives ran the clock in protest. Then, an unusual glitch arose when Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, wanted to remove a provision to rename a forest in his home state after the late Cecil Andrus, a four-term Democratic governor.\n\nAt one point, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., stepped forward to declare the entire late-night scene \"ridiculous. It's juvenile.\"\n\nOnce the opponents relented, the Senate began voting, clearing the package by a 65-32 vote a full day before Friday's midnight deadline to fund the government.\n\n\"Shame, shame. A pox on both Houses - and parties,\" tweeted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who spent the afternoon tweeting details found in the 2,200-page bill that was released the night before. \"No one has read it. Congress is broken.\"\n\nPaul said later he knew he could only delay, but not stop, the outcome and had made his point.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill was supposed to be an antidote to the stopgap measures Congress has been forced to pass -- five in this fiscal year alone -- to keep government temporarily running amid partisan fiscal disputes.\n\nLeaders delivered on President Donald Trump's top priorities of boosting Pentagon coffers and starting work his promised border wall, while compromising with Democrats on funds for road building, child care development, fighting the opioid crisis and more.\n\nBut the result has been unimaginable to many Republicans after campaigning on spending restraints and balanced budgets. Along with the recent GOP tax cuts law, the bill that stood a foot tall at some lawmakers' desks ushers in the return of $1 trillion deficits.\n\nTrump only reluctantly backed the bill he would have to sign, according to Republican lawmakers and aides, who acknowledged the deal involved necessary trade-offs for the Democratic votes that were needed for passage despite their majority lock on Congress.\n\n\"Obviously he doesn't like this process -- it's dangerous to put it up to the 11th hour like this,\" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., who opposes the bill and speaks regularly to Trump. \"The president, and our leadership, and the leadership in the House got together and said, Look, we don't like what the Democrats are doing, we got to fund the government.\"\n\nWhite House legislative director Marc Short framed it as a compromise. \"I can't sit here and tell you and your viewers that we love everything in the bill,\" he said on Fox. \"But we think that we got many of our priorities funded.\"\n\nTrying to smooth over differences, Republican leaders focused on military increases that were once core to the party's brand as guardians of national security.\n\n\"Vote yes for our military. Vote yes for the safety and the security of this country,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., ahead of voting.\n\nBut even that remained a hard sell. In all, 90 House Republicans, including many from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, voted against the bill, as did two dozen Republicans in the Senate.\n\nIt was a sign of the entrenched GOP divisions that have made leadership's job controlling the majority difficult. They will likely repeat on the next budget battle in fall.\n\nDemocrats faced their own divisions, particularly after failing to resolve the stalemate over shielding young Dreamer immigrants from deportation as Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has left it for the courts to decide.\n\nInstead, Trump won $1.6 billion to begin building and replacing segments of the wall along the border with Mexico. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus opposed the bill.\n\nAlso missing from the package was a renewal of federal insurance subsidies to curb premium costs on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Trump ended some of those payments as part of his effort to scuttle President Barack Obama's health care law, but Republicans have joined Democrats in trying to revive them.\n\nBipartisan efforts to restore the subsidies, and provide additional help for insurance carriers, foundered over disagreements on how tight abortion restrictions should be on using the money for private insurance plans. Senate Republicans made a last-ditch effort to tuck the insurance provisions into the bill, but Democrats refused to yield on abortion restrictions.\n\nStill, Democrats were beyond pleased with the outcome. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., chronicled the party's many gains, and noted they could have just have easily withheld votes Republicans needed to avert another shutdown.\n\n\"We chose to use our leverage to help this bill pass,\" Pelosi said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said as the minority party in Congress, \"We feel good.\" He added, \"We produced a darn good bill.\"",

                "body": "Never fearing a fight, John Bolton's decades-long resume in government has been defined by a distaste for treaties, contempt for diplomatic niceties and an ambivalence for the need to get along.\n\nHis deep-seated belief to maintain a hard-line approach toward adversaries once inspired his colleagues to give him a bronze-plated hand grenade as a trophy to celebrate his reputation as a bomb thrower. Bolton for years proudly displayed it on a coffee table in his Washington office.\n\nNow he will help shape the next phase of foreign policy as President Donald Trump's next national security advisor at one of the more tumultuous times in recent American history.\n\n\"It's always an honor to serve our country, and I think, particularly, in these times, internationally, it's a particular honor,\" Bolton said in an interview on Fox News, where was a frequent a contributor.\n\nThe latest shake-up at the White House is likely to have an immediate impact, particularly on North Korea and Iran. Bolton has made the public case to go to war with both nations for years and has routinely excoriated their leadership. Pyongyang responded once by calling Bolton \"human scum.\"\n\nFears abound in Washington that Trump is filling his Cabinet with like-minded people who will echo the President's most pessimistic views back to him. Bolton is an unabashed hawk likely to embrace the president's \"America First\" agenda that has at times undercut many of country's longstanding global alliances. His views align with like newly nominated Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who still is awaiting Congressional confirmation after last week's dismissal of Rex Tillerson.\n\n\"It's hard to escape the disquieting conclusion that the mass exodus of the 'adults' from this Administration is putting our nation's security at risk,\" Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a tweet. \"Ambassador Bolton's hawkish and conspiratorial thinking will only make matters dangerously worse.\"\n\nBolton, a Yale-educated Baltimore native and former senior State Department official, spent more than two decades in and out of government, but rose to prominence as a lawyer representing President George W. Bush during the Florida recount in 2000. That sign of loyalty ultimately led to a nearly two-year stint U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBut Bolton has never been one to quietly follow orders. In 1994, he declared that if the 39-floor U.N. headquarters in New York City \"lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\n\nPerhaps most famously, in 2003, Bolton delivered a speech denouncing then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il as the \"tyrannical dictator\" of North Korea where \"life is a hellish nightmare\" just as the so-called six-party talks were about to begin to discuss dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear-weapons program.\n\nAnd so it is somewhat of a surprise in Washington and in foreign capitals that Trump named Bolton to such a prominent position in the Administration. The president is on track to meet current North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il's son, to discuss the possible nuclear disarmament.\n\nBolton, meanwhile, has continued to reiterate his distaste for diplomacy with North Korea. In January, he said that talking with them was a \"waste of time.\" Most recently, he wrote an p-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\"\n\nBolton has also repeatedly questioned the multilateral deal signed during the Obama Administration under which Iran suspended its nuclear program. Trump promised to decertify it in May unless changes aren't made.\n\n\"No fix will remedy the diplomatic Waterloo Mr. Obama negotiated,\" Bolton wrote in the Wall Street Journal in January. \"Mr. Trump correctly sees Mr. Obama's deal as a massive strategic blunder, but his advisers have inexplicably persuaded him not to withdraw.\"\n\nIf Trump undoes the nuclear deal with Iran, analysts fear that Tehran will sprint for a weapon. Its regional arch-rival Saudi Arabia would work to acquire its own nuclear weapon, setting off a 21st century arms race in a dangerous part of the globe.\n\n\"Taking hardline stances in op-ed pages is all good and well, but reality begins to set in once you're briefed on military plans,\" said Anthony Cordesman, a former intelligence official at the Pentagon now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\n\"The fact is that he is not alone in shaping these decisions,\" he said. \"There's a new team coming into place and they will redefine each other's views over time.\"\n\nBolton replaces H.R. McMaster, an Army lieutenant general who plans to retire from the military. McMaster was a revered military officer, who enjoyed support from Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis when Trump's first national security adviser retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was driven from his post due to the ongoing Russia scandal.\n\nTrump and McMaster never had a close relationship and have been discussing McMaster's departure for some time, said a White House official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Amid constant speculation, the timeline was expedited for his ouster. McMaster will stay on to ensure a transition for Bolton to take over by April 9.\n\nIn an interview told Fox News, Bolton said Thursday that he never has been shy about what his views are, but that's behind him.\n\n\"Bolton is very hard line, but he is smart and thoughtful -- not impulsive,\" said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. \"I am worried, but there is some hope.\"",

                "title": "Donald Trump Just Hired John Bolton. Here's Why That Makes Some Nervous",
                "body": "By 9 p.m. on Thursday, the spacious West Wing corner office of National Security Advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster sat empty, the door open, the blinds undrawn, pale blue papers on the desk bearing messages from world capitals, unanswered. For White House staffers already on edge after a week of tumultuous personnel and policy change driven by President Donald Trump, the scene represented an ominous calm before the latest, most worrying disruption at the top of American government.\n\nTwo hours earlier, Trump had announced on Twitter that he would be replacing McMaster, a temperate, soldier-scholar who had closely hewed to the traditional role of \"honest broker\" in reconciling the often competing agendas of the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon, among other foreign and national security agencies in the U.S. government. McMaster would be replaced, Trump tweeted, with the firebrand diplomat and Fox News personality, Amb. John Bolton, a hawkish interventionist with fixed opinions and set agendas.\n\nBolton will not officially start in the job until April 9, but already moderates in the West Wing are worried. Bolton famously couldn't win permanent Senate confirmation as Ambassador to the U.N. in 2005, when he was nominated to the position by then-President George W. Bush. He had been criticized by Democrats and some moderate Republicans for intemperance after several witnesses testified to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that Bolton had harassed and bullied them. Several floor votes failed to override a Democratic filibuster of his nomination, before he was appointed in recess to the post by Bush.\n\nBut more important, he seemed ill-suited for the role of interagency arbiter. \"John Bolton does not have a reputation for consensus building within the administration or with allies,\" says Michael Green, a senior Asia advisor in Bush's NSC, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Rather, Green says, Bolton has \"a reputation for being an aggressive advocate of his (or in this case the President's) position. The best national security advisors are usually considered honest brokers, so that would be a different approach from his past M.O., but perhaps one he recognizes is necessary. We'll have to see\"\n\nThe record of national security advisors with strong agendas is mixed. Henry Kissinger was successful, though controversial, in the role. Ronald Reagan's National Security Advisor John Poindexter was convicted of multiple felonies after running a covert operation out of the National Security Council without the knowledge of Congress or other agencies of government. In recent history, Brent Scowcroft is viewed as the most successful holder of the job, thanks to his scrupulous representation to the president of all the views of his national security team, however conflicted.\n\nIn previous positions in Republican administrations, Bolton has typically played the role of advocate rather than arbiter. He pushed hard for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, though he argued in favor of leaving the country to rebuild on its own rather than trying to establish democracy there. He is particularly hawkish on Iran and North Korea.\n\nThat will make already nervous allies even more uneasy, says Green. \"He is a smart, relentless and often effective advocate for his point of view,\" Green says, \"But he is also seen as more of a bomb thrower than consensus builder and he has advocated the more extreme versions of Trump foreign policy, including military force against North Korea and ending the Iran deal, and this will make allies very nervous. At the U.N., he became more diplomatic and it will be interesting to see how he grows into this role.\"\n\nWhile Bolton's reputation for stubborn opinions worries some West Wing staffers, any internal disputes it stirs among agencies will fit with the President's approach to governing. Especially in recent days, the president has preferred disorder and drama over reliability and steadiness. With Bolton in charge of the massive national security decision making apparatus in the White House, Trump may get more drama than he bargained for.",

McMaster with Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who makes regular appearances on Fox News.\n\nSince it was started in 2014, the John Bolton Super PAC has spent millions on independent expenditures for Republican candidates such as Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and against Democrats such as New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan. A recent press release stated it hoped to increase that spending in 2018.\n\nThe super PAC was also among the first clients for Cambridge Analytica, which was suspended by Facebook this week for its handling of data. According to a report in the New York Times and the Observer of London, the firm culled personal data from more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission.\n\nRead More: Cambridge Analytica's Data Was Either Valuable or Totally Worthless\n\nThe report and a hidden video from a British news channel which showed the firm's CEO discussing using bribes and entrapment against public officials have led to major criticism. Facebook suspended the firm this week, and special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly interested in the firm's activities, according to ABC News.\n\nBolton's connection to Cambridge Analytica may have come through Robert Mercer, a billionaire conservative donor who is a major investor in the firm as well as the largest donor to the John Bolton Super PAC.\n\nBut Bolton will probably not face questions on Capitol Hill anytime soon about his ties, as the position of national security advisor does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nNeither Bolton, the White House nor the National Security Council responded to requests for comment on the connection with Cambridge Analytica Thursday evening.",

                "body": "(LOS ANGELES) -- A former Playboy model apologized to First Lady Melania Trump for a 10-month affair she claims she had with President Donald Trump that started with him offering her money after the first time they had sex.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper that aired Thursday night, McDougal said Trump tried to pay her after their first sexual tryst at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006.\n\n\"Well, after we had been intimate, he, he tried to pay me. And I actually didn't know how to take that,\" she said. \"But I looked at him and I said, 'That's not me. I'm not that kind of girl.'\"\n\nShe cried on the way home and didn't think she would see him again, but agreed to go on other dates with him after he called her back, she said. McDougal repeatedly described Trump as \"very charming\" and \"sweet.\"\n\nMcDougal said she continued the relationship with Trump for about 10 months and broke it off in April 2007 because she felt guilty. She recalled traveling to meet Trump at his properties in New York, New Jersey and California and said she had sex with him \"many dozens of times.\"\n\nMcDougal had feelings for Trump, but the affair was \"just tearing me apart,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a real relationship there. There were real feelings,\" she said. \"He would call me baby or he would call me beautiful Karen.\"\n\nTrump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005, and their son, Barron, was born in 2006.\n\nSpeaking to CNN -- which her attorney has said would be her only interview about the relationship -- McDougal apologized when she was asked what she would say to First Lady Melania Trump.\n\n\"What can you say except, I'm sorry?\" McDougal said. \"I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me.\"\n\nMcDougal said she never wanted to discuss her relationship and repeatedly rebuffed inquiries from reporters about the alleged affair. But after the story became public, she wanted to get out and tell her side of what happened, she said.\n\nThe White House has said Trump denies having an affair with McDougal and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the interview Thursday night.\n\nOn Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which she said paid her $150,000 during the presidential campaign for the rights to her story of an affair, but never ran the story.\n\nMcDougal's lawsuit, which asks a judge to invalidate the contract, alleges that Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, was secretly involved in her discussions with the tabloid's parent company, American Media, Inc.\n\nThe company has said that McDougal has been allowed to speak about her relationship since 2016 and the contract gave them discretion over whether to publish the story.",

                "body": "(BEIJING) -- China announced a list of U.S. goods including pork, apples and steel pipe on Friday on which it might raise tariffs in an escalating trade dispute with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry called on Washington to negotiate a settlement to the conflict over higher U.S. import duties on steel and aluminum but set no deadline.Beijing's move appeared to be a calculated step aimed at increasing domestic American pressure on Trump by making clear which exporters, especially farming areas that supported the president in the 2016 election, might be hurt.\n\nThe dispute has weighed on global financial markets amid concern it could spiral into a damaging round of retaliatory import controls by governments worldwide.\n\nThe higher American duties on aluminum and steel have little impact on China, which exports only a small amount of those products to the United States. But private sector analysts have said Beijing would feel obligated to take action to avoid looking weak in a high-profile dispute.\n\nThe country's top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, earlier appealed to Washington to \"act rationally\" and said, \"we don't want to see a trade war.\"\n\nThe Commerce Ministry said the higher U.S. tariffs \"seriously undermine\" the global trading system. It rejected Trump's contention they are needed to protect U.S. national security.\n\n\"The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to resolve the concerns of the Chinese side as soon as possible,\" the ministry said. It appealed for dialogue \"to avoid damage to overall Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\"\n\nBeijing reported a trade surplus of $275.8 billion with the United States last year, or two-thirds of its global total. Washington reports different figures that put the gap at a record $375.2 billion.\n\nU.S. authorities also are investigating whether Beijing improperly compels foreign companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access, which could lead to still more trade penalties.\n\nGoods targeted for possible higher tariffs in Friday's list include pork and aluminum scrap. They would receive a 25 percent duty increase, mirroring Trump's 25 percent tariff hike for steel.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry said China bought about $2 billion worth of those goods last year.\n\nA second list targeted for 15 percent duties, the level of Trump's charge on aluminum, includes wine, apples, ethanol and stainless steel pipe. The ministry said Chinese purchases of those goods last year were about $1 billion.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Chinese premier promised at a news conference that Beijing will \"open even wider\" to imports and investment as part of efforts to make its economy more productive.\n\nLi said that included eliminating tariffs on drug imports. But he gave no other details and it was unclear whether the planned changes might mollify Washington, the European Union and other trading partners that complain China improperly blocks access to its markets and subsidizes exports.",

                "body": "A teenage girl who was shot when a classmate opened fire inside their Maryland high school is brain dead and is being removed from life support, her mother said Thursday.\n\nMelissa Willey told news reporters Thursday night that her daughter, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey has \"no life left in her.\" She said Jaelynn would be removed from life support during the evening, by the family's decision.\n\nThe mother, holding a young baby, said, \"On Tuesday ... our lives changed completely and totally forever. My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives.\"\n\nThe teen was shot Tuesday by 17-year-old Austin Rollins at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County.\n\nRollins died after shooting Willey. A school resource officer got there within a minute and fired a shot at Rollins, but it's not yet clear whether Rollins was killed by the officer's bullet or took his own life.\n\nThe St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday Rollins and the girl had been in a relationship that recently ended.\n\n\"All indications suggest the shooting was not a random act of violence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nWilley had been in critical condition at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center. A fundraising page to help her family has raised more than $59,000.\n\nJaelynn was one of nine siblings, her mother said, and a member of the swim team.\n\nThe shooting broke out just before classes were to begin Tuesday, according to the sheriff's office, which said the gun used belonged to Rollins' father.\n\nA 14-year-old boy who was shot in the thigh during the encounter was released Wednesday from a hospital.\n\nIn an email Thursday to The Associated Press, his mother, Kimberly Dennis, said her family is \"eternally grateful\" that her son, Desmond Barnes, is \"alive, doing well and in good spirits.\"\n\nShe expressed sympathy for Willey and her family and added, \"We are also praying for the entire Great Mills High School family and young people around this country. As a community and nation, we must continue to work and fight for a world that is safe for our children.\n\nGreat Mills High School has about 1,600 students and is near the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) southeast of Washington.\n\nSt. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron credited Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill with preventing any more loss of life.\n\nCameron said Gaskill, a six-year veteran with SWAT team training, responded within a minute and fired his weapon simultaneously with a final shot fired by Rollins. The officer was unharmed.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said the Glock handgun used in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins' father. In Maryland it is illegal for anyone under age 21 to possess a handgun unless it is required for their employment.",

                "body": "As Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said goodbye on Thursday, he urged State Department employees to stay honest and be kind to one another, despite their \"mean-spirited town.\"\n\nAfter imploring his staff to continue doing their duties, Tillerson issued a warning: \"Never lose sight of your most valuable asset, the most valuable asset you possess: your personal integrity,\" he said in his farewell speech.\n\nThe short talk reflected Tillerson's tumultuous time in office. President Donald Trump fired the former Exxon CEO on March 13, barely one year after he was confirmed. Tillerson officially learned that he was being replaced through a tweet from the President.\n\nTillerson will remain Secretary of State until March 31, according to the Washington Post, but has already handed over day-to-day operations to his deputy, John Sullivan.\n\nThroughout his time at the State Department, Tillerson had a strained relationship with Trump, starting with his own reluctance to take the position and continuing through the President publicly criticizing him a number of times in recent months. Still, Tillerson insisted earlier this year that he would not be leaving and told CNN he intended to stay through the end of 2018.\n\nAfter his firing, the Daily Beast reported that Chief of Staff John Kelly had told Tillerson about Trump's tweet while the Secretary of State was on the toilet, a story that for many seemed to represent the devolving relationship between Tillerson and the White House. Tillerson's final speech on Thursday remained restrained, but he did tell his staff to rise above Washington gossip and antics.\n\n\"In these times, your continued diligence and devotion to the State Department's mission has never been more necessary,\" he said. \"As you go about your duties, each of you carrying out your individual responsibilities as well as your collective duty, it is my hope that you will be guided by and test your actions each day against the values that we have spoken about over this past year.\"\n\nTillerson also reminded staffers that their integrity is something others in the administration cannot take away. \"Only you can relinquish it or allow it to be compromised. Once you've done so it is very, very hard to regain it,\" he said during the speech.\n\n\"In closing I'd like to ask that each of you undertake to ensure one act of kindness each day towards another person. This can be a very mean-spirited town,\" he added. \"But you don't have to choose to participate in that. Each of us get to choose the person we want to be, and the way we want to be treated, and the way we will treat others.\"",

                "title": "What to Know About John Bolton, President Trump's New National Security Advisor",
                "body": "National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster will soon be the latest White House official to leave the Trump administration, President Donald Trump announced via Twitter Thursday night.\n\nMcMaster, who was brought in last year to help stabilize the Trump administration in the wake of Michael Flynn's firing, will be replaced by John Bolton. McMaster will stay on until April 9 to help with the transition, at which point Bolton will officially take office.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Bolton as he prepares to advise the President.\n\nKnown as a hardline interventionist, Bolton served as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush. He was floated for a number of foreign policy jobs before Trump took office, including the position of Secretary of State, but ultimately stayed an unofficial Trump fan until now.\n\nBolton has long been a presence on Fox News, and in recent months, has been widely rumored as the frontrunner for the National Security Advisor position. He has also been meeting regularly with Trump to discuss foreign policy, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhile this switch is just the latest in a recent series of firings and resignations at the White House, the Times reports that McMaster's departure was amicable. Trump's goal, according to the paper, was to put in place a new national security team before he meets with North Korea's Kim Jong-un this spring.\n\nThe choice of Bolton as National Security Advisor had many observers worried on Thursday, as he has been known for his blunt, and often extreme, comments. He has recently suggested the U.S. attack both Iran and North Korea, for example, and in the past has made comments such as saying \"there is no United Nations\" during a 1994 speech.\n\nWhen he worked in the Bush administration as undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, Bolton pushed for the Iraq war and said he was \"confident\" that Saddam Hussein had \"hidden weapons of mass destruction,\" according to the BBC. Senators from both parties objected to Bolton's appointment as U.N. ambassador in 2005, according to the New York Times, and Bush had to go around them to install him in the position.\n\nBolton has also been linked to anti-Islam organizations and has pushed an anti-Muslim conspiracy theory, according to BuzzFeed News.\n\nIn 2016, Bolton spoke at the conference of the American Freedom Alliance, which says it \"promotes, defends and upholds Western values and ideals\" and has been labeled a \"hate group\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center. There, he joked that President Obama was a Muslim. During his speech while talking about Muslim countries, Bolton said: \"King Abdullah of Jordan, who is not simply a Muslim king of a Muslim country, unlike our president,\" which got him a boisterous round of laughter from the audience.\n\nStill, Bolton has been around the Trump administration for months. In December, Press Secretary Sarah Hauckabee Sanders said Bolton was a \"friend of the President\" and that his presence at the White House was \"nothing more than a check in and a friendly visit.\"\n\nTwitter users have long had fun at the expense of Bolton's distinctive bushy mustache -- but not Trump. And with the hiring of Bolton, one of the biggest questions the Internet had was whether Bolton's facial hair would also work in the West Wing.\n\nThe absurd interest in Bolton's personal style stems from a late 2016 Washington Post report that aides said Trump wanted Bolton to join the administration after he was elected, but the President could not deal with Bolton's mustache.\n\nGiven Bolton's hardline stance on foreign policy and the unique look he has cultivated, it seemed unlikely on Thursday that he would be shaving simply to take a position in the White House. Still, some Twitter users had fun speculating about the outcome of the 'stache.",

HB3026 would outlaw that possibility and require parents to secure children under the age of 14 with seat belts.\n\nState Representative Emily Virgin wrote the bill that passed the House last week in a 51-41 vote, and state senator Ervin Yen said he will introduce it to the Senate. He said he was surprised to hear kids could ride in adult seats without safety measures.\n\n\"I said what? That's crazy! How did that happen? I don't know.

It also comes after someone at the White House leaked that Trump was urged in briefing documents not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin about his recent re-election win. Trump did it anyway.\n\nIn a statement released by the White House, McMaster said he would be requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer, adding that afterward he \"will leave public service.\"\n\nMcMaster was brought in after Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was dismissed because he did not tell White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the full extent of his contacts with Russian officials.\n\nThe White House said McMaster's exit had been under discussion for some time and stressed it was not due to any one incident.\n\nBolton, probably the most divisive foreign policy expert ever to serve as U.N. ambassador, has served as a hawkish voice in Republican foreign policy circles for decades. He met with Trump and White House chief of staff John Kelly in early March to discuss North Korea and Iran. He was spotted entering the West Wing earlier Thursday.",

When the competition finished on Saturday, he and his teammates went out to a local bar, according to the New York Times. But the next morning, the team was scheduled to return to the United States and Dombroski never showed up.\n\nHis parents quickly reported him missing, and after police, locals and Dombroski's family searched for him, police on Monday found the 19-year-old's body at the bottom of an empty moat near a colonial-era fort.\n\nWhile Milroy said Thursday that Dombroski's injuries were consistent with a fall from a high point, Bermuda police superintendent Sean Field-Lament said his department would continue investigating the death.\n\n\"We'll do all our best efforts to get a clearer picture of what happened that morning,\" Field-Lament said, according to NBC News. \"There's nothing to indicate that he was pushed at this stage.\"\n\nThe police are working with the FBI to access Dombroski's cell phone, Field-Lament said, and they are still looking to speak with witnesses about the death.",

                "body": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange ( Spencer Platt -- Getty Images\n\nU.S. stocks tumbled the most in six weeks and Treasuries rallied as investors shifted focus from the Federal Reserve to the threat of an escalating trade war with China that has the potential to disrupt global growth.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 Index slumped the most since early February and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 700 points after President Donald Trump ordered tariffs on about $50 billion in Chinese goods. The 10-year Treasury yield slid toward 2.8 percent and the yen advanced as investors sought safe havens. The dollar rebounded.\n\n\"The market doesn't like trade wars, the market doesn't like that the Fed is adamant about raising rates,\" said Matt Schreiber, president and chief investment strategist at WBI Investments in Red Bank, New Jersey. \"Yes the economy has been pretty strong, the labor market has less slack, but there's nothing to really get fired up about and try to normalize rates to a level way above where we are.\"\n\nThe threat that a tit-for-tat trade spat with China will erupt and hamper global growth has investors on edge a day after the Fed sought to reassure markets that it's in no hurry to raise rates even as it lifted growth projections for the world's largest economy. Trump's first trade action directly aimed at China comes as policy makers including IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde warn of a global trade conflict that could undermine the broadest world recovery in years.\n\nStocks were also hit earlier when John Dowd resigned as Trump's lead attorney countering Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe as the inquiry into possible collusion in the 2016 election intensifies.\n\nFacebook Inc. helped pace a decline in the tech sector, falling 2.7 percent. This week's selloff in tech stocks is on pace to be the worst since early February. Other notable decliners Thursday included Accenture Plc and Micron Technology Inc.\n\nElsewhere, West Texas oil fluctuated before falling and the Australian dollar slipped after the country's unemployment rate climbed. The British pound initially jumped after the country's central bank voted 7-2 to maintain interest rates, but pared as investors digested comments from policy makers that weren't overtly hawkish.\n\nHere are some key events on the schedule for the remainder of this week:\n\nThe Bank of Russia's rate decision is on Friday. U.S. government funding is due to expire at the end of the day on Friday.\n\nAnd these are the main moves in markets:\n\nThe S&P 500 Index fell 2.5 percent as of 4:03 p.m. New York time, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.9 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 2.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.7 percent and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index dipped 1.5 percent, touching the lowest in 15 months. The MSCI Emerging Market Index fell 1.2 percent.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2 percent, rebounding from the largest drop since January. The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2318. The British pound dropped 0.2 percent to $1.4111. The Japanese yen rose 0.6 percent to 105.41 per dollar.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries fell six basis point to 2.82 percent. Germany's 10-year yield dropped six basis point to 0.53 percent, declining from the highest in more than a week. Britain's 10-year yield fell nine basis points to 1.44 percent.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude dropped 1.4 percent to $64.24 a barrel, easing from the highest in almost seven weeks. Gold fell 0.3 percent to $1,329.07 an ounce a day after the biggest rise since May 2017.",

                "title": "Poet Cleo Wade Shares How She Stays Inspired and Informed",
                "body": "If you want to know why Cleo Wade has become the poet of her generation, look no further than Instagram. Her 350,000-plus followers eagerly post shots of her affirmational poems with captions like \"Positive vibes only\" or the prayer hand and heart emojis. In fact, it's nearly impossible to scroll through any social media feed without seeing images of Wade's sage poetry, usually hand-written in her trademark all-caps style, or Wade herself, speaking about self-love during a TED talk or sharing her thoughts on social issues alongside celeb friends like Yara Shahidi.\n\n\"Be yourself. I love you like that.\"\n\n\"Don't let your old hurt get in the way of your new love.\"\n\n\"Stop worrying about what you should do -- get to work on what you can do.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples of the self-empowering phrases that are resonating with so many and have led Wade to be dubbed the \"Millennial Oprah.\"\n\nThe rising literary star has now released her first book, Heart Talk: Poetic Wisdom for a Better Life, and has some thoughts on why her voice fits so seamlessly into the current wave of feminism and the #MeToo era.\n\nHow do you view your role as an artist and an activist?\n\nAs Nina Simone says, an artist's job is to reflect the times. Right now, the words that are popping up on protest signs, the tops of graduation caps, Instagram and billboards, reflect a collective feelings. I think that activism is really organized storytelling and I tell stories through poetry and visual representation. So for me, as I was writing Heart Talk, I didn't want it to just look beautiful, I wanted it to be useful and a tool. Whenever I write anything, or make anything or put anything in a creative art installation, I ask myself, \"What does this do?\"\n\nHow do you think activism has changed and evolved in the age of social media?\n\nIt's so incredible how you are able to find your tribe and the people you believe in, but it's important to remember that the online world isn't the answer to connectivity, it's the launch pad. In terms of creating change, we do have to live beyond the click. It's not about invalidating connecting online, it's about furthering it.\n\nIt's important to make sure the balance is right, and that we are critically looking in the right place at the right time for the right connection in order to get things done in terms of activism.\n\nYou've been vocal in the past about practicing everyday activism -- how do you define that?\n\nI think it's important to define everyday activism with a spirit of flexibility. To me, activism is doing what you can with what you've got, and in your own way. You can always ask yourself, what do I have today, where am I today, and what can I do with it? Sometimes that can be making sure you ask your neighbor how they're doing, or it can be how you give your time or money to something. My advice for young people is to never let your inability to do everything get in the way of your ability to do something.\n\nHow we can ensure movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter create real change?\n\nSometimes, what ends up happening when moments feel dire is that we end up thinking that we need to reinvent the wheel. It's important to remember that even if you have an idea for how to change something or if you're just finding out about an issue, you need to identify the people who have been working towards fighting this problem for a long time, and find ways to amplify the cause and their messages.\n\nAfter Parkland, so many people were supporting Everytown, but there are so many black and brown people in inner cities who have been working to get guns out of the streets for a long time. So it's important that when we have our \"Aha!\" moments to dive deep into the issue, and find the people that have been and are doing the work.\n\nWhy do you think your poetry is striking a chord with so many people?\n\nPoetry has always held a special place in American culture. That's why President Kennedy invited Robert Frost to recite a poem at his inauguration. When we think about the movements that were happening in the 1960s, there's a parallel with what's happening now, and poetry plays an important role in these times.\n\nThere's been so much fear and uncertainty, especially with this last election, and people are looking for things, whether it's songs or poetry or the arts, to just help them. Art is important because you can't change laws or policy without first changing hearts and minds. And usually art can do the best job of that.\n\nDid you expect your words to inspire so many people?\n\nThere's a page in my book that says, if you give anyone or anything the ability to make you feel that you're on top of the world, you give it equal ability to make you feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders.\n\nEvery time I pick up a pen or a paintbrush, my promise to my audience is that no matter where you are or whatever you feel, know that I am looking for you, know that I'm writing for you, know that these words are for you. Then I have a promise that I keep to myself and to my life, which is to be a storyteller. I think there are three pillars of storytelling: bravery, authenticity and vulnerability and my promise to myself is to live in those three pillars.\n\nHow do you stay inspired?\n\nI'm inspired by people, whether that's my friends, my family, my neighbors or people I meet on the subway. I don't think you can be good at writing about feelings or emotions if you're not a good listener. So I try to have a really good practice of compassionate listening. It's what inspires my work the most, and where most of my work stems from.\n\nWhy is self-care and self-love so important?\n\nFirst we have to look at the interconnected relationship between self-care and self-love. I think most of us are looking for love from another being, but we have to remember that it's really, really difficult to find or give love without first learning how to love yourself. Self-care is what really fuels that. It is also what fuels our ability to love ourselves and others in a way that is faith-based and not fear-based.\n\nFor women now especially, we have more agency than we've ever had before. It's not just that the world is so exhausting, but we're also able to know ourselves more freely than any other generation before, and ask, \"What are my needs, really? How do I show care for myself, really?\"'",

                "body": "Emissions spew from a large stack at the coal fired Brandon Shores Power Plant, on March 9 in Baltimore\n\nEmissions of the primary pollutant that causes climate change increased to a record high in 2017 after three years of flatlining, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.\n\nRenewable deployment grew faster than other fuel, but the rapid investment in generation from clean energy sources like wind and solar was not enough to meet the massive demand that resulted from rapid global economic growth. Instead, energy users turned to fossil fuels to meet 70% of new demand.\n\nFatih Birol, who heads the IEA, said in a press release that the findings signal that current measure to fight climate change remain \"far from sufficient.\" The IEA projected earlier this month that oil demand will continue to grow in the coming years even as countries continue to push emissions reductions and energy efficiency policies.\n\nNot all countries contributed equally to the rise in emissions. China and India alone contributed more than 40% of the increase in emissions while the United Kingdom, Mexico and Japan all experienced a decline in emissions. The U.S. saw the biggest decline with emissions dropping by 0.5% as renewables continue to grow.\n\nDeveloped countries such as the U.S. have proven in recent years that economic growth can continue without increasing carbon emissions -- refuting a critique long floated by opponents of renewable energy. But developing countries such as India have yet to round the same corner even as they commit to clean energy investments.\n\nPast analysis has suggested that the world will need to peak its emissions by around 2020 to maintain any hope of meeting the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping temperatures from rising more than 2°C (3.6°F) by 2100 with an ideal target of keeping temperature rise below 1.5°C (2.7°F).\n\nThe chances of meeting that goal have dimmed significantly since countries agreed to the global deal in 2015. President Trump has vowed to remove the U.S. from the Paris Agreement while other countries have lagged on their efforts to meet their commitments under the deal.\n\n\"We are far from the 1.5 degrees if we look at the commitments that have been put on the table,\" Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), told TIME earlier this month. But \"there is a lot happening, a lot more than anticipated.\"",

They are packed with fiber and quality ingredients and are the perfect portable meal if you need some quick nourishment.\n\nI love to make them when I know I've got a busy week in front of me. They last for about five days when stored in the fridge, and marry perfectly with an almond milk latte. The addition of a generous amount of grated carrot and apple helps to keep them delicate and moist, while the walnuts add a crunch and a boost of omega-3s.\n\nYou don't need to fuss when making these muffins, as they are the sort of throw-in-the-bowl and mix with your hands type of treat that takes around 10 minutes to whip up.\n\nCarrots are a good source of beta-carotene, which can convert to vitamin A in the body. Apples contain a fiber known as pectin, which supports healthy digestion.\n\nNOTES + INSPIRATION: They keep well in the fridge for around four days and are also delicious served with a dollop of Greek style yogurt. Almond milk can be used in place of orange juice in this recipe.\n\nTeresa Cutter, founder of The Healthy Chef, is an author, nutritionist and classically trained chef.

                "body": "(WASHINGTON) -- Special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between President Donald Trump's campaign and the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which has come under fierce criticism over reports that it swiped the data of more than 50 million Facebook users to sway elections.\n\nMueller's investigators have asked former campaign officials about the Trump campaign's data operations, particularly about how it collected and utilized voter data in battleground states, according to a person with direct knowledge of the line of inquiry but not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nThe investigators have also asked some of Trump's data team, which included analysts at the Republican National Committee, about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica, according to two former campaign officials. The campaign paid the firm just under $6 million for its work in 2016, according to federal records.\n\nAuthorities in Britain and the United States are investigating whether Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from Facebook to try to influence elections, including the 2016 White House race.\n\nMueller is leading a criminal probe into whether Trump's Republican presidential campaign had ties to Russia and whether he may have obstructed justice.\n\nThe Trump campaign has distanced itself from the data mining firm, which had been financed by major Republican donors and, for a time, employed Steve Bannon, the conservative provocateur who later became Trump's campaign chief executive.\n\nTrump turned to Twitter on Thursday to boast about his campaign's social media efforts compared with those of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but it was not clear what prompted the declaration.\n\n\"Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!\" Trump wrote.\n\nA request for an explanation from the White House was not returned.\n\nThe exact role that Cambridge Analytica played for the Trump campaign has remained murky.\n\nStaffers at Cambridge Analytica made several overtures to the Trump campaign before eventually being retained. They first requested a meeting in spring 2015, before the celebrity businessman officially announced his candidacy, according to four former campaign officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss internal operations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAlexander Nix, the Cambridge Analytica CEO captured on a sting video released this week, met with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to make a pitch for the data-mining company's voter target products, including its so-called psychographic method.\n\nLewandowski passed, in part because the staff believed Trump would not be willing to make a sizable financial investment in an analytics firm, according to two of the campaign officials.\n\nCambridge then went to work for the campaign of Trump's Republican rivals Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. But after Trump became the GOP's presumptive nominee, the data firm reached out again, this time to Paul Manafort, who had replaced Lewandowski to become campaign chairman.\n\nManafort was also skeptical about the effectiveness of the firm's methods, but Cambridge was hired, in part as a friendly gesture to the Mercer family, heavyweight Republican donors who helped fund the company's launch a few years earlier, according to one of the former campaign officials.\n\nWith the Trump campaign concerned that the RNC might not fully invest in Trump -- he had clashed repeatedly with the organization -- Cambridge was retained. Campaign finance records indicate that the Trump campaign's first payment of $100,000 to the firm came in July 2016.\n\nFive of the firm's staff members were assigned to work with the campaign's digital director, Brad Parscale, at his Texas-based firm, where much of the campaign's digital operation was located.\n\nParscale and Jared Kushner, the candidate's son-in-law, emphasized using social media -- and particularly Facebook -- to better target voters and pressed its importance on Trump.\n\nThe campaign tapped Cambridge to build out a database of small-dollar GOP donors, a dataset the company had from its prior work for the Cruz and Carson campaigns.\n\nBut when it became clear the RNC would share its much-improved data operation with the Trump campaign, Cambridge became de-emphasized. Two of the former campaign officials said their tools were not useful, though Parscale, during a Google forum a month after the election, said the firm became involved in daily tracking polls and helped inform the campaign's decisions on where to spend its resources.\n\nAnother of the campaign officials said Cambridge was kept around mostly to placate the Mercers and their allies on Trump's staff.\n\nAll told, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge just under $6 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The largest payment to Cambridge Analytica -- $5 million on Sept. 1, 2016 -- was made about two weeks after Bannon was appointed the chief executive of the Trump campaign, according to FEC records. At that same time, another Mercer ally, pollster Kellyanne Conway, was named his campaign manager to replace Manafort.\n\nBannon, with the Mercers' backing, served as vice president of the firm from June 2014 to August 2016, when he joined the Trump campaign. He has since had a falling-out with the Mercers and with Trump over disparaging comments he made about the president's family.\n\nChris Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who became a whistleblower, told The Washington Post that Cambridge had begun testing phrases like \"drain the swamp\" and \"deep state\" well before Trump launched his campaign. The president began incorporating those concepts into his stump speech in the stretch run of the campaign, soon after Bannon came on board.\n\nWylie has said he fears the data was turned over to Russians who aimed to interfere with the U.S. election.\n\nParscale, who has been appointed Trump's 2020 campaign manager, has slammed the firm on Twitter for taking credit for Trump's victory. \"So incredibly false and ridiculous,\" he wrote this week, declaring Cambridge's comments \"an overblown sales pitch.\"\n\nLawmakers have demanded answers from both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, as Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, declared this week that the blooming scandal was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West.\"\n\n\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" Warner tweeted.\n\nThe news of Mueller's interest in Cambridge Analytica was first reported by ABC News.",

He was one of more than 3,000 inmates released prematurely due to the coding error, which lasted from 2002 to 2015.\n\nState authorities discovered the problem in 2012, but fixes were repeatedly delayed before the department notified Gov. Jay Inslee in late 2015. Amid a public outcry, the department re-arrested some offenders it had released early.\n\nAmong them was Wright, who by then says he had obtained an apartment, a car and a job at a car wash; enrolled in a welding program at a technical school; and had a baby daughter, whom he saw regularly. When he was released again in April 2016, that was all gone. He wandered the streets of Seattle for nearly two weeks, homeless.\n\n\"Seventy-six days: It's just long enough to lose everything,\" he said.\n\nSpokesman Jeremy Barclay said the department does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nAccording to a department report, officials reviewed more than 1,500 releases dating to 2011 and determined that 116 offenders should be re-arrested. Authorities decided not to re-arrest more than 1,000 others, under a state Supreme Court decision which held prisoners mistakenly released are entitled to credit for time spent at liberty if they don't \"abscond legal obligations.\"\n\nIt's not clear why officials targeted Wright, but it is possible they declined to credit the time he spent in the community because he had supervision violations, including drinking alcohol and failing to report, in the months after his release. He later completed alcohol treatment, and in early 2015 -- a year before he was re-arrested -- his community corrections officer notified King County Superior Court that Wright had \"successfully completed his DOC supervision.\"\n\nThe department has faced claims from the families of two people killed by prisoners freed early, settling one for $3.25 million. Barclay said he was not aware of other lawsuits brought by a re-arrested offender.\n\nSeveral employees were demoted over the scandal. Four others resigned, including Corrections Secretary Dan Pacholke, who had only become chief in October 2015 and brought the issue to the governor's attention. Lawmakers also passed reforms designed to avoid future problems.\n\nIn his complaint, filed March 16 in U.S. District Court in Seattle, Wright, 37, seeks damages for wrongful arrest and constitutional violations. His maximum sentence date had expired, and officials had no authority to return him to prison over a mistake they had made and known about for three years, the complaint says.\n\nNevertheless, they re-arrested him. Instead of obtaining a warrant from a court, they issued a \"secretary's warrant\" claiming he had escaped from custody or work-release -- something his lawyer, Tiffany Cartwright, called \"completely unauthorized.\"\n\nFurther, he should have been credited his time in the community because -- despite having some missteps -- he completed his supervision and thus did not \"abscond legal obligations,\" she said.\n\n\"They knew the whole time they were releasing people early,\" Cartwright said. \"They let people go out and start to reintegrate and rebuild their lives, and when it became public, they wanted to make a big show and round everybody up.\"\n\nWright served his sentence for robbing a man at an ATM, at gunpoint, of $300.\n\nHe said he didn't believe his daughter's mother when she told him in January 2016 that police were looking for him. But in the middle of the night, his mother called from Chicago: Federal marshals had come to her door.\n\n\"It was like a nightmare,\" he said. \"I was 100 percent sure I didn't commit a crime. Why would they be looking for me?\"\n\nDays later, officers confronted Wright in his car, parked at a friend's house. He served the 76 days at the prison. He never saw a judge or lawyer, he said, and though he knew he hadn't escaped, he had no means to contest his confinement.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, his roommate moved, unable to pay both shares of the rent. Wright's possessions in the apartment vanished. The mother of his daughter filed for full custody, and he couldn't attend the hearing because he was in prison. His car disappeared from the house where he'd been arrested.\n\nWhen his time was up, prison authorities gave him $60 and sent him on his way.\n\nHe wandered Seattle for 13 days before falling asleep on a chair outside a friend's house. The friend let him crash for a few days, and he eventually found an emergency shelter in nearby Bellevue. He resumed working days at a car wash, returning to the shelter at night with $100 in tips.\n\nThe shelter, Congregations for the Homeless, helped him land an apartment, he said, putting up money for the first and last months' rent. He's now re-enrolled at Renton Technical College, studying heating, venting and air conditioning.\n\nRe-entering society after prison is hard enough, Wright said: \"To make me do it again? I don't think that's right.\"",

                "title": "Why the Summer Zervos Lawsuit Against Donald Trump Matters",
                "body": "Florence is the Legal Director of Protect Democracy, a cross-partisan nonprofit.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly trotted out the argument that this President is above the law. Whether declaring he has \"the absolute right\" to do what he wants with the Justice Department, or seeking to avoid litigation against him with claims of immunity, the President all too often purports to be the king of the castle, not President of a democratic nation.\n\nTuesday's opinion from Judge Schechter of the New York Supreme Court in the Summer Zervos defamation case against Trump rightly rejects these claims. The very first sentence, \"No one is above the law.\" could not be clearer. No one, not even and perhaps especially not the President of the United States is entirely immune from suit.\n\nThe case involves former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, who is suing President Trump for defamation because he called her a liar after she accused him of sexual misconduct. The suit was filed in January of 2017, shortly before inauguration day, in state court in New York, where Zervos and Trump both lived at the time. Trump responded to the suit with the argument that -- because he is now President -- he cannot be sued in state court. Trump's lawyers argued that a constitutional provision making the Constitution and federal laws the supreme law of the land prevents state courts from hearing cases against a sitting President. In other words, Trump's argument is that because the President holds an important federal office he can't be sued in a state court.\n\nAs the New York court noted, the U.S. Supreme Court made it clear 20 years ago that the President's office doesn't place him beyond the reach of the courts in Clinton v. Jones, a case involving strikingly similar circumstances. (That was the sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones against President Clinton over his conduct while he was Governor of Arkansas.) In that civil suit, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a president can be sued in a civil case based on his personal conduct before taking office. For wrongful conduct not falling within his official duties, the President is subject to suit just like any other American.\n\nMy organization Protect Democracy, a cross-partisan non-profit, filed the lone friend of the court brief in the Zervos case. We did so on behalf of three constitutional law professors who also filed a brief 20 years ago in the Clinton v. Jones case. Although the political party of the President has changed, the arguments the professors advanced are the same: that the President of the United States is not immune from civil suit for his personal conduct. That principle is just as true in state court as in federal court.\n\nThe New York Court got it just right in its opinion this week, explaining that \"Nothing in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution even suggests that the President cannot be called to account before a state court for wrongful conduct that bears no relationship to any federal executive responsibility.\"\n\nSome people worried after Clinton v. Jones that there would be a flood of meritless litigation against Presidents in their personal capacity just to harass them. But neither President George W. Bush nor President Barack Obama became the target of widespread vexatious litigation. That may not hold true for this President if he's done things he shouldn't have and for which the victims are entitled to seek legal relief.\n\nAs a result of Tuesday's decision, Zervos's case can move forward, and the President will have to face her allegations like anyone else would. And if others have been harmed by a violation of state law by Trump in his personal capacity, they can too.\n\nThe presidency affords Trump substantial power and privilege -- but in our country, the law still reigns supreme.\n\nAfter this decision, it will be much harder for Trump to make the argument, \"When you're president, they let you do it.\"",

After being asked what she thinks of Nixon's foray into the world of politics, the one and only Samantha Jones offered a somewhat ambiguous response. \"I support & respect any former colleague's right to make their own career choices,\" she wrote on Thursday.\n\nCattrall's cryptic reply comes just weeks after an apparent public falling out with Sarah Jessica Parker following the death of the former's brother.\n\nParker has yet to weigh in on Nixon's campaign.

Trump said the number would be $60 billion at a press conference Thursday.\n\nThe Trump Administration conducted a months-long case, known as a Section 301 investigation, to build a case that China has forced U.S. companies to share technology and intellectual property as a condition of doing business in China, among other concerns.\n\nTrade associations representing a wide range of the business community said they largely agree with criticism of China's intellectual property practices, but criticized the tariffs as a poor remedy that could ultimately harm U.S. businesses and raise prices for consumers.\n\n\"The overall focus of the Section 301 investigation should be to bring China to the negotiating table for a meaningful resolution of specific, sector-by-sector issues,\" Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council trade association wrote in a letter to congressional leaders. \"Premature, unilateral sanctions alone are unlikely to achieve this objective.\"\n\nU.S. trade partners were already on edge about a slew of Trump tariffs announced earlier this year as the president seeks to make good on a campaign promise to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices. Past actions have covered steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels.\n\nThe announcement Thursday compounded industry fears. As news of the impending announcement spread, China announced that it was preparing tariffs of its own on U.S. soybeans, sorghum and live hogs, all of which originate in areas that overwhelmingly supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nA senior administration official said that the U.S. had already engaged China on the topic in diplomatic discussions and the tariffs were a last resort. \"China will have a choice about how to respond,\" the official said. \"They have benefited from this relationship far more than we have.\"\n\nThe tariffs will be subject to a 15-day comment period before the U.S. Trade Representative finalizes the move. Other measures, including new restrictions on Chinese investment in the U.S., will take longer.",

                "title": "The Facebook Data Cambridge Analytica Took Was Either Extremely Valuable or Totally Worthless",
                "body": "A Facebook Like Button logo is seen at the entrance of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on May 10, 2012.\n\nA voter-profiling firm that worked with Donald Trump's campaign improperly obtained information on 50 million Facebook users, but experts say the data was both extremely valuable and possibly worthless.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked with both Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaigns, got access to information on Facebook users and their friends through a researcher who misled the social network giant, saying the information he was gathering would be used strictly for academic research, according to recent reports.\n\nThe trove included information like people's names, locations, genders and things users have \"liked\" on Facebook, which a company whistleblower said it planned to use to exploit \"the mental vulnerabilities of people\" with targeted political messages.\n\nBecause there would be no other way to get that data through Facebook, which does not sell personal information, it's hard to put a price tag on how much it's worth, sources in politics and tech say. While personal data is clearly valuable -- especially for advertisers who want to reach specific mailboxes and inboxes -- they also raised doubts about whether the profiles would really be that much more helpful than information already for sale in the public square.\n\nTom Bonier, CEO of political data and strategy firm TargetSmart, said that licensing a robust set of \"voter files\" at a similar scale might cost a company around $500,000. Voter files are snapshots that often combine government records on whether you're registered to vote with consumer data about things you have bought, as well as educated guesses on your race and income. The commercial data brokers that sell it might even scrape together tidbits like how much you owe on your mortgage or whether you have a hunting license.\n\nVoter files are commonly used by campaigns, though in some ways they're arguably inferior to a Facebook profile: While a voter file might try to assess your religion or level of education based on other known factors, that kind of information is often explicit on social media. And better data is more valuable. Directly collecting information on 50 million people, rather than using models to predict it, would \"certainly\" run up a bill of millions of dollars, Bonier said.\n\nWhile the revelations have sparked a controversy over how Facebook protects information on its users, Bonier said that the way Cambridge Analytica attained the information is more shocking than the fact that a political firm had personal data about individual U.S. voters. \"What should be the most disconcerting component of this is really that breach of trust,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a response to the situation after days of silence, acknowledging that users might feel their privacy was compromised. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he wrote on the platform.\n\nThe researcher working for Cambridge Analytica also captured a lot of signals that aren't in voter files. According to news accounts, the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, developed a Facebook app with a personality quiz. When users opted in, as about 300,000 eventually did, they gave him access to information in their profiles. At the time, circa 2013, Facebook also permitted developers to access information about such users' friends, which is how the number of profiles in question ballooned into an enormous sampling of U.S. voters. (Facebook has since changed that policy and cut that access off.)\n\nFacebook says there was no \"data breach.\" The problem, the company says, is that Kogan misled the company and users about how he would use the information, improperly sharing the data with a commercial firm. According to reports, Cambridge Analytica paid Kogan's firm something in the neighborhood of $1 million -- covering the costs to do the research as well as incentives for people to take the quiz -- to get the information.\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied using the Facebook data, though it has admitting to possessing it. Reports from the New York Times and Guardian detail the firm's intention to use \"likes\" to help build algorithms that can predict the personality traits of voters. Armed with that kind of data, a firm could in theory tailor political messages that play on factors like people's neuroticism or openness.\n\nResearch has found that \"likes\" can predict many traits, often with better accuracy than the factors that voter files use to make guesses about people's attributes. For example, \"likes\" can predict the race of a Facebook user with 95% accuracy. But when Pew recently did a study on voter files, seeing how accurate data brokers were in their records about individuals, some companies had accuracy rates on race closer to 75%. With education, the rates dipped to 27%.\n\nThe personality quiz, with added questions about political leanings, had the potential to make connections between \"likes\" and voters' mental makeup. In theory, the researchers could assess which \"likes\" and other attributes are associated with people who scored high on neuroticism questions, for example, and use those correlations to figure out about how other people think.\n\nBut a number of experts have cast doubts on whether this would all add up to something that could really change voter behavior. Antonio Garcia Martinez, a Silicon Valley veteran and former employee of Facebook who writes about these issues for Wired, likens the scheme to creating a \"mental horoscope.\" Even if a firm knew that a neurotic people could be persuaded to vote for a candidate with a certain type of ad, he says, how would a firm target ads to neurotic people? Would they buy ads on Facebook that target people who tend to \"like\" things that neurotic people tend to \"like\"?\n\n\"It's too many leaps,\" Martinez says. \"You can't target a state of mind on Facebook.\"\n\nIn that case, is all this extra data really worth very little? Martinez argues that 50 million profiles Cambridge Analytica ended up with might actually be more noisy and \"less useful\" than traditional voter files. Bonier likens it to past fads in politics, like pollsters wanting to draw overblown conclusions about voters based on whether they own a Prius.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't lots of useful signals for companies like his in social media, he says. Political firms might use \"social listening,\" gathering publicly available information about who has used an #ImWithHer or #MAGA hashtag that can serve the same kind of predictive purpose.\n\nAnd even if it's not happening today, political operatives could find a way to psychologically profile the masses and use that to sway elections. One of the majors lesson of the election was that brilliant, powerful tools like Facebook can be used in ways their founders never intended.\n\n\"Politics has always been about persuasion and if persuasion goes far enough it can veer into manipulation, playing on people's greatest fears and desires. And I think the Internet's making that explicit for the first time,\" says Matt Mahan, CEO of Brigade, a startup that is trying to use data analytics to make it easier for people to engage in the political process. \"People's personal preferences and fears and hopes and neuroses, none of those things were ever explicit down to an individual basis,\" he says, \"before the rise of social media.\"",

Over his career, he is credited with making important observations on the transmission of HIV, and he has studied the care of people with chronic viral infections.\n\nHowever, his reputation as an HIV expert is not without controversy. In 1993, Redfield was investigated by the U.S. Army for allegedly misrepresenting data regarding an AIDS vaccine under research at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The vaccine was meant to help treat people already infected with the disease. During presentations, Redfield reportedly described statistically significant decreases in the amount of HIV in the blood of people who received the vaccine, but Redfield was later accused of misrepresenting that data.\n\nThough the Army acknowledged there were issues about the accuracy of the data, Redfield was ultimately cleared of any allegations of scientific misconduct. However, one of the whistleblowers who raised the issue of the trial data to the Army told Kaiser Health News (KHN) that he remains concerns about what happened. \"Either he was egregiously sloppy with data or it was fabricated,\" said former Air Force Lt. Col. Craig Hendrix, a doctor who is now director of the division of clinical pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, to KHN. \"It was somewhere on that spectrum, both of which were serious and raised questions about his trustworthiness.\"\n\nIn a letter to President Donald Trump, Sen. Patty Murray also called out a policy advocated by Redfield in which HIV-positive soldiers were segregated from other soldiers. Redfield also helped implement an HIV screening program where military recruits were screened for the disease and barred from service if they tested positive. \"This pattern of ethically and morally questionable behavior leads me to seriously question whether Dr. Redfield is qualified to be the federal government's chief advocate and spokesperson for public health,\" Murray wrote in her letter.\n\nPublic health leaders have also questioned Redfield's lack of experience leading a public health agency, and the potential impact of his reportedly conservative positions on sexual health.\n\nStill, others argue he's a respected researcher who will be a great fit for the position. \"It's nice to have someone competent and committed to HIV/AIDS,\" said Dr. Jim Curran, a former head of CDC's HIV/AIDS program and current dean of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta to Science. \"Most of the bad things he was associated with were quite a while ago and, unlike some of the people involved with AIDS in the beginning, he's been really, really committed for a long period of time.\"\n\nA former CDC director under former President Barack Obama, Dr. Tom Frieden, shared words of encouragement for Redfield on Twitter:\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called Redfield's scientific and clinical background \"peerless\" when announcing his appointment. \"Dr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients, and we are proud to welcome him as director of the world's premier epidemiological agency,\" wrote Azar.",

                "body": "(GREAT MILLS, Md.) -- Tuesday's school shooting in southern Maryland that left the shooter dead and two students wounded increasingly appears to be the action of a lovesick teenager.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday released a few additional details into the shooting at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County.\n\nAustin Rollins, 17, was killed after shooting a schoolmate, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey. A school resource officer got there within a minute and fired a shot at Willey, but it's not yet clear whether Rollins was killed by the officer's bullet or took his own life.\n\nA 14-year-old boy who was shot in the thigh during the encounter was released Wednesday from a hospital.\n\nThe St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday that Rollins and the girl had been in a relationship that recently ended. Authorities had previously only said that the two had had a relationship of some sorts.\n\n\"All indications suggest the shooting was not a random act of violence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nSt. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron said earlier that a precise determination of Rollins' motive may be impossible now that he is dead.\n\nThe girl, Jaelynn Willey, was still fighting for her life at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center. A fundraising page to help Willey's family has raised more than $54,000.\n\nHospital spokesman Michael Schwartzberg said in an email Wednesday night that she remained in critical condition.\n\nAttempts to reach Rollins' family were unsuccessful.\n\nA day after the eruption of gun violence in one of the sleepy community's schools, the few residents who ventured out amid a snowstorm blanketing the East Coast praised the school resource officer who responded, Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill.\n\n\"He did a very, very good job,\" said Sharon Eglinton, manager of a cafe in nearby Leonardtown.\n\nEglinton, herself a Great Mills alumna, noted that Rollins, was by all accounts a good student who had not shown any warning signs. She said she thinks the best way to prevent future school shootings is to install metal detectors at schools.\n\n\"I have no problem paying for it,\" she said. \"If you can protect people getting on a plane with metal detectors, you can protect people in schools.\"\n\nWhile investigators are still determining whether Rollins took his own life or was killed by the officer's bullet, Cameron credited Gaskill with preventing any more loss of life.\n\nCameron said Gaskill, a six-year veteran with SWAT team training, responded within a minute and fired his weapon simultaneously with a final shot fired by Rollins. The officer was unharmed.\n\nGaskill was praised a couple of years ago for his handling of a confrontation with an armed suspect.\n\nA Maryland man was charged in 2016 after he was accused of confronting Gaskill with a gun at an apartment in an incident captured on body camera video. Gaskill can be heard in the video giving several commands to drop the gun before the man eventually complies.\n\nThe Enterprise, a local newspaper, reports Cameron said at the time that Gaskill had \"used exemplary judgment.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said the Glock handgun used in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins' father. In Maryland it is illegal for anyone under age 21 to possess a handgun unless it is required for their employment.\n\nPeople who knew Rollins were trying to make some kind of sense of Tuesday's hometown horror.\n\n\"Never in a million years could I have imagined he would do something like this,\" said Adlai Traver, 18, who attended Great Mills and knew all three kids involved in the shooting. He recalled playing cards with Rollins during band class when the fellow percussionists had a little down time during class. \"I was in the car when I heard it was him. I pulled over and almost puked.\"",

                "title": "Do You Need to File Taxes This Year? Here's How to Find Out",
                "body": "Tax pros say they field two related questions all the time regarding tax-filing requirements. They are: Do I need to file a tax return, and how much do you have to make to file taxes?\n\nThe answer to either question is pretty simple, if you're just considering income. But experts say there are some other considerations, especially because you might be entitled to a refund you wouldn't otherwise be able to claim. If you're wondering if you need to file taxes in 2018, read on.\n\nIf you're a single filer who was under the age of 65 at the end of 2017, and you earned less than $10,400, you generally do not have to file taxes this year. If you're married filing jointly and you're both under 65, you probably don't have to file taxes if you earned less than double that amount above, or a total of $20.800.\n\nThe rules are different for older people. If you're married filing jointly and either you and your spouse (but not both of you) was over 65 at the end of last year, you don't have to file taxes if you made less than $22,050. If you're single and 65 or older, you don't have to file taxes if you made less than $11,950. If you're married and both of you are 65 or older, you don't have to file if you earned less than $23,300 in 2017. (There are slightly different rules if you're a widow or widower; the I.R.S. has the breakdown in table 1-1 of this document here.)\n\nEven if you technically don't have to file a tax return, you might want to. Why? If you're below any of these thresholds, you might want to file anyway because there are some sizable tax breaks available, especially if you have kids or if you're paying for education.\n\n\"The top credit you may miss out on if you don't file when you are not required to would be the American Opportunity Credit,\" said Mark Jaeger, director of tax development at TaxAct.\n\nThe American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC, is a tax break of up to $2,500 if you paid for qualifying educational expenses -- including tuition, books, and other course materials -- for yourself or a dependent in 2017. \"Since this is a refundable credit, you may miss out on this money if you do not file your return,\" Jaeger said. I.R.S. guidelines say 40% of this credit is refundable, which means you could get a refund of $1,000 even if you don't owe any federal income tax.\n\nThe other big credit experts say people often miss out on by not filing is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Lisa Greene-Lewis, tax expert for TurboTax, said many people are under the mistaken impression that this credit is only for very low-income Americans; in reality, it's actually meant to help out taxpayers and families of both low- and moderate-income.\n\nTo qualify for the EITC, you must have earned some income, and the caps for eligibility are higher than you might imagine. Single filers who earned up to $15,010 last year could get a credit of up to $510, according to TurboTax. If you're married filing jointly with three or more kids, you can be eligible even with an income of up to $53,930, and could get a credit of up to $6,318. (The I.R.S. has more details about income thresholds relative to family size here.)\n\nFinally, your health insurance status might compel you to file taxes for 2017. Regardless of how much you make, you'll need to file taxes if you get a credit on health insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act, Greene-Lewis said. \"If you bought health insurance through the marketplace, you need to claim your healthcare status,\" she said. \"To keep the premium tax credit, you have to file to prove your income.\"\n\nIf you purchased health insurance through the marketplace, you should have received a form 1095-A. The I.R.S. has instructions about what to do with it -- and who to contact in your state if you think you should have gotten this form, or if the information on it is incorrect -- at this link. If you received advanced payments of that credit and plan to do so next year, the IRS advises, taxpayers \"should file their tax return timely to ensure they can receive advance payments next year from their marketplace.\"",

                "body": "When Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg posted a status update Wednesday on the still-unfolding Cambridge Analytica scandal, he called it an \"issue,\" a \"mistake\" and a \"breach of trust.\" But he didn't say it was a data breach.\n\nEver since the news broke this weekend that the U.K. firm Cambridge Analytica obtained information about 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge, the social media site has been carefully avoiding using those words. Executives are profusely apologizing but stopping short of characterizing the situation as a data breach -- a phrase that brings to mind images of hacker frantically typing in a dark room or stolen credit card numbers being shared online.\n\nFacebook has 1.4 billion daily users it doesn't want to scare off with the \"data breach\" characterization. But was it?\n\nDepends who you ask.\n\nHere's what happened: A few years ago, a researcher put together a Facebook personality quiz that asked participants to download an app and give him access to their friends' data. About 270,000 people consented, which ultimately led to some 50 million profiles being scraped for information. The researcher then gave to Cambridge Analytica, and the company used it to build profiles it sold to clients as political research.\n\nThat amounts to a data breach if you're using a general definition, like the one cybersecurity company Trend Micro has on its website: \"an incident wherein information is stolen or taken from a system without the knowledge or authorization of the system's owner.\"\n\nIt counted for the Observer, which helped break the story and in its first sentence called the debacle \"one of the tech giant's biggest ever data breaches.\" Ditto tech entrepreneur Narendra Rocherolle, who flatly tweeted Saturday that \"when you allow 3rd parties to access my data in a manner inconsistent with the rules and policies. That is a data breach.\"\n\nFacebook, of course, disagrees. Deputy general counsel Paul Grewal released a statement on Saturday writing that \"the claim that this is a data breach is completely false\" because the researcher got consent from everyone involved. Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, Facebook's former vice president of ads, took a similar stance.\n\nPublications like Motherboard are trying to walk the line. The outlet pointed out that the Facebook news is different than last year's 140 million-person Equifax data breach, which took place when hackers exploited a vulnerability in its software. But it also mentioned that Facebook's entire business centers around collecting huge amounts of information from its users, so the whole operation isn't extremely secure.\n\nStill, others -- like Sen. Amy Klombuchar, the democrat from Minnesota -- are playing it safe and just using the word \"breach.\"",

                "body": "The Wall Street scare that spooked investors in February proved to be a false alarm, showing how risky it can be to flee the stock market out of fear.\n\nBut it was the start of something.\n\nEven though the selloff didn't turn into a full-fledged bear market, stocks have entered a new, bumpier phase -- as evidenced by Thursday morning's 350-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.\n\n\"Volatility returned in the first quarter of 2018 with a vengeance,\" says David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer for Cumberland Advisors.\n\nLess than three months into this year, investors have already witnessed more days in which the S&P 500 index has risen or fallen by at least 1% than in all of 2017. What's more, the average daily swing in stock prices so far in 2018 has been three times wider than last year -- meaning there's a good chance that any given day might produce a triple-digit gain or loss in the Dow.\n\nThat volatility is likely to remain for the foreseeable future, market strategists say.\n\nWhy? For starters, at nine years old, this is the second-oldest bull market in history. And aging rallies have a way of getting jittery near the end.\n\nMoreover, \"the market is reacting to the uncertainty around this president's style,\" Kotok says, noting that the unpredictable nature of this administration -- coupled with disruptive turnover among White House personnel -- could be contributing to the market's skittishness.\n\nPlus there are plenty of fundamental reasons why investors are getting nervous. Among them: rising interest rates, which could increase borrowing costs for companies; rising inflationary pressures, which could force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates even more; and fear of a trade war, especially now that the Trump administration is about to impose tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nYet all the while, the bull market keeps plodding along, which means you have to find a way to smooth out the market's bumps without slamming the brakes on stocks.\n\nThe good news: There are investments that act like shock absorbers if held within a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe simplest strategy to reduce volatility in your portfolio is to stick with so-called Steady Eddies: shares of humdrum companies that tend to fall less when the market is down, but also rise less in euphoric times.\n\nWhile this seems like a strategy tailor-made for rocky markets, there's a strong case for owning these shares all the time. Academic research has shown that low-volatility stocks actually outperform the broad stock market over the long run.\n\nMoreover, low-volatility stocks have outperformed the market in the two most recent major downturns for U.S. equities: the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the global financial crisis.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 tech wreck, for example, low-volatility stocks actually gained more than 6% while U.S. stocks fell by double digits.\n\n* How to invest: There are a number of funds and ETFs that specifically focus on this low-volatility strategy. iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (ticker symbol: USMV), for instance, is a big, low-cost fund that invests in about 150 U.S. stocks that exhibit lower-than-average volatility while also enjoying strong profit and cash flow growth.\n\nAmong the top holdings of this fund are boring names like the medical instrument maker Becton Dickinson and the trash and environmental services firm Waste Management. In the 2008 stock market crash, Becton Dickinson fell only about half as much as the broad market while Waste Management shares actually gained value.\n\nThanks to these types of stocks, iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility tends to hold up better in choppy markets. In months when the S&P 500 has posted losses over the past five years, for instance, this ETF has lost only about two-thirds as much as the market, according to the fund tracker Morningstar.\n\nIncome-generating stocks have a built-in cushion: the dividends that they issue to shareholders.\n\nIf their share prices were to fall say, 10%, a dividend payout of 3% would alleviate some of that pain. In the 2008 market crash, for example, when the S&P 500 index lost a stunning 37%, dividend payers saw a much more modest 23% decline in total returns, softening the blow.\n\nThere's another reason to embrace dividend payers at a time when market volatility is on the rise due to inflation fears: \"Over the long term, dividends have done a good job of staying ahead of inflation,\" says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for Cresset Wealth Advisors.\n\nOf course, dividend-paying stocks aren't without risk. In the event the economy is about to slow, there's a possibility that companies in weak financial condition could be forced to trim or suspend their payouts if business slows, as many banks did during the financial crisis.\n\nThat's why \"as you get later in the economic cycle, what becomes important is ultimately dividend growth,\" says Mark Freeman, chief investment officer at Westwood Holdings Group, referring to companies that can consistently raise their payouts over time.\n\n* How to invest: A good place to look for these types of dividend payers is in the SPDR S&P 500 Dividend ETF (SDY), which tracks an index of companies that have paid and increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Among the top holdings of this fund are two low-P/E stocks that have consistently boosted their payouts for more than three decades: AT&T and Exxon Mobil.\n\nWhy dedicate a small portion of your portfolio -- say, 5% to 10% -- to raw materials? For starters, commodities are an inflation play, as growing economic activity is likely to boost the price of natural resources such as oil and steel.\n\nPlus, relative to stocks, \"commodities have cheapened significantly,\" says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for The Leuthold Group. \"Indeed, from their peak in 2008, the relative price of commodities has declined by more than 75%.\" And relative to stocks, he adds, \"the price of commodities is near a 50-year low.\"\n\nBut the real reason to hold commodities is the diversification effect that they can have over a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.\n\nPaulsen looked at past inflationary periods -- specifically, times when the economy was growing faster than the national unemployment rate (which is the case today). In such periods going back to 1970, the stock market has suffered losses in 34 out of 105 quarters, or roughly 33% of the time. But in those down quarters for stocks, \"commodities delivered a positive total return about 75% of the time,\" Paulsen found.\n\n* How to invest: In our MONEY 50 list of recommended ETFs, there's iShares North America Natural Resources ETF (IGE), which gives you exposure to energy and natural resources for the relatively cheap cost of 0.48% of assets a year.\n\nFor years, stocks have been trading at lofty prices. But investors have argued that high price/earnings ratios aren't a problem for the market, since inflation is at historic lows -- and low inflationary periods have historically coincided with higher-than-average P/E ratios for equities.\n\nHowever, if consumer prices and interest rates are moving higher now, causing choppiness in the market, that valuation argument loses some of its punch.\n\nThis is why Lewis Altfest, president of Altfest Personal Wealth Management, says investors ought to \"trim some of the high-flying stocks with high P/Es\" from their portfolios.\n\nHistory says that's good advice. Normally in a market selloff, stocks with high P/E ratios tend to fall more because they're starting off at loftier levels. This was the case with frothy tech stocks in the dotcom crash in 2000 and expensive real estate-related equities in the mortgage meltdown of 2007.\n\n* How to invest: Use the equity portion of your portfolio to invest in undervalued stocks. In our MONEY 5o list of ETFs, there's the PowerShares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000 ETF (PRF). This fund owns blue-chip stocks that are relatively cheap based on fundamental factors such as their earnings and dividends. Indeed, the average holding in PowerShares FTSE RAFI sports a P/E ratio of less than 15, which is 15% cheaper than the broad market. The fund has outperformed more than 90% of its peers over the past decade.\n\nIf investors are worried that stocks will gyrate on economic fears, than the smart play is to recession-proof the stock portion of your portfolio.\n\nIn addition to low-volatility and lower-priced stocks, history says that high-quality stocks -- or shares of dominant companies with strong balance sheets and little debt -- are able to withstand stormy economic times better than the market as a whole.\n\nWhat's more, high-quality companies also tend to perform better in the latter stages of a bull market, while speculative low-quality stocks thrive at the start of an economic and market cycle.\n\n* How to invest: PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ) \"invests in profitable firms with strong balance sheets and conservative operating asset growth,\" noted Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan in a recent report. These are companies like Visa, Procter & Gamble, and 3M. As a result, \"it should hold up better than most of its peers during market downturns and offer attractive performance over a full market cycle.\"\n\nOver the past five years, PowerShares S&P 500 Quality has matched the performance of the broad stock market, posting gains of more than 14% a year. Yet in those months when the S&P 500 lost value, this fund fell only around three-quarters as much, according to Morningstar.\n\n\"The types of quality stocks the fund targets are unlikely to offer eye-popping returns,\" Bryan wrote. But the fund \"should reward patient investors with a better risk-reward profile than the broader market over the long term.\"",

The so-called \"Patterson Pledge\" was launched in 2015 and is run in coordination with Scholastic Book Clubs, which adds book club points to Patterson's contribution. More than 80,000 teachers applied for donations.\n\n\"I can't underscore enough how important books and reading are to a child's development -- better readers make better people, and ultimately better citizens,\" Patterson said in a statement. \"I'm so grateful for the teachers who are doing imperative work with students every day, in every school in the country. These grants are my way of acknowledging their extraordinary efforts.\"\n\n\"Teachers often have to find their own funds and use their personal money to buy books and build fresh classroom libraries. This is why we at Scholastic Book Clubs are truly inspired by James Patterson's commitment to offer real help to teachers in this work,\" Judy Newman, president of Scholastic Book Clubs, said in a statement.\n\nOver the past few years, Patterson has also given millions of dollars to bookstores and literacy programs and endowed thousands of college scholarships for teachers.",

                "body": "When a diminutive skeleton -- measuring just six inches long, with a tiny, cone-shaped head and only 10 pairs of ribs -- was discovered behind an abandoned church in the Atacama region of Chile in 2003, onlookers thought they might have stumbled across an alien.\n\nFifteen years later, researchers have the DNA evidence to prove that the skeleton, nicknamed Ata, is of \"purely earthly origin,\" a finding that was published Thursday in the journal Genome Research. Even still, plenty of questions remain unanswered.\n\n\"We really haven't see another child like that,\" says Dr. Atul Butte, the director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California San Francisco and one of the researchers involved in the project. \"Anything's possible.\"\n\nUsing DNA extracted from Ata's bone marrow, Butte and his colleagues were able to determine that the skeleton belonged to a human female with a mix of Native American and European heritage. They also found that the skeleton was likely less than 50 years old, and probably owed its weathered appearance to the harsh climate of the Chilean desert where it was found.\n\nFrom there, though, things got murky.\n\nAta's remarkably tiny size would suggest that she was a stillborn or a fetus, but bones in the skeleton's hands -- a body part commonly analyzed to estimate age -- more closely resembled that of a 6- to 8-year-old child, Butte says. Genome sequencing also revealed a number of defects having to do with bone development and growth, some known and some novel, Butte adds.\n\nDespite the apparent age of the bones, \"the severity of the other malformations -- the head, the abnormal number of ribs, all of that -- made us think that the child might not have lived very long or was never born,\" Butte says. \"That's the guess. But it's only a guess.\"\n\nThese unanswered questions are exactly what makes the project interesting, Butte says, adding that the complexity of the analysis has encouraged him to look beyond the obvious, even when it comes to more conventional cases.\n\n\"In medicine we like to say the simplest explanation is probably the right one. But sometimes there is a complicated explanation,\" Butte says. \"This story started with people thinking this was an alien. Look how much detail we can figure out about this girl now, just from the DNA. It's really interesting what you can learn.\"",

His birth name is actually John Roger Stephens, hence the reason their's daughter Luna's last name is Stephens.\n\n\"John Legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me, and it kind of grew into my stage name,\" the \"All of Me\" singer told MTV News in 2008. \"'Legend' is something that I never would have chosen for myself originally.

                "body": "William Stixrud is the co-author of The Self-Driven Child: The Science and Sense of Giving Your Kids More Control Over Their Lives, with Ned Johnson.\n\nWhen my daughter Jora was in high school, she went to a talk I gave on the adolescent brain, during which I pointed out that high school grades don't predict success very well. On the way home she said, \"Great talk, Dad, but I bet you don't really believe that bit about grades.\" I assured her that I did. To prove it, I offered to pay her $100 if she got a 'C' on her next report card -- in any subject.\n\nWe've all heard the familiar anxiety-inducing nostrums: That a screw-up in high school will follow you for the rest of your life. That if you don't get into Harvard or Yale, you'll never reach the c-suite. That the path to success is narrow and you'd better not take one false step. I have come to think of this unfounded belief system as what we psychologists call a \"shared delusion.\"\n\nSo why don't we tell our kids the truth about success? We could start with the fact that only a third of adults hold degrees from four-year colleges. Or that you'll do equally well in terms of income, job satisfaction and life satisfaction whether you go to an elite private college or a less-selective state university. Or that there are there are many occupations through which Americans make a living, many of which do not require a college degree.\n\nI am not against being a good student, and there are clear advantages to doing well in school. But you don't need to be a top student or go to a highly selective college to have a successful and fulfilling life. The path to success is not nearly so narrow as we think. We've all heard the stories of the college dropout who went on to found a wildly successful company. I myself was a C+ student in high school who flunked out of graduate school. At one point I went for 20 weeks without turning in a single assignment. (I often tell the underachievers I see in my practice: \"Top that!\") Long story short, I managed to do pretty well in life, and I credit my failure in graduate school with leading me to a career more in line with my skill set.\n\nThe problem with the stories we're telling our kids is that they foster fear and competition. This false paradigm affects high-achieving kids, for whom a rigid view of the path to success creates unnecessary anxiety, and low-achieving kids, many of whom conclude at a young age that they will never be successful, and adopt a \"why try at all?\" attitude. Many of these young people engage in one of the most debilitating forms of self-talk, telling themselves either, \"I have to, but I can't,\" or \"I have to, but I hate it.\"\n\nWhy do we encourage our children to embrace this delusional view of what it takes to be successful?\n\nI've asked various school administrators why they don't just tell kids the truth about college -- that where you go makes very little difference later in life.\n\nThey'll shrug and say, \"Even if we did, no one would believe it.\" One confided to me, \"We would get angry calls and letters from parents who believe that, if their children understood the truth, they would not work hard in school and would have second-class lives.\"\n\nMany adults worry that if their kids knew that grades in school aren't highly predictive of success in life, they'd lose their motivation to apply themselves and aim high. In fact, the opposite is true. In my 32 years of working with kids as a psychologist, I've seen that simply telling kids the truth -- giving them an accurate model of reality, including the advantages of being a good student -- increases their flexibility and drive. It motivates kids with high aspirations to shift their emphasis from achieving for its own sake to educating themselves so that they can make an important contribution. An accurate model of reality also encourages less-motivated students to think more broadly about their options and energizes them to pursue education and self-development even if they aren't top achievers.\n\nChildren are much more energized when they envision a future that is in line with their own values than when they dutifully do whatever they believe they have to do to live up to their parents' or teachers' or college admissions boards' expectations. We don't inspire our kids through fear. We inspire them by helping them to focus on getting better at something, rather than being the best, and by encouraging them to immerse themselves in something they love.\n\nSo if you want your kids to succeed in life, don't perpetuate a fear-based understanding of success. Start with the assumption that your children want their lives to work. Then tell them the truth: That we become successful by working hard at something that engages us, and by pulling ourselves up when we stumble.",

From left to right: Michaela Hoenig, Kate Lebrun, Mai Canning, Gabrielle Zwi and Emiliano Calvo Alcaniz\n\nAs teens from across the country descend on Washington, D.C., for a massive march to end gun violence, an underground network of high school students is helping to secure hundreds of homes for their out-of-town peers.\n\nThe organizers -- five friends from Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Md. -- have set up temporary housing for at least 200 students from as far as California as they travel to participate in Saturday's March For Our Lives. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to demand school safety measures and push for stronger gun restrictions in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla, which left 17 students and staff members dead.\n\n\"We're taking this extreme grief and this extreme anger and making it into something substantial,\" said 16-year-old Mai Canning, the youngest member of the March For Our Lives home-sharing network. \"Turning that grief into substantial action is really the key to this movement.\"\n\nIn just two weeks, Mai and her friends have convinced about 300 hosts to open their homes, churches, synagogues, college dorm rooms and rental properties along D.C.'s Metro transit system for free over the weekend.\n\nThe housing network heavily relies on social media and the use of shared Google documents, but it's a concept with longstanding roots in activism circles. Like many young activists, the students from Maryland say they were moved to action out of frustration following the Parkland shooting.\n\n\"We've never lived in a world where school shootings and gun violence weren't part of our society,\" said 18-year-old organizer Kate Lebrun, who is a senior at Walter Johnson High School. \"We've been growing up learning what to do if someone comes into our school with a gun. It's been a reality for us as long as I can remember.\"\n\nThe friends said they knew many of their peers wouldn't be able to attend the March For Our Lives in Washington without help.\n\n\"After the shooting, after realizing a lot of people wanted to express their voices, we realized they needed a place to stay,\" said organizer Michaela Hoenig, 17. \"Hotels in D.C. are ridiculously expensive. We realized we have homes in the area. We could open those up. We could extend the same privilege we have to the people coming in who want to protest.\"\n\nThey began spreading the word about their home-sharing network for March For Our Lives at the end of February, and soon several dozen students and hosts signed up. The young organizers then compared the online forms each participant had to fill out to match like-minded individuals.\n\nWhile organizers can't guarantee anyone's safety, they have been trying to screen for potentially dangerous situations. For example, they contact parents for permission when students under 18 sign up, and they ask for letters of recommendations from hosts' employers as part of a background check. They also do their best to pair students with families.\n\nPhilip Freeman, a 17-year-old high school student from St. Louis, has been texting and communicating on Snapchat with his Maryland host family for the last two weeks. He said he wouldn't have been able to take part in March For Our Lives without the home-sharing network.\n\n\"When I heard about the march in D.C., I got really excited, but I knew there was no way I could go,\" he said. \"I would have to go by myself, and my family doesn't have that much money.\"\n\nNow, the teen from Missouri -- who wants to pursue a career in politics -- is counting down the days until he's in Washington, pressuring leaders to enact tighter restrictions on gun or get voted out of office, and marching alongside thousands of his peers, including the survivors of the Parkland shooting.",

                "body": "Snow falls at the US Capitol during a snow storm in Washington, DC, March 21, 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump publicly griped over a congressional spending package that includes just a fraction of the money he wanted for border security, arguing that \"the rest will be forthcoming.\"\n\nAs part of a massive omnibus spending package on track to be approved, Congress is expected to approve just shy of $1.6 billion for border security, of which only $38 million can be spent on \"border barrier planning and design.\"\n\nTrump had called for $25 billion to build a wall on the border of Mexico, but the bill allocates funds primarily for \"pedestrian fencing,\" leading Trump to tweet angrily that he had to \"waste money\" on Democratic \"giveaways\" to get the bill passed. (The package includes $591 billion in non-defense spending on such things as childcare development and efforts to combat the opioid crisis.)\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Congress has just more than 36 hours to pass the $1.3 trillion spending package -- a massive, 2,232-page document that lawmakers only first saw on Wednesday night. Though the White House has said publicly that the president supports the package following meetings with Republican leadership on Wednesday, senior aides told The Atlantic that he was irate.\n\nHe is not alone, either. Conservative members of his own party, particularly in the House of Representatives, were quick to lash out against the bill, bemoaning the magnitude of the package and the haste with which they were expected to pass it.\n\n\"We're opposed -- spending levels way too high, no real border funding, no real conservative wins,\" one aide to a prominent House conservative told TIME.\n\nDemocratic leaders praised the bill, however.\n\n\"Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"From opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first.\"\n\nThe bill also includes a provision endorsed by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, that will fortify the background check system used in firearms purchases and prompt states to report information from this system to the federal database.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday afternoon, before leaving town for the two-week Easter recess. From there, the Senate has until midnight on Friday to pass the bill before the government runs out of funding.",

                "title": "This Compound Can Reverse Aging in Mice. Will It Work in People?",
                "body": "Mice are by no means men -- but the results of a new mouse study are still encouraging for man's search for longer life.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Cell, researchers report that they found a molecule that essentially reactivates faltering blood flow in aging mice. Compromised blood flow is a major component of aging, since it deprives tissues and organs, including the brain, of the essential nutrients and oxygen they need to function.\n\n\"Loss of blood flow seems to be one of the early things that leads to diseases of aging,\" says David Sinclair, the study's senior author and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn center for the biology of aging at Harvard Medical School. \"As organs like the brain and muscles lose their [blood] perfusion, they no longer function effectively.\"\n\nIn the study, Sinclair and his colleagues found a way to restore that blood flow in aging mice. They provided elderly mice with a molecule called nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is then made into another compound that promotes the formation of tiny blood vessels in cells that line the muscle, as well as other organs. The mice given NMN increased their treadmill run time by 60% compared to animals that didn't get the molecule, and they doubled their exercise endurance -- to levels that matched or even exceeded that of younger mice.\n\nMORE: Scientists Can Reverse DNA Aging in Mice\n\nWhat NMN does, Sinclair says, is provide the same benefits in improving blood flow that exercise does by promoting a family of molecules called sirtuins. \"Here we have the potential of having a pill give the benefits of basically running for 10 miles a day without having to do that,\" he says. That can be especially important for older people who are physically unable to exercise as much as they should. \"It's not just about trying to replace exercise when you are middle-aged, but giving you the benefits of exercise when you are too old to be able to do it.\"\n\nSinclair anticipates that improved blood flow could be important in helping not just aging tissues and organs, but speeding healing of wounds, particularly for people with diabetes who often lose fingers and toes as their circulation falters.\n\nMORE: Is An Anti-Aging Pill On The Horizon?\n\nThere is also the possibility that the finding could be used not just to improve circulation in older people or those with blood flow problems, but to enhance blood flow for elite athletes. Improving the pumping of blood to muscles could give athletes an advantage in being able to train longer and outperform their rivals.\n\nIn a small early trial at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Sinclair is already testing how the molecule works in people. Although it is currently available to purchase as a supplement, he wants to scientifically test NMN's effect on aging. Previous so-called \"anti-aging\" compounds have not proved as effective in people as they have in animals.\n\nBut Sinclair is confident enough in its benefits for aging that he is taking NMN himself. So far, it appears to be relatively safe and does not lead to out-of-control growth of blood vessels that other agents have, but further studies are necessary to confirm its safety and efficacy. Sinclair plans to test NMN's effects first in otherwise healthy elderly people, to see if it causes the same improvements in blood flow that he and his colleagues saw in animals.",

                "body": "Admiral Stavridis was the 16th Supreme Allied Commander at NATO and is Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University\n\nIn terms of timing, Shakespeare said it best in Julius Caesar: \"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries.\" As America welcomes the young, dynamic and controversial Prince Muhammad Bin Salman Al Saud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we should remember that he believes his destiny lies in reshaping not only the Saudi nation, but also the Arab world and the broader Middle East. And I would not bet against him.\n\nDuring a trip hosted and paid for by the Foreign Ministry with the aims of discussing diplomatic education, I was invited to speak with the Crown Prince. Our meeting was held in his large office in the Royal Palace on March 12, at 11 p.m., as the Royal Court milled about outside.\n\nIn ten years as a very senior U.S. military officer and five years in my current role as the Dean of a graduate school of international relations, I have met most of the major world leaders. I would put Prince Muhammad near the top of the list in terms of energy, ambition and vision. His youth means a long, long time in power when he becomes King. But the challenges are immense, and the detractors -- both inside the Kingdom and globally -- are formidable.\n\nHis list of titles is long, much like the other global Prince of the moment, his friend Jared Kushner. In addition to being selected as the Crown Prince, he serves as First Deputy Prime Minister, President of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs, and Minister of Defense -- the world's youngest holder of the latter office at the time of his appointment nearly two years ago. Each of these positions would be a full-time job for most people. For example, as Minister of Defense he manages the fourth-largest defense budget in the world, has Saudi troops in a significant regional war in Yemen, directs strikes against the Islamic State as part of the coalition led by the U.S. and recently fired much of the uniformed leadership. His duties in each of the other positions are equally significant.\n\nHis energy and enthusiasm for the task ahead of him was apparent. He held forth with precision and passion on the threat posed by Iran, the challenge of finishing the task of destroying the Islamic State, the positive state of relations with the United States, anti-corruption measures and the need to reform both the Saudi economy and improve the situation for women in the Kingdom. Surrounded by stacks of documents, folders, binders and various computers and other electronic devices, he was clearly looking forward to a long trip to the United States, which would encompass both coasts and multiple locations.\n\nThere is a particular need driving his deep personal engagement with current U.S. leadership and the lengthy visit to America. With a relatively small population relative to Iran and reliance on hydrocarbons for a reliable revenue stream, the Saudis need a powerful partner -- and only the United States can provide the full range of security guarantees. For the Kingdom, a U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East puts in place a far more dangerous landscape. This should also inform a Saudi approach that eases U.S. concerns about the war in Yemen, the relationship with the Qataris, and cooperation with Israel.\n\nThe Crown Prince's reputation is not without controversy, of course. Confining members of the Royal family in a Ritz-Carlton in a crackdown on corruption has created a significant human rights backlash, particularly after a damning story in the New York Times appeared. Likewise, the Saudi military campaign in Yemen has helped create a significant humanitarian crisis, and accusations of loose collateral damage standards in terms of the air campaign continue to crop up. The isolation of Qatar is contributing to a high degree of tension in the Gulf Cooperation Council, traditionally led by the Saudis. And his reforms on behalf of women, from permission to drive to allowing custody of children after a divorce, are stirring up trouble in traditional sectors of Saudi society.\n\nThere will be additional major challenges ahead. The ambitious plan to reinvent the Saudi economy and wean it from oil revenues will be difficult, even with an infusion of cash from the planned sale of part of Saudi Aramco. If the Prince cannot succeed in generating jobs for young Saudis, encourage technology transfer and sensible direct investment, manage the sovereign wealth in a way that protects the post-hydrocarbon future, tap the human capital of women, reduce radicalization, strangle corruption, maintain the support of the majority of young Saudis and continue to connect the Kingdom to the global grid, then his path will be vastly harder. He cannot succeed by force of personality alone, something he knows well -- he must follow through on the coherent plan he has laid out, adjusting course as necessary as events force changes.\n\nRelations with Israel will be tricky, despite the increasingly obvious need for the Saudis to work with Israel in opposing Iranian influence throughout the region (as the Egyptians and Jordanians have for decades). Creating a sense of unity among the fractious Arab states will be hard, and there are other leaders in the Arab world to challenge the young Prince. And above it all looms the long shadow of Iran, who see themselves as inheritors of the Persian Empire and are striking out across the region, seeking to gain influence both north and south of the Kingdom, using Shiite militias, Revolutionary Guards, traditional troops, and an alliance with Russia, Syria and increasingly NATO member Turkey. In addition to traditional Arab states (to include solving the situation with Qatar), the Prince needs a quietly cooperative Israel, European help in ensuring the Iranian economy doesn't suddenly swing into high gear, U.S. influence both in the region and in Europe; possible cooperation with NATO (there is already a nascent level of such engagement) and direct investment from other parts of the world. The United States will be a central part of that coalition, and he will be a vital partner for our security efforts.\n\nThe Crown Prince is determined to seize this moment and sail on the flood tide. But he would do well to remember that the play from which that famous quotation comes tells the story of a leader who faces a brutal end. I'd say the odds of his success are better than even, but there are rough seas ahead.",

                "title": "Hurricane Harvey's Toxic Impact Worse Than Reported: Records",
                "body": "(HOUSTON) -- A toxic onslaught from the nation's petrochemical hub was largely overshadowed by the record-shattering deluge of Hurricane Harvey as residents and first responders struggled to save lives and property.\n\nMore than a half-year after floodwaters swamped America's fourth-largest city, the extent of this environmental assault is beginning to surface, while questions about the long-term consequences for human health remain unanswered.\n\nCounty, state and federal records pieced together by The Associated Press and The Houston Chronicle reveal a far more widespread toxic impact than authorities publicly reported after the storm slammed into the Texas coast in late August and then stalled over the Houston area.\n\nSome 500 chemical plants, 10 refineries and more than 6,670 miles of intertwined oil, gas and chemical pipelines line the nation's largest energy corridor.\n\nNearly half a billion gallons of industrial wastewater mixed with storm water surged out of just one chemical plant in Baytown, east of Houston on the upper shores of Galveston Bay.\n\nBenzene, vinyl chloride, butadiene and other known human carcinogens were among the dozens of tons of industrial toxins released into surrounding neighborhoods and waterways following Harvey's torrential rains.\n\nIn all, reporters catalogued more than 100 Harvey-related toxic releases -- on land, in water and in the air. Most were never publicized, and in the case of two of the biggest ones, the extent or potential toxicity of the releases was initially understated.\n\nOnly a handful of the industrial spills have been investigated by federal regulators, reporters found.\n\nTexas regulators say they have investigated 89 incidents, but have yet to announce any enforcement actions.\n\nTesting by state and federal regulators of soil and water for contaminants was largely limited to Superfund toxic waste sites.\n\nBased on widespread air monitoring, including flyovers, officials repeatedly assured the public that post-Harvey air pollution posed no health threat. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official in charge now says these general assessments did not necessarily reflect local \"hotspots\" with potential risk to people.\n\nRegulators alerted the public to dangers from just two, well-publicized toxic disasters: the Arkema chemical plant northeast of Houston that exploded and burned for days, and a nearby dioxin-laden federal Superfund site whose protective cap was damaged by the raging San Jacinto River.\n\nSamuel Coleman, who was the EPA's acting regional administrator during Harvey, said the priority in the immediate aftermath was \"addressing any environmental harms as quickly as possible as opposed to making announcements about what the problem was.\"\n\nIn hindsight, he said, it might not have been a bad idea to inform the public about the worst of \"dozens of spills.\"\n\nLocal officials say the state's industry-friendly approach has weakened efforts by the city of Houston and surrounding Harris County to build cases against and force cleanup by the companies, many of them repeat environmental offenders.\n\n\"The public will probably never know the extent of what happened to the environment after Harvey. But the individual companies of course know,\" said Rock Owens, supervising environmental attorney for Harris County, home to Houston and 4.7 million residents.\n\nThe chairman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Bryan Shaw, declined when asked by lawmakers in January to identify the worst spills and their locations. He told a legislative subcommittee hearing he could not publicly discuss spills until his staff completed a review.\n\nThe amount of post-Harvey government testing contrasts sharply with what happened after two other major Gulf Coast hurricanes. After Hurricane Ike hit Texas in 2008, state regulators collected 85 sediment samples to measure the contamination; more than a dozen violations were identified and cleanups were carried out, according to a state review.\n\nIn Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters ravaged New Orleans in 2005, the EPA and Louisiana officials examined about 1,800 soil samples over 10 months, EPA records showed.\n\n\"Now the response is completely different,\" said Scott Frickel, an environmental sociologist formerly at Tulane University in New Orleans.\n\nFrickel, now at Brown University, called the Harvey response \"unconscionable\" given Houston's exponentially larger industrial footprint.\n\nReporters covered some environmental crises as they happened, such as AP's exclusive on the flooding of toxic waste sites and the Chronicle's Arkema warnings before fires broke out. But the sheer quantity of spills was impossible to document in real time.\n\nAcademic researchers are now trying to fill in the gaps in environmental monitoring, helped by grants from the National Science Foundation and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. One project, a Harvey-related public health registry for Houston, was funded just this month but is not yet underway.\n\n\"People are left in a state of limbo of not knowing if they were exposed or not -- or if they were, what the implications are for their health,\" said Dr. Nicole Lurie, who oversaw federal public health responses to the Superstorm Sandy and Deepwater Horizon disasters while at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nScientists say the paucity of data also could hamstring efforts to prepare for and mitigate damage from future violent weather events that climatologists predict will happen with increasing frequency.\n\nWhen it meets moisture, hydrogen chloride gas becomes hydrochloric acid, which can burn, suffocate and kill.\n\nBetween lulls in Harvey's pounding torrents on Aug. 28, an 18-inch pipeline leak at Williams Midstream Services Inc. unleashed a plume of the chemical near the intersection of two major highways in La Porte, southeast of Houston, where the San Jacinto River meets the 50-mile ship channel. It's the petrochemical corridor's main artery that empties into Galveston Bay.\n\nA toxic cloud spread about a quarter-mile in an industrial sector as firefighters and police rushed to shut down roads, blared neighborhood sirens and robo-dispatched phone and text messages warning people to stay indoors.\n\nTwo hours ticked by before a county hazardous materials response unit -- lucky to find a road not under water -- arrived and ended the danger with the help of a crew from a nearby plant.\n\nThe spill was among dozens barely noticed at the time, records show. A county pollution control inspector, Johnathan Martin, wrote in his report that he could not safely monitor the toxic plume but believed it did not reach homes less than a mile away. There were no reports of injuries.\n\nOn land, the deluge -- five feet of rain in some spots -- appears to have scoured the top soil, according to separate testing efforts by scientists from Texas A&M and Rice universities.\n\nThe Texas A&M collection of 24 samples -- taken in September from lawns mainly in a neighborhood near Valero Energy Corp.'s refinery -- turned up only low traces of petroleum and petrochemical-related compounds.\n\n\"As expected the rains washed most things out,\" said Texas A&M research leader Anthony Knap.\n\nRice researchers tested soil at a school and park in Baytown, east across Upper Galveston Bay, where residents said floodwaters rushed in from the 3,400-acre ExxonMobil refinery and chemical plant. They also sampled in Galena Park, a community of 11,000 hemmed in by heavy industry along the ship channel, just east of downtown.\n\nOnly one of the nine samples collected by Rice researchers showed elevated levels of petroleum-related toxins, according to an independent chemical analysis funded by the AP-Chronicle collaboration. Collected in Galena Park, it showed the presence of benzo(a)pyrene, a known carcinogen, at levels just above what the EPA deems a cancer risk.\n\nJessica Chastain lives a block away.\n\nDuring Harvey's three-day downpour, the nearby Panther Creek swallowed Chastain's home, forcing the 36-year-old mother and four of her children to swim across the street to the safety of her parents' two-story house, through slimy brownish-black water that smelled like a \"rotten sewer,\" said Chastain. \"It had a coat of film over it. I'm not sure what it was. It was probably oil.\"\n\nHer children -- 15, 11, 9 and 6 -- all developed skin infections and strep throat, she said.\n\nHer youngest still \"cries when it rains hard,\" she said. \"'Is it going to flood?' he asks.\"\n\nThe creek, which empties into the nearby ship channel, had backed up from flooded chemical plants and tank farms.\n\nA number of Harvey-related spills occurred near Chastain's home, including the 460,000-gallon gasoline spill at a Magellan Midstream Partners tank farm and nearly 52,000 pounds of crude oil from a Seaway Crude Pipeline Inc. tank.\n\nSamples taken in October at a Houston park upstream of the ship channel showed elevated levels of dioxins, PCBs and hazardous chemicals typically created in the burning of oil, coal and gas, said Jennifer Horney, an A&M epidemiology professor who conducted testing for the city.\n\nBenzo(a)pyrene was among the chemicals found in sediment on the banks of Brays Bayou at the park, a popular recreation site with baseball diamonds, soccer pitches and bicycle pathways.\n\n\"It's coal tar and it's a known carcinogen and mostly you find it in industrial settings,\" said Horney. \"We know the ship channel -- or the bayou -- was (up) in that park.\"\n\nWhile worrisome, the levels at the park were not high enough to trigger a cleanup under EPA standards, she said. Neither Houston nor Texas A&M officials have publicly released those test results, which the city health department's chief environmental science officer, Loren Raun, said showed \"nothing of concern for human health risk.\"\n\nThe surface soil scrubbing that scientists believe occurred during Harvey means contaminants likely migrated downstream, said Hanadi Rifai. The head of the University of Houston's environmental engineering program, she has been studying pollution in the watershed for more than two decades.\n\n\"That soil ended up somewhere,\" Rifai said. \"The net result on Galveston Bay is going to be nothing short of catastrophic.\"\n\nResidents of the tidy, mostly Latino neighborhood off Old Industrial Road in Galena Park are accustomed to the foul odors that wind shifts can bring.\n\nBut no one told them about the gasoline spill at the Magellan terminal a mile away -- one of more than a dozen Harvey-related releases in a two-mile radius. The release was initially reported to the Coast Guard at 42,000 gallons -- and residents would only learn of it a week later through news reports. Not until 11 days after the spill did Magellan report that it was actually more than 10 times bigger.\n\nAsked about the discrepancy, Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine said floodwaters prevented the company from accessing the ruptured tanks until Sept. 5. He said the company later removed 15 dump trucks of tainted soil.\n\nThe spill was reported to the Coast Guard on Thursday, Aug. 31 at 11:35 p.m. -- six days after Harvey made landfall.\n\nAn explosion risk prompted workers to evacuate upwind as the nearly half-million gallons of gasoline gushed out failed storage tanks, state environmental and Coast Guard records show. The spill ranked as Texas' largest reported Harvey-related venting of air pollutants, at 1,143 tons.\n\nThe local fire department put down foam to suppress the fumes, records revealed, and a police report described \"a vapor cloud.\"\n\nClaudia Mendez, a 42-year-old housewife, said she later saw foam by the side of the road and wondered about its origin.\n\nThe fumes were so strong, Mendez said, \"I thought my husband had brought the lawnmower gas can inside.\"\n\nMagellan has been cited for 11 environmental violations since 2002 by Texas regulators and fined more than $190,000, more than half in August 2012 for a single violation of air quality standards.\n\nIts spill is among at least three post-Harvey releases about which Harris County officials have withheld information, saying they remain under investigation.\n\nThe second involves W&P Development Corp., owner of an industrial park where about 100,000 gallons of oily wastewater were reported to have spilled into the San Jacinto from Aug. 29 to Aug. 31. The site was formerly Champion Paper Mill and a landfill there received wastes including turpentine- and lead-contaminated soil and mercury until 2008. For most of 2015 and 2016, the property was in violation of federal anti-pollution laws, EPA records show.\n\nA spokesman for W&P Development, Dennis Winkler, said the company later determined that a smaller amount -- 30,000 gallons -- had escaped from a water treatment plant when the river overtopped a berm.\n\nThe third site is Channel Biorefinery & Terminals, where some 80,000 gallons of methanol spilled from a tank rupture into Greens Bayou, which enters the ship channel just downstream of the Magellan terminal. Highly flammable and explosive, methanol can cause brain lesions and other disorders.\n\nThe property, once the site of the nation's largest biofuels refinery, was in violation of federal hazardous waste-management rules the first half of 2017. Texas cited the property's owners for failing to prove they could manage licensed wastes, including oily sludge and petroleum distillates, records show.\n\nDennis Frost, the on-site manager for Gulf Coast Energy, the tenant of Channel Biorefinery, said he and co-workers did their best to prevent the spills.\n\n\"They were impossible to contain,\" he said. \"The water here down by our facility was up over 20 feet.\"\n\nCompanies are required under federal law to report spills to the state and federal government but not to counties, which are the first line of defense against industrial pollution.\n\nHarris County pollution control investigators queried more than 150 plants on Harvey-related spills, but many did not provide estimates.\n\n\"Spill information is provided as a courtesy,\" said Latrice Babin, deputy director of the county's pollution control office. \"Likewise, there is no requirement of notification of evacuation.\"\n\nThe largest spill, by far, was at ExxonMobil Corp.'s Olefins Plant in Baytown, east of the ship channel. Two days after Harvey hit, some 457 million gallons of stormwater mixed with untreated wastewater, including oil and grease, surged into an adjacent creek.\n\nThe spill was not reported to the public. In a water quality report filed with the county and obtained through an open records request, ExxonMobil said \"available information does not indicate any potential danger to human health or safety or the environment.\"\n\nIt did not include results of third-party water testing that the company said had been done. The plant has a history of federal air pollution violations and reported emitting 228 tons of airborne pollutants during Harvey.\n\nOther large spills found in official records include:\n\n-- More than 3,000 pounds of benzene from Royal Dutch Shell PLC's Deer Park complex on the ship channel's south bank. Initially, the company reported a half ton of phenol, which can burn skin and be potentially fatal, was spilled. It later revised that downward to just two pounds.\n\n-- About 34,000 pounds of sodium hydroxide, or lye, which can cause severe chemical burns, and unpermitted airborne emissions, including 28,000 pounds of benzene, from the Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. plant in Baytown, near where thousands of residents live along Cedar Bayou. A spokesman, Bryce Hallowell, said a containment pond kept about 38 percent of the lye from escaping the facility.\n\n-- About 60,000 tons of what Dow Chemical Co. called \"non-hazardous biosolids\" at the company's plant in Deer Park. The company now says that roughly 50 tons of that consisted of biosolids and that the rest was \"primarily\" stormwater.\n\nYvette Arellano of the advocacy group Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services surveyed the area by helicopter on Sept. 4.\n\nShe reported seeing flooded tank farms, fluorescent liquid streaming from Exxon's outfalls, and refineries and chemical plants flaring gas intensely like giant candles.\n\n\"The entire skyscape looked like a birthday cake,\" Arellano said.\n\nAs Harvey bore down on Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott's administration decreed that storm-related pollution would be forgiven as \"acts of God.\" Days later, he suspended many environmental regulations.\n\nOn Sept. 1, just as residents in some areas of Houston started dragging soggy belongings to the curb, the city experienced Texas' worst ozone pollution of the year.\n\nA top city health official emailed the EPA on Sept. 1 with a request marked \"urgent,\" asking for help in determining whether spills and leaks at industrial and Superfund sites threatened the public. Three days later, after getting no response, she emailed again, records obtained in a public information act request show.\n\n\"We are finding alarming levels of benzene in the neighborhood next to Valero . Should EPA evacuate the residents?\"\n\nThere was no record of an EPA email response, though the agency did send a mobile air-monitoring van on Sept. 5.\n\nBy then, Houston had done its own air monitoring, recording a high benzene level of 324 parts per billion -- more than three times the level at which federal worker safety guidelines recommend special breathing equipment. The city was aided by the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, which dispatched a mobile van from California to track the toxic benzene plume.\n\nOn Sept. 7, state investigators took air samples near Valero and reported suffering headaches and dizziness, though they said they found pollutants \"below levels of short-term health and/or welfare concern,\" according to a state report.\n\nThe EPA said it also conducted 28 flights over 12 days beginning Aug. 31 using a plane equipped to evaluate \"unreported or undetected\" chemical releases. It flew over nearly 700 industrial sites, municipal wastewater treatment plants and other facilities, and EPA said it found no pollution exceeding state-permitted levels.\n\nIn at least seven \"status reports\" the EPA and TCEQ posted online from Sept. 3 and Oct. 6, they said all measurements \"were well below levels of health concern.\"\n\nColeman, who retired in January after 29 years with EPA, said he was comfortable with the advisories, saying they were general assessments. \"Were there hotspots? Absolutely,\" he said in a recent interview. \"But on any given day, within some isolated area, there could be a problem.\"\n\nAP and Chronicle reporters asked the EPA and state regulators for a detailed accounting of any soil and water testing they did after Harvey, along with any investigations or sanctions.\n\nThe responses mostly cited online bulletins, in which the EPA said it had assessed all 43 Superfund cleanup sites in the hurricane-affected area and cleared all but one -- the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, which was leaking dioxins. An examination of the 17 state Superfund sites found \"no major issues,\" regulators said.\n\nState officials said they didn't test any sediment that may have been deposited elsewhere by floodwaters. The EPA tested water at an unspecified number of industrial sites but did not disclose results.\n\nWithout elaborating, the state said it had a number of open investigations. The EPA refused to discuss whom it might be investigating, beyond Valero and Arkema.\n\nWith a few exceptions, companies with spills did not call local emergency responders, meaning the public was not informed in real time. Instead, the companies handled the spills in-house, the Chronicle and AP found in surveying local and county fire officials.\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office, which handles countywide emergency response and routinely dispatches a special investigator to major spills, said it was not alerted to 22 of 23 spills that reporters asked about, based on size and potential toxicity.\n\nThe Arkema plant was the exception. Impossible to go unnoticed, its containers of liquid organic peroxides exploded after floodwaters disabled backup generators. Sickened first responders have filed suit, as have Harris and Liberty counties, which claim the company violated numerous environmental and safety regulations.\n\nBob Royall, emergency operations chief for the county's Fire Marshal office, said his agency was alerted to Arkema and the Williams' hydrochloric acid leak but no one informed it at the time of the nearly half-million-gallon Magellan spill.\n\nLike spills on land, unpermitted releases of air toxins are self-reported in Texas -- a state that has long been friendly to heavy industry. As attorney general, prior to being elected governor, Abbott had sued the federal government more than a dozen times to challenge environmental regulations that he deemed over-reaching.\n\nThe governor's Harvey disaster declaration suspended environmental reporting and record-keeping rules as well as liability for unauthorized emissions for the duration of the disaster declaration, which was most recently renewed on March 16. A spokesman for the state environmental agency said the suspensions only apply when rules would hinder disaster response.\n\nAn attorney for the nonprofit Austin-based Environmental Integrity Project said that while federal environmental laws remained in effect, the governor's action essentially put state regulators on the sidelines and made it more difficult to hold polluters accountable. \"The state tied its own hands before it knew the scope or the magnitude or any of the effects of the storm,\" said attorney Ilan Levin.\n\nThe TCEQ itself has a long track record of industry tolerance. State auditors in 2003 found it was late in ordering and collecting fines, giving polluters $25 million a year in discounts. A study by Levin's group found the agency penalized only 3 percent of air pollution incidents reported by all companies statewide from 2011 to 2016.\n\nTwo Texas laws enacted since mid-2015 have weakened counties' ability to police polluters. The first caps at $2.15 million what they can collect from polluters in lawsuits. The rest must go to the state. The second law took effect Sept. 1. It obliges counties to give the state right of first refusal on any pollution enforcement cases, which local officials say could mean less punitive action.\n\n\"Every time we've been able to make something -- you get a large judgment against one of these companies, get some significant process-changing injunctive relief -- they come back around behind us to the legislature,\" said Owens. \"And they have clipped our wings.\"",

                "title": "Sean Penn Talks His Debut Novel and His Fears for #MeToo",
                "body": "Actor and activist Sean Penn makes his debut as a book author with 'Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff'\n\nOn March 27, Sean Penn will make his debut as an author with his satirical novel, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff. To mark the occasion, the philanthropist and two-time Academy Award-winning actor famous for his roles ranging from Fast Times at Ridgemont High to Milk to Mystic River spoke with TIME about the themes of the book, the #MeToo movement, President Donald Trump and Haiti.\n\nThe main character of your book is a mercenary who opposes a Trumpian figure. Do you share Bob Honey's worldview? I wrote this book to get myself away from my own worldviews. And that doesn't mean that they are or are not expressed in the book. It's up to the reader to decide.\n\nBob drafts a letter to the Trumpian character saying, \"We are a nation in need of an assassin.\" Are you worried that will be read as you advocating for the assassination of President Trump? No, I'm not worried about that. I think if anybody believes by reading this that I am advocating for something like that, then they are really not getting that right. This is satire.\n\nBob targets the elderly. Do you fear getting old? No, I am in a hurry to get old. I've always had it in my head that I'm 77 years old. Now I don't know that I'll make it to that. I've done a little too much smoking. But I do feel more at ease with the world the older I get, despite the fact that the world itself is becoming increasingly challenging.\n\nWhen you picture your life as a 77-year-old, what do you see? I think I run a bed and breakfast, and I keep a good bottle of Haitian rum under a blanket over my legs, in a wheelchair. I am not committed to the wheelchair, but I use it because I could get away with it. And I'm very selective about who can stay at the bed and breakfast.\n\nWhat can books do that movies can't? Put the vision in the hands of the reader. Film has often been called the director's medium. And a writer kind of gets lost in that, often. With a book, you've got a writer and a director -- and the director is the reader.\n\nWhat did you think when the President described Haiti as a \"sh-thole\"? I just know so many people who would have been hurt by it, who have lived a hardship that that man's never known. The indignity of his indulgence in his own flamboyance and minor brain is cheapening the air we breathe. And the fact that this Congress is tolerating him, the fact that anchors on news stations aren't pulling the fire alarm. We passed the Paddy Chayefsky moment about a year ago, when the screaming \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore\" should have been. I used the book to keep myself from [falling into] the worst thoughts that Bob expresses. When it comes to Sean Penn talking for Sean Penn these days, I even feel that I want to use less flamboyant language than I have, and I'm not a politician.\n\nYou write in the novel \"words are as lethal as any weapon\" and \"public yearning\" has \"now become an insatiable hunger bent on having one's own insecurity empowered.\" Is there a cure to that? Well, I think we've got to hit quite a challenging restart button if we're going to cure that in this culture. I think that we are seeing people in great pain be dubbed heroes. There's goddamn nothing to criticize about someone being a victim. On the contrary, there's something to hug and to cure. But I don't know if throwing the word hero around should apply in some of these circumstances. And I try to write about that a little bit also. Heroism is a funny thing, in that it's often circumstantial and we see the best of humankind respond in ways that can make us weak with courage. I don't know that we're in a conversation that these flamboyant terms of reverence are helping very much.\n\nIn the poem that makes up the epilogue of the book, the phrase \"#MeToo\" is described as \"infantilizing.\" And it says that the \"toddlers' crusade\" might end up \"reducing rape, slut-shaming, and suffrage to reckless child's play.\" Could you explain that further? Well, I think that as a writer expressing myself freely, allowing myself to freely write within the brain of Bob, that there is an argument to be made that Bob would find familiar, those two words put together, \"me too,\" the three-year-old who wants a toy because his brother got one is \"me too, me too.\" And so I think that's what that is. That's Bob singing.\n\nThe lines that follow-up that section of the poem ask if \"Due process has lost its sheen?\" After Steve Wynn resigned from his hotel and casino company over sexual-harassment allegations, Trump asked a similar question. What do you make of that overlap? A broken watch has perfect time once a day. There will always be alignments to be found. I think it's really, like most things, in the personality where the difference lies. So why things are said and in what context they're said. Certainly there is, in all of us, contradiction.\n\nDo you personally have criticism of how #MeToo has taken shape? I personally have hopes that it moves more into baby steps, simply because I want it to win. I fear that when groupthink becomes a media legislation of free speech, and a social media jury to convict anyone, it is no longer an American process, which is a due process. I think the greater issue here is that there are very serious changes that society needs to make to improve life for women, for homosexuals, for immigrants.\n\nIn 2016, you settled a defamation suit with director and producer Lee Daniels, who insinuated that you had been violent toward Madonna during your marriage. Has that experience affected your impression of #MeToo? Yeah. Listen, it wasn't only that. As militant as anybody chooses to be on any subject, so shall I be on my right to healthy skepticism. Skepticism is more necessary and valuable than any blind belief anybody has about anything. No matter what issue we're talking about, I believe every black person can have a point of view on a white person that is legitimate to express. Every man who has a point of view on women's issues, it is legitimate to express, and vice versa. We've got to be a \"we\" at some point. Once good intentions start forcing everybody into camps, the strategy is off. And then things get worse. We talk about trauma so quickly, and then all of a sudden you see what these 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds go through down there in Parkland. And then you think about what these kids are experiencing in Yemen. And if we get all one-issue about this sh-t and divide each other over it or the way we're allowed to talk about it, and people take some kind of high ground like only Danish princes can play Hamlet, then we've lost the joy of life.",

They told him not to congratulate Putin and instead he invited Putin to a get-together,\" he said. \"That's like if your wife says, 'Your buddy Carl creeps me out, I don't want him hanging around here anymore,' and you say, 'OK, totally got it, get it, problem solved -- asked him to move in with us.'\"",

The Duke of Cambridge was shown the ropes by young rising stars who play wheelchair basketball -- and even took a few shots at the hoop himself. When he sank a basket -- on his third try -- the crowd was enthusiastic in their cheers.\n\nSupporting him from the sidelines was none other than the Duchess of Cambridge, who is eight months pregnant and expecting their third royal baby sometime next month. In fact, this may very well be her final official public appearance before settling down to await the arrival of the new child. SportsAid has been a longtime cause for Princess Kate, as it supports athletes in financing their pursuits.\n\nWheelchair basketball, which is one of the events of the Summer Paralympic Games, will make be a part of the Commonwealth Games in 2022.",

                "body": "Medical bills can push patients over the financial cliff, but a new study says this may not happen as often as previous research suggests.\n\nHospitalizations cause only about 4 percent of personal bankruptcies among non-elderly U.S. adults, according to an analysis published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThis contrasts with previous research by former Harvard professor and current U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others that pointed to medical reasons as the trigger for more than 60 percent of U.S. bankruptcies.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tracked the credit reports of more than a half million adults under 65 in California who had a hospitalization between 2003 and 2007 that wasn't tied to childbirth. They found that hospitalizations clearly forced some patients into bankruptcy in the years following their stay, said study co-author Matthew Notowidigdo, a Northwestern University economist.\n\nIt just may not happen as frequently as the other research indicates.\n\n\"What causes bankruptcies is still somewhat unknown, but it appears that medical expenses are responsible for a much smaller share of them than previously thought,\" said co-author Raymond Kluender of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nResearchers also estimated that hospitalizations were responsible for only about 6 percent of bankruptcies among uninsured patients. They noted that hospitalization rates are lower in that patient group compared to the overall non-elderly population.\n\nThe new analysis included a broader range of people than earlier research, which focused on those who already had filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nSuch a narrow focus makes it \"impossible to infer the role of medical expenses in causing bankruptcy\" without information on those who had big medical bills and didn't sink financially, the authors of Wednesday's report noted.\n\nTheir study also had limitations: It focused only on adult patients from one state who were hospitalized.\n\nKluender said hospital stays often are the first event that triggers a \"chain of struggles with medical expenses and medical debt.\"\n\nThe research looked at hospitalizations that occurred several years before the federal Affordable Care Act expanded insurance coverage to millions of Americans.",

                "body": "It was almost exactly 50 years ago, in the Jun. 7, 1968, that TIME took a look at what it dubbed \"the year of student power.\"\n\nNow, as the new issue of the magazine looks at a new era of student power -- exemplified by the activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and their leadership of the #NeverAgain movement for stronger gun-control laws -- a note to readers from TIME's Editor in Chief Edward Felsenthal draws a parallel between these two moments in history.\n\n\"This generation of students has an instinct for humanity that may help redress what many of their elders concede is an imbalance in American life,\" the magazine noted back then, referring to the groundswell of opposition to the Vietnam War that spread from college campuses. It's that idea, Felsenthal notes, that could also apply to today.\n\nThe college class of '68 -- who graduated high school shortly after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and finished college in a watershed year that started out with the Tet Offensive and the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. -- \"tends to have a sober, even tragic view of life\" and \"combines an idealism with a cynicism about society's willingness to embrace their ideals,\" the magazine wrote. \"The graduates do not speak with a common voice but with common candor, sometimes naively and too glibly, often with a deep faith in the perfectibility of man.\"\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nTo see if that was still the case, TIME recently called up the Baby Boomer who was chosen to represent the nation's 630,000 college seniors on the cover. His name is Brian Weiss, and at the time he was a 21-year-old senior anthropology major at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Editor in Chief of the student newspaper the Daily Bruin. But, though the original story focused on cynical optimism, he says he's more accurately described as a \"rational pessimist,\" which is what TIME called his generation in a follow-up piece three years later.\n\n\"We were optimistic, at that point, that we could affect very substantial changes and I think that much of that has proved to not be possible,\" says the now 71-year-old \"still bearded\" writer, in a call from Pasadena, Calif. \"At that point, with the optimism of youth...we thought we would stop a war and perhaps stop all wars. I think we were successful in stopping a war. Clearly, [we] have not been successful at stopping all wars. Change, by and large, happens slowly.\"\n\nWhat they did do successfully, however, is show people that they couldn't rely on politicians to know all of the answers and trust that they'd look out for their best interests.\n\n\"I feel our legacy, our gift to the next generation, was a degree of awareness that has made the current high school movement a reality,\" he says. \"We collectively need to participate in our society, our government, and I think there's a greater perception today that people need to take action. We cannot simply stand by and think everything will take care of itself.\"",

The 10-second clip shows the hand of an adult off-screen holding what appears to be a cigarillo to the child's lips. The child then makes a cooing sound and appears to inhale before letting out a puff of smoke.\n\nThe Raleigh Police Department said Wednesday that the child was safe and the mother was in custody.\n\n\"Big thanks to everyone who posted information about the smoking mother and baby,\" department officials told their Facebook followers in a post. \"Thanks to your willingness to get involved, the child is now safe and the mother is in police custody.\"\n\nPolice spokeswoman Laura Hourigan confirmed in an email that officials were referring to the child seen in the video.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what substance the child was smoking, but the mother was charged with marijuana possession. Brianna Ashanti Lofton, 20, was also charged with two counts of felony child abuse, according to a police news release.\n\nThe baby was placed with the county's child protective services department. A phone listing for Lofton couldn't be found through a public records search.\n\nWhile police said multiple Facebook users alerted them to the video Wednesday morning, the account holder whose posting was seen by more than a million people said he's glad the child is now safe.\n\nThe user, who identified himself as Rasheed Martin of Rochester, New York, said he hasn't spoken directly with police, but he's satisfied that he helped raise awareness. His post prompted numerous comments by people worried about the child or upset with the mother.\n\nMartin said he doesn't know the mother and first found out about the video when a friend shared it online. He said he wanted the woman to be held responsible, so he reposted the video while urging his followers to help identify the woman.\n\n\"Once more and more people found out about this situation, they showed me a screenshot of her actual Facebook page,\" Martin said in in an online interview. \"Then I later added it to the post so everyone could know exactly who ... did that to the poor little girl.\"",

                "body": "(AUSTIN, Texas) -- The suspected Austin bomber is dead after terrorizing Texas' capital city for three weeks. And in the end the manhunt wasn't cracked by hundreds of phoned-in tips, the big pot of reward money or police pleading to the bomber through TV.\n\nOne of the largest bombing investigations in the U.S. since the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013 came to an intense close early Wednesday when authorities say they moved in on Mark Anthony Conditt at an interstate hotel. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said Conditt blew himself up after running his sport utility vehicle into a ditch.\n\nHere is what's known about how authorities finally zeroed in on the suspected bomber after 19 days, two dead victims and more than 1,000 calls of suspicious packages around the city:\n\nConditt had been careful to avoid cameras before entering a FedEx store in southwest Austin this week disguised in a blond wig and gloves, said U.S. House Homeland Security chairman Michael McCaul. The Austin congressman had been briefed by police, the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nMcCaul said going into the store was Conditt's \"fatal mistake.\" He said authorities previously had leads on a red truck and that the surveillance video from the FedEx store -- where Conditt is believed to have dropped off an explosive package destined for an Austin address -- allowed investigators to identify him and the truck.\n\nSaid Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, \"I'm not sure how much they narrowed him down to an exact person of who he was before he went into that FedEx store.\"\n\nAt the FedEx store, McCaul said investigators got from surveillance the truck license plate that linked the vehicle to Conditt, which in turn gave authorities a cellphone number they could track. McCaul said Conditt had powered down his phone for \"quite some time\" but that police closed in when he switched it back on.\n\n\"He turned it on, it pinged, and then the chased ensued,\" McCaul said.\n\nAbbott said police were able to closely monitor Conditt and his movements for about 24 hours before his death. The governor said the phone number was used to tie Conditt to bombing sites around Austin.\n\n\"The suspect's cellphone number showed up at each of the bombing sites as well as some key locations that helped them connect him to the crime,\" Abbott said.\n\nAuthorities say they also tracked down Conditt, a 23-year-old unemployed college dropout, through witness accounts and other purchases, including at a Home Depot where McCaul said the suspect bought nails and other bomb-making materials.\n\nAbbott said Conditt's purchases at the Home Depot also included five \"CHILDREN AT PLAY\" signs, one of which was used to rig a tripwire that was set off by two men Sunday in a southwest Austin neighborhood. One of them was walking and the other was riding a bike.\n\nWilliam Grote told The Associated Press that his grandson was one of the victims and had nails embedded in his legs from Sunday's explosion.\n\nThe batteries to power the bomb were purchased through the internet, McCaul said.\n\nThe initial bomber profile sketched out by FBI behavioral scientists was that he was most likely a white male, McCaul said. And while that part was right, the congressman said, a full psychological profile won't come together until investigators have time to comb through Conditt's writings and social media posts.\n\nConditt's motive is not clear. But on Wednesday, police discovered a 25-minute video recording on a cellphone found with Conditt, which Manley said he considers a \"confession\" to the bombings. Manley said it described the differences among the bombs in great detail.",

                "title": "Why Tai Chi Works So Well For Pain Relief",
                "body": "There are more questions than answers when it comes to fibromyalgia, or chronic pain. What doctors know is that it causes muscle pain throughout the body, fatigue, sleep problems and even psychological impairment and depression. What they don't know is what causes it and how best to treat its generalized symptoms.\n\nIn a new study published in the BMJ, researchers report encouraging results involving one way to reduce the painful effects of fibromyalgia: with tai chi, an ancient practice originating in martial arts that has since become part of traditional Chinese medicine. The mind-body practice involves both physical and psychological exercises that promote health. While small studies have suggested that tai chi could help reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia, no rigorous trial has compared tai chi's effect to those of currently recommended treatments for the condition, until now.\n\nIn the new study, scientists led by Dr. Chenchen Wang, director of the Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine at Tufts Medical Center, and her colleagues studied a group of 226 people with fibromyalgia for a year. For the first 12 to 24 weeks, they randomly assigned the volunteers to a currently recommended aerobic exercise regimen, or one of four tai chi sessions. They measured people's symptoms of physical pain and psychological effects of their condition at the start of the study and again at 12, 24 and 52 weeks.\n\nMORE: Here's How Practicing Tai Chi Can Help the Heart\n\nWang found that while all of the people reported fewer symptoms at the end of the year, all those in the tai chi groups reported more improvement in their symptom control than people in the aerobic exercise group after 24 weeks. And among those assigned to a tai chi regimen, people who practiced tai chi for a longer period of time showed greater improvement than those who did it for a shorter period.\n\n\"We think our results suggest that physicians should think about what type of exercise is best for their patients with fibromyalgia,\" says Wang. \"We found that tai chi was more enjoyable [for patients], there was a social connection and they could practice it at home by themselves with their family and friends.\"\n\nMORE: How Tai Chi Makes You Stronger\n\nWang measured a variety of things related to fibromyalgia, including the intensity of pain, people's ability to function, fatigue, how tired they felt in the morning, whether they were depressed, how well they could perform their job and how well they slept. Regardless of which exercise group they were assigned to, all of the people in the study continued to take whatever medications they were using, and over the year started to reduce the amount of pain killers, antidepressants, muscle relaxants and other drugs they were taking. The study did not involve enough people to determine if the tai chi groups showed greater reduction in their medication use than people in the aerobic exercise group, however.\n\nWhile it's not clear what causes chronic fatigue, doctors believe that being physically active can improve blood flow to the brain and body and may relieve a variety of symptoms, from depression to pain caused by inactive muscles and joints.\n\nWang says that tai chi may therefore be particularly useful for people with chronic fatigue, since it involves both the mind and body. People are taught to include meditative and relaxation skills in their movements. Many people with chronic pain are also not able to exercise due to their physical or psychological symptoms; some who start aerobic type exercises often stop. Indeed, those assigned to the tai chi classes in the study attended 62% of them, while people assigned to aerobic exercise attended 40% of their classes.\n\nWang says that doctors should consider tai chi as a possible treatment for people with fibromyalgia, especially since it appears to be easier to start and maintain. And if the improvements reported in the study are confirmed, more people with the condition may be able to improve their quality of life.",

                "title": "Why Facebook Needs Transparency to Protect Its Users  --  And Stay in Business",
                "body": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing calls to testify before Congress\n\n\"It is not easy to protect 1.4 billion people every day. But if Facebook wants to be the home where all those people share their likes and heartbreaks and plans and politics with acquaintances online, it had better try a lot harder.\"\n\nThat was the thrust of the news on March 17, when the Observer of London and the New York Times revealed that analytics firm Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data from 50 million Facebook accounts. The company, which worked with both Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump on their 2016 presidential campaigns, then attempted to build psychological profiles of potential voters -- with the hopes of using them to determine whom to target.\n\nBut in this case, unlike other recent privacy breakdowns -- like the Equifax data breach that put 145.5 million accounts at risk -- thieves or hackers did not steal information. The company actually just handed the data over, then didn't watch where it went. As Facebook itself reported, Aleksandr Kogan, the academic researcher who first obtained the information through an app he developed, did so \"in a legitimate way and through proper channels\" and violated Facebook's policies only when he passed it on to Cambridge Analytica. The social network was also under the impression until recently that the harvested data had been deleted, but the Times says it has viewed a set of it. Right now, it's not clear who else can see the data.\n\nRead more: Want to Fix Facebook? That'll Cost You About $75 a Year\n\nAll This has prompted sharp criticism of the company, which meticulously tracks its users but failed to keep track of where information about the lives and thinking of those people went. Facebook's shares were down by 6.8% in the first business day after the reports. Lawmakers in both the U.S. and Britain, where Cambridge Analytica did similar work ahead of the Brexit referendum, have demanded testimony from Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg; in an interview with CNN, Zuckerberg responded to a question about whether he would go before Congress by saying, \"The short answer is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to do.\" The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general have reportedly begun investigations. On the site itself, many users mused, Why are we still here? This all comes at a time when the company reported that it had seen a decrease in daily active users in the U.S. and Canada for the first time -- from 185 million to 184 million -- in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nBecause Kogan obtained the data through legitimate channels, preventing such a scenario from happening again isn't as simple as patching a bug or boosting Facebook's security infrastructure. A fix would require Facebook to be stricter with its actual customers: developers and advertisers of all kinds, from retailers to political groups, who pay to know what you have revealed about yourself. But it will need to keep a closer eye on who can see what, even if that results in repercussions for its other partners. Facebook invites you to chronicle your life through its platforms, especially your most cherished moments. There is a natural expectation that a space with such precious material will be guarded. As Zuckerberg said in a statement that in part pledged to restrict developers' access to data: \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\"\n\nThere's another group in need of urgent introspection: users. In an era in which we tell companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon what groceries we eat, whom we're in touch with and where we're going (at a minimum), users themselves need to actually demand to know to whom their information is being sent and how they will use it, in a way that is readable and accessible. There's no single obvious answer for preventing future data abuse, but one lesson is evident: Facebook needs to be more transparent with its users when their data is being exploited, and users themselves should be much more vigilant about the personal details they're willing to share. \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\" Senator Amy Klobuchar posted to Twitter. (Although even she expressed to Vice News Tonight skepticism that lawmakers will change the system ahead of this year's elections, suspecting some will want one last election cycle with these tools in hand.)\n\nRead more: Mark Zuckerberg Just Revealed 3 Steps Facebook Is Taking to Address the Cambridge Analytica Crisis\n\nUsers may not invest in Facebook with cash. Instead, we offer invisible things: our emotions, our interests, our time and, in the end, our trust. As Facebook asks for more and more of us as it expands, from its messenger apps to virtual reality to Instagram, we must ask, Why do we trust what we know so little about? Especially when what we do know is that the site profits off our interests? We need to value our minds and lives at least as much as the advertisers and politicians do.",

                "title": "Krysten Ritter on the Righteous Anger of Jessica Jones and #MeToo",
                "body": "Krysten Ritter in Marvel's Jessica Jones David Giesbrecht -- Netflix\n\nJessica Jones star Krysten Ritter thinks creator Melissa Rosenberg can predict the future. The gritty Netflix superhero series was the first of its ilk to get political: The first season tackled abusive relationships, and the second season, now on Netflix, deals with bad men, too. Rosenberg even wrote a specific subplot about a male movie producer who takes advantage of young girls. But the show finished filming long before the Harvey Weinstein allegations emerged or #MeToo went viral.\n\n\"Melissa was just writing what we all experience as women,\" Ritter says. \"Maybe now that we're talking about it, this s-t won't stand anymore.\"\n\nJessica Jones' emotionally resonant storytelling and political perspective paved the way for other superheroes to get political: Logan surprised audience with its examination of immigration policy, Black Panther and Luke Cage both took on issues of race and Wonder Woman tackled sexism. Now the show is back, and it has plenty more to say. Ritter spoke to TIME about the show's politics and plot twists.\n\nTIME: The first season was was dominated by Kilgrave, Jessica's obsessive, mind-controlling ex. He's largely absent from the second season. How does that change the show?\n\nKrysten Ritter: Obviously, we don't want to tell the same story. We don't want to repeat ourselves. But the Kilgrave character and the mark he left on Jessica is really in the front of my mind all of the time. I try to layer what Jessica has gone through into the performance. The trauma she experienced affects everything. It affects how she walks, how she speaks, how she drinks, how she relates to her friends, how she hates herself. It's always there.\n\nDoes carrying all that take a toll?\n\nIt is dark, and it is a role that I really sink into. But that's the work you dream of as an actor. I create playlists for myself. It's a lot of depressing, dark music.\n\nThis season, the show deals with the themes of #MeToo. But the show actually finished filming before #MeToo ever trended on Twitter.\n\nSometimes I think [our showrunner] Melissa Rosenberg has a crystal ball. In season one, there was this scene where Kilgrave tells Jessica to smile. That came out around the same time as that video that went viral of the woman walking around New York City with all these men catcalling her and telling her to smile.\n\nThis season, we have a small storyline where [Jessica's friend] Trish has to face a movie producer that took advantage of her when she was younger and has since taken of advantage of other young girls. It's a very uncanny parallel to #MeToo.\n\nThese issues aren't new, unfortunately. Melissa was just writing what we all experience as women. Maybe now that we're talking about it, this shit won't stand anymore.\n\nLots of shows depict rape and assault. Why do you think the way Jessica Jones deals with those issues resonates with people?\n\nPeople are connecting with Jessica because she is outwardly expressing her anger about it. She's pissed off. [Trish's] story does not involve her, but she's a victim of sexual assault herself. I think it triggers an anger that has been lying dormant. The fact that he's hurting other women makes her completely flip out and punch a hole in a car.\n\nJessica Jones hired all female directors this season, which is rare for television. Why was that important for the show?\n\nThat's the DNA of our show. The showrunner is a woman. Half our writers are woman. The star is a woman. Melissa is always trying to make sure that we're bucking stereotypes, even the way that she creates people in the background.\n\nShe wanted to make sure that we were doing 50-50. They started interviewing people and realizing that there are a lot of women that would be a great fit. And then they just decided to do an all-female team. I feel so proud that our show did that. It's proof that it's really not that difficult to do.\n\nDoes it make a difference for you as an actor?\n\nThere was a real collaborative feel on set. Seeing all these badass women behind the camera is inspiring.\n\nAnd when I have to do a sex scene, having that conversation with a woman is just so much easier. Like, \"Okay you want to see this much of my butt? You want to put my arm here? Let's do it.\" It's just a quicker, franker conversation when you can have it with another woman.\n\nBut at a certain point you don't even think about the gender of your director. Now, I can sit back and think, we did something so amazing. On the day, you don't think about the gender of your director.\n\nWonder Woman premiered between seasons one and two of Jessica Jones. Since then, there's been a push to bring more female superheroes to the screen. Has that lifted the burden off Jessica as the only female superhero with her own TV show?\n\nJessica doesn't think of herself as a superhero. Her superpowers are a secondary thing. I sometimes even forget what we're doing a superhero show. Her concerns are very real-world problems and trauma.\n\nShe's a very different kind of character than Wonder Woman, but women can relate to both of them in totally different ways. That's awesome. There is room to celebrate both as wildly different as they are.\n\nGod knows there are a million different types of male superheroes in movies and TV.\n\nAnd there's a million types of women in life. We're big and we're small. We're happy and we're sad. We're naïve and we're jaded. There's a million types of women that fans can connect to in very personal ways.\n\nHow is Jessica different from other superheroes in general?\n\nWhat we're doing with Jessica is totally new for the genre. Alias by Brian Michael Bendis, where Jessica Jones originated, was the first R-rated comic book. The first word in the comic book is \"f-k.\" There is an anal sex scene in the comic book.\n\nThe show is more adult, too. She doesn't wear a costume. She wears jeans and boots and a leather jacket. She's an alcoholic. She has sex. She hates herself. She has PTSD. She's prickly and not likable all the time. She's very vulnerable.\n\nJessica knocks back a lot of whiskey in the show. What are you drinking when Jessica takes shots?\n\nIt's usually peppermint tea. We've perfected the look and the color. For me, because I consume mass amounts, I can't be drinking Coca-Cola all the time.\n\nJessica drinks viciously because it takes a lot to get her drunk. It takes five times the amount for her to get drunk. That's why she's always throwing it back so violently -- because it pisses her off that she can't just get drink.",

                "body": "Fire safety manufacturer Kidde has issued a recall covering nearly 500,000 dual sensor smoke alarms after finding that a malfunction in the devices puts them at risk for not alerting people to fires.\n\nThe recall, issued on March 21, affects about 452,000 smoke alarms in the U.S. and about 40,000 units in Canada. The devices are under recall because a yellow cap left on the smoke alarms during the manufacturing process could cover one of the detector's smoke sensors, potentially blocking its ability to detect smoke and warn people of a fire in their houses.\n\nThus far, Kidde has received one report of a yellow cap being included on a smoke alarm before it was installed in a home. There have been no reports of injuries or other incidents.\n\nAccording to Kidde, the affected models include PI2010 and PI9010. The devices should have \"KIDDE\" printed on the front center with the model number and date printed on the back.\n\nCustomers who have the Kidde models under recall are urged to check their smoke alarms for the presence of a yellow cap. If the cap is present, they should contact Kidde immediately for instructions on getting a free replacement smoke alarm and wait until it arrives to discard the faulty detector.\n\nKidde said customers should not try to take the smoke alarm apart, open the casing or try to remove the yellow cap -- just wait until the replacement arrives. If your smoke detector doesn't have a yellow cap inside, there is no need to change anything.\n\nThe U.S. Fire Administration advises people to check their smoke detectors at least once a month and replace the batteries twice a year, saying that three out of five home fire deaths occur because the affected houses did not have working smoke alarms.",

                "title": "Mercury Is Entering Retrograde Again. This Is Why So Many People Care",
                "body": "A picture taken in Turkey's Van province shows the sun as Mercury (seen as a small dot) passes between Earth and the sun on May 09, 2016.\n\nAt the end of this week, shortly after 7:00 Thursday evening Eastern time, the planet Mercury will enter apparent retrograde motion, marking the beginning of a three-week span of misfortune down on Earth. At least, that is, according to proponents of astrology, who have made the phrase \"Mercury in retrograde\" (or the more grammatically correct \"Mercury retrograde\") an increasingly buzzy phrase over the past few years.\n\nRetrograde motion is when a planet appears, when observed from Earth, to reverse direction. This happens due to an optical illusion caused by differences in orbit. In the realm of astrology, retrograde motion has negative connotations. Because Mercury is the planet said to rule communication, those who are astrologically inclined expect frequent misunderstandings, scheduling problems and disagreements with friends during this period. Since Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system, it enters apparent retrograde motion between three and four times a year, for about three weeks at a time. The frequency makes it an ideal scapegoat for any sort of misfortune, so much so that there is a whole website devoted to the question of whether today is one of those days -- the aptly named www.ismercuryinretrograde.com -- that one can visit to seek validation on a particularly bad day.\n\nRetrograde motion is not new to astrology or astronomy. In fact, it was one of the earliest mysteries that confounded ancient stargazers. Yet, public interest in the subject is experiencing a relatively new boom, as evidenced by Google queries for the question \"is Mercury in retrograde,\" which has seen considerable viral growth since 2009.\n\nSo, what exactly is the reason for this newfound popularity?\n\nAstrology is quite popular among young Americans, with more than half of 18-24-year-olds believing that it is a science, according to a National Science Foundation poll conducted in 2014. But, while some scientific studies may appear to be linked to astrology -- for example, a recent study showed the demonstrated effects of birth season on personality -- there are no scientific studies showing that who a person is has anything to do with their natal chart. Yet as evidenced by the plethora of memes, apps and horoscopes found across the web, astrology is a cultural mainstay for the internet age, regardless of whether it is \"real\" or not.\n\nBut, while many have jumped to label the astrology boom as another millennial trend, that may not actually be the case. According to Nicholas Campion, a historian of cultural astrology at the University of Wales who spoke with TIME, it is difficult to say whether fascination with star signs is any more prevalent than it has been in the past, since studies on the popularity of astrology weren't conducted until recent years. While those numbers will never be known, looking at the history of popular astrology, changes in technology have a significant influence on how people engage with astrological insight.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nAlthough humans have been attempting to divine meaning meaning from planetary movement since ancient times, sun sign astrology -- the type of astrology most people in the West are familiar with today -- got its start in the 1930s. The earliest horoscope that offered insight based on a reader's birthday was published in the British newspaper, the Sunday Express, in 1930 by astrologer R.H. Naylor. However, it was a magazine called American Astrology that published the first 12-paragraph horoscope explicitly tying birth date to signs in the zodiac. Before then, almanacs were the chosen way for people to get premonitory knowledge, but not with the same degree of personalization. According to Campion, the language of identifying as a particular sign really began in the 1930s.\n\nThe appeal of personalized fortune-telling that was readily available to the public became a continual phenomenon throughout the rest of the century. Encouraged by their ability to drive sales, more and more publications started running horoscopes, including The Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times and numerous tabloid publications.\n\nIn the 1960s, interest in astrology was again heightened by the release of Linda Goodman's Sun Signs, a best-seller that expanded on the notion of identifying with a particular sign. The book contained long passages describing romantic compatibility, how each figure in the zodiac handles money, and how to interact with employers based on their signs. Horoscopes experienced another resurgence in the '80s, when newspapers created call lines that allowed people to phone in to receive personalized horoscopes.\n\nThe inauspicious connotations of Mercury retrograde are actually quite old, evidenced in an ancient branch of astrology known as horary astrology. A person would pose a question, and an astrologer would determine an answer by consulting an astrological chart for the moment the question was asked. If Mercury were in retrograde, it would elicit a negative response. \"A typical phrase that was used in relation to horary questions during mercury retrograde was 'nothing will come of it,' [meaning that] nothing will come of the question asked,\" Campion says.\n\nIn the 1980s, Campion noticed a trend to revive and adapt older forms of astrology, and through that, the once specific meaning of Mercury retrograde became more broad. \"People started to apply it to everything,\" he adds.\n\nNow, decades later, just as newspapers and call lines previously changed how people interacted with popular astrology, the Internet has made it possible for people to readily access more complex astronomical data.\n\nIn the past, the average person would have to be a diligent amateur astronomer in order to observe retrograde motion. Now, all it requires is a quick web search. This is also why people are more familiar with their \"rising signs,\" which are based on time of birth and geographic location. What used to require a consultation with astrologer can now be easily found out by an online calculator. And it's likely no coincidence that the increased awareness of astrology starting around 2009 corresponds to the social media boom that year, as Facebook and Twitter became key sources for news. It was only a matter of time until articles about Mercury retrograde began to circulate, and the Internet's favorite excuse for when things go wrong was born. As history has shown, when journalism changes, astrology does too.",

                "title": "Putin Won. But Russia Is Losing",
                "body": "Vladimir Putin may have been re-elected president of Russia on March 18, but he's far from the grand master of geopolitical chess portrayed in the Western media. Whether bragging about Russia's \"invincible\" new missile, playing coy over accusations that his hackers play games with foreign elections or that his spies murder opponents in faraway places, the Russian President seems intent on restaging the Cold War-but without the military reach or global ideological appeal that made the Soviet Union a formidable foe.\n\nWhat has Putin really won? Today's Russia has an economy smaller than that of Canada. Its entire military budget is less than the extra money President Donald Trump wants Congress to spend on U.S. defense. It has no NATO allies, and it counts countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Serbia among its few reliable friends. China makes occasional deals with Russia but only at a Chinese price.\n\nWhile Putin wants the world to see him as a strong, decisive leader, he often fails to understand the full impact of his actions. Looking at the foreign policy fights he has picked, it's clear that he is a shrewd short-term tactician and a lousy long-term strategist.\n\nLet's begin with Ukraine. In response to the public protests in 2014 that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych-Russia's man in Kiev-Putin ordered Russian troops into action. Seizing Crimea gave Putin a trophy at the West's expense and boosted his tough-guy reputation. But freeing Ukraine of its most pro-Moscow region eased the way for Ukrainian nationalists to win the country's elections and left Russia responsible for paying pensions in a place full of pensioners. Meanwhile, the Russian navy gained nothing of strategic value in Crimea; it already had a base on that peninsula. For all this, Putin invited sanctions from the U.S. and Europe-which contributed to a drop in Russia's GDP from 2014 to 2015 that the World Bank put at 35%.\n\nNor did Putin win the hearts and minds of the people he tried to subdue. His move to destabilize Ukraine's eastern regions led an entire generation of Ukrainians-too young to remember life in an empire governed by Moscow-to believe that Russia was their country's bitter enemy. Ukraine may not move quickly toward the E.U. or NATO, but there is now a deep determination among many Ukrainians to never again serve as Russia's junior partner. Putin may well be remembered as the Russian who lost Ukraine.\n\nWhat about other former Soviet republics? The Baltic states-Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia-have long since turned to the West; NATO troops are even stationed there now, a direct result of Russia's continued antagonism. Azerbaijan and the Central Asian states are more interested in long-term ties with rising China than with rusting Russia. If there is a dominant power in central Asia today, it's strategic and hungry Beijing-to Moscow's increasing chagrin.\n\nIn his quest for influence, Putin can look to Syrian President Bashar Assad, Russia's only reliable Middle East partner, to claim victory over former U.S. President Barack Obama. Russia will now get to keep its one Mediterranean naval base. But to what end? Deeper involvement in the Middle East is not a good thing for a country with a stagnant economy that already spends too much on its military.\n\nPutin's worst decision was the green light he gave his intelligence services to play with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It wasn't a surprising move; manipulation and sabotage are art forms in which any former KGB lieutenant colonel will take pride. Putin wanted to bring the U.S. down a peg, and he hated Hillary Clinton. No evidence has yet emerged that Putin made Trump President, but the U.S. intelligence community and lawmakers of both parties are now focused on threats posed by Russia. Yet in spite of Trump's fascinating refusal to criticize Putin, Russia's President has gained nothing of value from the U.S. President. Only Putin's failure to understand the checks and balances at the heart of the U.S. political system explains his apparent belief that Trump could override all objections to his would-be Russia reset. Sanctions aren't going away. Now that Russia's secret services stand accused of brazenly poisoning Sergei Skripal, a former double agent exiled in the U.K., more may be coming.\n\nPutin's adventurism has so far helped divert the attention of the Russian public away from endemic corruption and economic stagnation at home. There, his one lasting achievement is ensuring the independence of the country's central bank and stashing away money in reserve funds during good times for use in bad times.\n\nRussia is slowly emerging from two years of recession, mainly because oil prices have enjoyed a modest recovery. But as Putin begins his fourth term as President, he'll face a stark reality: Russia remains as deeply dependent on oil prices as when he took office a generation ago. Ten years ago, the oil price climbed to $147 per barrel, and Russian living standards and self-confidence rose with it. Since then, the price has fallen to less than half that amount and looks set to remain there for the foreseeable future. And the U.S. is at the heart of a revolutionary shift in energy markets: technological innovation in crude oil and natural gas production has helped the U.S. rival Russia and keep prices much lower than during the commodity boom of the past decade.\n\nThere's no evidence that Russia will adjust to this new reality by finally diversifying its economy. Even today, about 80% of Russia's exports are directly related to oil and gas, according to the Carnegie Center in Moscow. It will slowly become harder for Russians to maintain their standard of living, and the state will have less money to spend on both guns and butter. Recent efforts to create a Russian version of Silicon Valley have produced little. That's in part because Russia's smartest and most talented minds have every reason to leave the country in search of better opportunities.\n\nPutin should enjoy his victory celebration while it lasts. He and his country don't have much else on the horizon.",

                "body": "Claire Foy and Juno Temple cling to sanity -- barely -- in Unsane Bleecker Street\n\nSteven Soderbergh is one of those directors who can do anything-which doesn't necessarily mean he should. His latest experiment, the psychological thriller Unsane, was shot on iPhones, which is probably the one thing most people will remember about it 10 years from now. The story-featuring Claire Foy (The Crown) as a woman who, after being traumatized by a stalker, suddenly finds herself involuntarily committed to a mental hospital-has a modest, workaday tenseness. Written by Jonathan Bernstein and James Greer, it keeps you guessing, but only up to a point. Not even its grisliest twists pack the wallop they should.\n\nBut Soderbergh's semifailures are more interesting than a lot of other director's successes. That's why Unsane isn't easily dismissible, especially if you think of it as just one fragment of the wild terrazzo of Soderbergh's career, which includes jaggedly brilliant genre classics like The Limey and offbeat crowd-pleasers like Magic Mike. The movie is worth seeing for its craftsmanship alone. As the heroine faces down the man who may or may not be her former tormentor-played, with unnerving innocuousness, by Joshua Leonard-Soderbergh makes clever use of wide-angle lenses to tease out shivers of paranoia. The whole thing looks the way a buzzing fluorescent light sounds-it's subliminally discombobulating. This is what makes Soderbergh different from you and me: while we're zoning out on Candy Crush, he's working out how to make a feature with a minuscule budget and an even smaller camera. Unsane may not be his greatest work, but it's still a rebuke to time wasters everywhere.",

                "title": "What Nelson Mandela Would Have Seen in President Trump",
                "body": "In 2018, the late Nelson Mandela would have turned 100 years old. In honor of his centennial, Penguin Random House is re-issuing my book Mandela's Way, now with a new introduction, which is excerpted here.\n\nNelson Mandela was born a century ago and died in 2013. He never owned a smartphone. He never typed a word on a laptop. I'm not even sure he knew what the Internet was. Yet he is the author of the most popular Tweet of all time.\n\nAfter the violence of right-wing groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, former President Barack Obama posted a series of threaded Tweets that read: '\"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love...For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\" -- Nelson Mandela.'\n\nThe Tweets were liked more than seven-and-a-half million times.\n\nThe lines come from the final chapter of Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. They reflect his conclusion, after a lifetime of fighting discrimination and experiencing it first-hand, that prejudice is not innate but learned. The words resonated in part because they offered a profound contrast to the anger and moral equivocation of President Donald Trump, who suggested that both sides -- the neo-fascists and those who opposed them -- were in the wrong. Mandela knew hate for what it was, but his vision that we can rise above it struck a chord. (And, of course, Barack Obama had something to do with it...)\n\nBut the words also reflected the fundamental principles of Mandela's approach to leadership -- principles which seem to be in short supply these days: forgiveness, understanding, empathy. Mandela, more than any other global figure, is known for forgiving his enemies. He never hated the hater; he did not attack the attacker. When his enemies went low, he went high. In the sentence that immediately follows the one Obama quoted, Mandela writes that even in prison he could see \"a glimmer of humanity\" in his guards. A few paragraphs later, just before the end of the book, he says that he ultimately realized that to free his own people he needed to emancipate those who had imprisoned them. \"The oppressor,\" he wrote, \"must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed.\"\n\nBut such sentiments are increasingly scarce. The Charlottesville gathering of white-supremacists and neo-Nazi groups is a symptom not only of the rise of ethnic-nationalism and authoritarianism in America, but its surge across the globe. Strongmen around the world are deliberately stoking hate and persecution. According to the non-profit Freedom House, last year was the 11th consecutive year of decline of global freedom, meaning more countries retreated from democracy than advanced toward it. Populist and nationalist political forces, Freedom House asserted, made astonishing gains in democratic states while authoritarian nations consolidated power and ratcheted up global aggression.\n\nIndeed, the largest and least-anticipated trend in global politics since the fall of the Berlin Wall has been the rise of non-democratic states and authoritarian rule. When the Wall fell, the scholar Francis Fukiyama famously prophesized \"the end of history,\" suggesting that in the future there would be no rivals to the ascendancy of liberal democracy. Instead, history has returned with a vengeance. From Russia to Venezuela, from China to Burundi, from Turkey to Hungary, we have seen the return of blood and borders, nationalism and autocracy, tribalism and religious sectarianism. \"America First\" -- with its echoes of pre-war isolationism and anti-Semitism -- is evidence of this in our own country. Nationalist forces everywhere are pushing back against immigration and diversity, against anyone who looks different or worships a different God. Democracy is in retreat.\n\nI cannot tell you how troubled Nelson Mandela would be by all of this. Mandela's vision was of non-racial democracy, the idea that human rights and rule of law could and should triumph over narrow-mindedness and prejudice. Despite all that he suffered -- 27 years behind bars -- he was a natural optimist who assumed that people were decent until proven otherwise.\n\nThis trend toward autocracy represents everything he fought against during his own long life. Mandela saw and experienced ethnic authoritarianism first-hand -- it was called apartheid. Apartheid was iron-fisted autocratic rule based on white supremacy and the systematic repression of people of color.\n\nHe would have recognized Donald Trump and seen him as a reincarnation of those bumptious apartheid leaders who were ethnic nationalists and only represented those who looked and thought like them. He would certainly have bridled at Trump's description of Africa as \"shithole\" countries and seen it as an example of the kind of Western myopia and imperialism he spent a lifetime fighting against. Mandela's highest praise for a leader was \"measured.\" I don't know the right word to describe Donald Trump, but it is the opposite of \"measured.\"\n\nMandela would see today's global nationalism for what it is: a return to a noxious form of tribalism. Tribalism was the animating principle behind grand apartheid which divided South Africa into ten tribal \"homelands.\" The spurious and deceptive logic of the white oppressors was that black South Africans were violently fractured along tribal and ethnic lines and that the white masters needed to keep them separate to maintain peace (apartheid's \"divide-and-rule\" strategy).\n\nMandela understood tribalism. He was raised by the king of the Thembu tribe. Until the end of his life, he loved and appreciated the Thembu's tribal traditions. Even as the African National Congress (ANC) sought to move beyond tribalism -- a move he supported -- Mandela always sought to show respect to tribal leaders. I remember going with him to a remote part of the Transkei to meet with a tribal leader who had once been a rival of his and who greeted Mandela while sitting on a leopard-skin throne. He was sometimes criticized for this kind of deference. But he thought a truly democratic South Africa had to unite not only white and black, but tribal traditionalists and the young urban blacks who rejected them.\n\nWhile Mandela respected tribal traditions, he also saw their limits. \"Divide-and-rule\" was a strategy that Mandela always sought to expose. Ultimately, he regarded tribalism as a kind of prison, as a barrier to a democratic and free South Africa, and indeed, to a democratic and free Africa as a whole. During the apartheid years, the ANC aimed to unite all the different tribes of South Africa around the larger struggle for freedom. Mandela and others at the ANC believed that what united black South Africans in their collective freedom struggle was far greater than what divided them. And the modern non-racial South Africa that Mandela created is an embodiment of that idea. To him, the future of his nation was people identifying with the new democratic South Africa above any tribe or region or ethnicity.\n\nThe rise of leaders who exploit tribalism and preach ethnic nationalism would have alarmed him. They mirror the old apartheid leaders whom he fought against. One of the hallmarks of this type of authoritarian leader is \"double down-ism;\" the idea that even in the face of new and contradictory evidence, they will not change their minds for fear it shows weakness. Don't get me wrong -- Mandela could be bull-headed. But often his stubbornness was the last reflex of an old position before he changed to a new one. If there was new data, he would reevaluate. He liked to quote John Maynard Keynes: \"When the information changes, I change my mind. What do you do?\"\n\nBut there was one thing about which he would not compromise: freedom for his people. Everything else was negotiable. He saw autocratic leaders as being the opposite: men with no over-arching principle other than their own survival. The autocrat refuses to compromise -- that's his only value. It was that type of leader who became the model of the African autocrat who refuses to ever cede power. When Mandela voluntarily chose not to run for re-election as president of South Africa, it was a message to autocrats everywhere: strength is not protecting one's power at all costs but willingly relinquishing it.\n\nFor Mandela, projecting strength was not about the closed fist but the open hand. Vengeance was about looking backwards, and one had to let go of one's grievance or else one was a prisoner of it. Even in his famous 1964 courtroom speech, as he was about to be sentenced to life imprisonment, he said, \"During my lifetime, I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination.\" He was not simply against the oppression of Africans -- he was against oppression, period. In a darkening world, this kind of enlightened and generous leadership is a beacon. The world would be a better, safer, saner place if leaders could only follow Mandela's Way.",

                "body": "The actor and Saturday Night Live veteran makes his directorial debut with the dark comedy series Barry (debuting March 25 on HBO), co-created by Alec Berg. Hader stars as a dejected assassin who follows a mark to an acting class and decides to make a career pivot.\n\nHow do you find the humor in a story about a depressed hit man?\n\nAlec and I both come out of comedy, so we can't help but not take certain things too seriously. Barry goes to meet with Chechen mobsters, and I don't like when there are just bad guys-everyone has their reasons-so we opened those characters more. It turned into, \"Oh, what if the mobster's henchman was kind of like a guy from the Apple Genius Bar?\"\n\nHow are Barry's two roles -- assassin and actor -- connected?\n\nAs a hit man you have to be in the shadows and anonymous and emotionally dead inside, but to be an actor you have to live in the spotlight and be known and totally accessing your emotions all the time. The more we explored it, the more the idea held water. The hit man world and being an actor is similar in the sense that you're traveling a lot, you're living out of a suitcase, and as exciting as it all is it's actually a lot of time alone in a city you don't know and a lot of waiting around.\n\nWhat would you say to people concerned about depicting gun violence?\n\nOur show does not glorify it. It shows it for what it is: brutal and sad. One of my favorite parts is when [a dead character's] dad shows up and Barry's like, \"Oh, right, these people have families that love them.\" If Barry's purpose is to get out of that world, that world should be awful.\n\nIs directing your big dream?\n\nThat was the thing I moved to Los Angeles to do- be a director and writer-and I kind of fell into acting and performing. A lot of directing is making people feel secure in what they're doing-and if it's not working, being honest. It always sucks when a director is telling you, \"That's great!\" when you know it was terrible.\n\nYou were famously anxious on SNL-are you still?\n\nIt's there the minute you walk into 30 Rock. There's no second take, so if you screw up a joke, that's it. And I've done that-a lot.\n\nYou're known for your skill with impressions. Is there anyone you've tried to do but can't get?\n\nThere's a ton where I'd say, \"Oh, put me in as someone else.\" I'm known for impressions but I can really only do a handful of people. I can never do Christopher Walken -- a lot of people can, but I can never figure him out. And Jeff Goldblum. It's harder to find the handle on more modern-day actors, the thing you can grab on to and exploit in an impersonation. I remember one time -- and nothing against him -- but I had to do an impression of Robert Pattinson, and I was like, \"Well, it's more of just a look and a British accent.\" It wasn't like doing Cary Grant. These were the problems we had at SNL.\n\nWhy don't you use social media?\n\nI'm semifamous and on talk shows, so I don't know what social media would be good for, and I like a certain degree of privacy. Right before I was about to go on Twitter [for Trainwreck], my publicist said, \"I kind of don't like you on Twitter. Do you want to be doing this?\" I said no, and he said don't do it.\n\nWhat's New York's hottest club right now?\n\nI don't know-I don't go out to clubs. I'm not taking the bait. But I appreciate the effort.",

                "title": "Wes Anderson's 'Isle of Dogs' Beauty Gets Lost in Its Own Ambition",
                "body": "Boss, from Isle of Dogs: his voice belongs to Bill Murray Fox Searchlight\n\nMovies that were a lot of work to make shouldn't be a lot of work to watch. But Wes Anderson's ambitious yet faltering stop-motion adventure Isle of Dogs sentences us to hard labor every minute: not a moment goes by when we're not reminded how much cleverness, how much painstaking planning, how much meticulous manipulation went into this doggo-dystopia fable set in Japan some 20 years in the future.\n\nIn this bleak new world, Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura), the cruel mayor of a city called Megasaki, has banished all dogs, sending them to almost certain death on remote Trash Island. A mystery ailment known as snout fever has infected the canine population, and could pose a threat to humans as well. To prove that he means business, Kobayashi makes his family's own dog, a speckled cutie named Spots (Liev Schreiber), the first exile. Spots, it turns out, is the beloved bodyguard and best friend of a stout-hearted lad named Atari (Koyu Rankin). Atari flies to Trash Island in a stolen plane, hoping to rescue his pal. He crash-lands, and a motley crew of mutts-their voices belong to a fine group of actors including Bill Murray, Edward Norton and Bryan Cranston-befriend him warily and agree to help.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Megasaki, a group of student activists including American exchange student Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig), a freckled powerhouse with a blond bouffant, strive to prove that snout fever is really a government conspiracy. And by the time you've processed all the plot threads crisscrossing the Isle of Dogs landscape, you're likely to be as confused as a pup who's lost his sense of smell.\n\nThere's no doubt that Isle of Dogs was a labor of love, and some of its visuals are terrific: the movie opens with a prologue outlining the (fictional) history of dogs in Japan, from wild things roaming free to docile house pets-the story is told partly through a series of inventive faux woodblock prints featuring canines of all shapes, sizes and colors, and my feelings about the rest of the movie notwithstanding, I'd wallpaper my whole living room with these in a heartbeat. Plus, Anderson dots the movie with witty touches: every once in a while, one of the flu-sickened dogs will offer a distracted little cough, like an asterisk-it's a funny, charming effect.\n\nBut Isle of Dogs is so packed with detail that the terrific ones barely stand out. Its dog characters are well-designed-they have wiry, dusty coats and expressive heart-shaped noses-but its human characters, with their waxy skin and glassy eyes, are off-putting. And while you can sense some political undertones whirring beneath the surface, Anderson fails to bring them into focus. It's all too bad: Anderson's 2009 Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't just one of the finest stop-motion-animation movies ever made, but also a glorious film, period. Isle of Dogs, on the other hand, buckles under the weight of its own finicky whimsy. By the end, you might feel exhausted, like a border collie who's worn a circular groove in the carpet. And you didn't even make the movie-you only watched it.",

                "body": "\"This generation of students has an instinct for humanity that may help redress what many of their elders concede is an imbalance in American life.\" So TIME wrote in a cover story 50 years ago profiling young leaders from the class of 1968. \"The year of student power,\" we called it then, in a phrase that might just as well apply to this week's story about the students in Parkland, Fla., whose justifiable anger and grit have jolted the dormant gun debate from its sleep.\n\nIn a matter of five weeks, the young voices of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have changed minds and even laws. Florida, Rhode Island and Oregon tightened gun restrictions. Giant retailers stopped selling assault-style weapons. Longtime corporate partners ended relationships with the National Rifle Association. And hundreds of thousands of people are expected to flood the streets on March 24 for March for Our Lives, an event conceived and organized by kids. As my own children's head of school put it in a letter to shaken parents, \"We are all going to school at Stoneman Douglas.\"\n\nAmerica's gun-violence epidemic is complex, and won't be solved quickly. Clearly the Second Amendment doesn't require that a gun be easier to obtain than a driver's license; the Constitution's drafters feared tyranny, but they also feared chaos. And yet reform efforts are doomed if safe and responsible gun owners (I come from a family of them myself) are shut out of the discussion.\n\nOne of history's rhymes is that social change begins with the young; another is that change will be imperfect. \"Partial victory\" is how Brian Weiss, the student featured on that 1968 cover (right), now describes his generation's efforts. But in the face of unremitting gun violence in the most developed country on earth-more than 90% of the people under 25 killed by firearms in all high-income countries are from the U.S.-inaction is inexcusable.\n\nYoung people know this instinctively. TIME national correspondent Charlotte Alter, who reported and wrote this week's cover story, says it well: \"This story isn't just about guns. This story is about kids.\" And, I would add, about hope.",

                "title": "6 Real Ways to We Can Reduce Gun Violence in America",
                "body": "The Sunrise Tactical Shop in Coral Springs, Florida, on March 9, 2018, where Nikolas Cruz bought the weapons that killed 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nColumbine. Sandy Hook. Virginia Tech. Las Vegas. The names of America's mass shootings have become as hauntingly familiar as the responses to them-a now predictable cycle of thoughts and prayers, calls for new gun laws, debate over their need and then, usually, little else. Until the next one.\n\nNo other developed country has such a high rate of gun violence. A March 2016 study in the American Journal of Medicine found that Americans are 25 times more likely to die from gun homicide than people in other wealthy countries. There are commonsense steps we can take to reduce that toll, but they require acknowledging certain truths. The right to bear arms is enshrined in the Constitution, and there are approximately 265 million privately owned guns in the U.S., according to researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities. Any sensible discussion about America's gun-violence problem must acknowledge that guns aren't going away. \"We have to admit to ourselves that in a country with so many guns, progress is going to be measured incrementally,\" says Jeff Swanson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice? It requires a shift in our collective perspective. While legislators in statehouses and Washington can pass laws that may-or may not-help, the most effective way to tackle our national problem is to stop thinking of gun control as a political battle and instead see gun violence as a public-health issue. \"The public-health model says you intervene in as many places as possible,\" says Dr. Liza Gold, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine. \"There are no magic solutions. There are a lot of solutions.\"\n\nHere are six steps that we can take to reduce America's shameful gun-violence problem.\n\nThe reduction in U.S. motor-vehicle deaths over the past 50 years is one of the great triumphs of public-health intervention. Safer cars, stronger seat-belt laws and fewer teenage drivers have helped reduce car fatalities, which dropped from 33.5 deaths per billion miles traveled in 1975 to 11.8 in 2016. Gun deaths have increased steadily since 2009 and are now nearly as lethal as traffic accidents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nLawmakers can learn lessons from auto safety. To start, they can put in effect more rigorous requirements for owning firearms. \"For the most part, it is much easier to be a legal gun owner in America than it is to be a legal driver,\" says David Hemenway, director of the Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nSome measures, like Walmart's lifting its minimum age for purchasing a gun from 18 to 21, may sound good but likely won't do much to combat gun violence. According to FBI reports, handguns were responsible for 90% of homicides in 2016. Walmart sells handguns only in Alaska.\n\nA more effective policy would require every buyer, of any age, to obtain a license that includes a registration of all purchases and at least a modest training program. According to the State Firearms Law project, just seven states require a permit to possess a gun of any kind. A 2014 study in the Journal of Urban Health found that Missouri's 2007 repeal of its permit-to-purchase handgun law was associated with a 25% increase in firearms homicide rates.\n\nNot all gun laws are created equal. The military-grade rifles used in many mass shootings may dominate the political debate, but they account for less than 5% of homicides. Meanwhile, research published in JAMA Internal Medicine in early March found that strong firearms laws in a state, such as background checks for all private sales and restrictions on multiple purchases, were associated with lower rates of gun homicides.\n\nResearchers are also finding links between right-to-carry laws-which require governments to issue concealed-carry permits to citizens who meet certain requirements-and spikes in firearms crime. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper estimates that 10 years after the adoption of right-to-carry laws, violent crime is 13% to 15% higher than it would have been without those policies.\n\nAnother measure that has attracted lawmakers' attention is extreme-risk protection orders, also known as gun-violence restraining orders. These allow family members or law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily bar an at-risk person from buying firearms. Police may also be permitted to confiscate their guns. Before the shooting in Parkland, Fla., California, Oregon, Washington, Indiana and Connecticut all had some version on the books. Florida adopted one on March 9.\n\nEvidence suggests that these orders save lives. A 2017 study in Law and Contemporary Problems estimated that in Connecticut, every 10 to 20 gun seizures averted a suicide. In California, the San Diego city attorney's office has issued 20 gun-violence restraining orders since mid-December. In one instance, an employee of a car dealership had praised the Las Vegas gunman and said that if he were fired, he'd return to the dealership with a gun. After the city obtained a gun-violence restraining order, the man surrendered a semiautomatic rifle.\n\nDoctors can play a key role in educating families about gun safety, particularly when it comes to keeping guns out of the hands of young children. Studies show that some 3-year-olds are strong enough to shoot a gun. By the time they reach school age, about 75% can fire a weapon. As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians start asking about firearms in the home when children are 3 years old and curious about the world-and objects-around them.\n\nBut some states have sought to prevent doctors from talking about guns with patients, even though they present a health risk. A 2011 Florida law threatened physicians with suspending their medical license and fines if they inquired about and discussed a family's firearms. Doctors sued, claiming that the statute violated their First Amendment rights. A federal appeals court settled the \"Docs v. Glocks\" case in February, siding with the physicians and overturning the law. Minnesota, Missouri and Montana also limit doctors' ability to address guns with patients in different ways.\n\nDoctors say such gag laws and restrictions hamper their ability to discuss issues that can affect patient safety; after all, they talk about the dangers of smoking or of not wearing a seat belt in a car. \"My role is not to be judgmental,\" says Dr. Joseph Wright, chair of the committee on emergency medicine for the AAP. \"We are asking about and providing information about what science has demonstrated as the most effective ways to keep children safe in homes with guns.\"\n\n\"If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you've got the right fingerprint,\" President Barack Obama asked in January 2013, \"why can't we do the same thing for our guns?\" More than five years and too many tragedies later, guns aren't much smarter now than they were at the time of the Sandy Hook school massacre. In fact, no truly smart guns are on the market in the U.S.\n\nAll the pieces appear to be in place. The safety technology is available. Entrepreneurs have introduced products that use biometrics to identify a weapon's rightful owner while locking it for everyone else. Such smart guns may not prevent mass shootings with firearms purchased legally. But they can prevent crimes or suicides with weapons owned by somebody else. They can also cut down on accidental shootings. According to the CDC, an average of 500 people are shot to death unintentionally every year.\n\nIf the benefits seems obvious, why aren't smart guns available? Some gun owners worry that the technology will fail when they need it most, like during a home invasion. Others fear government overreach. New Jersey passed a law in 2002 requiring that the state's retailers sell only personalized, or smart, guns within three years of their being available for sale elsewhere in the U.S. The mandate backfired, mobilizing opposition to smart guns from the firearms lobby and stunting investment in the technology. Similarly, when Smith & Wesson, one of the largest handgun manufacturers in the U.S., agreed to develop smart-gun technology in the wake of the Columbine school shooting in 2000, the NRA condemned the company. Gun owners boycotted, and sales plummeted. No major gun manufacturers have invested in the technology since.\n\nIn early March, Smith & Wesson's parent company, American Outdoor Brands Corp., reaffirmed its stance. \"We are a manufacturing company, not a technology company,\" it wrote in a response to the investment-management firm BlackRock, which had inquired about the gunmaker's plans to address safety concerns.\n\nSupport for smart guns, however, could be building. A 2016 study from Johns Hopkins University found that almost 60% of Americans considering purchasing a new handgun would be willing to make it a smart gun. \"The time for smart guns,\" says Stephen Teret, founding director of the school's Center for Gun Policy and Research, \"is now.\" Such numbers mean that smart guns could be a prime market opportunity. \"This isn't just a great gun-safety mission,\" says Gareth Glaser, CEO of LodeStar Firearms, which is developing a smart gun. \"It could be a hell of a business.\"\n\nAccording to a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, gun violence should have received $1.4 billion in federal research money from 2004 to 2015, on the basis of mortality rates and funding levels for other leading causes of death. Instead, such projects received $22 million-just 1.6% of the projected amount. Gun violence received 5.3% of the federal research funds allocated for motor-vehicle accidents, even though they kill similar numbers of Americans per year.\n\n\"We know far less about gun violence as a cause of injury and death than we do about almost every medical problem,\" says Dr. Elinore Kaufman, chief resident in surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nThere is a reason for this lack of knowledge. In 1996, Congress, with a push from the NRA, passed the Dickey Amendment-named after its author, former Republican Representative Jay Dickey from Arkansas-which mandated that no CDC funds could be spent on research that \"may be used to advocate or promote gun control.\" Congress also cut $2.6 million from the CDC budget, which was equal to the federal agency's expenditure on firearm-injury research the prior year. The message to researchers was clear: study the gun problem at your own risk. \"The effect of the Dickey Amendment was beyond chilling,\" says Dr. Eric Fleegler, a pediatric emergency physician and health services researcher at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nThe restrictions on research funding have had devastating consequences on what we know-and what we don't. In early March, the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan think tank, released a sweeping two-year examination of U.S. gun laws. The main takeaway: there's a dearth of evidence on their impact. Few studies, for example, test the argument that gun restrictions thwart people's ability to defend themselves. \"There are thousands of studies waiting to be performed,\" says Fleegler. \"But you can't do them because of the money.\" Toward the end of his life, even Dickey, who died in April 2017, said he regretted the amendment that bears his name.\n\nSome states are trying to pick up the slack. California recently opened the nation's first state-funded firearms-violence research center, on the Sacramento campus of the University of California, Davis. Such investments are urgent as the failure to find answers carries a steep cost. \"People are dead today,\" says Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the new center, \"as a result.\"\n\nFederal law offers the gun industry extraordinary protections. In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which shields gun manufacturers and sellers from civil claims brought by victims of gun violence. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre hailed the law as the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.\n\nNo one benefits from frivolous lawsuits. But holding manufacturers liable for the misuse of their products, experts say, would incentivize them to make firearms safer. \"If pillows caused fatalities at that level, those companies would be bankrupt,\" says Fleegler of Boston Children's Hospital. \"If there were 500 deaths a year associated with any consumer product, it would be banned, regulated, fixed. But here, nothing.\"",

The killing of the human-rights activist mobilized tens of thousands of Brazilians to demand justice and sparked tributes from around the world.\n\nBorn and raised in the Maré favela, one of Rio's most dangerous slums, 38-year-old Franco was a fierce advocate for the marginalized-including Afro-Brazilians, the poor, the LGBTQ community and women-and a critic of President Michel Temer's federal intervention in the city. As a black, lesbian single mother, she was a minority several times over in Brazilian politics and the only black woman on Rio's 51-member city council, having received the fifth most votes in the election that won her the seat.\n\nTens of thousands of people have protested Franco's death in cities across the country, as well as in New York City, Paris, Berlin and elsewhere. Her name was mentioned in more than 3 million tweets in 54 countries over the two days following her death, often with the hashtags #MariellePresente (Marielle Is Here) and #SayHerName, the latter borrowed from Black Lives Matter activists. Some demonstrators have also used her death as a rallying cry to call for an end to systemic racism in Brazil.\n\nSome activists believe Franco was killed for speaking out against abuses of military and police power in Brazil, and human-rights observers have criticized what they call a culture of impunity in Brazilian law enforcement. The protests, led largely by young Brazilians, have highlighted their demands for legitimate leadership and their broader dissatisfaction with the nation's political system. As the police continue their investigation into the apparent hit, many of Franco's followers are looking to the October elections as an opportunity to continue her struggle.",

                "title": "A San Francisco Art Museum Tackles Art's Instagram Dilemma",
                "body": "A woman clutched her phone to her heart the way a missionary might hold a Bible. She was anxious to take a picture of a stunning bouquet of flowers that sat not 10 ft. away, but first she had to get through a crowd of others jostling to do the same. The cause of this recent frenzy was Bouquets to Art, one of the most popular annual events at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. For the 34th year, florists were asked to create bouquets that respond to pieces of art on display, from ancient carvings to contemporary sculptures. A tower of baby's breath imitates a frothy waterfall in a nearby painting by Gustav Grunewald. Red flamingo flowers and neon blue sticks echo a surreal portrait of a woman by Salvador Dalí. It's entrancing and also extremely Instagrammable, to the point that it has become a problem.\n\nIn recent years, the de Young received more than a thousand complaints from people who felt that cell phones had tainted their experience of the exhibit. Institutions of fine art around the world face similar problems as the desire to take photographs becomes a huge draw for museums as well as something that upsets some of their patrons. So the de Young responded with a kind of compromise: carving out \"photo free\" hours during the exhibition's six-day run (which is short because of flowers' perishable nature).\n\nOne common complaint in the ongoing debates over the effect of social media on museum culture is that people seem to be missing out on experiences because they are so busy collecting evidence of them. An oft-cited study published in the journal Psychological Science suggests there is some truth to this; it found that people who took photos of an exhibit rather than simply observing it had a harder time remembering what they saw. But the issue is complicated for the professionals running museums. Linda Butler, the de Young's head of marketing, communications and visitor experience, acknowledges that not everyone wants a museum to be \"a selfie playland.\" Yet a lot of other people do, and her take is that the de Young is in no position to assert that one motivation for buying a $28 ticket is more valid than another. \"If we removed social media and photography,\" she says, \"we would risk becoming irrelevant.\"\n\nIf this is a battle, signs indicate that the pro-phone crowd has already won. On this visit to the museum, most people seemed to treat the photo bonanza as the new normal. Many politely waited their turn and got out of other people's shots, even as visitors bumped into each other in cramped galleries. Morgan Holzer, a millennial who was surprised by the furor, said that as she approached bouquets to read their labels, she found herself holding up the process. But rather than expressing frustration about this awkwardness, she said she felt guilty, as if she were the one defying convention. \"I felt bad blocking everyone's photo,\" she said.",

                "title": "In the 'Roseanne' Revival, the Political Becomes the Personal",
                "body": "A Rosy Return John Goodman and Roseanne Barr are back, on ABC's Roseanne revival. They joine a wave of smart family comedies\n\nRoseanne Conner is a Trump voter, and it makes sense. The sitcom mom played by Roseanne Barr lives in one of the Rust Belt towns that broke heavily against Hillary Clinton-though, in Illinois, she's technically a blue stater. She's provocative and likes to speak frankly. And, in the first episode of her sitcom revival (premiering March 27 on ABC), she's newly attracted to one side of our ongoing culture war. Preparing to say grace before dinner, she makes a reference to recent NFL protests, asking her liberal sister (Laurie Metcalf), \"Would you like to take a knee?\" Roseanne has always been an insult comic, so it's no surprise that she's drawn to a President whose power comes in part from his punch lines.\n\nIn its first run, Roseanne was political, but more implicitly than explicitly. The show dealt less with debates happening on the national stage and more with ones happening at kitchen tables, with the frayed purse strings of two working-class parents, and the even more frayed sanity that came with their trying to raise three kids in the midst of the 1990s' evolving cultural mores. Returning after 20 years off the air, though, Roseanne enters a world in which kitchen-table debate has become dominated by the cultural chaos that created and is stoked by the President. It's among a group of sitcoms doing crisp and effective work taking on social issues-territory that mainstream TV drama has all but left behind.\n\nThis new iteration of Roseanne makes a statement by kicking off with a brutally real, lengthy debate between sisters Roseanne and Jackie over their divided allegiances. The political is personal-the pair still haven't recovered from wounds inflicted in late 2016-and the personal swerves back around to political too. \"You just can't stand for anybody to have their own opinions about anything, can you?\" asks Jackie. \"So you tell them how stupid they are all the time.\"\n\nIt's a layered depiction of the ways in which politics divide families-not just by disagreement, but by a divisive rhetorical style that's become ubiquitous in American life. Roseanne-both the comic and the character-was always gifted at mean jokes, but she's grown crueler; so have the times in which she lives. Recognizing that change is funny and sad in equal measure. It's a balance that the contemporary family sitcom is uniquely equipped to pull off.\n\nAnd thank goodness, because dramas, at present, can't or won't. Human-scale stories like Friday Night Lights or Six Feet Under, which assessed how contemporary culture alters the home and family lives of quotidian Americans, have gone out of style. On network TV, the procedural reigns supreme. (The secret of NBC's This Is Us, notionally a family drama, is that it's effectively a procedural that re-examines the same death every week.) And on cable and streaming, attempts to look at politics' impact on families-like Alan Ball's flawed but promising Here and Now, currently airing on HBO-can't help but be overshadowed by fire (from Game of Thrones' dragons) and fury (from the endless stream of antiheroes that keep cropping up in premium dramas). Politics as will be practiced by Robin Wright in the upcoming final season of House of Cards is glamorous enough for prestige drama, but politics as it affects lunch-pail Americans is reserved for comedy.\n\nThat's all the better, given how much good comedies have been doing with it. On Netflix's One Day at a Time, complexities of gender and Latinx identity are parsed with élan. The show, which depicts the lives of a Cuban-American family in Los Angeles, places real pain in their path-homophobia, racism, misogyny, struggles with mental illness. And yet the show is more than the sum of its problems. It gives its stories heft and a dollop of genuine warmth; its debates are infused with the sense that each participant is aware that they're stuck with their conversation partner for life. Meanwhile, on Roseanne's network home, ABC, families both like and unlike the Conners have been debating tough topics for years. On Speechless, a superb show about a family whose eldest son (Micah Fowler) has a disability, the struggle to obtain resources on a recognizably tight budget and to balance the needs of all three children has enough juice and tension to roll on for years to come.\n\nAnd on TV's current reigning family sitcom, black-ish, the arguments have only grown sharper in the Trump era. News broke this month that ABC had shelved an episode of the series that dealt with the debate over NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. Why the episode didn't make it to air isn't known, but it seemed like a missed opportunity for the network to address a topic that's been widely discussed and that has meaning beyond itself-as Roseanne, with her barbed comment about the protests, knows well. Hers shouldn't be the only take allowed to exist on the air. After all, debates give both sides their time.\n\nWhat Roseanne coming to ABC should represent is continued engagement with new points of view in America's endless debate. What it might too easily become, even at a time of openness to all kinds of TV families, is the loudest voice in the room.",

Except they're not sitting, exactly. They're crouching diagonally on the seat and leaning back on one another's knees in order to devour their calzones while maintaining as much physical contact as possible. Corin throws a crouton into González's mouth. Kasky uses Corin's knees as a pillow. The conversation turns from their fellow organizer David Hogg (\"So laser-focused,\" González says, that \"he could make his body get pregnant if he wanted to\") to the conspiracy theory that they're actors being paid by shadowy donors (prompting Kasky to ask why his credit card was recently declined at McDonald's) to their prolific trolling of the NRA. They agree that the gun lobby's spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, is \"very hot but kind of scary,\" as González puts it.",

                "title": "How Deloitte CEO Cathy Engelbert Rose to the Top",
                "body": "Growing up as one of eight siblings in the southern part of New Jersey, or South Jersey as it's known to all who live there, has its disadvantages. Cathy Engelbert had to share a room with her messier younger sister Peggy. There were occasional fistfights, which Cathy usually lost. Both her parents had jobs outside the home, and sometimes her dad took extra work on weekends and evenings, either for more cash or for less chaos. But in elementary school, when Engelbert ran for class president, one advantage of having a big clan became apparent.\n\n\"She wanted to win so bad, and she was going up against the most popular boy in the class, so she came up with this campaign slogan, 'Have a taffy, vote for Cathy,'\" recalls Peggy, a nurse. \"We run to the store and buy bags of Charms Pops and Tootsie Pops, and we tape the slogan to all of them.\" Then four of her five brothers-Kurt, Kenny, Kevin and Keith (Kyle came later)-Peggy and oldest sister Beth gave out the candy around the school. Engelbert won in a landslide.\n\nIt's interesting that the perpetrator of so flagrant a vote-buying scheme would be such a success in the audit business. The shyly confident, quietly competitive Engelbert, 53, is now CEO of Deloitte U.S. Like class presidents, Deloitte CEOs are elected, and like U.S. Presidents, they serve four years with the option of another four. Engelbert became the first female CEO of a Big Four financial-services firm in 2015 and will soon stand for her second term. If she wins, she will be the first two-term CEO since 1999.\n\nAt a time when fewer than one in 10 companies on the Fortune 500 has a female CEO, Engelbert exercises a particular brand of soft power, given that she runs the company that helps run 400 of those 500 businesses. (KPMG, another of the Big Four, also has a female CEO.) More than 60% of her employees are millennials, the majority of whom, having been trained by Deloitte, will leave to work elsewhere. She is responsible for forming tomorrow's corporate leaders in an era when traditional models of political leadership are in flux-when, as she says, \"we're walking on business eggshells, because every morning you wake up and you kind of cringe when you go to look at your breaking news.\"\n\nEngelbert is also at the helm at a tricky time for financial-services firms. While they are known for audit and tax services, most of the growth in recent years has been in management consulting, the much sexier and more lucrative end of the business. (Deloitte advises Meredith Corporation, the owner of this magazine.) Instead of parachuting in to solve a particular problem, consultants now need to be able to effect a corporate metamorphosis for a whole new environment, one constantly being remade by digital technology. \"Companies used to buy point solutions from us,\" says Engelbert. \"Now they want to buy end-to-end transformation.\"\n\nDeloitte hires 18,000 people in the U.S. every year. It has to predict who will be useful to businesses in the future. \"Now 65% of IT spending is in the cloud,\" says Engelbert by way of example. \"That requires hiring different people than we hired before. We need more data scientists.\"\n\nBut it's not just expertise that she has to build; it's culture. \"Every day I wake up and say there are 88,000 people going out to clients today,\" says Engelbert. \"You have to build the right culture into them.\" These issues are not Deloitte-specific. She believes the concepts of an employee and a workplace are changing rapidly. \"Jobs are being disconnected from work,\" she says. \"Work has a whole new definition. There's the gig economy, the open talent network. So how do you build culture when you can't build it in your four walls?\"\n\nEngelbert has made a big bet on technology, forming partnerships with Amazon Web Services-to combine Deloitte's business savvy with Amazon's tech agility-among others and developing a cadre of Apple-specific advisers, experts in shifting businesses to mobile using the iOS platform. She has also doubled down on work-life balance, insisting, against the advice of her spreadsheet wielders, that all employees be offered 16 weeks of paid leave for any family emergency. \"I'm not a big rattler, but I rattled some people,\" she says. \"I said we're just going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as work-life strategy goes, Engelbert has a black belt in scheduling. The day before our meeting, she was in Washington at a business roundtable. Two days before that, she was in Dallas. The previous week, Madrid and Singapore. Because she travels so much, she prioritizes family, including her two children, when she can. She coached her daughter's middle-school lacrosse team. Even as CEO, she made it to most of her daughter's high school games. She has promised her teenage son (her daughter's now at college) that, after our conversation, a client lunch and several internal meetings, she will be home in northern New Jersey by 5 p.m. to watch an NCAA game with him. At about noon, her assistant gets antsy. Apparently I'm eating into Engelbert's time for SMOR-\"small moments of reflection,\" the 10-minute microbreaks she schedules between one meeting and the next.\n\nHow did Engelbert win the approval, trust and votes of a business-minded group of individuals when so many other women struggle? In short, whether by nature or design, she does not appear threatening. Her conversational style is friendly and unpretentious. She makes no jokes. Like many CEOs, she's a competent but unexciting public speaker: at a recent commencement at Duke, she gave advice that started with the letters D U K E, while at a Villanova talk her tips began with N O V A. Her office in Manhattan's 30 Rockefeller Center, a mere 33 floors and 17 personality types away from the Saturday Night Live set, is decorated in soft hues. The imposing view of the Empire State Building is offset by many family photos.\n\nHer only mild gesture of dominance is that despite being 5 ft. 10 in.-she was a walk-on basketball player at Lehigh University and captained a team that won the Eastern Conference title-she wears high heels, so she towers over most visitors.\n\nEngelbert sources some of her success to two lucky breaks. The first was that as a young consultant, she was sent to find out about this new financial instrument, derivatives. Her early expertise catapulted her into a different league. \"It gave me a platform to meet with treasurers and CFOs across America, and it was my first taste of leadership,\" she says. It didn't hurt that having grown up with five brothers, attended a mostly male college and married a former Army helicopter pilot-the kind of guy who drinks $100 wine out of a red Solo cup-she was not deterred by the behavior of the bros who worked in the capital-markets team.\n\nThe second grew out of what she calls \"personal selfishness.\" While pregnant, she was assigned to a client in St. Louis. She asked for a larger client, who happened to be located two miles from her home. Her bosses agreed but warned her that the proprietor was not a fan of female consultants. \"He didn't think I could do the job,\" she says. \"But I thought, I'm going to take this as a challenge and turn him. By the end of my five years there, he was like, 'She's the best partner I've ever worked with.'\" This helped cement her reputation for being as good with clients as she was with numbers.\n\nNone of Engelbert's success comes as a shock to her family, which has seen her fly in from Davos, give a speech for her mom's retirement party and then get home in time for her son's baseball tryout. \"We always knew she was going places,\" says Peggy. \"Now whenever she achieves something, I just shrug and say, 'Have a taffy, vote for Cathy.'\"",

                "title": "President Trump Feels Good About White House Shakeups. His Staffers Don't Facebook description: Welcome to 'the Trump Show'",
                "body": "It was early March, and President Donald Trump had a dramatic plan: impose a new round of import tariffs on America's largest trading partner, China. But in meeting after meeting, his aides warned just how costly the move could be. It would hurt U.S. workers and slice into the stock market, they said. It didn't have the backing of fellow Republicans. It would be bad politics for a party facing tough odds in November's elections. They reminded him that the global aluminum and steel tariffs he imposed earlier in the month had led European allies to prepare retaliatory moves and had prompted the White House's chief economic adviser to resign. Who knew what unintended consequences this new plan might unleash?\n\nThe President nodded along, now and then mumbling an O.K., and the White House aides thought they had prevailed. But in the middle of the month, they were summoned to hear from the President again: he wanted $30 billion in tariffs on Chinese products. Hours later, the staffers read that Trump had doubled the figure to $60 billion.\n\nWelcome to Season 2 of the Trump Show, to borrow a phrase from one of his veteran aides. Fed up with experts and advisers and increasingly comfortable in the job, Trump is determined to do things his way. \"The President feels he's got this now,\" says one White House official, who does not share his confidence.\n\nThe impact of an emboldened Trump goes well beyond a possible trade war. On March 13, Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with a tweet, replacing him with hard-line CIA chief Mike Pompeo. Three days later, his goading helped drive Attorney General Jeff Sessions to fire FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who previously oversaw the bureau's investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump's subsequent tweets attacking Robert Mueller by name for the first time raised fears the President might fire the special counsel and trigger a constitutional crisis.\n\nInside the White House, the mix of high-impact policy moves and high-profile personnel changes is taking its toll. Conversations with more than two dozen current and former Administration officials during the past month reveal a White House in the grip of anxiety as staffers fear the next email or phone call could bring word they're being fired too. Some have taken to asking reporters about rumored staff changes, suspecting journalists will know before those running the government. More worrying: Trump's own aides fear the fallout for the country and the world that may result as he tests the limits of the power of the presidency.\n\nTrump has always preferred a chaotic workplace. But his confidence in the Oval Office is new. When he won the White House-back when no one in his orbit had pleaded guilty, Mueller was at a white-shoe law firm and liberals still blamed then-FBI Director James Comey for Hillary Clinton's loss-Trump decided he needed some experience around him. He had been a successful businessman, but as the head of a privately held real estate empire, he'd never suffered a board of directors or oversight of stockholders. Moreover, he knew he was the first Commander in Chief not to have previously served in government or the military. So Trump hired a flight of experienced Washington hands to help guide him. They were the guardrails of his presidency.\n\nAnd Trump hated it. These men-and they were largely men-told him, often in charts and pictures, why his preferred actions were dangerous. Sometimes they were right. But in recent weeks, Trump has focused more on decisions where their dire predictions haven't come true, aides say. They told him that moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would cause lasting chaos in the Middle East. (It did not.) They warned him that tariffs on steel and aluminum would spark a trade war with Europe. (It wasn't as bad as they had feared.) They warned that a debt-heavy tax-cut package would spook investors. (Wall Street is booming, although investors are warning clients that a reckoning is coming.) These advisers-\"the so-called experts,\" Trump mockingly labeled them-had all been proven wrong, he said. Why, he wondered aloud, was he listening to them?\n\nAnd over time, the guardrails gave way. Trump ditched some of the staffers. Gone was the first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, along with several of his deputies. Tillerson was his boldest firing yet. Others were forced out by scandal or by Trump's order-seeking chief of staff, retired Marine General John Kelly. Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary-the Administration's traffic cop for top-secret and other files-was pushed out when the public learned he had been accused of abusing his ex-wives. The President's personal aide, once a YouTube viral video star with a knack for trick throws of footballs and a reported penchant for online gambling, was sent packing soon after, but he landed a new gig at the Trump 2020 campaign.\n\nThen there is the departure of Hope Hicks, Trump's top media strategist, who was tired of working in a windowless closet within shouting distance of the Oval Office. As much as anyone, she had been able to influence the President, and White House officials worried that her departure could leave Trump unmoored. Top economic adviser Gary Cohn resigned after losing an internal fight over metals tariffs. On March 19, the President roiled his legal team, adding well-known Washington lawyer Joseph diGenova, who had accused the FBI and Justice Department of conspiring against the President.\n\nTo hear Administration officials tell it, the exodus is only beginning. Lieutenants to Kelly and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, two of the most experienced remaining advisers, expect their bosses to depart shortly. That would leave Trump alone at center stage. More confident in his ability to run a country, Trump wants to surround himself with people he likes, say aides. That increasingly means people he likes on television. To fill Cohn's spot, Trump hired Larry Kudlow, a onetime junior aide to President Ronald Reagan and a regular on CNBC, as his top economic adviser. He promoted the Columbia-educated former Fox and Friends anchor Heather Nauert to the top public diplomacy post at the State Department. Trump is eyeing another Fox contributor, Pete Hegseth, to take over the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nNo staff change could have a greater impact than the removal of Mueller, but Trump has shown he is increasingly frustrated by the special counsel's probe, which has reportedly delved into the President's business records. \"If you had been attacked mercilessly and continuously,\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders explained March 20, describing her boss's mood, \"and literally, every day you wake up to an onslaught of people saying that you're there because of reasons that are completely false, that's frustrating.\" Even Trump's most loyal pals worry he will respond to that perceived attack by firing Mueller. \"That would be the beginning of the end,\" predicted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a golf partner to the President. \"That would be the stupidest thing the President could do,\" added GOP Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a reliable ally.\n\nMaybe Trump's increasing theatrics don't matter. Maybe he can thrash about the White House-offending his nominal friends, enraging America's allies and spooking the financial markets-without doing much lasting damage. Trump's supporters point to steadying forces around him, like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and first daughter Ivanka Trump. But these same voices previously cited Tillerson and Cohn in the same role. Now both have departed, and Kelly and McMaster might not be far behind. \"It's no secret the President is not a patient man. Now, he's really out of patience and will be doing things his way,\" says one Republican on Capitol Hill. \"The President tried it their way and didn't like what he was seeing.\" What comes next will make for edge-of-your-seat viewing. But it brings real risks.",

                "title": "This Mom Is Charging Her 5-Year-Old \"Rent\"",
                "body": "A young mother named Essence Evans recently posted on Facebook that she charges her five-year-old daughter $1 each for rent, utilities, food, water, and cable out of her weekly $7 allowance. The remaining $2 is the child's money to spend however she wishes. The $5 that Evans takes for \"bills\" actually goes into a savings account she'll give to her daughter when she turns 18.\n\nThe internet went berserk. Some people loved this idea, while others thought it took things too far. Whether you agree or disagree with the method, something has to be said for the initiative Evans is taking to teach her young daughter money management and the value of a dollar.\n\nShould you follow her example and charge your little ones \"rent?\" Here are five important lessons you'd be teaching them by having them \"pay bills.\"\n\nFrom birth until death, you need and deal with money in some capacity. The earlier you learn how to earn, spend, lend, borrow, and invest, the better off you are. By making your little kids pay for living expenses, you teach them very early how to handle money responsibly. It helps them begin the journey of distinguishing wants from needs and prioritizing taking care of their needs first.\n\nBefore your child is allowed to spend any money, they should be required to \"pay their bills\" and set money aside in savings of some sort. The action of giving money to them and having them give a portion of it back is a powerful lesson in and of itself. It becomes a normal part of having money. You teach them to save and pay their bills first, which is a powerful tool in keeping them out of financial trouble later in life. (See also: 4 Parenting Mistakes to Avoid When Teaching Kids About Money)\n\nMaking your kids pay bills before allowing them to spend their money on things they want teaches them the power of budgeting. Budgeting is all about setting priorities and planning. Budgeting teaches them that they canhave some of the things they want if they plan correctly. It also teaches them that they cannot afford all of their wants. It drives home the point that there are certain bills that they will always have (rent, utilities, groceries) and they should always plan for those recurring expenses.\n\nTeaching them these lessons in a controlled and loving environment is so much more humane than neglecting these lessons and having them learn it the hard way as an adult.\n\nYou can't buy love, happiness, peace, or good health. But everything else will cost you. The sooner kids learn this, the better off they will be.\n\nYour kids need to know how the financial system works. You should teach them that in order for you to withdraw money at the ATM, you had to deposit money in the first place. They need to know that every time you use a credit card to buy something, you have to pay it back with interest.\n\nTeaching them that everything costs money -- including the bed they sleep in, the food on the table, and the internet they enjoy -- is a lasting life lesson that will help guide them into being contentious spenders. It is also important to teach them to always look for the cost in everything. This doesn't mean you should make your kids neurotic, but you do want to ensure that they are aware that everything they ask for costs you something. (See also: 21 Things You Should Make Your Kids Pay For)\n\nEntitlement is one of the leading underlying causes of debt and credit abuse. Teaching your kids that hard work pays off is a valuable lesson. But you also have to teach them that working hard doesn't mean they can have whatever they want. They must learn that they can only have what they can afford.\n\nIn life, we don't always get what we deserve -- good or bad. Sometimes life is unfair and we have to wait, work harder, or settle for an alternative. The quicker your kids learn this, the more content they will be in the long run. Teaching them to focus on and be grateful for what they do have in lieu of what they don't have or what everyone else has is far more valuable than getting them everything their tiny hearts desire. Helping them develop self-governance and the ability to tell themselves no is more valuable than a giving them a hefty trust fund.\n\nMaking kids contribute to their living expenses helps teach them about opportunity cost. That lesson is all about being able to pause, weigh all of the options, and make a rational decision. They have to learn that if you have $5 and spend it all on candy, you can't also get a toy. The concept of delayed gratification will slowly be seared into their tiny minds and help them become less impulsive. Even kids who are impulsive by nature will learn (with your guidance) how to stop and consider what else they may want to do with their money.\n\nTeaching your kids about opportunity cost also helps them to become rational decision makers. When you make each transaction more about business and less about emotions, they will learn how to make purchases using logic and practicality. You have to model for them how to talk themselves through paying bills and making purchases. When you ask them questions and help them view money objectively, you will help reduce feelings of buyer's remorse and they will become confident in their financial decision-making.\n\nIn the end, you may not agree with Evans' approach, but you must appreciate and applaud her moxie. Your value system may not allow you to charge your kids rent, but it's important to find some system that can ingrain these lessons into your kids.\n\nFiscal responsibility is one of the greatest things you can teach your children. Failing to teach them how to handle and relate to money will create a type of poverty in them than no amount of money can fix.",

                "body": "For Tony Robbins, confidence and success isn't a mentality -- it's a physical state of being.\n\nFixing your posture and taking care of your body can be direct catalysts for success, the author and life coach said during an on-stage conversation at Fortune magazine's annual Brainstorm Health Conference this weekend.\n\nTo demonstrate his point, Robbins asked the audience to shout out what the appearance of a depressed person would look like. The crowd's answers included \"slumped,\" \"head down,\" \"breathing shallow,\" \"quiet.\" Robbins contended that if that person just amended their bad posture and demeanor, he or she would eventually become happier and more confident.\n\n\"Most people try to change the mind ... but when you change the body radically, you change the biochemistry, the state changes, and they make a shift,\" he said. \"I really believe that's why I've lasted so long: I put myself in states where my body can put myself back in balance and heal.\"\n\nThe strategy doesn't just extend to mental well-being, he argued: Improving your body language can lead to improved performance.\n\nRobbins said he'd been asked to speak to the Golden State Warriors basketball team, who have struggled recently as injuries have sidelined key players like Steph Curry. He gave the conference audience a preview of his advice, noting that the players need to change their body language off the court. The team has the skills and talent it needs to win, he said; the only factor determining success is their physical state of being.\n\n\"I've got to change the momentum,\" Robbins said -- \"and the first place I need to change the momentum is physically.\"\n\nElsewhere during the conversation, the author of the New York Times bestsellers Unshakeable and Money: Master the Game said his motivation for success was due in part to his rough upbringing. Robbins described his mother's drug addiction and abusive behavior in detail, yet said the suffering he experienced makes him want to reduce other people's suffering.\n\n\"It's not about the money for me; it's about changing peoples' lives,\" he said.\n\nThat said, Robbins did reveal the one luxury he splurged on when he first started making big money: a Mercedes.",

                "body": "If you're already drawing Social Security -- or if you plan to start doing so in the near future -- you might be wondering: Is Social Security taxed?\n\nTax experts say it's an important question, especially because many Baby Boomers who are currently receiving Social Security benefits are also still in the workforce and earning income. The answer is not that simple: Social Security benefits are taxed for some people, but not others.\n\n\"Social Security taxation is complicated, but not as complicated as Social Security itself,\" said Gil Charney, director at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. \"Taxpayers' Social Security benefits are not taxable until their income reaches a certain level, which depends on your filing status.\"\n\nIf you currently draw income from a retirement account or pension, you could have to pay taxes on some of your Social Security benefits. Another reason you might find that your Social Security is taxed is if you're also still working -- even if it's a part-time job, gig economy work like driving for Uber or working as a self-employed consultant.\n\n\"To see if your Social Security will be taxed, you have to look at your combined income and your marital status,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, tax expert for TurboTax. \"Typically, Social Security won't be taxed unless you receive additional income.\"\n\nFor taxpayers wondering, is Social Security taxed, there's a formula you can use. \"The IRS provides a quick way to find out if you must pay taxes on your Social Security benefits,\" said Mark Jaeger, director of tax development at TaxAct. To find out your \"combined income\" for purposes of calculating Social Security taxes, add your adjusted gross income, any nontaxable interest you earned over the course of the year, and half of your Social Security benefits.\n\nThe gist is that if you're single with combined income above $25,000, or married filing jointly with combined income of more than $32,000, you can expect to pay taxes on half your Social Security benefits. But if you're single and your combined income is more than $34,000, or more than $44,000 if you're married and filing jointly, you could see up to 85% of your Social Security benefits taxed.\n\nFor anyone using tax prep software like TurboTax to do your taxes, the program will automatically figure out if and how much of your Social Security income will be taxed.\n\nThe good news is that no more than 85% of your Social Security benefits will be taxed. Still, tax pros say it's good to keep those income thresholds in mind if you plan to keep working in retirement. Depending on your situation, it could be wise to consider delaying Social Security or retirement plan distributions.\n\nIf you do owe taxes on Social Security, the Social Security Administration says you can either make quarterly payments or have them automatically withheld from your Social Security benefits.",

                "title": "Bratz Dolls Billionaire Isaac Larian Bids to Save Toys R Us",
                "body": "(NEW YORK) -- Toy company executive Isaac Larian says he and other investors have pledged a total of $200 million in financing and hope to raise four times that amount in crowdfunding in order to bid for up to 400 of the Toys R Us stores being liquidated in bankruptcy.\n\nThe unsolicited bid still faces many hurdles, including finding other deep-pocked investors and getting a bankruptcy judge to agree to it. But this is the first public plan to keep the cherished toy brand in existence in the United States.\n\nSuch a long-shot move would also greatly benefit Larian's primary business. He's CEO of Bratz doll-maker MGA Entertainment, which relies on Toys R Us for nearly 1 in every 5 sales.\n\nLarian says he and the other investors, which he declined to name, believe salvaging part of the Toys R Us business will be good for the toy industry, customers and workers. They're interested in more than half the 735 U.S. stores Toys R Us plans to liquidate, and want to be able to use the valuable brand name.\n\nAnd they're hoping the outpouring of affectionate nostalgia when Toys R Us announced its plans -- #SaveToysRUs has been a trend on social media -- translates into pledges toward their $1 billion goal.\n\nToys R Us sought court approval last week to liquidate its remaining U.S. stores, threatening the jobs of some 30,000 employees and spelling the end for a chain known to generations of children and parents for its sprawling stores, sing-along jingle and Geoffrey the giraffe mascot.\n\nThe store has an iconic place in American culture, said Larian. \"We can't just sit back and just let it disappear.\" Larian, who is a billionaire, is using his own money, not MGA funds, for the bid.\n\nWhy might Larian be successful with a retail chain struggling to stay relevant in the age of Amazon? For one thing, Larian wouldn't have the massive $5 billion in debt that hampered the current owner of Toys R Us. He also says the toy industry needs a big chain like Toys R Us, where children can touch and feel the toys and toymaker's can test new products.\n\nThe chain's liquidation will have a \"devastating effect\" on the toy industry, said Larian, who estimates that 130,000 jobs in the U.S. could be lost when you include layoffs at suppliers and logistic operations. He said a total Toys R Us liquidation could mean MGA would have to lay off workers at an Ohio plant that makes the Little Tikes toy vehicles. That brand accounts for 25 percent of MGA total sales, and Larian says only Toys R Us really had enough room to display the cars. It's harder to ship such bulky items on Amazon.\n\nThe Toys R Us troubles have hurt big toy makers like Mattel and Hasbro, which have been key suppliers to the chain. MGA, based in Van Nuys, California, is the world's largest privately held toy company. The planned liquidation would have a bigger impact on smaller toy makers that rely more on the chain for sales.\n\n\"People do not realize the hole that can't be filled by other retailers,\" said Larian, noting that Toys R Us accounts for 18 to 19 percent of MGA's worldwide sales. \"The pipeline is too big.\"\n\nLarian claims that if 400 U.S. Toys R Us stores are salvaged, he could save one-third of the 130,000 jobs.\n\nThe planned closure of the U.S. Toys R Us stores over the coming months will finalize the downfall of the chain that succumbed to heavy debt and relentless trends that undercut its business, from online shopping to mobile games.\n\nWhen the chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last fall, it pledged to stay open. But after what CEO David Brandon called a \"devastating\" holiday shopping season, Toys R Us announced in January it would close 182 stores, and then last week that it would liquidate.\n\nThe company said last week it's trying to bundle its Canadian business with about 200 U.S. stores and find a buyer. Larian has personally aligned with another investor in a separate bid for those operations, though he declined to specify the value of it.\n\nToys R Us is also likely to liquidate its businesses in Australia, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain. It's already shuttering its business in the United Kingdom. That would leave it with the stores in Canada, as well as in central Europe and Asia. It operates more than 700 stores outside the United States.",

                "body": "(WASHINGTON) -- Farmers, electronics retailers and other U.S. businesses are bracing for a backlash as President Donald Trump targets China for stealing American technology or pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over.\n\nThe administration is expected Thursday to slap trade sanctions on China, perhaps including restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese products.\n\nDozens of industry groups sent a letter last weekend to Trump warning that \"the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy, provoking retaliation; stifling U.S. agriculture, goods, and services exports; and raising costs for businesses and consumers.\"\n\nThe announcement will mark the end of a seven-month U.S. investigation into the hardball tactics China has used to challenge U.S. supremacy in technology, including dispatching hackers to steal commercial secrets and demanding that U.S. companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. The administration argues that years of negotiations with China have failed to produce results.\n\n\"It could be a watershed moment,\" said Stephen Ezell, vice president of global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank. \"The Trump administration's decision to go down this path is illustrative that previous strategies have not borne the hoped-for fruit.\"\n\nBusiness groups mostly agree that something needs to be done about China's aggressive push in technology -- but they worry that China will retaliate by targeting U.S. exports of aircraft, soybeans and other products and start a tit-for-tat trade war of escalating sanctions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\n\"The sanctions are a very big deal,\" says Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"The Chinese see them as a major threat and do not want a costly trade war.\"\n\nThe move against China comes just as the United States prepares to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum -- sanctions that are meant to hit China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum but will likely fall hardest on U.S. allies like South Korea and Brazil because they ship more of the metals to the United States.\n\nTrump campaigned on promises to bring down America's massive trade deficit -- $566 billion last year -- by rewriting trade agreements and cracking down on what he called abusive commercial practices by U.S. trading partners. But he was slow to turn rhetoric to action. In January, he imposed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. Then he unveiled the steel and aluminum tariffs, saying reliance on imported metals jeopardizes U.S. national security.\n\nTo target China, Trump has dusted off a Cold War weapon for trade disputes: Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which lets the president unilaterally impose tariffs. It was meant for a world in which large swaths of global commerce were not covered by trade agreements. With the arrival in 1995 of the World Trade Organization, which polices global trade, Section 301 fell largely into disuse.\n\nAt first it looked like Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were going to get along fine. They enjoyed an amiable summit nearly a year ago at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. But America's longstanding complaints about Chinese economic practices continued to simmer, and it became more and more apparent that the U.S. investigation into China technology policies was going to end in trade sanctions.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang this week urged Washington to act \"rationally\" and promised to open China up to more foreign products and investment. \"China has been trying to cool things down for weeks. They have offered concessions,\" Lovely says. \"Nothing seems to cool the fire. I fear they will take a hard line now that their efforts have been rebuffed. ... China cannot appear subservient to the U.S.\"",

                "body": "(WASHINGTON) -- Congressional leaders have finalized a sweeping $1.3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending but leaves behind young immigrant \"Dreamers,\" deprives President Donald Trump some of his border wall money, and takes only incremental steps to address gun violence.\n\nAs negotiators stumbled toward an end-of-the-week deadline to fund the government or face a federal shutdown, House Speaker Paul Ryan dashed to the White House amid concerns Trump's support was wavering. Although some conservative Republicans balked at the size of the spending increases and the rush to pass the bill, the White House said the president backed the legislation.\n\nTrump himself sounded less than enthused, tweeting late Wednesday: \"Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\"\n\nTalks had stretched into Wednesday evening before the 2,232-page text was finally released.\n\n\"No bill of this size is perfect,\" Ryan said. \"But this legislation addresses important priorities and makes us stronger at home and abroad.\"\n\nLeaders hoped to start voting as soon as Thursday. A stopgap measure may be needed to ensure federal offices aren't hit with a partial shutdown at midnight Friday when funding for the government expires.\n\nNegotiators have been working for days -- and nights -- on details of the bill, which is widely viewed as the last major piece of legislation likely to move through Congress in this election year. Lawmakers in both parties sought to attach their top priorities.\n\nTwo of the biggest remaining issues had been border wall funds and a legislative response to gun violence after the clamor for action following recent school shootings, including the one in Parkland, Florida.\n\nOn guns, leaders agreed to tuck in bipartisan provisions to bolster school safety funds and improve compliance with the criminal background check system for firearm purchases. The bill states that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do research on gun violence, though not advocacy, an idea Democrats pushed.\n\nBut there was no resolution for Dreamers, the young immigrants who have been living in the United States illegally since childhood but whose deportation protections are being challenged in court after Trump tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.\n\nDemocrats temporarily shut down the government earlier this year as they fought for that protection. But the issue only rose to a discussion item when Trump made a late-hour push for a deal in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funds.\n\nInstead, Trump is now poised to win $1.6 billion for barriers along the border, but none of it for the new prototypes he recently visited in California. Less than half the nearly 95 miles of border construction, including levees along the Rio Grande in Texas, would be for new barriers, with the rest for repair of existing segments.\n\nIn one win for immigrant advocates, negotiators rejected Trump's plans to hire hundreds of new Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents.\n\n\"We are disappointed that we did not reach agreement on Dreamer protections that were worthy of these patriotic young people,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe emerging plan removes a much-debated earmark protecting money for a rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The item was a top priority of Trump's most powerful Democratic rival, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, but Trump vowed to veto the bill over the earmark. Under the legislation, the project would remain eligible for funding, however, and a Schumer aide said it was likely to win well more than half of the $900 million sought for the project this year.\n\nThe core purpose of the bill is to increase spending for military and domestic programs that have been sharply squeezed under a 2011 agreement that was supposed to cap spending. It gives Trump a huge budget increase for the military, while Democrats scored wins on infrastructure and other domestic programs that they failed to get under President Barack Obama.\n\nThat largesse has drawn opposition from some fiscal conservatives and could make passage a potentially tricky process.\n\nLast month, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul triggered a brief government shutdown over his objections to the deficit spending. On Wednesday, he tweeted his opposition to the emerging legislation, known as an \"omnibus.\"\n\n\"It's a good thing we have Republican control of Congress or the Democrats might bust the budget caps, fund planned parenthood and Obamacare, and sneak gun control without due process into an Omni ... wait, what?\" Paul tweeted.\n\nMost essential was support from Trump, who has been known to threaten to veto legislation even when his team is involved in the negotiations.\n\nWord of Trump's discontent sent Ryan to the White House, where he was invited to a face-to-face with the president, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the phone.\n\nWhite House aides said the president's support was never in doubt, but one senior White House official said the president was concerned that details of the package weren't being presented as well as they could be, both to members of Congress and the public.\n\nThe group discussed how they could better sell the package, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conversation.\n\n\"The president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that it would fund Trump priorities such as wall construction, add money to combat the opioid crisis and provide new infrastructure spending.\n\nBoth parties touted $4.6 billion in total funding to fight the nation's opioid addiction epidemic, a $3 billion increase. More than $2 billion would go to strengthen school safety through grants for training, security measures and treatment for the mentally ill. Medical research at the National Institutes of Health, a longstanding bipartisan priority, would receive a record $3 billion increase to $37 billion. Funding was also included for election security ahead of the 2018 midterms.\n\nChild care and development block grants would receive a huge $2.4 billion increase to $5.2 billion. And an Obama-era transportation grant program known as TIGER would see its budget tripled to $1.5 billion. Head Start for preschoolers would get a $610 million boost, while an additional $2.4 billion would go for child care grants.",

Downtown Philadelphia got 7 inches and New York City's Central Park recorded a little less than 7. Boston was expected to get 4 to 9 inches before tapering off Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"It's time to move on to another season,\" said Pancho Ortega, who was clearing the sidewalk outside his soon-to-open restaurant in Philadelphia.\n\nAirlines canceled more than 4,000 flights Wednesday. On the ground, Amtrak scaled back service on the Northeast corridor between Washington and Boston, and some states banned trucks from major highways. At least two traffic deaths were reported in New Jersey and on New York's Long Island.\n\nPatience was wearing thin as the fourth major storm in three weeks pounded the region.\n\n\"I want warm! I'm done with the cold,\" said Yana Damoiseau, a pedestrian in New York City.\n\nIn New Jersey, some streets were flooded along the shore, including one in Point Pleasant Beach where a pair of ducks cruised back and forth through an intersection where a plastic garbage can bobbed in the waves.\n\nThe storm also unloaded snow on Virginia and West Virginia as it pushed into the Northeast. Virginia reported more 240 traffic accidents.\n\nBut not everyone was sick of the snow.\n\nIn Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania, about 90 miles outside Philadelphia, 10-year-old siblings Talia and Miles Broadhurst made their own fun on yet another day off from school, climbing onto the family SUV and sliding down the snow-slicked windshield and hood before plopping onto the snow.\n\n\"If the snow keeps me away from school, I'm fine with it,\" Miles said.",

The rights group says that previously, in order to view a Chinese account, Beijing would have had to go through the U.S. legal system. Now, communist officials will be able to go through China's compliant courts.\n\n\"Apple's pursuit of profits has left Chinese iCloud users facing huge new privacy risks,\" Amnesty's East Asia Director Nicholas Bequelin alleged in a statement. Apple reported record earnings of $17.9 billion in Greater China in the last quarter, up from US$16.2 billion in the same period a year ago.\n\nAccording to some estimates, mainland China is the largest market of iPhone users.\n\n\"By handing over its China iCloud service to a local company without sufficient safeguards, the Chinese authorities now have potentially unfettered access to all Apple's Chinese customers' iCloud data. Apple knows it, yet has not warned its customers in China of the risks,\" Bequelin said.\n\nThe human rights group this week launched a social media campaign targeting Apple, just in time to coincide with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's visit to Beijing.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Apple said it had to comply with the new Chinese laws, and ultimately decided it was better to allow local hosting of the iCloud than to discontinue the service, which it argued could lead to an even greater erosion of users' data privacy and security.\n\n\"While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful,\" it said.",

The AP reported Sunday that Kushner Cos. stated in more than 80 permit applications that it had zero rent-regulated tenants in its buildings when it, in fact, had hundreds.\n\nThe false filings were made while Kushner Cos. was run by Jared Kushner, now senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald Trump. The false filings were all signed by a Kushner employee, sometimes by its chief operating officer. None were signed by Jared Kushner himself.\n\nThe false documents allowed the Kushner Cos. to escape extra scrutiny during construction at 34 of its buildings, many which showed a sharp decline in rent-regulated units following the work. Housing Rights Initiative, a watchdog group that uncovered the false filings, says that made it easier for the Kushner Cos. to harass the low-paying, rent-regulated tenants so they would leave, freeing up apartments for higher-paying tenants.\n\nThe Kushner Cos. said Wednesday that it is the victim of \"politically motivated attacks.\" It said it values and respects its tenants and operates under \"the highest legal and ethical standards.\"\n\nIn earlier statements the company said it outsourced preparation of its permit applications to third parties, and described the wrong information as \"mistakes or typographical errors.\" It also said it corrected mistakes as soon as it spotted them.\n\nThe buildings department confirmed on Wednesday that its building marshal's office had launched investigations into possible false paperwork.\n\n\"Our building marshal is a key part of our Tenant Harassment Task Force,\" spokesman Joseph Soldevere said. \"And when they inspect a building they look into everything from the roof to the cellar to find illegal construction, and that's what they are doing.\"\n\nThe agency has disciplined a contractor involved in false filings at two Kushner buildings, he said.\n\nThe Kushners Cos. filed more than one permit application at many of the buildings under investigation. At least 10 of the 29 applications under investigation were filed by prior owners.\n\nOn Monday, the city council launched a joint investigation with Housing Rights Initiative into the false filings.\n\nThe heads of the joint investigations, Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, and Housing Rights Initiative founder Aaron Carr, said in a statement that they were encouraged by the buildings department probe, but that more needed to be done.\n\n\"The predatory practices of Kushner Companies is symptomatic of a systemic failure in DOB enforcement,\" it said.",

                "title": "Peru's President Offers to Resign Ahead of Impeachment Vote",
                "body": "(LIMA, Peru) -- Embattled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski offered his resignation Wednesday ahead of an impeachment vote, seeking to put an end to a fast-moving political drama playing out just three weeks before the Andean nation is set to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a regional summit.\n\nIn a nationwide televised address, Kuczynski, flanked by his cabinet, lashed out at opponents led by the daughter of former strongman Alberto Fujimori for allegedly plotting his overthrow with damaging leaks of confidential documents that raised doubts about his integrity and made it impossible to govern.\n\n\"I don't want to be an obstacle blocking our nation from finding the path to unity and harmony that it so much needs and which I was denied,\" he said, adding that the campaign in favor of his removal had caused \"enormous damage\" to Peru's democracy.\n\nCongress was scheduled to debate Thursday on whether to accept the resignation, which would transfer power to First Vice President Martin Vizcarra. It could also decide to reject his offer and plow ahead with impeachment proceedings, which a large majority of lawmakers had favored before Kuczynski resigned.\n\nBeyond the conservative leader's departure, the outlook is uncertain, with many Peruvians expressing disgust with their entire political class -- not just Kuczynski but also his accusers, led by Fujimori's daughter Keiko.\n\nVizcarra, who is in Canada, where he had been serving as Peru's ambassador, hasn't said whether he would form a government to try and finish Kuczynski's term ending in 2021. If he and the country's second vice president resign in solidarity with Kuczynski, as they vowed during a previous impeachment attempt in December, power would transfer to the head of congress, who would be required by the constitution to call new elections -- for both president and congress -- within a year.\n\n\"The only public institution with moral authority left in Peru is the fire department,\" said Oscar Mendoza, a lawyer standing outside the presidential palace moments after Kuczynski waved goodbye to aides and stepped into a tinted SUV for a lonely drive to his Lima mansion. \"All the rest, when you touch them with your finger, puss comes out because they are fully corrupted by graft.\"\n\nPressure has been building on Kuczynski to resign after the shock revelation Tuesday of secretly shot videos in which several of the president's allies were caught allegedly trying to buy the support of an opposition lawmaker to block the conservative leader's impeachment.\n\nThe videos presented by Keiko Fujimori's party purportedly show attempts by Kuczynski's lawyer, a government official, and Fujimori's son Kenji trying to convince the lawmaker to back the president in exchange for a hand in lucrative state contracts.\n\nKuczynski said the videos had been heavily edited to smear him and recalled practices from \"sad days of Peru's history that we thought had been overcome.\"\n\nHe was referring to Fujimori's longtime spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, who secretly recorded himself paying cash bribes to media moguls, military officers and politicians in efforts to gain leverage over potential rivals and boost his almost unlimited power.\n\nKenji Fujimori led a group of rebellious lawmakers in December who defied his sister's leadership of the Popular Force party to narrowly block Kuczynski's removal. Days later, Kuczynski pardoned the feuding siblings' father from a 25-year jail sentence for human rights abuses committed during his decade-long presidency.\n\nA new impeachment vote had been scheduled to take place Thursday and Kuczynski had been scrambling for support.\n\nKeiko Fujimori, who has publicly distanced herself from her father, had accused Kuczynski of orchestrating the alleged vote-buying scheme.\n\nThe videos released Tuesday portray the president's allies trying to lure lawmaker Moises Mamani to their side with promises of lucrative contracts.\n\nIn one exchange, Freddy Aragon, the head of the government agency regulating firearms, tells Mamani that he stands to pocket 5 percent of future public works projects authorized by the executive branch in his district. In another, Kuczynski's lawyer hands the waffling lawmaker the transportation minister's cell phone.\n\n\"Those who've voted in favor of impeachment have all the doors closed to them,\" Kenji Fujimori tells Mamani in one of the recordings.\n\nPeru's chief prosecutor as well as congress said they would open a criminal probe into the videos.\n\nKuczynski is accused of lying as president about $782,000 in payments his consulting firm received a decade earlier from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.\n\nOdebrecht is at the center of Latin America's biggest graft scandal, having admitted to paying some $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America, including $29 million to politicians in Peru.",

To promote more women in the science, Saruhashi also started the Society of Japanese Women Scientists in 1958 with an mission to have more women contributing to sciences and world peace.\n\n\"There are many women who have the ability to become great scientists. I would like to see the day when women can contribute to science and technology on an equal footing with men,\" she once said.\n\nSaruhashi's first major contribution to the field involved a methodology to determine CO2 levels in seawater. She was the first to determine carbonic acid levels based on temperature, pH Level, and chlorinity. Today, oceanographers call this \"Saruhashi's Table\".\n\nHer second major area of research was to quantify nuclear pollution caused by testing in the 1950s. She measured the amount of radioactivity in seawater and found that fallout from U.S. atomic tests in the Marshall Islands in the 1950s reached Japan after about a year and a half. Her findings on how radioactivity spreads helped led to restrictions on oceanic nuclear experimentation in 1963.\n\nIn 1981, Saruhashi founded the Saruhashi Prize, an annual award to recognize the research contributions of female scientists.\n\nShe died in 2007 of pneumonia.\n\nGoogle's Doodle remembers Saruhashi with an illustration that depicts her with a clipboard in front of a turbulent blue sea.",

The gathering kicked off Monday evening with a joint-dinner at a Helsinki restaurant where the delegations were seen arriving.\n\nMedia were largely kept in the dark about the identities of the delegates and issues on the table, apart from Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini saying Tuesday that denuclearization wasn't on the agenda.\n\nWhat is known, however, is that senior North Korean diplomat Choe Kang Il, who handles North American affairs for his government, was among delegates from Pyongyang, while the U.S. delegation is believed to have included Kathleen Stephens, the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea.\n\nIt was the first in a series of planned meetings between the Koreas and the U.S. involving unofficial talks between current and former officials, and academics. The meetings are likely to be important for establishing summit expectations and possibly even agenda items.\n\nThe Helsinki talks took place just a few days after North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho concluded separate diplomatic talks in neighboring Sweden on Saturday.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto said Monday that his country, which has a long history of hosting international summits, received a request to host the meeting \"through middlemen.\"\n\n\"We're happy to host it and hope that discussions can bring issues forward,\" he told reporters before the talks.\n\nSenior South Korean officials who recently visited North Korea's capital said that Kim agreed to hold talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in late April. They said Kim also proposed meeting with Trump.\n\nTrump then agreed to meet Kim by the end of May. North Korea has yet to confirm talks with the U.S., but its official media on Tuesday carried a commentary saying there \"has been a sign of change\" in U.S.-North Korean relations.\n\nThe developments have raised hopes for a potential breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear crisis. But many experts say tensions could flare again if the summits fail to make progress, leaving the nuclear issue with few diplomatic options.\n\nThe South Korean officials who traveled to North Korea said that Kim is willing to discuss the North's nuclear weapons program.",

He has also drawn criticism for sidestepping an outright apology in previous interviews this week with the New York Times and in a public Facebook post, in which called the scandal \"a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us,\" but fell short of apologizing for the incident.\n\nHe amended those comments Thursday, telling CNN's Seagall that Facebook made a \"mistake\" in 2015 after it was approached by the Guardian about a quiz app that was harvesting the data of tens of millions of users.\n\n\"I think that this was clearly a mistake in retrospect,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We need to make sure we don't make that mistake ever again.\"\n\nHe also promised that Facebook would build new apps to help users' identify whether their data was compromised, by Cambridge Analytica and in the future, and promised an \"intensive process\" of reviewing questionable third-party activity on the social network.\n\n\"I regret that we didn't do at the time and I think we got that wrong and we are committed to getting that right going forward,\" he said.",

                "title": "How Bomb Investigators Piece Together the Clues After an Explosion",
                "body": "An intense manhunt for a serial bomber in Austin, Texas, ended in the early morning hours Wednesday when a 23-year-old suspect killed himself with an explosion inside his vehicle as a SWAT team closed in.\n\nAuthorities identified the man as Mark Anthony Conditt, a resident of a town located about 20 miles north of Austin, who went from \"person of interest\" to prime suspect mere hours before his death. There were deep fears that yet-to-be found unexploded bombs were still strewn around the city, but police assured the Austin community that the nightmare was over.\n\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters late Wednesday that Conditt left a 25-minute recording on his cell phone, which detailed the pipe bomb attacks.\n\n\"I would classify this as a confession,\" Manley told reporters, adding the suspect did not leave a motive or a specific reason why the suspect targeted the people who were killed or injured in the attacks.\n\nConditt discussed seven explosive devices in his recording. Authorities said all seven have been recovered.\n\nThe bombs exploded on front porches, near a city sidewalk, and inside FedEx facility. The blasts killed two people, injured four others, and terrorized a state capital known for its laid back atmosphere. For three weeks, Austin became a city on edge with each new blast, intensifying the pressure on law enforcement to identify a culprit.\n\nBut how do authorities find a faceless killer whose murder weapon bursts into a ball of fiery debris?\n\nHundreds of federal agents from the FBI and ATF descended on central Texas in hopes of turning up clues on one of the most baffling and audacious cases in recent memory. The agents, along with local police bomb units combed through each square-inch of the five blast areas looking for charred bomb fragments and scorched electronic bits to help determine how the bombs were constructed, what they were made from, and ultimately who built them.\n\n\"The ATF explosive experts working with the FBI bomb technicians have been able to reconstruct all these devices throughout this investigation, so that's how we know what the components are,\" ATF Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski told reporters. \"I know to the public they may look all different, but when you look at the internal components they're very similar to us, and from laboratory analysis we know the same person who manufactured them.\"\n\nFederal agents found homemade explosives and bomb components in one room of Conditt's house, which were consistent with other evidence that authorities collected, he said.\n\nThe forensic work, which involved on-scene investigators and lab scientists from across the country, found the suspect's bombs were all powered by \"exotic\" batteries made in Asia that had been ordered online, according to a NBC News report. Once investigators knew they were dealing with the same bomb maker, the report said, they began looking for mobile phones that repeatedly showed up in areas near the blasts.\n\nThe biggest break came after surveillance video at a FedEx store in south Austin captured a man believed to be Conditt -- wearing gloves, a ball cap, and a long blonde wig -- as he paid to mail two packages. One of those packages exploded at a FedEx facility, 60 miles south of Austin, while another intact package containing an explosive device was found at a FedEx facility near the Austin airport.\n\nThe explosion turned out to be the fifth in the series of bombings. Three previous bombs were hidden in packages at the front door of homes. The fourth, injured two bicyclists, was triggered by a tripwire attached to a street sign.\n\nA detailed examination of each of the scenes helped provided the earliest clues that launched a sweeping manhunt for the identity of the bomber or bombers.\n\n\"If a device explodes, the general belief among the public is that it's all gone, but there's quite a bit of physical evidence that remains at the scene,\" said Adam Hall, a forensic explosives expert who previously worked in the Massachusetts State Police crime laboratory.\n\nThe type of explosive used may also glean telltale clues for investigators to piece together the device. They swab victims' clothing and surroundings for post-blast residue. They use a handheld chemical detection device, called an ion mobility spectrometer, to \"sniff\" the air for material. Some explosives contain taggants, uniquely encoded chemical markers, which identify where they came from.\n\nIt's like putting a puzzle together, Hall said, even if you can't find all the pieces.\n\n\"Time is of the essence,\" he said. \"You have an individual or individuals who are creating these devices, causing public harm and panic, and killing people. \"\n\nCollecting the smallest splinter can be crucial, he said. Traces of DNA or fingerprints may be present that analysts can attempt to match to a suspect. Also, if part of the device's wiring, timer, or circuit board is recovered, for instance, it could help narrow the search on where the components were manufactured or purchased.\n\nInvestigators in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed all 243 passengers and 16 crew, were able to track a fragment of the device's circuit board -- the size of a thumb nail -- to its manufacturer, then onto those responsible: two Libyan nationals.\n\n\"Lots of material survives from the bombing -- metal parts, tape, plastic -- to link the bombings,\" said Jimmie Oxley, the co-director of the University of Rhode Island's Center of Excellence in Explosives, Detection, Mitigation, and Response. \"They will look for matches.\"\n\nThe ATF's National Response Team works with state and local investigators to gather evidence, reconstruct the scene, identify the origin of the blast and determine the cause on the nation's highest profile bombings. The team is composed of veteran special agents, forensic chemists, explosives enforcement officers, and trained canines.\n\nWith even the scantest amount of evidence, investigators try to reassemble the bomb. Once they do, the materials can be cross-referenced with the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center in Quantico, Virginia. The immense facility, known as the \"bomb library of America,\" was established in 2003 and serves as a database and repository for improvised explosive devices collected from around the globe.\n\nThe wars Iraq and Afghanistan have generated a wealth of knowledge in the U.S. government about tactics, techniques, and procedures used in crafting explosive devices, said Mark Sanders, a retired Navy commander who worked in Explosive Ordnance Disposal. No matter how much care a bomber takes into making a device, he or she will reveal something.\n\n\"There's a lot to look for,\" he said. \"Whether it's a latent fingerprint or DNA or tool marking or type of explosive, you can't hide it all.\"",

He said the 25-minute recording was found on a phone that was in Conditt's possession Wednesday morning, when he died after detonating a bomb inside his car while police approached the vehicle.\n\nManley said police have still not determined Conditt's motive. In the recording, the 23-year-old Conditt described seven explosive devices, all of which have now been recovered by police, and detailed how he constructed them, Manley said.\n\n\"Having listened to that recording, he does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate,\" Manley said Wednesday. \"But instead, it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\"\n\nThe series of explosions -- which killed two people and injured several others -- spread fear across the Texas capital over a nearly three-week period, while police tried to track down a suspect and stop further attacks.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Wednesday afternoon, Conditt's aunt said the family was devastated and shocked by his role in the attacks.\n\n\"We are devastated and broken at the news that our family could be involved in such an awful way. We had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in,\" the statement said. \"Our family is a normal family in every way. We love, we pray, and we try to inspire and serve others.

                "body": "Conor Lamb, Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, smiles as Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), right, speaks during a campaign at the Greene County Fairgrounds in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Sunday, March 11, 2018.\n\nRepublican Rick Saccone conceded defeat to Democrat Conor Lamb on Wednesday night in a closely watched special election in Pennsylvania, more than a week after the end of a remarkable race that has shaken GOP confidence ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\nLamb, 33, claimed the seat by about 750 votes in a Republican-held district that President Donald Trump won by almost 20 percentage points just 16 months ago. Lamb, who struck a moderate tone during the race and was backed by the district's influential labor unions, beat Saccone, a state lawmaker who had compiled one of the most conservative voting records in the state Legislature.\n\nLamb also benefited from what Pittsburgh-area Democrats called the party's most energized electorate they had ever seen, driven by an anti-Trump fervor.\n\nOn Twitter, Lamb said he had just gotten off the phone with Saccone and congratulated him \"for a close, hard-fought race.\"\n\nRepublicans considered seeking a recount request or a lawsuit to contest the result, even as vote-counting over the past week continued to pad Lamb's lead.\n\nThe seat became open in October when eight-term Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned amid a sex scandal.\n\nLocally, the outcome has a short-term effect.\n\nThe district is dissolving under a court-ordered redraw of Pennsylvania's 18 congressional districts, leaving Lamb to seek the nomination to challenge three-term Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in a newly drawn district west of Pittsburgh that is considered a toss-up. Saccone is running in a new, more Republican district in Pennsylvania's southwest corner that retains much of the territory he and Lamb campaigned in for the last four months.\n\nNationally, Lamb's win highlights Democratic potential and Republican vulnerabilities ahead of the fall campaign with the GOP trying to defend its majorities in Congress. Democrats are now 23 seats shy of the majority -- though it effectively stays at 24 because Lamb is pursuing Rothfus' seat.\n\nIn the race, Lamb downplayed opposition to Trump, who remains more popular in the district than nationally. He opposed sweeping new gun regulations and supported Trump's steel tariffs, but he is a fierce critic of Republicans' tax cuts and their economic and health care policies.\n\nSaccone, 60, adhered to Republican orthodoxy and openly embraced Trump, who tweeted many times on his behalf and campaigned in person twice, including a raucous rally the Saturday before voters cast ballots.\n\nOutside Republican groups spent more than $10 million -- about seven times as much as outside groups spent for Lamb -- with much of it attacking Lamb as a stooge for national Democrats, particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Lamb, however, distanced himself from Pelosi and held national Democrats at arm's length while he easily outraised Saccone in campaign cash.",

                "body": "France is proposing a bill that would charge immediate fines of up to $920 for public sexual harassment.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the legislation, which is backed by French President Emmanuel Macron and French Junior Minister for Gender Equality, Marlène Schiappa, would require sexual offenders be charged fees on-the-spot ranging from $110 to $920 for public behavior like making \"degrading or humiliating comments\" or making \"sexual or sexist\" actions towards someone. It was also proposed that fines could increase for repeat offenders or especially hostile or aggressive harassment.\n\n\"The idea is that it is high enough to be a deterrent but also that we could be sure the harasser can pay it immediately, so that the law can be efficient,\" Schiappa said of the sexual harassment fees.\n\nThe bill also proposes that France's age of consent be raised to 15 -- currently, sex with children is criminalized in the country, but rape charges must be proven with evidence of violence or coercion. This stipulation follows backlash over a case where a rape charge was dropped after a court decided that an 11-year-old girl consented to have sex with a man who was over twice her age. The legislation will also raise the statue of limitations to the age of 48 for survivors who were raped as children, 10 years more than what they are currently given.\n\nThe bill is being presented during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday and will go to parliament after that.",

                "title": "The School Shooting Generation Has Had Enough",
                "body": "It's lunchtime on a Tuesday, and the kids are piling into a pizzeria booth in Coral Springs, Fla., to plot a revolution. \"The adults know that we're cleaning up their mess,\" says Cameron Kasky, an 11th-grader at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who started the #NeverAgain movement to curb gun violence three weeks earlier in his living room. \"It's like they're saying, 'I'm sorry I made this mess,'\" adds buzzcut senior Emma González, \"while continuing to spill soda on the floor.\"\n\nKasky and González are sitting with two more of the movement's leaders, Alex Wind and Jaclyn Corin. Except they're not sitting, exactly. They're crouching diagonally on the seat and leaning back on one another's knees in order to devour their calzones while maintaining as much physical contact as possible. Corin throws a crouton into González's mouth. Kasky uses Corin's knees as a pillow. The conversation turns from their fellow organizer David Hogg (\"So laser-focused,\" González says, that \"he could make his body get pregnant if he wanted to\") to the conspiracy theory that they're actors being paid by shadowy donors (prompting Kasky to ask why his credit card was recently declined at McDonald's) to their prolific trolling of the NRA. They agree that the gun lobby's spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, is \"very hot but kind of scary,\" as González puts it.\n\nThe pizza joint is a few hundred yards away from the school where 17 of their peers and teachers were murdered a month ago. At 2:21 p.m. on Valentine's Day, according to authorities, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, a former student, entered the freshman building armed with an AR-15 and opened fire into four classrooms on the first floor. Corin had just delivered carnations to the building to raise funds for junior prom; she had handed one flower to a girl who was shot minutes later. After the fire alarm went off during his AP environmental science class, Hogg took a video of students crouching inside a tiny classroom to hide from the shooter. The video went viral, landing him a recurring spot on the cable-TV circuit. The next day, Kasky invited Wind and Corin over to his house to plan a march for gun reform. Together, they started the #NeverAgain hashtag on Twitter.\n\nMost of these kids cannot vote, order a beer, make a hotel reservation or afford a pizza without pooling some of their allowance. On the surface, they're not so different from previous generations of idealistic teenagers who set out to change the world, only to find it is not so easy. Yet over the past month, these students have become the central organizers of what may turn out to be the most powerful grassroots gun-reform movement in nearly two decades. For much of the rest of the country, numbed and depressed by repeated mass shootings, the question has become, Can these kids actually do it?\n\nNo one thinks it will be easy. Gun violence in America is one of those problems that can feel truly hopeless. The U.S. has only 4.4% of the world's population, yet it accounts for roughly 42% of the world's guns, according to the comprehensive 2007 Small Arms Survey. And roughly 31% of the world's mass shooters are American, according to a University of Alabama study. Even as mass-shooting deaths mount, our Second Amendment has made gun rights a third-rail issue: roughly 90% of Americans agree on \"common-sense\" solutions like universal background checks, yet absolutists stand in the way of any meaningful action.\n\nAfter Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six staff members at a Connecticut elementary school in December 2012, politicians tried to tackle the issue. President Obama issued Executive Orders to strengthen the background-check system and study gun violence, and several states tightened gun restrictions. Yet Congress failed to pass a modest bipartisan bill to close loopholes for gun sales. In the five years since, a familiar pattern has emerged. Every month or so, a killer shoots innocent people at random. There is a brief period of mourning. Democrats offer feeble pleas for new gun limits; Republicans offer \"thoughts and prayers.\" No substantial laws are passed, and the nation moves on. This was the response when Omar Mateen killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016; when Stephen Paddock massacred 58 people at a Las Vegas concert last October; when Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church in November.\n\nBut in the days after the Parkland shooting, something different happened. The Parkland kids, at once tearful and cutting, publicly called out the NRA's influence on national politics, and shamed the leaders they considered responsible for the nation's lax gun laws. (Privately, they have dubbed Florida Governor Rick Scott \"Voldemort\" and called Senator Marco Rubio some names that are unprintable.) Their voices quickly went viral. González had no Twitter account before the shooting -- 11 days later, she had more followers than the NRA. They called for specific changes like a renewed assault-weapons ban, universal background checks and digitized gun -- ownership records.\n\nPerhaps most important, the Parkland kids painted the NRA and their allies as the mortal enemies of the roughly 50 million schoolkids growing up in what Kasky calls \"the mass-shooting generation.\" They took the mantle of \"personal protection\" from the gun lobby, while reframing the larger gun debate along generational lines.\n\nAnd so news that was once met with sad resignation now drives teenagers to march in the streets. On March 14, nearly a million kids across the country left class for the National School Walkout to protest the school-shooting epidemic. Support for stronger gun regulations spiked to 68% after the shooting, up from 60% last November, according to a Politico/Morning Consult survey. Public support for the NRA is down to 37%, according to a WSJ/NBC poll, the first time since 2000 that the organization has been viewed more negatively than positively. Companies from Delta Airlines to Hertz to MetLife cut ties with the NRA. Dick's Sporting Goods announced it would stop carrying assault weapons. Florida, known for its historically soft gun policies, passed a bill March 9 that bans bump stocks, imposes a waiting period, raises the minimum age to buy a weapon and allows cops to take guns from mentally disturbed people. Sixty-seven NRA-endorsed Republicans voted for the bill, and the gun-friendly GOP Governor Scott signed it.\n\nHow a movement catches fire is always a mystery, but the Parkland kids seem matched for this moment. They're young enough to be victimized by a school shooting, but old enough to shape the aftermath. Like many teenagers, they're at a peculiar stage in their lives where they feel at once vulnerable and invincible, highly social yet impervious to the etiquette expected from adults. Their bombastic style mirrors President Trump's: they call their enemies names and hurl sick burns at politicians and lobbyists as if they're shouting across the locker room.\n\nNone of which means they'll actually succeed, and the kids are not entirely naive about their chances. They know the GOP-controlled Congress is unlikely to pass meaningful new gun laws. Although Trump briefly signaled support for strengthening background checks, he quickly abandoned that position. Nor do the Parkland kids speak for everyone, by a long shot: polls show that young people as a whole do not necessarily favor stricter gun laws than their parents. Which means the kids face the same question as the movements before them: If this government doesn't respond to their demands, did their movement make a difference?\n\nThe first big test will come on March 24 with the student-led March for Our Lives, which already has registered more than 800 demonstrations in all 50 states and on six continents. (\"Sorry, Antarctica, y'all are gonna get shot,\" Kasky quips.) The organizers plan to allow only young speakers to address the Washington march, and only artists under 24 can submit official poster designs. The march is meant to expand voter registration among like-minded members of the school-shooting generation: the kids that grew up post-Columbine, who huddled behind barricades during active-shooter drills and learned to tape construction paper over classroom windows.\n\nFrom there, the Parkland kids plan to make gun reform the central issue for young voters in the midterms. \"We're going to show these politicians that we're coming for them,\" says Hogg. Kasky is more ambitious. \"The world failed us,\" he says, \"and we're here to make a new one that's going to be easier on the next generation. If you're against that, then get out.\"\n\nThe youth revolt is being planned in a donated office space in a strip mall, next to a mediocre deli in a small town near Parkland. To get inside the three windowless rooms where the #NeverAgain movement is headquartered, you have to knock three times on a locked glass door and then loudly identify yourself so the kids are sure you're not an armed stalker. (They have received death threats.) Inside the lair, there are boxes of March for Our Lives T-shirts and a bust of Robert F. Kennedy next to whiteboards with schedules of conference calls. On one wall there's a collage of mail that runs the gamut from encouraging to obscene. (An excerpt from one letter, sent to 17-year-old Parkland organizer Delaney Tarr: \"Shut the f-ck up, you stupid f-cking c-nt.\") On another there's a map of the U.S. where the teens have labeled the hundreds of sibling marches. A broom closet near the back bears a sheet of notebook paper that says Cameron Kasky's office, directly across from a tiny bathroom labeled Cameron Kasky's other office.\n\nEverything crackles with a sense of ferocious optimism. It feels like the last rehearsal of a high school musical, halftime at state championships, the final days of senior year. The kids stream in and out on no particular schedule, tumble to the floor to read their fan mail, twirl around on chairs while composing tweets and crowd into a tiny conference room for calls with reporters or lawmakers. One day, they spent an afternoon making a video mocking NRA spokeswoman Loesch (they call her \"the woman from the SuperBeets commercial\" after digging up an old spot she did for a beet-juice product). Another day, they met with Representative Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat who represents Parkland in Congress. There's a sense that anything can happen in this little corner of the teenage universe, because all kinds of things can.\n\nGun politics have vexed adult organizers for decades, but so far the Parkland teens have had striking successes. Even though the kids are disappointed in the Florida bill (\"It's like they tried to take a big step forward and then tripped,\" Hogg says), it's still the first significant piece of gun legislation to come out of the Florida legislature in at least 20 years. The March 14 school walkouts, organized by Women's March youth groups, surpassed the 750,000 protesters who flooded the Washington Mall for the Million Mom March in 2000 in what was then the largest gun-safety protest in U.S. history. \"This youth movement is unprecedented,\" says Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which was formed by the organizations behind the 2000 march. \"What's different here is that the children who are impacted are older, and they are able to give voice in a way that could not happen before.\"\n\nThe #NeverAgain organizers built a movement with the skills they learned in high school. Hogg, an aspiring journalist who studies TV production at Stoneman Douglas, has anointed himself the movement's \"press secretary.\" Corin, the bubbly junior class president who did a 50-page term paper on gun control last year, organized roughly 100 students to travel to Tallahassee to lobby the state legislature. Kasky and Wind, both drama kids, have given some of the most emotional testimony about the shooting and their dead classmates. González gave a speech about the NRA's influence that was informed by an AP government lesson on special-interest groups.\n\nThe kids are social-media natives who have used Twitter to stir up the same kind of fervor Trump does. If the President can mock his enemies, they reason, then why can't high school students? \"People always say, 'Get off your phones,' but social media is our weapon,\" says Corin. \"Without it, the movement wouldn't have spread this fast.\"\n\nTeens have always had a unique talent for humiliation, and social media only sharpens their knives. If the Parkland kids were targeting their classmates instead of powerful lobbyists or Senators, their taunts could be mistaken for bullying. But going up against the NRA, they're like mouthy Davids slinging stones at Goliath. \"They're using Twitter as a means to ridicule, to dismiss, to brush past the usual criticisms and just say, 'These people are full of it,'\" says Robert Spitzer, a professor of political science at SUNY Cortland who has written five books on gun policy. \"The door for this has been opened by Donald Trump himself.\"\n\nAs teenagers who survived a school shooting, they're politically hard to hit: if the NRA or the GOP fight back, they are attacking young victims of a tragedy. One GOP candidate for the Maine house of representatives who called González a \"skinhead lesbian\" on Twitter faced so much online backlash that he dropped out of the race.\n\nThe students have had plenty of help. They've raised more than $4 million from small donors on the crowdfunding site GoFundMe, plus a couple million more from celebrities like George and Amal Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey. A top Hollywood PR firm is assisting with press requests pro bono, and Women's March organizer Deena Katz is volunteering as a consultant on the march. The gun-reform advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, backed by billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, has given out more than $1 million in grants to local organizers planning sibling marches around the country, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is sending busloads of kids to Washington, D.C. Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer pledged $1 million to gun-safety groups' efforts to register more high school students to vote. \"Our biggest problem is that we're getting too much help,\" says Corin.\n\nThey know that other youth campaigns against gun violence, including those led by black activists in urban communities, have not gotten the same financial support or media attention. \"We came from an affluent area, and we're mostly white, and we have to use that privilege,\" says Tarr. The kids say they are trying to correct the imbalance. A letter from the Dream Defenders, a racial-justice group formed after the killing of Trayvon Martin, is hanging on the office wall. And in early March, the teens invited young activists from the Peace Warriors, a Chicago anti-violence group, to Parkland to discuss coordinating their efforts. \"We're fighting for the same thing,\" says Arieyanna Williams, a high school senior from Chicago who has been working with the Peace Warriors since sophomore year. \"We found our voice in Parkland. We didn't really have it here.\"\n\nInside the office, there is no adult supervision beyond Matt Deitsch and Kaylyn Pipitone, two 20-year-old college students and recent Stoneman Douglas alums who help with things that only adults can do, like signing contracts and insurance forms and paperwork for their 501(c)(4). \"We want the grownups we need in this, and nothing more,\" says Kasky. \"We only have people doing the things that as 17-year-olds we cannot.\" At an early #NeverAgain meeting, parents asked how they could help, recalls Alex Wind's mother.\n\nThe answer came back: \"Order pizza.\"\n\nThe March for Our Lives almost certainly won't lead to major gun legislation in Congress this year. But the Parkland teens are taking the long view. To them, this movement is as much about mobilizing young voters as it is about gun violence. The voter-registration group HeadCount plans to dispatch roughly 5,000 volunteers to sign up young voters at U.S. marches. The Parkland kids say their goal is for 4 out of 5 young people to vote in November's midterm elections. \"Either have the politicians pass legislation or set them up to be voted out,\" Kasky says. \"It's a win-win.\" If only it were that simple. Only 39% of voters between 18 and 20 voted in the 2016 election, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, and only 14% of voters that age showed up to cast a ballot in the 2014 midterms. Previous turnout drives have not had much success.Not all young people vote Democratic, either. While Trump has a historically low approval rating among millennials (only 6% strongly approve of him, while 46% strongly disapprove), almost a third of millennials lean Republican, according to a Pew survey. Only 49% of 18-to-29-year-olds favored a renewed assault-weapons ban in a 2015 Pew survey, while more than half of respondents of other age groups did support a ban.\n\nThey envision a youth political movement that will address many of the other issues affecting the youngest Americans. Hogg says he would like to have a youth demonstration every year on March 24, harnessing the power of teenage anger to demand action on everything from campaign-finance reform to net neutrality to climate change. But even if none of this works -- even if they never pass comprehensive gun reform, and net neutrality fails, and Citizens United endures, and climate-change legislation stalls -- today's teenage rebels will become tomorrow's establishment leaders, informed by the experience that may already be shaping the gun debate.\n\nAnd that, says Hogg, is the bottom line for politicians who side with the NRA. \"You're gonna be smeared in the textbooks. Your legacy is gone,\" he says. \"If you don't stand up with us now, you'll be standing against us.\"",

Vanity Fair reports it has sold over 180,000 copies, and has more on backorder, according to the New York Post.\n\nLast Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is actually written by Last Week Tonight staffer Jill Twiss with illustrations by EG Keller. It follows a day in the life of fluffy creature Bundo as he discovers a romantic partner -- a boy bunny -- and they ultimately tie the knot. That storyline is meant to oppose Pence's stated policy positions to LGBT rights including marriage equality.\n\nOn Tuesday, the parody book was Amazon's top seller, with a slew of five-star reviews. (Pence's book is still in stock on Amazon, and has a 4.5 star rating.) For those still looking to purchase the picture book, Oliver has assured audiences that they're re-printing and plan on having more in stock in the next few weeks -- they just didn't expect this level of interest in the joke story.",

                "body": "Chinese space lab Tiangong-1 (or \"heavenly palace\") is set to fall back to Earth some time at the end of March or beginning of April. The catch: It's unclear where it will fall.\n\nThe 19,000-pound space lab -- China's precursor to a space station, according to NPR -- was decommissioned and de-orbited in 2016, after being in use for nearly five years, Popular Mechanics reported. It has been replaced with Tiangong-2.\n\nTiangong-1's fall to Earth is different from that of other space debris, which often have a controlled burn through the atmosphere and land in the ocean.\n\nInitially, Tiangong-1 was expected to fall towards the end of 2017. As the lab has gotten lower, however, it has been easier to predict the \"when\": \"~30 March to ~6 April,\" according to the European Space Agency. The agency notes that \"This is highly variable.\"\n\nHowever, because the lab orbits the Earth \"several\" times per day, according to Popular Mechanics, the \"where\" is nearly impossible to predict. The organization Aerospace Corporation predicts that it will be somewhere between \"north of 42.7° N latitude or south of 42.7° S latitude.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. William Ailor, an engineer at the Aerospace Corporation's Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies, there is little to worry about in terms of being hit by falling space debris.\n\nMost of the lab will burn up in the atmosphere, Ailor told NPR, and \"somewhere between, say, 2,000 and 8,000 pounds might come down.\"\n\nBecause most of our Earth is covered by the ocean, both Ailor and Popular Mechanics noted, what doesn't burn up in the atmosphere is unlikely to strike a person. The likelihood is \"one million times smaller than the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot,\" according to Aerospace Corporation.\n\nSpace debris of this size falls to Earth multiple times a year.\n\n\"We had three objects reenter randomly in 2016 and four in 2017 the same size range. There were no reports of damage and in general no reports of these actually being seen,\" Ailor told TIME, adding that it's likely Tiangong-1 will come down over water.\n\n\"Of course, there is a chance it will come down over land, but we've never had a reported injury from space debris and only one person has been \"touched\" -- Ms. Lottie Williams was brushed on the shoulder in 1997 and not injured,\" he said.\n\nIf the space lab does fall in a populated area, it could be a spectacular sight for anyone looking at the sky, who could witness the fireball streaks of Tiangong-1 burning up.",

                "body": "Several parts of the federal government are moving to fight near-certain attempts to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections. But even those charged with the task say their efforts may not be enough.\n\n\"We have seen Russian activities and intentions to have an impact on the next election cycle,\" CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who President Trump recently selected as his newest Secretary of State, told Congress last month.\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee, a loose group of other senators and the Federal Election Commission have made recommendations to improve upon systems they say faltered in the 2016 presidential election. But none have the power to ensure these proposals actually translate into law, and officials are urging quick action.\n\n\"This issue is urgent - if we start to fix these problems tomorrow, we still might not be in time to have systems in place by 2020,\" Republican Sen. Richard Burr, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said at a Senate hearing on election security on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look at these proposals and how they could come up short before the midterm elections.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee released its preliminary recommendations Tuesday to beef up election security for 2018. Committee members said their findings revealed Russia had attempted to infiltrate voting systems in at least 21 states and had accessed at least one database, although they said there is no evidence there was influence over votes.\n\nThe committee's recommendations include implementing stronger channels of communication between federal, state and local election officials, increasing cybersecurity measures on election systems - like two-factor authentication when logging into a voting system - and using voting machines that not only lack wi-fi, but have some form of a paper trail.\n\n\"Russia can't hack a piece of paper,\" Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nAlthough the committee is holding a hearing on Wednesday -- in the midst of a heavy snowstorm -- to discuss these recommendations, the members acknowledged proposals can only go so far and urged swift legislative action.\n\nCommittee members also seemed to acknowledge that the clock was ticking to actually turn these proposals into concrete legislation: the midterm elections are less than eight months away, and primaries are already underway.\n\n\"We are already in an election year,\" said Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who sits on the committee. \"The need to act now is urgent.\"\n\nThe recommendations from the Senate Intelligence Committee come on the heels of the the Federal Election Commission approving a a draft notice of a proposed rule, which contains two proposals that would regulate some online political ads.\n\nThe proposed rule changes came in response from the revelations that the Russians had ran political ads on major technology sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google. The proposed rules clarify that disclaimer rules apply to online advertisements that advocate for or against a candidate.\n\nThere will now be a 60-day period where the FEC can receive comments on the proposals and a public hearing is set for June 27. But the FEC still has to write the rule that will be implemented, which is not guaranteed. The commission is supposed to have six members, but is currently operating with four: two Republicans, one Democratic and one independent commissioner, who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nFor anything to move forward, they all have to agree, which will likely require compromise. And even if that were all to happen this summer at the earliest, a majority of the primary elections already would have happened. And even the commissioners acknowledge that the rule is just a tiny step.\n\n\"This was the most I can get an agreement to do and it was a heavy lift,\" Ellen Weintraub, Vice Chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, said in an interview with TIME. \"I wish we could take it further. I wish it could be broader. But this is all we can do in the short term.\"\n\nBut Adav Noti, Senior Director of Trial Litigation at the Campaign Legal Center, and an associate counsel for the FEC from 2013 to 2017, said agreeing on a rule change, no matter how small, is still an improvement.\n\n\"If they're able to reach agreement on an actual proposed rule-making that would be a step forward, even if it's incremental,\" he said.\n\nBoth Weintraub and Noti also stressed the FEC cannot fix all issues of online ad disclosure. And there is a proposal in Congress, the Honest Ads act, which would fix a lot of what the FEC doesn't address.\n\nSponsored by Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John McCain, the act requires online political advertisements adhere to the same standards for ads on television and radio. The act also mandates that major online platforms keep public repositories of ads from any person or group who spends at least $500, which would make the ads easier to track.\n\nThe act has been endorsed by over 25 experts and oversight groups; the Campaign Legal Center said in its January report, \"Examining Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections,\" that the act was essential to impeding holes the Russians took advantage of in 2016.\n\nBut the act was introduced in October - and Congress has not scheduled any hearings or votes on this bill in the subsequent five months.\n\nIn December, a bi-partisan group of Senators introduced another act, the Secure Elections Act, which is designed to prevent cybersecurity threats to election systems. But that act has not been taken up for a vote either.",

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg outlined some concrete steps the social network will take to protect user data, his first public response to the crisis over Cambridge Analytica's access to information from the platform.\n\nHe said the company will do three things:\n\nInvestigate all large apps that were allowed to get data not just on their own users, but on those users' friends, before Facebook changed its policies in 2014, and ban any developers that don't agree to an audit. The company will tell affected users if they find problems. Remove developer access to data if someone hasn't used that app in 3 months, and reduce the type of information the app gets when users sign in. Work to make sure people understand who has access to their data, showing everyone a tool at the top of the News Feed in the next month, and making it easy to revoke permissions.\n\n\"I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nI want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation -- including the steps we've already taken and our next...",

                "body": "(SACRAMENTO, Calif.) -- Relatives, activists and Sacramento officials are questioning why police shot at an unarmed black man 20 times, killing him, when he turned out to be holding only a cellphone in his grandparents' backyard.Relatives have identified the man as Stephan Alonzo Clark, 22, who preferred to go by Stephon, according to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nPolice say the man was spotted breaking at least three vehicle windows Sunday night. Sheriff's deputies in a helicopter say they saw him break a neighbor's sliding glass door.\n\nTwo arriving officers chased him into the backyard of his grandparents' home, where he was staying. The department says he refused orders to stop and show his hands. He advanced toward the officers holding an object extended in front of him, the department said. The officers thought he was pointing a handgun and opened fire, fearing for their safety, the department said.\n\nNo gun was found and only the cellphone was found near his body when more officers arrived and approached him about five minutes after the shooting, the department said.\n\n\"He was at the wrong place at the wrong time in his own backyard?\" Clark's grandmother, Sequita Thompson, told The Sacramento Bee . \"C'mon now, they didn't have to do that.\"\n\nThe department could not say how many times Clark was hit, and the coroner's office was not releasing information until his relatives were notified. The department said the two officers have been with Sacramento police for two and four years, but each has four years' previous experience with other law enforcement agencies. Both are on paid administrative leave.\n\nFamily members said Clark leaves behind two sons, 1 and 3 years old.\n\nClark routinely helped care for his grandparents at their home in south Sacramento, his cousin, Sonia Lewis, told Capitol Public Radio .\n\nBlack Lives Matter Sacramento called it a police murder and wants quick answers.\n\nCity Councilman Larry Carr decried the loss of life and said police must provide timely information. The department is required to release video from the helicopter and the officers' body cameras within 30 days.",

                "title": "Plant Fats Are Healthier Than Animal Fats, Study Says",
                "body": "After being vilified for years, fat is having a comeback. But with so many sources and types of fat out there, it can be hard to keep track of what's healthy and what's not.\n\nA new study, however, offers a simple rule of thumb: Plant fat sources appear to be better for you than animal sources, at least when it comes to monounsaturated fats.\n\nThe research, which was presented Wednesday at an American Heart Association conference in New Orleans, found that plant-based monounsaturated fats -- like those found in vegetable oils, avocados, nuts and seeds -- are associated with a lower risk of dying from heart disease and other causes. Animal-based monounsaturated fats -- like those in meat, dairy and eggs -- are associated with a higher risk, according to the research.\n\n\"We have observed a beneficial role of monounsaturated fats for the prevention of cardiovascular and total mortality when plant-based foods are the primary sources,\" says Marta Guasch-Ferre, a research associate in the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who co-authored the paper with Dr. Geng Zong and Dr. Qi Sun.\n\nThough the researchers could not prove cause-and-effect, they looked for patterns in the dietary data of almost 100,000 people. They followed the people for about 22 years, and people completed food questionnaires every four years. During those decades of follow-up, more than 20,600 people died, roughly 4,500 from heart disease.\n\nPeople who ate lots of plant fats had a 16% lower risk of dying compared to those with lower intakes, while those who ate lots of animal fats had a 21% higher risk, compared to those who didn't eat many of these foods. Replacing even a relatively small number of calories from trans fats, saturated fats and refined carbohydrates with an equal number from plant fats also seemed to cut a person's risk of dying by 10 to 15%, the researchers found.\n\nThe difference between plant versus animal fat sources, Guasch-Ferre says, is likely due to the other nutrients found in those foods. Plant sources of monounsaturated fats are typically also rich in vitamins, polyphenols and polyunsaturated fats -- longer-chain fats which are known to be heart-healthy. Sources of animal fats, on the other hand, tend to contain lots of saturated fat and cholesterol, which can contribute to heart disease.\n\n\"Recently, dietary recommendations have shifted toward diets including higher quantities of plant-based foods over animal-based foods,\" Guasch-Ferre wrote. \"Our results are in accordance with these recommendations.\"",

After days of silence, Zuckerberg on Wednesday outlined steps he said would protect users' information in the future.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a lengthy Facebook post. \"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\n\nFacebook is planning to investigate all apps that have had access to users' data prior to a change the company made in 2014 to limit the information third-party apps could receive, Zuckerberg said. Apps that do not agree to the audit will be banned, and Facebook will alert any users that may have had their information misused. The social media site is also planning to further limit the data apps currently have access to and remove data access to apps a user hasn't used in three months. Lastly, Facebook will be adding a tool that will help people understand what apps have access to their information and provide an easy way to revoke that access.\n\nZuckerberg also provided a timeline for the events surrounding the Cambridge Analytica scandal.",

                "body": "A wildlife ranger comforts Sudan, the last male Northern White Rhino on the planet moments before he passed away.\n\nThe world has been captivated by the loss of a rhino named Sudan, who passed away at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya this week from age-related complications.\n\nElderly for his species, the 45-year-old Sudan lived a long and generally good life that would be almost unthinkable in the wild. His death was not unexpected, yet it has resonated around the world. As the planet's last male northern white rhinoceros, Sudan found stardom as the so-called \"last man standing.\" Some affectionately called him \"the most eligible bachelor in the world.\"\n\nI met Sudan nine years ago, after I heard about a plan to airlift four of the world's last northern white rhinos from a zoo in the Czech Republic to Kenya. It sounded like a storyline for a Disney film of captive animals returning to the wild dusty plains. In reality, it was a desperate, last-ditch effort to save a species. At the time, there were only eight of these rhinos left, all living in captivity.\n\nWhen I saw this gentle, hulking creature in the Czech snow, surrounded by smokestacks and humanity, it seemed so unfair. He looked ancient, part of a species that has lived on this planet for millions of years, yet could not survive mankind.\n\nSudan and three other rhinos left the Dvůr Králové Zoo on a cold night in December 2009. They were brought to move \"free\" on the Kenyan savannas at Ol Pejeta. The hope was to breed them. The air, water and food -- not to mention room to roam -- might stimulate them, experts thought. The offspring could then be used to repopulate Africa. Failing that, they would be cross-bred with southern white rhinos to preserve the genes.\n\nI remember so clearly when Sudan first set foot on the African soil. The skies darkened and torrential rains came moments after we arrived. He put his head in the air to smell the rains and immediately rolled around on the ground. It was his first mud bath since he left the continent as a two-year-old, taken from Sudan, the country with which he shares his name. That Sudan was moved to the Dvůr Králové Zoo may have saved his life; the last known wild rhinos were poached on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2004.\n\nThis week in Kenya, I returned to say goodbye. Moments before he died, Sudan was surrounded by love, together with the people who committed their lives to protecting him and giving him the good life he enjoyed. There were the directors and people from the Dvůr Králové Zoo, staffers and his six dedicated keepers from Ol Pejeta, who spent more time with him than their own children. Veterinarians and other people from Kenya Wildlife Services were present as well. Most of them had been crying for days. I gave Sudan one last scratch on his ear. He leaned his heavy head into mine and the skies opened up just as they had when he arrived here nine years ago. He perked his head up in the pouring rain. All was silent except for one go-away-bird.\n\nPoaching is not slowing down. It's entirely possible, even likely, that if the killing continues, these rhinos -- along with elephants and a host of lesser known plains animals -- will be functionally extinct in our lifetime.\n\nThe plight of wildlife and the conflict between poachers and increasingly militarized rangers has received much-needed attention. But very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the front lines of the poaching wars, and the incredible work being done to strengthen them. We often forget that the best protectors of these landscapes are the local communities. Their efforts are ultimately the best immunization against forces that threaten both their wildlife and way of life. My hope is that Sudan's legacy serves as a catalyst to awaken humanity to this reality.\n\nSudan's death could mean the extinction of his species, though scientists are considering other options involving two remaining females, including stem cell procedures and harvesting eggs. But if there is meaning in Sudan's passing, it's that all hope is not lost. This can be our wake-up call. In a world of more than 7 billion people, we must see ourselves as part of the landscape. Our fate is linked to the fate of animals.\n\nAmi Vitale is a Nikon Ambassador, filmmaker and photographer for National Geographic.

It's a question we all wrestle with, whether we're on a grand adventure or see a funny looking dog on the street. An enthusiastic user of Instagram, travel TV host Anthony Bourdain says he uses it \"as an instrument of aggression.\"\n\nWait, what?\n\n\"I don't want people to feel good when I take a picture of this amazing meal I'm having,\" he says. \"I want them to feel bad. I'm very much guilty of the, 'Look what I'm eating and you're not. I hope you're eating Cheetos right now.'\"\n\nIn fact, 61-year-old Bourdain has even graduated to using Instagram Stories, posting shots of whatever city he happens to be in on that day (he travels roughly 250 days out of the year). \"I like scoring them, music first and then I try to have some banal imagery and then food porn,\" he gleefully says. \"That's like shooting fish in a barrel.\"\n\nBut he's not doing this a hundred times a trip. Posting an endless stream of vacation photos to various social media sites while you're on vacation is easily one of the most spectacularly passive-aggressive humble brags. But more importantly, the habit may also hurt your chances of really experiencing a place. When you hold a camera up, you're putting a wall between yourself and the experience, Bourdain says.\n\nThat's why you might think twice about overusing camera on your next trip. \"If you're shooting everything, you'll be looking at your phone half the time rather than Paris. And, my God, it's Paris!\"",

A person with measles is contagious four days before and four days after the rash appears.\n\n\"Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected,\" the CDC warns.\n\nMeasles is preventable through the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses starting at 12 to 15 months and later between two to four years of age.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is asking that those who may have been exposed and show symptoms call their doctor, so that health professionals can take necessary precautions \"to reduce possible exposures to others at the facility.\"",

                "body": "Parkland students (l-r) Cameron Kasky and Jaclyn Corin appeared on \"Today\" to discuss March for Our Lives rallies planned for Saturday, March 24, 2018.\n\nThis Saturday, March 24, \"March for Our Lives\" rallies to end gun violence and school shootings will take place in Washington, D.C., and in cities around the world.\n\nMarch for Our Lives events are planned in more than 800 locations worldwide -- including not just Washington but also New York, San Francisco, London, Tokyo, and more -- on Saturday, a little over one month after the February 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. Student survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the shooting occurred, will lead the march in Washington, D.C., which is expected to be the biggest of all the demonstrations.\n\nMany businesses and grassroots groups have pledged to support protesters by providing free food, lodging, and rides at the March for Our Lives rallies in Washington and other locations. Here is how they are trying to help the cause with discounts and giveaways to students and other demonstrators.\n\nThe rideshare service Lyft has announced that it will give students free rides to March for Our Lives events all over the country on Saturday, March 24. Lyft did not immediately return MONEY's request for further details about the offer, including exactly who qualifies and how one orders a free ride. We will update the story with more details as we get them.\n\nMarch organizers have also arranged for free buses to help people get to Saturday's demonstrations in cities like Des Moines and Boston, as well as the big national rally in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Shake Shack location at Union Station in Washington, D.C., is hosting a poster-making session on Friday, March 23, the day before the rally, from 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Poster supplies will be available for free, and participants are welcome to free ShackBurgers during the event.\n\nSeveral restaurants near the March for Our Lives route in Washington, D.C., are providing free food to high school students. The Eatwell DC restaurants, including The Bird, Logan Tavern, and The Pig, are handing out bag lunches for free from 10 a.m. to noon, while supplies last. Another distribution point for free bag lunches is Think Food Lab, the restaurant run by food activist and celebrity chef Jose Andres at 701 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nIn addition to free lunches being donated and distributed on the morning of the March for Our Lives, several restaurants in the nation's capital are giving students 50% off discounts throughout the day.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, several grassroots organizers are also arranging free places to stay this weekend for out-of-town high school students (who are generally too young to book hotels or Airbnb rentals on their own).\n\nOne such group, March for Our Lives Lodging, bills itself simply as \"a network of DC metro area moms \" that has been working for weeks to connect marchers with local homeowners willing to host them this weekend. A few high schools, colleges, and faith groups in the D.C. area are also hosting out-of-town marchers free of charge, the Post reported.",
