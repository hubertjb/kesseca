                "body": "Fifteen-year-old Brooke Solomon led thousands of demonstrators in a march through the downtown streets of Detroit. Ten-year-old Jack Thorne attended a similar event in Atlanta, Georgia with his mom. South Salem High School student Allison Hmura told protesters in Salem, Oregon that students shouldn't have to learn to \"duck and cover.\"\n\nThe youths were among hundreds of thousands at \"March for Our Lives\" events nationwide calling for stricter gun control in response to school shootings and gun violence.\n\n\"I'm here marching for the thousands of under-represented black and brown kids, especially in Detroit,\" said Solomon, who wants background checks in all gun sales. \"I'm looking for tougher gun laws and legislation that includes banning semi-automatic and assault weapons.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, Thorne held aloft a sign reading \"Guns Don't Kill People. Ummm... Yes They Do,\" as he described how he and his classmates recently underwent active shooter drills in school.\n\nAnd Hmura called on the nearly 2,400 people gathered at the Salem rally to fight for change.\n\n\"There cannot be two sides to our safety in school where we should be learning, growing and making friends -- not learning how to duck and cover,\" Hmura said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said in a prepared statement Saturday that he supports demonstrators' rights to march at anti-gun rallies across the country, but called for activists to find common ground with opponents.\n\n\"While protests are a legitimate way of making a point, in our system of government, making a change requires finding common ground with those who hold opposing views,\" the Republican from Florida said.\n\nRubio's district includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month. He said that a ban on bump stocks (used to make guns fire more rapidly), improvements to the gun background check system and other efforts were achieved by finding common ground with those who don't want certain gun bans.\n\n\"And finding common ground is what it will take to pass our red flag law so we can take guns away from dangerous people,\" Rubio said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in cities across the United States are attending \"March for Our Lives\" rallies, calling on lawmakers to enact legislation to help stop school shootings and reduce gun violence.\n\nThousands of people are flooding the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand stricter gun laws in the U.S.\n\nThe rally was one of several being held across California and the United States on Saturday.\n\nProtesters held signs and chanted as they marched to Los Angeles City Hall for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally.\n\nZoe Lopez, a 15-year-old high school freshman from Garden Grove, said she's attending the rally to demand additional regulations on gun purchases.\n\nIn Sacramento, thousands chanted: \"hey, hey, ho, ho, the NRA has got to go\" as they assembled at the state's capitol.\n\nRallies in Oakland and San Diego also drew hundreds of demonstrators.\n\nSimilar rallies were being held in cities across America to march for gun control and ignite political activism among teenagers.\n\nThe granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told tens of thousands of \"March for Our Lives\" demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C. that she too has a dream -- for a gun-free world.\n\n\"I have a dream that enough is enough,\" Yolanda Renee King said, referencing her grandfather's famous speech. \"That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\"\n\nThe crowd roared in response. The Washington, D.C. event has thousands thronging Pennsylvania Avenue to hear speakers including survivors of the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and singers like Miley Cyrus.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people attended youth-led, anti-gun rallies across the United States and the world on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to tighten gun control in order to stop mass shootings and gun violence.\n\nHundreds of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School arrived for the Washington, D.C. march on three flights donated by Delta Air Lines.\n\nThey'll return to Florida with Delta after the march too.\n\nThe airline, which broke ties with the National Rifle Association after last month's school shooting that left 17 dead, said they offered the round-trip charter flights \"as part of our commitment to supporting the communities we serve.\n\nAfter the shooting in Parkland, Delta said it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members to reflect its neutral status on the gun-control debate.\n\nThe move triggered a backlash from gun advocates, and the state of Georgia killed a proposed tax break on jet fuel in retaliation.\n\nA series of protests held across the United States Saturday in support of gun control is shaping up to be one of the biggest youth protests since the era of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe \"March for Our Lives\" rallies are a call to action by student survivors of last month's school shooting in Florida that left 17 people dead.\n\nAt Washington's \"March for Our Lives\" rally, throngs jammed Pennsylvania Avenue for blocks. Tens of thousands of teenagers and their supporters roared their approval as survivors of the Parkland, Florida, assault spoke from the stage. One of them, Delaney Tarr, laid down the students' central demand, a ban on assault-type weapons, and declared \"We will continue to fight for our dead friends.\"\n\nThe Washington crowd was well into the tens of thousands. A vast crowd also rallied in New York City and large marches unfolded in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis and scores of other cities. More than 20,000 rallied in Parkland near the school.\n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators at student-led anti-gun rallies held across the United States on Saturday were joined by counterparts the world over.\n\nIn Paris, France about 100 demonstrators rallied near the Eiffel Tower in solidarity with the American \"March for Our Lives\" events.\n\nCaitlin Waters, co-organizer of the Paris event, said it's important for Americans overseas to let Washington know that they want more gun control. Similar rallies were planned in New Zealand, Japan and other countries around the world.\n\nIn the United States, rallies stretched from sea to shining sea, with people marching in huge cities like Los Angeles and New York City as well as in smaller ones like Boise, Idaho and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nProminent civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis says that the student-led, anti-gun protests occurring across the United States remind him of the early days of the civil rights era.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" Lewis said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They will be the leaders of the 21st century.\"\n\nLewis joined the \"March for Our Lives\" protest in Atlanta, Georgia, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's Florida school shooting and other mass shootings.\n\nThe Democrat also implored his Republican colleagues in Congress to \"come to the right side\" and to pass meaningful gun-control legislation.\n\nLewis wore a button with a large red letter \"F'' on it, proudly displaying the grade he said he has received from the NRA. Lewis said hundreds of Democratic members of the House were wearing them today.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally in New York City on Saturday held a moment of silence to honor 17 people killed during a school shooting in Florida just last month.\n\nSam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was at the rally to read the victims' names.\n\nAnother MSD student, Meghan Bonner, told the demonstrators that she wasn't surprised when she learned the identity of the shooter because it was obvious something was wrong with him.\n\n\"There was so much more that could have been done to prevent this,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I want to see change.\"\n\nThe rally in midtown Manhattan is one of several being held across the United States on Saturday in response to gun violence.\n\nThe mayor of Houston, Texas told thousands of demonstrators at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally that adults have a responsibility to protect all children.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner spoke at the Tranquillity Park event Saturday morning, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's school shooting in Florida and other mass shootings.\n\n\"We have a responsibility for those of us as adults, we have a responsibility to stand up and protect our children,\" said Turner.\n\nTurner also chanted with the crowd \"Now is the time\" to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nStudents chanted \"enough is enough\" and held up signs with slogans like \"our ballots will stop bullets\" at a rally in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month.\n\nMore than 20,000 people filled the park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally Saturday morning.\n\nOthers from the area traveled to Washington, D.C., where the main \"March for Our Lives\" event is being held. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.\n\n__\n\nThis story has been changed to correct that Jack Thorne was at a march in Atlanta, not Savannah, Georgia and the spelling of Tranquillity Park in Houston, Texas.",

                "body": "LOS ANGELES -- During President Trump's fund-raising trip to Beverly Hills, Calif., this month -- the first time he'd come to the official state of resistance since becoming president -- a couple of friends of mine took to the streets, along with hundreds of others, to protest. But the visit was highly stage-managed, and Mr. Trump never faced the crowd; the most my friends could do, they said, was raise a middle finger to the sky as his aircraft flew overhead.\n\nIt's a funny image, but also a stark reminder that we have a president who assiduously avoids the majority of the public that disagrees with him. In the nation's most populous state, people turned out to meet their leader, and their leader refused to appear. This reinforced something I've felt since the beginning of the Trump era: We're all in the ghetto now.\n\nI grew up black in South Central and Inglewood, two Los Angeles neighborhoods shunned and distorted by everyone who doesn't actually live there. Leave it to Mr. Trump to expand the racialized idea of a ghetto to include everyone who is not on his good side -- in other words, most Americans.\n\nThe new ghetto is first and foremost geographical. Mr. Trump simply doesn't go to places he sees as hostile or irrelevant to his worldview, such as Los Angeles, or most college campuses, or actual ghettos. More significantly, he ghettoizes dissenters everywhere -- from Black Lives Matter activists to F.B.I. officers -- by ignoring and insulting them (the F.B.I.'s reputation is the \"worst in history\"), and crudely stereotyping them (crazy liberals, Mexican rapists).\n\nProgressives and even conscientious bureaucrats who are used to a place in the power structure are being frozen out. Many people find this disorienting, especially those who are used to being heard. But as a black American, I see a pattern of oppression that's awfully familiar, part of a historical continuum.",

                "body": "And if her name has seemed ubiquitous -- repeated on cable television and in the White House briefing room, and plastered on signs outside nightclubs, where her appearance fees have multiplied -- there is this to consider: Unlike most perceived presidential adversaries, about whom Mr. Trump is rarely shy, Ms. Clifford has not been the subject of a single tweet.\n\nTo many in the capital, Ms. Clifford, 39, has become an unexpected force. It is she, some in Washington now joke, and not the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who could topple Mr. Trump.\n\nThose who know her well have registered the moment differently. Ms. Clifford has subsisted amid the seamier elements of a business often rife with exploitation and unruly fare; more than a few of her film titles are unprintable. But for most of her professional life, Ms. Clifford has been a woman in control of her own narrative in a field where that can be uncommon. With an instinct for self-promotion, she evolved from \"kindergarten circuit\" stripper to star actress and director, and occasional mainstream success, by her late 20s. Why would a piece of paper and an executive legal team set her back?\n\n\"She's the boss, and everyone knew it,\" Nina Hartley, one of the longest-working performers in the industry, said about Ms. Clifford.\n\n\"The Renaissance porn star,\" said Ron Jeremy, once perhaps the most famous porn star of all.\n\n\"She was a very serious businesswomen and a filmmaker and had taken the reins of her career,\" said Judd Apatow, who directed her cameos in the R-rated comedies \"Knocked Up\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\" \"She is not someone to be underestimated.\"\n\nIn her own scripts, she has gravitated at times toward more ambitious productions, with elaborate plotlines and nods to politics.\n\nHer standards on set can be exacting. Ms. Clifford does not mind firing people, colleagues said, banishing those who flub a scene or gild a résumé. She has demanded that an actor change his \"dumb\" stage name because it would look silly on her promotional materials. And she has coaxed singular performances from her charges, once guiding Mr. Jeremy through a scene in which he sang to her small dog.\n\nHer competitive streak is not well concealed. After industry award nominations were announced one year, Ms. Clifford, who had amassed more than a dozen such honors, reminded an interviewer that she had been snubbed in the categories of cinematography and editing.\n\nWhen opportunities have presented themselves outside her domain -- a Maroon 5 music video, a public flirtation with a Senate run in Louisiana, an appearance at a celebrity golf tournament that included a future president -- Ms. Clifford has made the most of the publicity, helping her carve out a comfortable life in the Dallas suburbs.\n\nShe has a daughter, a third husband and an expensive hobby: equestrian shows. \"She blends right in,\" said Packy McGaughan, a trainer on the competition circuit. \"A pretty girl riding a horse.\"\n\nMore recently, inconspicuousness has been elusive in her life, but that is largely by design. Ms. Clifford has leveraged her newfound crossover fame into a national stripping tour, with scheduled dates through the end of the year. Not everyone is interested in attending.\n\n\"Pretty sure dumb whores go to hell,\" someone wrote her on Twitter last week.\n\n\"Whew!\" Ms. Clifford replied. \"Glad I'm a smart one.\"\n\nClassmates remember her as a serious, unobtrusive student -- a natural fit at a competitive, racially diverse high school with an engineering focus. They knew her as Stephanie Gregory, the girl with the auburn hair. She liked horses and Mötley Crüe.\n\nA quote beneath her senior yearbook photo hinted at high aspirations: \"We will all get along just fine,\" it read, \"as soon as you realize that I am Queen.\"\n\nShe thought she might be a veterinarian, or maybe a writer. \"At first I thought I wanted to be a journalist,\" Ms. Clifford said by phone on Friday in a 12-minute interview about her background.\n\nHer parents, Sheila and Bill Gregory, divorced when she was about 4, leaving her largely in the care of her mother. She has not seen either parent in over a decade. Ms. Clifford, who later took her first husband's surname, came from a \"really bad neighborhood,\" she said. She strained to remember exactly what she was like then.\n\n\"I don't really know because I'm such a different person now,\" she said. \"I wasn't like the popular girl, and I wasn't the jock, and I wasn't the ditz. I don't know. I was just sort of in the middle of the road.\"\n\nShe had offers from colleges, she has said. She had the test scores. The dancing started on a lark, of sorts. She was 17 and visiting a friend at a strip club in town, when she was persuaded to perform a \"guest set.\"\n\n\"I remember going on stage and thinking I was going to be a lot more afraid than I was,\" Ms. Clifford said. \"It was a slow night. There were like three people in the club, and I made enough money on two songs to make more than I did all week answering phones at the riding stable that I worked at.\"\n\nAfter high school, she found a professional home at the Gold Club in Baton Rouge, ingratiating herself with management as a reliable and magnetic performer, slogging through shifts from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. to earn perhaps a few hundred dollars a night.\n\nA calendar from 1999, in which Ms. Clifford straddles a Harley-Davidson as the dancer for July, still sits in the club, now called the Penthouse Club Baton Rouge.\n\n\"We knew,\" said Chuck Rolling, who has long overseen operations there. \"She was moving in a direction that was bigger than us. We're in Baton Rouge. We're not even New Orleans.\"\n\nMs. Clifford eventually graduated to higher-profile dancing work, traveling across Texas and Louisiana to headline at strip clubs, before transitioning to pornography. She was both determined to bend the business to her will and conflicted about the long-term consequences. \"I have very mixed emotions about stripping because stripping got me where I am now,\" she said, at age 23, in an industry interview. \"I own my own house, I own my own car, I own my own business. My credit is excellent. I have nice furniture and nice things.\"\n\nStill, the risks were clear. \"I have just seen so many girls that it just ruins them,\" she said then, \"so many women who are 35, 40 years old and still stripping and have nothing to show for it, and that is just really sad.\"\n\nMs. Clifford chose a more tempestuous stage name than most peers. She was not an Angel, or a Summer, or a Destiny. She was Stormy. And she was blond now.\n\nOften, she kept to herself. Mike South, a director and columnist in the industry press, recalled encountering her in 2004, the year she was named \"best new starlet\" at the Adult Video News Awards, pornography's equivalent of the Oscars. \"She was sitting in the lobby, alone, and I just decided to be friendly,\" said Mr. South, who invited her to a group dinner. \"She looks at me and doesn't crack a smile -- expressionless -- and says, 'I am really not that friendly.'\"\n\nRecognition came quickly anyway: awards, magazine spreads, feature roles and a contract with Wicked Pictures, a prominent pornography company. When she needed to, she charmed industry gatekeepers with a disarming wit.\n\n\"Are those real?\" read a question posted on her website.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"you're certainly not imagining them.\"\n\nIn 2008, as Jenna Jameson, then the industry's reigning monarch, announced her retirement at an awards show -- \"I will never spread my legs in this industry again,\" she told the crowd -- Ms. Clifford seemed to position herself next in line.\n\n\"I love you, Jenna,\" Ms. Clifford said, accepting an award from Ms. Jameson moments later, \"but I'm going to spread my legs a little longer.\"\n\nIt was a striking political slogan: \"Screwing People Honestly.\" But subtlety was never the idea.\n\nIn 2009, well into her turn as a director, Ms. Clifford sensed an opening beyond her typical orbit. David Vitter, a United States senator in her home state of Louisiana, was staggering toward a re-election year, laid low by a prostitution scandal. Ms. Clifford declared herself a Republican (though a Democratic operative was said to be involved in her efforts) and courted wide-scale media attention as she publicly weighed the merits of running. In remarks at the time, she connected her professional journey to the lives of service workers across the state.\n\n\"Just as these misguided arbiters of the mainstream view an adult entertainment star as an anathema to the political process,\" she said, when she eventually decided against a bid, \"so too do they view the dishwasher, the cashier or the bus driver.\"\n\nThe false-start campaign coincided with a turbulent moment in her personal life, exposing her to scrutiny in the mainstream press. In July 2009, Ms. Clifford was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence after hitting her husband, a performer in the industry, and throwing a potted plant during a fight about laundry and unpaid bills, according to police records. The husband, Michael Mosny, was not injured, and the charge was later dropped. Ms. Clifford had previously been married to another pornographic actor.\n\nShe has since married another colleague in the business, Brendon Miller, the father of her now 7-year-old daughter. He is also a drummer and has composed music for her films. The family has been spotted often at equestrian events, where Ms. Clifford, the owner of several horses, rides as \"Stormy Crain.\" Her preparations can be meticulous, matching her saddle pad with a horse's bonnet colors.\n\n\"She takes it very personally that she does well,\" said Dominic Schramm, a horse trainer and rider who has worked with her for several years. \"She can be quite hard on herself.\"\n\nMs. Clifford has not shown up at competitions since news broke in January that she accepted a financial settlement in October 2016 -- weeks before the election -- agreeing to keep quiet about her alleged intimate relationship with Mr. Trump. She has said the affair, which representatives of Mr. Trump have denied, began in 2006 and extended into 2007, the year she married Mr. Mosny.\n\nEarlier this month, she escalated public attention by filing suit, calling the 2016 contract meaningless given that Mr. Trump had never signed it and revealing that the president's personal lawyer had taken further secret legal action to keep her silent this year.\n\nShe has said that she does not want to expose the equestrian world -- or her daughter -- to the attendant circus trailing her now.\n\nBut the show has gone on for Ms. Clifford. She has danced across the country in recent months, from Las Vegas to Long Island. There are many more appearances to come. It would be foolish, she has said, to turn down more money than usual for the same work.\n\n\"She likes to maximize her profits,\" said Danny Capozzi, an agent who manages her bookings, \"not only on the feature dance bookings but at all times.\"",

                "body": "David Edebiri, a high-ranking traditional leader, was there, and described to me what happened during the ceremony. First the oba \"released all those bound by juju.\" Then he put a curse on the head of any priest who makes \"any concoction for anybody with a view to promoting any immigration to any part of the world.\" This curse, Mr. Edebiri told me, \"manifests in various ways: Some may die mysteriously, some may go mad in the street.\"\n\nWhat the oba has done is likely to be more effective than anything the international anti-trafficking community has managed to do after millions of dollars and many years.\n\nThe Benin kingdom of the Edo people has a proud history dating back to the 13th century. But lately Edo State has gained notoriety as a hub of sexual exploitation. According to the United Nations, over 90 percent of the thousands of women taken from Nigeria to Europe to work as prostitutes are coming from Edo.\n\nEdo is not one of Nigeria's poorest states. But in the early 1980s women there started traveling to Italy to trade in gold and beads, and \"saw a thriving market in prostitution,\" said Kokunre Agbontaen-Eghafona, a professor at the University of Benin and a researcher for the International Organization for Migration. She believes this \"founders factor\" is the main reason Edo has become such a center of human trafficking.\n\nDuring a reporting trip there in 2016, I came across heaps of secondhand winter clothes for sale to those planning to make the journey to Europe. I also met girls who had traveled thousands of miles to find a trafficker who would send them there.\n\nThe oba's intervention was probably motivated by a recent CNN series on human trafficking that focused on Edo. Mr. Edebiri said that the portrayal of the kingdom as a \"den of illicit activity\" outraged him and his colleagues. Around the same time, Julie Okah-Donli, the director of Nigeria's National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, paid the oba a visit. She said she told him that it was difficult to prosecute traffickers because the victims worried about breaking their oaths.\n\nThe fear of these oaths and their supposed consequences is one big reason women remain enslaved in sex work and debt bondage; they often rebuff attempts by activists to set them free.\n\nA native doctor named Olor Elemian boasted to me: \"I don't need to collect the girls' photographs or fingernails or anything else as other native doctors do. All I need is for them to bathe naked before the shrine and to write out their full names.\" Sitting on the floor in his shrine amid calabashes, animal bones and bloodstained cloths, Mr. Elemian, who inherited the job from his father, said: \"I can make sure that she never sleeps well or has any peace of mind until she pays what she owes. Something in her head will keep telling her, 'Go and pay! Go and pay!'\"\n\nIn Edo, I also met a 25-year-old woman who was deported from Italy but who along with her family remained petrified by the consequences of her unpaid debt. Her mother eventually borrowed yet more money to pay a native doctor to undo the oath her daughter had taken before she was trafficked.\n\n\"This belief in juju has been a strong impediment to our prosecution\" of traffickers, Arinze Orakwue, a top official at the Nigerian anti-trafficking agency, told me. \"You can't prosecute when nobody is willing to come forward to say this person did this to me.\"\n\nHis agency expects Oba Ewuare's pronouncement to have a significant impact in all of Edo. The oba's decree \"is a very strong weapon to support anti-trafficking,\" Mr. Orakwue said, because the Edo people's \"belief system is strongly rooted in traditional worship.\"\n\nThe agency's appeal to the oba is an example of using African solutions to solve African problems. Well-meaning foreign governments and groups can continue to inject millions of dollars into Africa to fix our problems, but those interventions would be much more effective if local people and customs were more deeply considered.\n\nIt is all well and good to imagine Africa as a Wakanda, where technology rules and everything works. But Africa is not a Wakanda. At least, not yet. We must use what Africa has today to get it to where we want it to be.",

                "title": "Opinion | Francis, the Anti-Strongman",
                "body": "In these circumstances, Pope Francis has emerged as the anti-strongman. His choice of name evoked Francis of Assisi, humble patron saint of the poor. His decision to live in the Santa Marta guesthouse rather than the Vatican Palace suggested his essential simplicity. Paying his hotel bill in Rome, carrying his own briefcase onto Shepherd One: Here was a pope with both feet on the ground.\n\nThose gestures also signaled his wish to unhitch the papacy from the office's authoritarian legacy. The name Francis (never before chosen by a pope) placed him outside the lineage of his roman-numeraled, monarchical predecessors. Setting up in the guesthouse kept him clear of the papacy's history of worldly power through rule of the Papal States. Paying his hotel bill suggested that even a potentate doesn't get a free ride.\n\nFrancis took office at a time of unprecedented change for the papacy. Benedict's resignation in February 2013 -- the first by a pope in 598 years -- altered the power structure of the Vatican overnight. Now that it can no longer be assumed a pope will rule for life, the Vatican is less like an absolute monarchy than a coalition government in which politicking is out in the open and the pope must hold factions together.\n\nFrancis has embraced this new openness: appointing a group of consulting cardinals, and actually consulting them; holding a papal synod focused on discussion more than conclusions; answering hard questions unguardedly; and taking his strongest stand on the problem of environmental degradation.\n\nEven as they grant that he was elected to shake up the constricted Vatican bureaucracy, his critics see his approach as that of a stealthy revolutionary or a reckless agent of disruption. In fact, Francis's exercise of the papal role reflects the Jesuit practice of discernment, which involves waiting, listening, letting competing options for action emerge, and choosing one after prayer and internal deliberation.\n\nThe group of advisory cardinals is significant because it belies the supposed solitary autonomy of papal decision-making and incorporates cardinals from places long thought remote from power: Santiago, Chile, and Mumbai, India, as well as Munich and Boston. The group's members are compromised figures whose blind spots are often akin to Francis's own. But it is a significant step that such a body exists at all.\n\nThe 2015 synod on marriage and the family, judged a debacle by many, is better understood as an instance of soft power in action. By calling the synod, Francis signaled that the issues surrounding Catholic teaching on marriage are not closed to further Vatican discussion -- in sharp contrast to the \"Rome has spoken\" approach of his predecessors. Then Francis set out to point the synod discussions in a progressive direction on the issue of whether divorced-and-remarried Catholics in certain countries may receive communion at Mass. Traditionalists accused Francis of flirting with heresy.\n\nOf necessity, the process was unruly. But discussions were had, and cardinals who opposed Francis were heard -- because Francis let them be heard. He gave a closing speech thick with exasperation, replaced some resistant curial officials and demoted the hostile American Cardinal Raymond Burke -- but he set aside the most far-reaching proposals about marriage and family for a future time, meanwhile keeping the discussion open.\n\nFrancis has acted on his conviction that Catholic faith is less about the use of power to shape the social order -- the stuff of present strongmen and past popes -- than about straightforward efforts of kindness and generosity.\n\nWhile John Paul forged a relationship with Opus Dei -- the strict and secretive movement with roots in the postwar Spain of Francisco Franco -- Francis is at ease with the Community of Sant'Egidio, founded in Rome during the student uprisings of 1968 and now present in 70 countries, working with the poor, migrants, the elderly and people with AIDS. With its members, Francis has acted like a 21st-century Christian who happens to be pope: washing the feet of Muslim men and women on Good Friday, airlifting Syrians out of the Lesbos refugee camp on the papal plane and instituting a shelter for homeless people inside the Vatican.\n\nFrancis could serve as pope for another year, or five or 10. The test of his soft power in the coming years will be its encounter with hard power. Will he issue an encyclical on migration and the demonizing of the immigrant \"other\"? As he seeks openings for the church in seething Russia and rising China, will he address those countries' human rights violations, opposing authoritarianism with the authority of the Gospel? Possibly -- but not certainly. Traditionalists in the Vatican are insisting that Francis would do better not to engage with intransigent leaders and intractable problems at all. And Francis's record is frankly poor in some areas. On priestly sexual abuse, for example, he has acted like a highhanded cleric of old instead of taking firm, clear action.\n\nSymbolically, the papacy is meant to be a \"contrast structure\" to worldly forms of authority. Too often, it has been such a structure in the wrong ways: crabbed, self-protecting, aloof and denunciatory. Five years into his pontificate, Francis is no small-d democrat, no faultless leader -- and no perfect pope. And yet in this pope, our upside-down age has a leader whose approach and example stand as reminders of what the sensitive exercise of power can look like.",

                "title": "Opinion | Understanding Rural America's Gun Culture",
                "body": "Robert Leonard concludes by stating, \"If Democrats want to engage rural America culturally and politically, they need to understand us, and at least some of our ideals.\" What, though, if we do understand you, but still think that your attitudes toward guns -- at least the more extreme attitudes -- are unhealthy?\n\nI'm a hunter myself and appreciate a nice shotgun as much as any farm boy. But when people's identities start to be defined by their AR-15s and Glocks, when they start to believe that their liberty is under perpetual threat from vague and sinister forces, and when their sense of self-worth is tightly tied to their ability to exert deadly force over others, I don't think they need understanding; I think they need therapy. Sometimes understanding a culture gives you reason to respect it less, not more.\n\nMost of the people I know from the Midwest -- where I was born, raised and educated -- are better, smarter and more willing to engage in serious dialogue than the caricatures Robert Leonard describes.\n\nThey know that different views on how to reduce gun violence cannot be resolved by talk radio-style debates on human nature or the effects of \"original sin\" and that the real question is what can be done to reduce the incidence of gun violence in the future.\n\nMost small-town Americans also recognize that ignoring the evidence by dismissing it as \"throwing around statistics\" is not likely to encourage a healthy dialogue, particularly when common sense suggests -- and studies have confirmed -- that restricting access to assault weapons reduces the incidence of mass murders.\n\nFinally, they know that despite the N.R.A.'s fear-mongering, taking away rural America's guns is not on the table and that we should be discussing real issues, not fake ones.\n\nI appreciated Robert Leonard's framing the gun-violence issue from a small-town perspective. To understand the deep attachment to guns, and the view that violence is the result of bad choices by people who lack moral guidance, is helpful to gun control advocates like me.\n\nI think the bigger question, if we as a nation want to substantially reduce gun violence, is which can we more realistically control: people's bad choices or their access to highly lethal weapons? In my professional experience as a psychiatrist, I find it exceedingly difficult to change people who are not motivated to change. Reducing access is the only realistic option.\n\nAs a shooter who grew up in a small town, I believe the small-town holders of the views that Robert Leonard reports are misguided. The principal point of gun control is not confiscation of guns but keeping them out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.\n\nStates like Connecticut and Massachusetts make a determined and fairly successful effort to do this. These states have some of the strictest firearms laws in the United States and the lowest per capita rate of gun deaths. As a holder of gun permits in both states, I'm familiar with the firearms regulatory schemes.\n\nEach state requires a would-be gun owner to pass a background check, usually be interviewed and provide evidence of having had satisfactory firearms training. If the applicant is barred by a felony conviction or other statutory disqualifiers, or is deemed unsuitable to carry a firearm, the application is denied.\n\nUnsuitability would include a history of suicidal ideation, alcohol or drug abuse, domestic violence, serious emotional problems that indicate a propensity to violence, or irresponsible behavior. In both states there is an appeals mechanism.\n\nThe process takes several months, but I didn't think it was onerous. Certainly, it seemed a reasonable predicate to allowing someone to own and carry a firearm.\n\nI am getting truly tired of hearing how I, an urbanite, a native New Yorker, has to \"understand\" the mind of my gun-loving rural compatriots. How about Middle America trying to understand urbanites like me, coming from a family that never owned a gun, has never seen the value of owning a weapon, and witnesses with horror the statistics of people of all ages killed in this country?\n\nWhy don't they take a good hard look at the examples of Australia and European countries that have enacted strict gun control and where children go to school without fear that this could be the last day of their lives?\n\nWho is being the stubborn party here? From where I sit, gun control advocates are the real pro-lifers in this country.\n\nRobert Leonard, in defending how small-town America looks at guns, notes that gun owners believe that having a gun makes them less likely to be a victim. Wrong. Study after study shows that having a gun in the house is more likely to lead to gun violence in the home. Study after study shows that states with looser gun restrictions have more gun deaths.\n\nAustralia passed strong gun control laws in 1996 after a mass shooting. Murder by guns virtually stopped in that country. No Western countries other than ours have anywhere near the amount of gun carnage we do. Why? Better laws. This month a California teacher discharged his weapon by mistake in the classroom. It is no wonder that teachers overwhelmingly oppose arming teachers as a safety measure.\n\nMr. Leonard seems to think that raising the age to buy a gun is a significant compromise. Maybe he should tell that to the grieving families who lost loved ones to the Las Vegas shooter, a man in his 60s who murdered innocent concertgoers with weapons barred by most civilized nations.\n\nWhen I was in grade school, I vividly recall how once in a while the teacher would declare that some privilege or other would be infringed or abolished because it had been abused one too many times by just one or two of my classmates. And without fail, a few kids would respond to these announcements with red-faced, furious howls of \"no fair, no fair!\" I remember sitting in silent dismay at these moments, wondering why we all had to be punished for the actions of just one or two.\n\nAnd over the years, it probably occurred to me that the teacher had no choice but to prevent the means of disruption so that the class could function. Is it possible that some children, urban or rural, never learn this lesson?",

                "body": "Now that John Bolton has finally ascended from the limbo of the green room to the Valhalla of the White House, we need to settle the first question of his tenure: Is he a \"neocon\" or a \"paleocon\"?\n\nI have seen both terms used, the former more promiscuously, to describe Donald Trump's new national security adviser. But they're both misdescriptions, and explaining why is a useful way of putting Trump's foreign policy team (and its distinctive dangers) in intellectual and historical perspective.\n\nForeign policy conservatives can be grouped into four broad categories. The first group, the genuine paleocons, are the oldest and least influential: Their lineage goes back to the antiwar conservatism of the 1930s, and to postwar Republicans who regarded our Cold War buildup as a big mistake.\n\nThe last paleocon to play a crucial role in U.S. politics was the Ohio Republican Robert Taft, who opposed NATO and became a critic of the Korean War. Pat Buchanan tried to revive paleoconservatism in the 1990s; The American Conservative magazine and the Cato Institute carry the torch in intellectual debates. But the tendency's only politically significant heir right now is Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\n\nExcept that even Paul, wary of the label, would probably describe himself instead as a realist, linking himself to the tradition of Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and George H. W. Bush -- internationalist, stability-oriented, committed to the Pax Americana but skeptical of grand crusades, and open to working out cynical arrangements rather than pushing American power to its limit.\n\nThis cynicism explains why realists have found their chief rivals among the neoconservatives, a group best defined as liberal anti-Communists who moved right in the 1970s as the Democratic Party moved left, becoming more hawkish and unilateralist but retaining a basic view that American power should be used for moral purpose, to spread American ideals.",

                "body": "In the bitter contest between the Rumsfeld Defense Department and the Colin Powell State Department, John Bolton was a Rummy person who was a fifth column at State, along with Liz Cheney. Like a walrus version of Wile E. Coyote, he lived to dynamite treaties, alliances and anything with \"global\" or \"multilateral\" in the title.\n\nHe was known as the most undiplomatic diplomat ever, with a rip-their-eyeballs-out, foaming-at-the-mouth style.\n\nW. nominated Bolton as U.N. ambassador, even though Bolton had once remarked that if the U.N. lost 10 stories, \"it wouldn't make a bit of difference,\" and even though the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was reviewing charges that he was using intimidation to distort key intelligence and buttress his hard-line positions on Cuba and North Korea. He was accused of trying to fire intelligence analysts and buoying the phony case on W.M.D.s in Iraq.\n\nBolton rejected the neocon label, preferring to see himself as a Goldwater conservative, but he helped the neocons and Cheney's henchmen when they shoveled distortions into Secretary Powell's U.N. speech making the case for war.\n\nHis mistreatment of underlings was so legendary -- one claimed that he had thrown objects -- that I once dubbed him the Naomi Campbell of the Bush administration.\n\nBy far the best thing about the Trump campaign was watching many of those culpable for the Iraq war go ballistic trying to stop the neophyte, who kept pointing out that Americans had been deceived into the historic debacle with Iraq. He even went where no one else had dared to go and correctly pointed out that W. and his administration had dropped the ball before 9/11.\n\nBill Kristol, Eliot Cohen, Robert Kagan and Max Boot, all of whom pushed to \"liberate\" Iraq, denounced Trump, saying he would be a foreign policy disaster. Kagan and Boot said they would vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAfter lukewarm support for the invasion, Trump often criticized W. on Iraq. \"No matter how long we stay in Iraq, no matter how many soldiers we send, the day we leave, the meanest, most vicious, most brilliant man in the country, a man who makes Saddam Hussein look like a baby, will take over and spit on the American flag,\" he told me in 2006. \"Bush will go down as the worst and by far the dumbest president in history.\"\n\nTrump was a Hillary supporter in those days and said that although her vote to authorize the Iraq war was \"horrendous,\" she should be forgiven because \"that decision was based on lies given to her.\"\n\n\"She's very smart and has a major chance to be our next president,\" he told me.\n\nIn 2013, Trump tweeted: \"All former Bush administration officials should have zero standing on Syria. Iraq was a waste of blood & treasure.\"\n\nWhen he ran for president against Jeb Bush, he continued attacking W. and presenting himself as a noninterventionist, focus-on-America candidate.\n\nBut somehow, in his King George madness, Trump has circled back to elevate one of the chief Iraq war hawks to be his national security adviser.\n\nThat move sent a shiver through the capital, among both Democrats and Republicans, who whispered, \"Anyone but Bolton!\"\n\nBolton is a clever infighter. He learned from the best. He pushed to go to war in Iraq and still thinks it was a good idea, just as he has pushed to go to war in North Korea and get regime change in Iran and Syria. He is a fervent believer in pre-emptive war.\n\n(Like other war hawks, Bolton didn't want to serve himself, enlisting in the National Guard in 1970 to ensure he wouldn't \"die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy\" in Vietnam.)\n\nThe president who loves to push hot buttons and hire Fox analysts must really get a kick out of Bolton's tempestuous style if he is now willing to overlook the 69-year-old's unruly mustache and frightening faith in pre-emption.\n\nAfter all those years of criticizing W. on war, Trump is now letting himself be guided by W.'s most hawkish adviser. And the president, whose curiosity only extends to himself, seems determined to stay an empty vessel. That makes him, like W., a magnet for extremists who want to hijack the Oval.",

                "body": "Though some people receive a VAD as a \"bridge,\" a way to stay alive while waiting for a heart transplant that might or might not come, Mr. Chauvin, then in his 50s, had been a smoker his entire life, so he wasn't a good candidate for a transplant. More likely, his VAD would be a \"destination.\" That's how he would live until he died -- battery-powered during the day and plugged into the wall at night.\n\nIn some ways, a VAD is nothing more than another implantable device, much like an insulin pump for diabetics or a cochlear implant for the deaf. I know the heart is just a muscle, and I have held a cadaver's still heart in my hands and felt its inanimate weight. And I know, too, that as time passes, VADs will become smaller, as devices do, and one day they might be no clumsier than pacemakers.\n\nBut there will always be another machine that goes one step further to bring us up against the limits of what it is to be mortal. And as a critical-care doctor who treats people at these margins, I wanted to understand what it was like to live a life dependent on this kind of technology -- not just at the hospital, amid the buzz of acute care decision-making, but after, when the reality set in.\n\nThat's how I came to meet Mr. Chauvin, first while I was observing a clinic for VAD patients, and then, later, during a weekend afternoon in his home outside Boston. He had invited me there to meet his family and to see firsthand the realities of life on battery. I took him up on his invitation, unsure of what to expect.\n\nWhen I stepped into his living room, I didn't even recognize him. Surrounded by his family, he looked happy and relaxed, so different from when I'd seen him in the clinic. He was wearing a vest to hold his batteries, and I could see part of the device bulging under his white T-shirt, but only if I looked closely.\n\nI settled into the seat he offered me and introduced myself to his sisters while he ducked into the kitchen to pull a steaming plate of baked potatoes, chives and sour cream out of the oven. He had found the recipe on Facebook, he explained. He was eager for us to try it.\n\nAs the plate cooled, he showed me around, down the narrow hallway to the bedroom, where he connected himself to a wall socket each night so his batteries could recharge. Limited to the electric cord's 20-foot radius, he was \"like a dog on a leash,\" until the morning. Luckily, his house was small enough that he could make it from the bedroom to the kitchen even when he was plugged in. The bathroom was even closer.\n\nOne time, he woke up at 2 a.m. to a jarring noise. Thinking there might be something wrong with his VAD, he changed his connection from the wall unit to a set of batteries. The sound continued. Frustrated, he fiddled around with the machine, doing things he definitely wasn't supposed to do, and still it wouldn't stop. He dragged himself out of bed to call his VAD team.\n\nIt was only when he saw the receiver hanging off the hook that Mr. Chauvin realized the source of the noise -- it had been the phone all along. As he told the story, his assembled family members laughed appreciatively, though they'd heard it before. I found myself laughing too, briefly forgetting that he was talking about life or death, about a sound that could have meant he was moments away from collapse.\n\nThe laughter quieted and there was a break in our conversation. In the moment of stillness, I found that I was curious about Mr. Chauvin's pulse. I asked him if I could feel for it and, seemingly amused, he offered his hand. I placed my fingers on his wrist, where I am used to feeling the rhythmic pulsations of the radial artery. But because the device moved blood through his vessels at a continuous, stable rate of flow rather than the pumping of a normal heart, melding human and machine, I found that I couldn't feel a thing.\n\nBy the time we met, it had been more than five years since Mr. Chauvin's heart had started to fail and over a year since he'd been told he wouldn't get a transplant. So I asked him what it had been like to learn that he would spend the rest of his life with this machine, that the equipment would be with him until he died. That if he were to follow his doctors' instructions to the letter, he would never be able to shower the way he liked or take his boat out on the lake. I wondered if he regretted his decision, if he had been angry.\n\nBut Mr. Chauvin surprised me. He had a hole in his stomach and a vest to carry his batteries and a cord that tethered him at night and the ever-present threat of a stroke or a bleed or a problem with the machine. But without the uncertainty of a transplant that might or might not come, he had found that he was now free to focus on enjoying his life for what it was. Sometimes that meant bending the rules.\n\n\"If I'm just going to sit and live in fear, I'd rather be dead. I'll take my chances,\" he told me. Neither of us knew, then, that he would ultimately die at home, just over a year later.\n\n\"When the pump goes down, I go down,\" he added. \"When you unplug me, I go down. But I don't have time to worry about all that.\"\n\nLater that afternoon, he was going to take a quick rest, and then, if the weather held up, he was going to Walmart. I smiled when he told me what he was planning to get there -- rope, an anchor and another life jacket. Summer was coming, and he wanted to be ready to go fishing.",

                "body": "My friend stuck her phone under my nose. On it was a picture on Instagram of a couple we both know, a photo of one of them pursing her lips over a frothy cocktail in a dim bar, flash on. Underneath, the caption said something like, \"Weekly Love Post #72: Fancy cocktails with bae #mygirlfriendisbetterthanyours #weekiversary #sorryshestaken.\"\n\n\"Blagahh,\" I said, doing my best vomiting noise and pushing the phone away. My friend cackled, delighted by how quickly she was able to irritate me. This couple celebrates their \"weekiversary\" every week, without skipping. Ever. They have been doing it for 72 weeks, which is about 17 months, which is nearly one and a half years. Make it stop.\n\nIt is so early in this couple's relationship and I'm already exhausted. So are most of our mutual friends. The responses on their weekiversary posts have dropped from dozens of \"You two!!\" and \"Cutest couple ahhhhh!!\" comments in the early days of their relationship to just a single comment from one of their moms. A lone tumbleweed of a comment, rolling through the dusty, echoing canyons of Shut Up You Guys National Park.\n\nThe members of this couple are nice in real life, and they are in love, and that is wonderful, but they are terrors on social media. The weekiversary posts are just the tip of the frozen-barf iceberg. There are also close, glistening photos of their home-cooked nightly dinners (kissy face #shesakeeper). There are unrelenting, near identical pictures of one of them napping next to a cat (heart-eyes #allmine). The content is nauseating and compelling; an endless highlight reel of two people who are strangely uninterested in keeping private, small joys in their relationship private.\n\nAnd it's not just them. I have coupled friends who post daily #whyiloveher pictures with paragraphs dedicated only to their partner (and their 2,000 followers), plus 15 hashtags underneath all that. I know friends in relationships who turn staying in and ordering pizza into a whole thing. It's not just ordering pizza, it's OMG best boyfriend ever!!<3<3 Pizza Date Night! Happy Tuesday babe I love you sooo much I couldn't imagine my life without you! #soinlove.",

                "title": "Opinion | Why Lyndon Johnson Dropped Out",
                "body": "Publicly, Johnson was adamantly optimistic. But the truth is that he was always a bleak skeptic on Vietnam -- skeptical that it could be won, even with American air power and ground troops, especially in view of the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese military and government, and skeptical that the outcome truly mattered to American and Western security.\n\nThis attitude was reinforced by the opinions of people he valued. The Democratic leadership on foreign policy -- J. William Fulbright, Russell and Mike Mansfield, the Senate majority leader -- privately warned him in 1964 and '65 against Americanizing the war. Allied leaders abroad did the same, as did prominent voices in the press.\n\nHis own vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey, a savvy politician who needed no reminder of the risks of \"losing\" a nation to Communism, insisted, in a memo in mid-February 1965, that the risks of escalation were far greater.\n\nIf \"we find ourselves leading from frustration to escalation and end up short of a war with China but embroiled deeper in fighting in Vietnam over the next few months,\" Humphrey warned, \"political opposition will steadily mount,\" because Americans had not been persuaded that a major war on behalf of an ineffectual Saigon government was justified.\n\nAt the same time, no senior military leader in 1965 offered the White House even a chance of rapid victory in Vietnam. Five years, 500,000 troops, was the general estimate Johnson heard. Where would that put the president in early 1968, as his campaign for re-election began in earnest? Right where he found himself as he sat down to deliver his announcement on March 31: in a protracted war with no end in sight.\n\nSo why did he go in? Part of the answer, surely, is that escalation, if done quietly, gradually and without putting the nation on full war footing, offered Johnson the path of least immediate resistance (always a tempting option for a policymaker), especially in domestic political terms. Given his repeated public affirmations of Vietnam's importance to American security, it made sense that he would remain steadfast, in the hope that the new military measures would succeed, lest he face accusations of backing down, of going soft.\n\nMore than that, Johnson made the leap because for him, \"retreat\" from the struggle was inconceivable. He personalized the war, saw attacks on the policy as attacks on himself, and failed to see that his landslide victory in 1964 and the international and domestic context in early 1965 gave him considerable freedom of action -- a point Humphrey cogently underscored in his February memo.\n\nFrom Day 1 to the end, Johnson was a hawk on Vietnam, which proves again that doubting warriors can be committed warriors. He always framed his options in such a way that standing firm appeared the only reasonable choice -- it was full retreat, bomb the hell out of China, or stay the course. Never did he fully explore imaginative ways out of the conflict; for him, extrication without victory signified humiliation and defeat.\n\nThis didn't mean Johnson rejected all talk of negotiations. After mid-1965 he pressed Under Secretary of State George Ball for new diplomatic ideas -- although, as Ball later remarked, \"he really meant merely new channels and procedures.\"\n\nWhen negotiations with North Vietnam at last began in Paris in May 1968, Johnson took a firm line. He also continued the bombing and increased it below the 19th Parallel and in Laos. In the 10 months from March 1 to Dec. 31, 1968, the Pentagon dropped a greater tonnage of bombs on Indochina than had been expended in the three years prior. This expanded bombing, Daniel Ellsberg hauntingly concludes in his memoir of the war, was \"obediently carried out\" by men from Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford \"on down to flight crews, who believed it served no national purpose whatever.\"\n\nHumphrey won the Democratic nomination in 1968, yet Johnson was reluctant to throw his full support behind him, privately accusing the vice president of being cowardly and disloyal whenever he expressed a desire to move policy even modestly in a dovish direction. Some part of Johnson preferred to see Richard Nixon as his successor, expecting, with reason, that the Republican would be more resolute than Humphrey in pursuing the war.\n\nAnd so it ended, the saga of Lyndon Johnson's presidency, its denouement having been anticipated by him at the beginning. He was a man who dreamed big dreams for the Great Society, who hoped that his prodigious efforts on civil rights, voting rights, education and Medicare would earn him a place alongside Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt -- and who anticipated from the start that Vietnam would ruin it all.\n\nIt bears all the markings of tragedy, but of a certain kind, more Shakespearean than Greek, more Macbeth than Agamemnon. Whereas for the Greek playwrights the universe tends to be deterministic, the hero at the mercy of forces beyond his control, for Shakespeare the tragedy lies in the very choices the protagonist makes. His Macbeth is no mere victim; he contributes to his own demise. The same must be said of Lyndon Johnson.\n\nFor those seeking symbols there is, finally, this: On Jan. 22, 1973, Johnson died at his Texas ranch, two days after hearing Nixon, in his second inaugural address, hint at cuts to the Great Society and remind Americans how far they had come from that bleak time in 1968, when they faced \"the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home.\" The next day, Nixon announced a deal had been reached in Paris to end the war and \"bring peace with honor.\"",

                "body": "Carlos Flores was 17 when he and three accomplices tried to rob a bar in Queens, N.Y., in 1981. An off-duty police officer named Robert Walsh intervened, and he was shot and killed. Mr. Flores was convicted of second-degree murder, a conviction that carried a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. But because he was not the shooter, the judge gave him 21 years to life.\n\nMr. Flores is now 54. He has served 37 years behind bars. The last time he got written up for a disciplinary offense was when he disobeyed an order to keep the mess hall line moving. That was more than 25 years ago. A recent risk-assessment test found that his release would pose the lowest risk of danger to the public. In other words, he's the sort of person parole is designed for.\n\nAnd yet for the 16 years, the New York State Parole Board has denied him parole, using its customary boilerplate language: \"Discretionary release at this time,\" the board said in its most recent denial, last October, \"would not be compatible with the welfare of society and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law.\"\n\nMr. Flores is being locked up not because he's a threat to society or has failed to show that he's changed, but for a crime he committed nearly four decades ago. Too often, that's the default attitude for New York's parole commissioners, even after a state appeals court in 2016 ordered the board to weigh an inmate's youth at the time of the crime in deciding whether he or she should be released.\n\nThat ruling was grounded in a revolutionary string of rulings by the United States Supreme Court, all of which have found that young people are \"constitutionally different\" from adults -- their brains are still developing, their impulse control is weaker and their ability to change over time is greater. This means that they are less guilty than adults and that their punishment must be different, especially in the case of life sentences for those convicted of murder. The \"imposition of a state's most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children,\" the court said in 2012. They must be given \"a meaningful opportunity\" to get out; actual life sentences should be reserved for those few who exhibit \"irretrievable depravity.\"\n\nWhile those rulings have struck down the most severe sentences for juveniles -- the death penalty and mandatory life without parole -- the New York appeals court rightly extended their logic to cases in which parole is technically available but is rarely or never granted. \"A parole board is no more entitled to subject an offender to the penalty of life in prison in contravention of this rule than is a legislature or a sentencing court,\" the state court said.",

                "title": "Opinion | Tariffs on Imports? What Exactly Is an Import?",
                "body": "When the New York International Auto Show opens on Friday, Audi will be featuring vehicles like the SQ5, one of the German automaker's latest entries in the highly competitive S.U.V. market. Well appointed and high powered, the SQ5, which ranges in price from $54,300 to nearly $70,000 with options, competes with the likes of BMW, Lexus, Lincoln and Land Rover.\n\nIt's a German import, the kind President Trump has threatened with tariffs. The president is miffed at Germany's \"already massive tariffs and barriers\" and says he's going to tilt the track back in our favor. (Technically, Germany doesn't impose tariffs; the European Union does.) Last year, the United States imported $20.1 billion worth of German cars while its exports of cars to Germany reached $5.7 billion, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nExcept the SQ5 isn't quite a German import. It isn't even quite German, for that matter. The transmission is German, sure enough, but the engine is made in Hungary, and 63 percent of the other parts are made in Mexico. Those components are actually assembled in San José Chiapa, Mexico -- the dreaded Nafta-European Union combo -- and the SQ5s are shipped across the border to be sold in the United States. They are also available for export.\n\nLooking from behind the wheel of the SQ5, the road has far more twists than the administration may anticipate. The president seems to think that tariffs will strong-arm manufacturers and suppliers into basing more production in America, or somehow get Europeans to buy Chevys. But supply chains have become so sophisticated as to be borderless, and Audi and other foreign companies have already invested billions of dollars in the United States.\n\nForeign-badged cars aren't the only ones that have foreign parts. The Chevrolet Bolt EV -- an important vehicle for General Motors -- is composed of 26 percent American/Canadian parts. The sales sheet isn't more specific because the parts don't care whether they're made in Ontario or Michigan. The motor and transmission -- more than half the total parts -- are from South Korea, which has already been frosted by President Trump's refrigerator tariff. The Bolt is then bolted together at G.M.'s Lake Orion, Mich., plant. In terms of origin, the Chevy Bolt is as American as a karaoke bar -- a venue that has become increasingly popular in the United States. Maybe Mr. Trump should slap a tariff on bad singing.\n\nUnlike the president, automakers have realized that free trade isn't a policy; it's essential to manufacturing efficiency. They source globally and manufacture locally when it makes economic sense -- one reason Audi's owner, Volkswagen, is investing in more production capacity in Tennessee. American automakers haven't been able to make small cars very profitably in the United States, so some of that production, such as that for Ford's Focus, goes to Mexico. Or China. President Trump is now revving up duties on up to $60 billion in unspecified Chinese imports to punish that country for stealing American technology. He might want to avoid autos. Buick's Envision crossover S.U.V., a potential Audi competitor, is manufactured in Yantai, China, from 88 percent Chinese-made parts. Buick is a best-seller in China; indeed, G.M. sells more Buicks there than here. Cadillac sales increased 50 percent in China last year.",

                "body": "\"Statoil's decision to undertake exploration is good news for the South Australian economy,\" said Matt Canavan, a conservative senator from the state of Queensland. Even though pro-drilling candidates won in hard-fought races, plans to extract natural gas here still have to be approved by Australia's offshore oil and gas drilling regulator. Statoil insists that exploration will be safe.\n\nAustralia has reached its 27th consecutive year without a recession by supplying energy and raw materials like iron ore to the manufacturing economies of Asia, and particularly China. Opening the Bight to drilling would help Australia stay on track to eclipse Qatar as the world's largest exporter of natural gas by 2020.\n\nBut opposition to the drilling plan highlights the limitations of relying so heavily on the exploitation of natural resources and their export. The plan has met surprisingly strong resistance, despite the need for jobs in a region where manufacturing used to employ one in five workers. Six town councils have raised objections to the drilling.\n\nCommunities on Australia's southern coast are questioning whether the government can justify putting at risk a unique marine wilderness area that supports the country's most valuable fisheries and a tourism industry worth more than $1 billion.\n\nThe Bight gets its name from its appearance: From space, it looks as if a giant bit into the southern coast of Australia. The crescent-shaped bay runs for more than 700 miles, lined by the longest stretch of sea cliffs in the world.\n\nPort Lincoln, a small seaside town of around 16,000 people where sealing and whaling reaches back to the 1820s, is the main jumping-off point for access to the Bight. Today, the enormous wealth that it continues to bring is evident in the mansions that dot its coast -- homes of the tuna barons who have made millions from selling to Japan, where sushi chefs pay top dollar for Australian tuna.\n\n\"There's potential for an oil spill that would be catastrophic for the industry and other industries along the coast,\" said Robbie Staunton, marine operations manager at Stehr Group, one of Australia's leading seafood companies.\n\nComputer modeling by the British oil company BP, which withdrew in 2016 from its plan to drill in the Bight, projected that an accident similar to the Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 could cause environmental damage along a wide stretch of the southern Australian coastline. This raised local concerns, particularly because the Bight's waters are deeper, rougher and more remote than those of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe projection also raised another problem: whether Australia was even equipped to deal with an accident at an offshore drilling platform. The equipment needed to contain a blowout by capping the flow of oil is thousands of miles away in Singapore, and would take up to 35 days to put in place.",

                "body": "But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow, the company would barely feel it. Facebook has more than 2.1 billion users worldwide. Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020.\n\nPeople in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it's one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it's not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service.\n\nMoreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique.\n\nFacebook's problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that's true, don't expect Facebook to fix itself.\n\nHope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\nThe Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T.\n\nThe European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won't have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product.\n\nAs with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won't repair the sins of the past. But it's something.\n\nRegulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands.\n\nIf we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it's a terrible tool for deliberation.\n\nSo go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism.",

                "body": "The survivors of the Parkland shooting have led a national call to action, and the nation has responded. Students have walked out of their schools in protest, businesses have cut ties with the N.R.A., and our collective frustration culminated in the March for Our Lives this weekend.\n\nSenator Charles Schumer has proposed three measures to reduce gun violence: expanded background checks, protective orders to disarm individuals at risk of violence or self-harm, and an assault weapons ban. These proposals are critically important. But there is another effective response that has been largely ignored: repeal of a law that prevents suits against the gun industry.\n\nA bedrock principle of the American legal system is accountability for wrongdoing. Businesses that cause harm may be held legally responsible in a court of law. Through the imposition of financial liability, our legal system encourages businesses to reduce harm to consumers by making their products safer and disclosing the risks associated with their use.\n\nThanks in part to the accountability imposed by lawsuits, society knows more about the dangers of smoking, and tobacco companies market their products more responsibly. Automakers continually develop and install new safety features, and these innovations deliver results: From 1975 to 2016, the rate of motor vehicle deaths decreased by nearly half. While motor vehicle deaths have declined over the last two decades, firearm deaths have not: According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people now die from firearms than motor vehicle accidents.\n\nThis disturbing reality exists in large part because, unlike other industries, gun manufacturers and sellers are shielded from legal accountability. Bowing to years of intensive N.R.A. lobbying, Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005. The law bars most suits against gun manufacturers and sellers for the harm they cause, immunizing the gun industry from accountability for the tens of thousands of gun deaths that occur in the United States each year.",

                "body": "Junior year starts, and with it comes a cityscape of fat textbooks on the dining room table. Now every time I hand over the keys, my daughter says: \"Can you drive? This is a very stressful time in my life.\" Soon there are leaf piles by the driveway, and she says they make her too nervous to pull into the street. She won't drive on Halloween because of the trick-or-treaters. And then it snows.\n\nWant to know a funny thing? This is a very stressful time in my life, too. I sit next to a colleague whose mother is my age. My jeans are snug. My eyebrows are balding. And I have a child who's a junior in high school, which means that everywhere I go, people want to talk about one thing: college.\n\n\"Have you started looking at schools? How many A.P. courses is she taking? Does she excel in a sport? Is she a leader? A volunteer? The valedictorian?\"\n\nDepending upon my answers, the conversation splits, Choose Your Own Adventure-style, in one of two directions. If I demur, I land in the chapter about how sad it is that our kids are so overstressed. If I play along, we arrive at, \"Have you guys made your list yet?\"\n\nI hate this question. \"We\" aren't going through the \"college process\"; my daughter is.\n\nOne night my husband and I have dinner with friends who just got back from Japan. As we're falling asleep, my husband says, \"What does it say about me that I'd rather talk about Hiroshima than college?\"\n\nI love my town, which we chose for its good schools and down-to-earth families. This is not a suburb where people care about your car or your lawn. But people do care where your kid is going to college. I care too, but I also want to make sure my daughter can take care of herself when she gets there. Does she know how to fry an egg? Manage money? Speak up in a crowded room? I may not be able to help with trigonometry, but I can show her these things. I can teach her how to drive.\n\nAfter a two-month hiatus, I lose my cool with my daughter one night on the way to swim practice. Buckling my seatbelt, I hiss: \"Next time you're driving. I'm sick of being your chauffeur.\"\n\nShe shrugs: Fine/I'm tired/Julia's mom never yells.\n\n\"You know, in the long run, it doesn't matter how you do on the SAT,\" I say. \"It matters whether you know how to parallel park. Driving is a life skill. You need to practice.\"\n\nShe leans back and closes her eyes, looking the way she did as a baby dozing in my arms. Somehow in the heat of the moment, I forgot how she was hunched over \"The Grapes of Wrath\" when I went to bed at midnight; that she's about to swim three miles and her hair will freeze afterward.\n\nFrom the locker room, she texts: \"I'm doing my best. You know that, right? I'm under an insane amount of pressure.\"\n\nI almost type, I am too -- but then I realize, my stress is not her problem, just as her SAT isn't mine. Instead I send a row of hearts.\n\nThe next time I'm with someone who wants to talk about liberal arts versus Big Ten, I say: \"Wait, hold on. How's the driving going?\"\n\nMy friend bursts out laughing: \"It's a total nightmare! She doesn't stop for pedestrians!\"\n\nBoth conversations -- college and driving -- are stand-ins for the real subject that's keeping us up at night: Our kids are leaving home in a year. No more books all over the table, no more late-night cups of tea. I don't want to spend our remaining time obsessing about where my daughter is going to college. Except for the tuition (deep breath), the destination is beyond my control.\n\nMy daughter's driving test is four weeks away. We -- I mean she -- hasn't mastered parallel parking, but she has navigated New Jersey's highways with aplomb befitting her middle name (Grace, like that of half the girls her age). When we arrive at a four-way stop, she waits for three cars to go in clockwise order. Then she slowly presses her foot on the gas. She says, \"My turn,\" and I know it is, and the knowing keeps me from barking at her to go faster.",

                "body": "The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them, and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum.\n\nIn response, one of the two Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson, said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws. Mr. Parkinson also suggested that Mr. Sanni was lashing out because the two had \"dated for 18 months, before splitting up -- I thought amicably -- in September 2017.\"\n\nHe said he had not spoken to Mr. Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign, but as a friend. \"That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him,\" Mr. Stephenson said in the statement, \"but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups.\"\n\nThe other adviser, Cleo Watson, could not be reached for comment.\n\nMr. Sanni said his relationship with Mr. Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum. In a statement, he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family, who live in Pakistan, and he accused Mr. Parkinson of intimidation.\n\n\"I never imagined that he, with the help of No. 10, would choose to tell the world I am gay, in a last, desperate attempt to scare me,\" Mr. Sanni said.\n\nHis lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement, \"We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone.\"\n\nBritish campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union.\n\n\"They were useless,\" said Justin Fisher, a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain.\n\nMultiple organizations, each with its own spending limit, were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue, and they were allowed to work together in ill-defined ways, allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits, Mr. Fisher noted.\n\nThe rules \"had never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before,\" Mr. Fisher said, noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving.\n\nMr. Sanni's allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump -- Cambridge Analytica.\n\nMr. Sanni is friends with Christopher Wylie, a former research director of Cambridge Analytica who has recently provided information to journalists indicating that the company improperly obtained the data of 50 million Facebook users in order to help target voters.\n\nThe Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ, which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr. Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica.\n\nPublic filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire $990,000 budget of BeLeave -- 625,000 pounds -- which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ.\n\nAs Mr. Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica, he encouraged his friend Mr. Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well.\n\nTestimony and documents provided by Mr. Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica's parent company, initially licensed all its software from that company, and for a time received virtually all its income from the company.\n\nIn a statement this week, Jeff Silvester, one of the founders of AggregateIQ, said it was a \"digital advertising, web and software development company\" and \"has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.\"\n\nMr. Silvester did not address the company's work for Vote Leave and BeLeave. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations, but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry. Mr. Sanni's testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry.\n\nHe and Mr. Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave's strategy, planning and internal discussion after the referendum, on June 23, 2016.\n\nMr. Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015, and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign. He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing, for example, that it closed doors to the non-European world.\n\nThe small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff, including Mr. Parkinson and Ms. Watson, as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign's online advertising, Mr. Sanni testified to the commission.\n\nBy mid-May, however, with the referendum little more than a month away, the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap.\n\nAt about the same time, the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group. Mr. Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend, Darren Grimes, was named its principal and campaign director.\n\nMr. Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct $900,000 to BeLeave, given that it was overseen by two unpaid, inexperienced people: He and Mr. Grimes were then both 22. But then his friend Mr. Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising.\n\nIn practice, Mr. Sanni said, nothing changed. The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office. The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages. And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave's online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave.\n\n\"We never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get-go,\" Mr. Sanni said in an interview, echoing his testimony. \"We were just volunteers.\"\n\nThe money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave -- 1,164 email sign-ups and 1,005 mobile phone numbers for more than $900,000 -- leading Mr. Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead.\n\nHe insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr. Parkinson, now at No. 10.\n\nInstead, he said, it was out of concern for Mr. Grimes, the other young volunteer. By making Mr. Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave, the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims, Mr. Sanni argued. \"He is getting thrown to the dogs,\" Mr. Sanni said. \"Everything I am doing is to protect Darren.\"\n\n\"I now feel sick about what happened,\" Mr. Sanni said in his testimony. The officials of Vote Leave \"used two 22-year-olds to cheat in the referendum.\"\n\nMr. Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment.",

                "body": "Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThere are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.\n\n\"They are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,\" Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network's default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.\n\nThe greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \"This is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\" she said.\n\nAlthough many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\n\nConsumers' seemingly benign activities -- their likes -- could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior. And not just by unknown third parties. Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, describing its services in a company case study as \"influencing voters.\"\n\n\"People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,\" said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \"If your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone's life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.\"\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation, something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago. But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.\n\n\"You're undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,\" said Dean C. Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter.\n\nIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons hat date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\n\n\"We're at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\" said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \"This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\"\n\nIn May, the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. The new rules treat personal data as proprietary, owned by an individual, and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission -- opting in rather than opting out -- after receiving a request written in clear language, not legalese.\n\nMélanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.\n\nIn a January speech in Brussels, Facebook's Ms. Sandberg said, \"We know we can't just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\" Google declined to comment.\n\nThe United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum -- and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\n\n\"With the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\" said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \"We now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\"\n\nBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\n\nPrivacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status, health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior-based ads. They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people.\n\nIn 2010, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers, called Do Not Track. Two years later, the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used.\n\nBut the Do Not Track effort and the privacy bill were both stymied.\n\nIndustry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation. Instead, the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads, although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected.\n\n\"If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there's a case to be made for federal regulation\" under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.\n\nThe business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.\n\nIf the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.\n\nThat would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.\n\n\"To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,\" said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.\n\nThere's another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world's remedy for any problem is always more technology.\n\n\"If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,\" said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. \"But well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It's like a child running a bulldozer. They don't have any sense of the damage they can do.\"",

                "title": "Opinion | Trade and the Cities (Wonkish)",
                "body": "Another answer may be that Trump, who often seems to have fixed ideas about the world that are long out of date - like his belief that American cities are gripped by a huge crime wave - is still living in the Michael Crichton era when Japan was going to take over the world any day now.\n\nYet a third answer may be that the U.S. does run a trade deficit with Japan - actually even bigger than the headline number if you include Japanese components embedded in Chinese exports - and Trump believes that (a) a trade deficit means that you're losing while someone else is winning and (b) trade balances are determined by protectionism.\n\nBoth propositions are, of course, untrue. In reality, trade balances are the flip side of capital flows: countries that attract more inflows of foreign capital than their own outflows must, by the sheer arithmetic, run current account deficits (that is, including investment income). Conversely, countries that are exporters of capital run current account surpluses.\n\nAnd modern Japan is a country that really should be running current account surpluses, for one powerful reason: demography. Japan has a rapidly declining working age population:\n\nThis means limited opportunities for investment, which means that it's a country that should be investing its savings abroad.\n\nBut the claim that trade surpluses often reflect weakness, while trade deficits reflect strength, is a very hard sell. And demographic drivers of trade imbalances are usually a lot less clear than this.\n\nThis, however, got me thinking: what about regions within the United States? We have sharply different growth rates across metropolitan areas, mainly driven by in- or out-migration. There are no protectionist barriers to muddy the picture, and capital is surely highly mobile within the country.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have comprehensive regional balance of payments data. Thanks to researchers at Brookings, however, we do now have a lot of information on the exports and imports of metropolitan areas - exports and imports to and from other parts of the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. I'm not sure how safe it is to use these data to estimate trade balances, but let me take a stab at it.\n\nThese data only cover goods; they don't cover either services or income transfers like, say, Social Security receipts, which as we'll see in a second can make a big difference. So I don't think I can run any regressions here. But I still think looking at metropolitan trade balances can be enlightening.\n\nSo let's look at the metros with the biggest goods trade deficits and surpluses.\n\nFirst, the biggest deficits (data for 2010, in billions of dollars):\n\nOK, Washington runs a huge deficit in goods; basically, what it exports is garbage. No, literally: waste is the only product in which it runs a surplus. But this goods deficit is presumably offset by services, both the federal budget and stuff like payments to K Street lobbyists. My guess is that Baltimore has some of the same stuff.\n\nMiami, meanwhile, is selling warm weather to senior citizens, who live largely off Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe big deficit surprise here to someone with a Trumpist view of trade balances would surely be Atlanta, which has been one of our fastest-growing metropolitan areas: a 24 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2010. And we're talking about a big deficit - about 13 percent of metro GDP. What's that about?\n\nThe answer, surely, is that the deficit is a reflection of Atlanta's growth: we're talking about building lots of housing, office parks, and so on, and much of that is financed by capital inflows from the rest of the country.\n\nLos Angeles is a very big metropolitan area, but also one whose growth has slowed a lot: it has run out of land, and zoning restrictions have kept it from building up. So its population rose only 3.7 percent from 2000 to 2010. As a result, it has probably become a big exporter of excess savings, hence a city with big trade surpluses, around 9 percent of GDP (probably even bigger if we had data on services).\n\nI haven't done enough homework to know what's going on in the middle three here. But did you know that New Orleans runs huge trade surpluses? And I mean huge: almost 20 percent of GDP in 2010.\n\nNow, I don't think many people would consider New Orleans an economic winner. In fact, its population declined 11 percent from 2000 to 2010, partly because of Katrina, but also because of wider problems. And that very decline means that savings generated in New Orleans go elsewhere in search of returns.\n\nYou can see the same thing in smaller cities with declining populations. Buffalo-Niagara Falls saw a 3 percent population decline in the 2000s; in 2010 it ran a trade surplus of 22 percent of GDP.\n\nAnd what about the Big Apple? Greater New York ran a small goods trade deficit - 1.6 percent of GDP - in 2010, but thanks to the financial industry surely ran a huge surplus in services. (Remember, this is the metro area, not just New York, so there are plenty of goods exports from, say, the pharma complex in New Jersey.) So it's a big surplus economy overall - not because it's growing fast, but because despite immigration its overall population is growing slowly.\n\nSo to sum things up: within the United States we have large regional trade imbalances that don't reflect \"unfair\" trade policies, because interstate trade is totally free. And running trade surpluses isn't a sign of success, nor is running deficits a sign of failure. If anything, much of the time it's the reverse: fast-growing regions run deficits, stagnating regions run surpluses.\n\nThe same principles apply at the international level. And I'm sure experts in the Trump administration will explain to the president why his view of such things is all wrong. Oh, wait.",

                "body": "Now, the members of Mr. Trump's newly constituted team are about to face multiple, simultaneous tests of their past proclamations and sometimes conflicting instincts. North Korea and Iran pose the most immediate challenge, with Mr. Trump setting negotiation deadlines that are only months away.\n\nOver the longer term, they must straighten out the strategic incoherence surrounding Mr. Trump's approach to Russia and China, defining the meaning of the administration's policy declaration earlier this year that \"great power competition -- not terrorism -- is now the primary focus of U.S. national security.\"\n\nWashington is now consumed by a debate over whether Mr. Trump's new team plans to govern as far to the right as it talks.\n\nSo far, the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has declared that his past comments are \"behind me.\" Hours after his selection was announced, Mr. Bolton vowed that he would find ways to execute the policies that Mr. Trump was elected on, but that he would not tolerate slow-walking and leaks from bureaucrats he dismissed as \"munchkins.\"\n\nSome who know Mr. Bolton and his operating style predict titanic clashes.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, the retired general who has argued for keeping the Iran deal intact and warned that military confrontation with North Korea would result in \"the worst kind of fighting in most people's lifetimes,\" told colleagues on Friday that he did not know if he could work with Mr. Bolton. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, another retired four-star general, was also unenthusiastic about Mr. Bolton's hiring.\n\nMr. Bolton's harshest critics -- mostly Democrats, but their ranks include some members of the Bush administration -- argue that the odds of taking military action will rise dramatically when he becomes the last person a volatile American president consults.\n\n\"John Bolton is not some gray bureaucrat whose views are unknown to us,\" said Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, and now a Stanford professor and the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\n\n\"He's very clear that there should be regime change in Iran and North Korea, and military force should be used to achieve those goals,\" Mr. McFaul said. \"If you hire him, you're making a clear signal that's what you want.\"\n\nBut others who have worked for years with Mr. Bolton argue that Mr. Trump knows exactly what he is getting: leverage, not conflict.\n\n\"I think this notion everybody talks about, that the risks of war have gone up, is wrong,\" said Stephen J. Hadley, who was Mr. Bush's national security adviser and a major architect of the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. \"This is the peace-through-strength crowd who want to make clear to people that they're tough and that no one should cross them. But the reason for that is to deter war.\"\n\nDov Zakheim, a former senior Defense Department official who has known Mr. Bolton for 35 years, wrote on Friday that Mr. Bolton \"may be a fire breather, but he is a man who cares deeply about his country,\" in comparison to his boss, who \"cares deeply about Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatever Mr. Trump's motives, his selection of this team would have been hard to imagine when he first came to office declaring that the continued American presence in Iraq was a \"disaster,\" that he was comfortable with Japan and South Korea getting their own nuclear weapons so the United States would not have to defend them, and that America would no longer be the world's policeman.\n\nMr. Bolton has come to the opposite conclusion.\n\nHe not only fervently advocated the attack on Saddam Hussein from his post at the State Department during the Bush administration, but he also defended its aftermath, and has said he remains convinced it was the right decision. Over the past three years, Mr. Bolton has advocated bombing Iran, attacking North Korea, and carving a new state out of Iraq and Syria.\n\nMike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state, said at the Aspen Security Conference in July that the most dangerous thing about North Korea was the fact that its young, moody and reportedly ruthless leader, Kim Jong-un, controls its weapons.\n\n\"So from the administration's perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?\" said Mr. Pompeo, who at the time was months into his current job as C.I.A. director. \"Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart.\"\n\nAssuming that Mr. Pompeo is confirmed, he and Mr. Bolton, the two most forceful, aggressive new members of the policy team, will have to decide in what order they can risk those confrontations. The Trump administration has said it is open to direct talks with Mr. Kim by May -- the same month by which the president has said he will scrap the Iran nuclear accord.\n\n\"Even if you are going to be a superhawk, you can't do all these at once,\" said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. station chief in Moscow who later hunted down Pakistani nuclear technology as the Energy Department's chief intelligence officer. \"And if you want to go to war with Iran and North Korea, you have to expect to alienate your allies and run headlong into the Russians.\"\n\nWilliam J. Burns, a longtime American diplomat who was Mr. Bush's ambassador to Russia and Mr. Obama's deputy secretary of state, predicted that if the new team exits the Iran deal and confronts North Korea, the first beneficiary is likely to be President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\n\"He looks for splits,\" Mr. Burns said of Mr. Putin. \"He knows he will benefit if we walk away from the Iran deal, because it will put a wedge between us and our European allies.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Mr. Burns said, Mr. Putin is seeking \"splits between the U.S. and China. We are doing his work for him.\"\n\nIn fact, it is in dealing with Mr. Putin that the new team is likely to run headlong into Mr. Trump's reluctance to ever say a critical word about the Russian president. As C.I.A. chief, Mr. Pompeo has embraced the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, though he changes the subject quickly when asked about it.\n\nMr. Bolton, by contrast, has ranked among Mr. Putin's harshest critics. Last July, days after Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin for the first time at a summit meeting in Germany, Mr. Bolton wrote that the Russian interference in the 2016 election was \"a casus belli, a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.\"\n\nMr. Trump did not view it that way.\n\nHe emerged from the meeting in Germany repeating Mr. Putin's observation that the Russians were too skilled at cyberoperations to be caught if involved. Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on winning a Russian election widely viewed as a sham, making no mention of the recent nerve-agent attack that Britain concluded, with American agreement, was a covert action by Moscow.\n\nIf it was, it was being planned out as Mr. Pompeo was acting as the host to the directors of the three major Russian intelligence services in Washington earlier this month.\n\nThe unknown factor in the new mix is Gina Haspel, the career intelligence officer who has been nominated to be the first woman to run the C.I.A. Since she has spent much of her career undercover -- details of which the agency is just beginning to release, in an effort to lobby for her confirmation -- her foreign policy views are largely unknown.\n\nBut her record in the terrorist detentions and interrogations following 9/11 is well documented. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was tortured as a prisoner of war, this past week pointedly asked in a letter to Ms. Haspel, \"Do you believe actions like these were justified, and do you believe they produced actionable intelligence?\"\n\nAt a moment when Mr. Trump has sided with the economic nationalists in his administration and ordered the imposition of tariffs on China to counter its restrictions on American companies and the forced transfer of American intellectual property, Mr. Bolton has gone one further.\n\nHe has questioned whether the United States should abandon the \"One China\" policy that has been the underpinning of relations since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Bolton wrote that confronting China \"may involve modifying or even jettisoning the ambiguous 'One China' mantra, along with even more far-reaching initiatives to counter Beijing's rapidly accelerating political and military aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas.\"\n\nIt is unclear how that squares with Mr. Trump's campaign argument that the United States should pull its forces back from Asia unless South Korea and Japan pay more of the cost of keeping them there.\n\nBut the most immediate decision facing the new team will be the benefits and costs of exiting the Iran deal. Mr. Trump cited his differences with Rex W. Tillerson on Iran in firing the secretary of state.\n\nMr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have been among the harshest critics of the nuclear accord, but they have not said how they would manage the international backlash if Mr. Trump decides, by a May 12 legislative deadline, to resume the sanctions that the United States suspended when the deal was reached.\n\nIf Washington breaches the deal, Iran may declare it is now free to resume producing nuclear fuel in unlimited quantities -- limits it agreed to, for 15 years, in return for economic normalization. If so, that could put the United States and Israel back where they were in the years before the accord was reached: threatening military action to destroy Iran's facilities, even at the risk of another Middle East war. That was the path Mr. Bolton advocated.\n\nIn August, when Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis wrote a joint op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal describing the merits of building economic pressure on North Korea in a policy of \"strategic accountability,\" Mr. Bolton said he was \"appalled.\"\n\n\"Time is not a neutral factor here,\" he said on Fox News, where he was a contributor. \"More negotiation with North Korea? I think they'd say 'bring it on.' More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities.\" He will now be preparing Mr. Trump for that negotiation.",

                "title": "Variety: Cryptic Crossword",
                "body": "VARIETY PUZZLE -- Cryptic crosswords are a unique form of punishment. If you like tricky clues in regular grids, though, you owe yourself to try them. At first, if it seems as if the rules are inscrutable, don't bail out; this is a very popular type of puzzle in other spheres, so there's great, detailed solving information available online (Deb Amlen recommends this guide -- try using it as a road map today).\n\nI've worked on cryptic puzzles for years, and have grown very fond of them. The experts say that the key to understanding each clue is recognizing its two parts; one is a standard definition or synonym, and the other is some form of paronomasia that adds a layer of interest and possibly leads you to an unusual solution. You definitely develop a knack for seeing the twist on each clue, but it also especially helps, in these puzzles, to recognize the fun in the journey and not beat yourself up for being unable to finish without an assist (especially from your fellow solvers in the comments).\n\nThe easiest clues for me are the anagrams; they're akin to multiple choice, as far as I'm concerned, as the answer is there, just scrambled. There will usually be a tip that the scramble needs to happen in the clue: look for a word like \"doctor\" (17D), \"rocks\" (23A), or \"deciphered\" (27A). Any word meaning disrupt, rearrange, or change can be a clue to what to do.\n\nFor example, the 27A: \"Acrostic deciphered: a country\" (5,4). First of all, as in most cryptics, you're given a hint in letter count that indicates more than one word, in this case a two-word phrase of five and then four letters. I look at the number of letters in each word; in this case, acrostic has eight letters, but if you add that \"a\" in \"a country,\" you get nine, so that's a good tip. If you rearrange the letters in \"acrostic,\" and add an a, with an eye to the information above, you arrive at COSTA RICA. Not bad, right? You can do this with those other two clues above -- \"doctor claimed,\" for 17A, to get MEDICAL, and \"paper said rocks\" for the other, DISAPPEAR. The order of the words in a clue can sometimes be altered to further challenge the solver.\n\nThe anagram can also be one ingredient in a more complex recipe, like at 9A and 19A, among others. Let's look at 19A: \"Mull liquor in blended tea\" (8). The anagram indicator is \"blended,\" so I guessed that \"liquor in,\" comprising eight letters, might be anagrammed for the answer, perhaps a synonym to \"mull.\" I came up empty, though, but the misdirection got me thinking of words like \"mull\": ponder, consider, cogitate. ... How about RUMINATE? If you work backward a bit, \"rum\" is a synonym for liquor, \"in\" an anagram of tea: \"ate.\"",

                "body": "Other states and cities have adopted rules to ensure, or at least encourage, minority-group participation in the fledgling marijuana industry, whether as growers or as distributors. Many are also trying to steer its economic benefits to the forlorn towns and neighborhoods that have posed the most intractable economic puzzles.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, distressed rust-belt cities like McKeesport and New Castle, once known for what they made, now find themselves turning to what they can grow.\n\n\"We're talking about bringing in anywhere from 100 to 150 jobs -- for us, that's important,\" said Anthony Mastrangelo, the mayor of New Castle, a city of 22,000 near the Ohio border where a company called Holistic Farms has filled a vast warehouse with cannabis seedlings and grow lights. Mr. Mastrangelo hopes the new business will help turn around a city that has been struggling since the Shenango China dinnerware plant closed in the early 1990s.\n\nMr. Mastrangelo, 80, said he had not heard many complaints from local residents about his city's new business. But the idea doesn't go down well everywhere. After Jeremy Faison, a Republican state representative from east Tennessee, sponsored a medical marijuana bill, he ran into significant pushback from his own district. The legislative board in Cocke County passed a resolution opposing his bill on the grounds that marijuana was still deemed illegal by the federal government.\n\nEven so, Mr. Faison said the new industry would be a shot in the arm for rural Cocke County, where more than 24 percent of residents live in poverty and where the illicit cultivation of marijuana has, along with moonshine making, been a historic and notorious fact of economic life.\n\n\"Some of the prohibitionists are, like, 'I can't believe you're bringing pot to Tennessee,' \" Mr. Faison said. \"I'm like, 'Are you serious?' \"\n\nLast month, the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission announced that Bold Team, the company that wants to set up shop in Cotton Plant, was among the companies that would be granted a growing license. On Wednesday, however, the licensing process was declared \"null and void\" by a Little Rock circuit judge, who noted, among other things, that two commissioners had professional ties to owners of two other companies that had been picked. The Arkansas attorney general has appealed the ruling to the State Supreme Court.\n\nSuch challenges are common in state medical marijuana rollouts. The Bold Team owners declined to comment for this article, but Mr. Ryland said he was confident they would eventually be setting up shop. In its application, company officials said their facility would initially have 25 employees, some of them locally hired unskilled labor. The company also pledged to contribute 1 percent of its gross sales to the city budget.\n\nMr. Ryland, who moved back to Cotton Plant in 2010 after retiring from the United States Department of Agriculture, said that God had called him to fix Cotton Plant. He was elected mayor in 2014 on the slogan \"Change Through Restoration.\"",

                "body": "In an interview with the French radio network RTL, Colonel Beltrame's mother said that she knew it was her son inside the supermarket as soon as she heard that a lieutenant colonel had exchanged himself to free a hostage.\n\n\"I am not surprised that it was him,\" she said. \"He has always been like this.\" His mother, who was not named, described the officer as someone whose reason for being was to defend others' lives. \"He would tell me, 'I am doing my job, Mom, that's all,' \" she added.\n\nA double valedictorian who graduated at the top of his class from the prestigious military school Saint-Cyr in 1999 and from the gendarmerie school in 2001, Arnaud Beltrame joined the special forces unit of the gendarmerie, known as the GIGN, in 2003. He was deployed in Iraq in 2005, according to the president's office, and later received military honors for his service there.\n\nAfter he returned from Iraq, he joined the Republican Guard, which is part of the national gendarmerie and provides officers for the security of French institutions. He was a guard at the Élysée Palace between 2006 and 2010, and joined the gendarmerie unit in southwestern France in August.\n\nAlmost 250 people have died in terrorist attacks here in recent years. Colonel Beltrame is the 10th member of the nation's security forces to be killed in a terrorist attack on French soil since 2012, as police and military officers have become regular targets of jihadists. In April 2017, Officer Xavier Jugelé, 37, was shot dead on the Champs-Élysées.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor François Molins said at a news conference on Friday night that the terrorist threat had not waned, calling it \"the result of radicalized individuals who are on our national territory.\"\n\nThe attack at Trèbes could increase pressure on the French government to take a more aggressive stand on the thousands of people on the security services' terrorism watch lists.\n\nMr. Macron has already shown signs that he will present a tougher face on terrorism than predecessors, recently promising to set up special \"watertight\" units in the country's prisons for a burgeoning radicalized population.\n\nMore details of how the attack unfolded emerged on Saturday. Mr. Lakdim, a 25-year-old French citizen who was born in Morocco and lived in Carcassonne, hijacked a car Friday morning. He shot and wounded the driver and killed a passenger, Jean Mazières, who was a retired winemaker, according to the local news media. The gunman then shot at a group of police officers who were returning from a jog, wounding one.\n\nAfter he left the hijacked car in the market's parking lot, Mr. Lakdim stormed into the store around 11:15 a.m., according to the national gendarmerie. About 50 people were shopping for groceries. The gunman killed two more people on the spot, the authorities said.\n\nSome shoppers escaped through emergency exits at the back of the market, while others hid. Christian Guibbert, a retired police officer who was shopping with his wife and sister-in-law, told French media outlets that he heard gunshots and saw a \"very agitated\" man yell \"God is great\" in Arabic.\n\nMr. Guibbert said he locked his relatives and other shoppers in a meat locker and called the police.\n\nThe only police officer to enter the supermarket at first was Colonel Beltrame, when he decided to swap places with a hostage. He left his phone on a table with the line open, according to Mr. Collomb, the interior minister, so that colleagues outside could listen in.\n\nThe officer spent about two hours with Mr. Lakdim inside the Super U supermarket, officials said.\n\nAfter officers heard more gunshots through the phone, they rushed into the market and killed Mr. Lakdim. Colonel Beltrame was \"seriously wounded\" in the exchange of gunfire, Mr. Collomb said.\n\nOn Saturday, the president's office asked the French people to honor the memory of the officer, who had fallen \"as a hero.\"\n\nMourners placed flowers in front of the gendarmerie headquarters in the French medieval city of Carcassonne to pay tribute to the officer. Officials ordered flags at all gendarmeries to be flown at half-staff.\n\nThe authorities searched Mr. Lakdim's home on Saturday, and the Paris prosecutors' services told The New York Times that officers had found notes referring to the Islamic State. The police also arrested a 17-year-old friend of Mr. Lakdim's overnight on charges of criminal association in connection with a terrorist enterprise. A woman, identified by Mr. Molins as Mr. Lakdim's partner, was taken into custody Friday night on the same grounds.\n\nIn a coincidence, the local newspaper La Dépêche du Midi reported that last year, Colonel Beltrame had led 60 police officers in a simulated exercise surrounding mass killings at a supermarket.\n\nColonel Beltrame told La Dépêche du Midi in December, \"We want to be close to the real conditions, so there is no pre-established scenario.\"\n\nA video shot at that time showed police officers armed with paintball guns surrounding an abandoned building and later holding a man on the ground.",

The issue includes an interview with Tracy K. Smith, the poet laureate; a review from the entrepreneur Audrey Gelman about a new book on friendship; and an essay from the Times columnist Ginia Bellafante revisiting the work of feminist legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon. One goal of the section was to introduce readers to a range of ideas and writing from women. \"The first idea we had was the word 'Vanguard,' because there was this sense that in lots of different ways there were things being done that were pioneering,\" John Williams, a daily books editor for The Times, said.\n\nBut the critics Parul Sehgal, Jennifer Szalai and Dwight Garner wanted to create neither an exhaustive inventory nor a definitive one, which would suggest hard lines between ideas. Instead, they aimed to present notable titles that each exemplify a broader theme, and to encourage readers to consider them together -- in the manner of a syllabus for a cutting-edge university course -- in the hopes of conveying a sense of literary moment.\n\nTo develop the list, the critics sat down with Mr. Williams in a conference room at The Times's Manhattan headquarters, armed with a giant spreadsheet of over 75 works. \"The list was monstrous. It has to be,\" Ms. Sehgal said.",

                "body": "As the Huskies' first player off the bench, she has diversified her game after sitting out a year in accordance with transfer rules. She can protect the rim on defense, and she has evolved from a perimeter shooter to one who can score inside, playing with her back to the basket.\n\nStevens remains a work in progress as a junior, but her presence provided the most intriguing story line as UConn (34-0) met Duke (24-8) on Saturday in the semifinals of the Albany Regional. She entered the game as UConn's third-leading scorer (15.1 points a game) and one of its leading rebounders (7.4 a game).\n\nBy Saturday, the tension had receded from 2016, when McCallie was quoted in The Chronicle, an independent Duke student newspaper, as saying: \"Is that what we're about now, 'I'm going to take transfers'? That was the neat thing they used to have. Connecticut wasn't a transfer school. Now, even if they win, who cares?\"\n\nShe added of Auriemma: \"You know why he's doing that? Because talent is down. And he wants to continue to win.\"\n\nAuriemma responded at the time by noting that Duke had failed to reach the Final Four with McCallie as its coach, despite highly ranked recruiting classes year after year.\n\n\"Do you know how hard it is to coach at Duke?\" he told The Hartford Courant. \"It's really challenging. It's an impossible job. She's tried so hard to get to a Final Four with all the disadvantages there. So I suggest she try a little harder and let us try to be respectable.\"\n\nAt a news conference on Friday, McCallie said that she had been misquoted, her words misinterpreted. \"I did not make those remarks,\" she said, adding: \"All I will say is, I'm very proud of Azura. What she's done is amazing.\"\n\nThe sports editor of The Chronicle, Hank Tucker, who wrote the Q. and A., said that he had recorded the interview, and that he stood by his reporting. \"We transcribed what she said properly,\" he said, \"and I think we gave all the context we needed.\"\n\nAuriemma was subdued on Friday, saying that, in retrospect, he did not believe the biting remarks were intended to be derogatory. They had some validity, he added.\n\n\"I think she was saying it's unusual for a team like Connecticut to have someone transfer in,\" Auriemma said, \"and it's true.\"\n\nHe added: \"I just thought of it as that's the changing world we live in. We've had kids move on to other schools, and there's a lot of kids that move on from other schools, and this one just happened to be a really, really good player that wanted to make a change.\"\n\nHe did manage one joking remark, saying he had told Stevens, \"They've been pretty good since you left, so maybe they're happy that you left.\"\n\nFor her part, Stevens said she saw the words attributed to McCallie, but put them out of her mind. \"It doesn't faze me,\" she said.\n\nThe decision to leave Duke was not easy, but there are no regrets, Stevens said. She went to UConn to be challenged by demanding expectations and to win a national championship. She has been up and down this season, but has been rewarded with the challenge of confronting areas of her game in which she was not confident or comfortable.\n\nCrystal Dangerfield, UConn's point guard, said Stevens \"got tired of being told she wasn't moving her feet, didn't have her hands up, on the defensive end.\" Dangerfield added, \"She took that personally and she got better at it.\"\n\nAt the offensive end, Stevens has become a moving target, not strong enough to outmuscle most traditional post players, but agile enough to get around them near the basket and versatile enough with her jumper to draw them outside. She had some of her most effective performances against the country's top-ranked teams -- 10 points in the fourth quarter of a home victory over Notre Dame, 16 points in 20 minutes of a narrow win at Texas.\n\nShe was also named the most outstanding player of the American Athletic Conference tournament, then delivered 26 points and 10 rebounds in 15 minutes of an 88-point rout of St. Francis of Pennsylvania in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament.\n\n\"Every big kid fancies themselves as the next Kevin Durant,\" Auriemma said. \"It's just been a matter of trying to get her to see all the different places on the court that she can have an impact, offense and defense. Most of the work has been on her mind-set: 'This is what I can become.' We've been successful to a point, but we're not quite there yet. When you have somebody like that, you don't know what the next level is. You just know that you're not there yet. There's so much more to her.\"\n\nChris Dailey, UConn's associate head coach, has worked to get Stevens to block shots with the correct hand and to be less tentative when shooting beyond the 3-point arc, where, entering Saturday's game, she was only 9 for 51 this season.\n\n\"We're not trying to reinvent the wheel,\" Dailey said. \"We're just trying to teach her to use what she has to her advantage, so she's not a one-dimensional player. We need her to have a little bit of a nasty streak in order to take that next step. But she is just a joy to have in our program. She's never going to be exactly like other big post players. But it's important for her to use her advantages against players like that.\"",

Mr. Mohammad was one of them, and he has now lived here long enough to see Russia seemingly drawn back into Afghan intrigue.\n\nAt the time, though, Russians spoke of having an Afghan Syndrome, like the Vietnam Syndrome in the United States; they wanted nothing to do with the country.\n\n\"Russia had a bitter time,\" said Mr. Mohammad, who has spent the last 35 years living in various mud-walled homes in northern Afghanistan.",

                "body": "The issue repeatedly flared without resolution under the Obama administration, peaking in 2016, when the government tried to force Apple to help it break into the iPhone of one of the attackers in the terrorist assault in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nThe debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the \"going dark\" problem.\n\nThe National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.\n\nBut the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.\n\n\"Building an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,\" said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. \"Any of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.\"\n\nCraig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening -- not weakening -- security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of \"security versus security\" rather than security versus privacy.\n\n\"Proposals that involve giving the keys to customers' device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,\" he said in a statement. \"Weakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.\"\n\nBut some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.\n\nA National Academy of Sciences committee completed an 18-month study of the encryption debate, publishing a report last month. While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.\n\nThey included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.\n\nAccording to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on \"going dark\" issues.\n\nThe researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that \"this issue is not going away,\" and were trying to foster \"constructive dialogue\" rather than declaring that no solution is possible.\n\nMr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.\n\n\"The stuff I've been thinking about is entirely the device problem,\" he said. \"I think that is where the action is. Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\"\n\nThe deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \"warrant-proof encryption\" was endangering society.\n\n\"Technology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\" he said. \"Competition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.\n\n\"At the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\" Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \"I'm confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the 'going dark' problem.\"\n\nThe Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.\n\nThe idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner's passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted -- so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.\n\nLaw enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.\n\nStill, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day -- so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.\n\nThe Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.\n\nStill, in 2016, the Obama administration's deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.\n\nBut one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.\n\nMr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \"is a difficult problem,\" he said. \"Let's keep working on it. But let's not let the desire for a perfect solution get in the way of one that would help.\"",

I have complained to the super and building management, to no avail. (The super even told me the owner hopes that I will move out because my lease is rent-stabilized.) I have read about the health hazards of cleaning products. Imagine what it's like being forced to inhale these fumes daily! What can be done to protect my health?\n\nA. Many household cleaning products (even some that are marketed as environmentally friendly) contain ingredients that can harm your health. Such products can irritate your eyes or throat and cause headaches or other health problems.\n\nSome people are more sensitive to chemicals than others, particularly those with conditions like asthma. \"These things are irritants, but everybody's threshold is a little different,\" said Dr. Louis DePalo, a pulmonology professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n\nIs the building using these products to harass you, as your question suggested? Possibly. But management might also just be trying to keep the area clean. (Dust can also be an irritant.)\n\nSince these products are legal, you cannot force the building to change its purchasing habits. however, you could try the art of persuasion -- with your neighbors, building staff and management.",

                "title": "Transgender Workers Gain New Protection Under Court Ruling",
                "body": "The case was brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent federal agency, on behalf of a funeral director who had been fired by a Michigan funeral home after informing the owner that she intended to transition from male to female and would dress as a woman while at work.\n\nJob discrimination based on a person's transgender status violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court ruled. Under the law, it said, \"gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.\"\n\nThe court's conclusion is at odds with a position taken by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October. In a memorandum to Justice Department lawyers, he said that \"Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.\"\n\nThe funeral home maintained that it did not violate federal law by requiring the employee to comply with a sex-specific dress code. Moreover, the owner of the home, Thomas Rost, who has been a Christian for more than 65 years, said that forcing him to employ the transgender worker would impose a substantial burden on his sincerely held religious beliefs and would therefore violate another law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n\nThe court disagreed, saying that employees may not be discriminated against because they fail to conform to \"stereotypical gender norms\" -- in this case, an employer's notion of \"how biologically male persons should dress, appear, behave and identify.\"\n\nDiscrimination based on transgender status is a form of sex discrimination, said the decision, written by Judge Karen Nelson Moore for a unanimous three-judge panel, because \"an employer cannot discriminate against an employee for being transgender without considering that employee's biological sex.\"\n\nScott Rabe, an expert on employment law at the firm Seyfarth Shaw, said that the ruling was important because \"it addresses two hot-button topics in employment law: the scope of the definition of 'sex discrimination' under Title VII and the impact of laws protecting the free exercise of religion in the workplace.\"\n\n\"The ruling is a big win for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and for transgender people,\" Mr. Rabe said. \"The court sent a strong message that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has minimal impact on the E.E.O.C.'s authority to enforce the anti-discrimination laws under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\"\n\nIn an interview, the employee at the center of the case, Aimee Stephens, 57, said she had been shocked by her dismissal.\n\n\"I had a hard time believing that a company or a person could get away with firing me because I was transgender,\" Ms. Stephens said. \"It didn't seem right.\" But, she said, she has since learned that \"it's a pretty common occurrence for transgender people to be fired because they are transgender or don't meet the expectations of what another individual thinks they should be.''\n\nIn court papers, Mr. Rost said he wanted to run his business in keeping with his religious belief that \"a person's sex (whether male or female) is an immutable God-given gift and that people should not deny or attempt to change their sex.\"\n\nThe court decision is binding in states covered by the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. But its reasoning could have influence elsewhere.\n\nAs it embraced a broad view of protections under Title VII, the court also rejected an expansive interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThat law figured prominently in dozens of court cases in which employers challenged an Obama-era rule that required them to provide insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has proposed to roll back that requirement by offering an exemption to any employer that objects to covering birth control on the basis of religious beliefs.\n\nDoron M. Kalir, a law professor at Cleveland State University in Ohio, said the court ruling showed how judges were \"extending the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to a more diverse work force of gays, lesbians and transgender people.\"\n\nThe funeral home has not said whether it will appeal the ruling. Mr. Kalir said that at least several Supreme Court justices, if presented with the issue, would probably vote to overturn the ruling on the ground that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Mr. Kalir wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for a civil rights group, Equality Ohio, that was quoted by the appeals court.)\n\nIn a separate case last year, Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said the meaning of the civil rights law and the word \"sex\" had changed over the years.\n\n\"It is well-nigh certain that homosexuality, male or female, did not figure in the minds of the legislators who enacted Title VII,\" wrote Judge Posner, who retired from the federal bench in September. But, he said, the law \"invites an interpretation that will update it to the present,\" and the word \"sex\" in Title VII can now, after more than a half-century, be \"understood to include homosexuality.\"",

His father is a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York.\n\nThe couple met through OkCupid in February 2016, and quickly bonded over their interest in the Broadway show \"Hamilton,\" which Ms. Schwartz had already seen.\n\n\"He wasn't the kind of stereotypical guys I had been meeting online,\" Ms. Schwartz said. \"Guys who would write ridiculous things that they thought were clever.\"\n\nThey made plans to see \"Hamilton\" on their first date, set for March 1, but as it turned out, Ms. Schwartz scored tickets to \"The Book of Mormon\" for the same night, and asked Mr. Markowitz if he would still like to go along. He accepted her invitation, and before heading to the theater they went to dinner, where each earned a rave review from the other.\n\n\"He was really handsome and really funny and smart,\" Ms. Schwartz said.\n\nMr. Markowitz, who admits to being \"someone who is a little awkward and not very good when it comes to making small talk,\" said \"she was so bubbly and easy to talk to, the conversation just kept flowing.\"\n\nThough their fourth date was a 12-hour marathon, \"there were no awkward pauses,\" Mr. Markowitz said. They went to the Central Park Zoo and lake, a bowling alley in Times Square, a movie followed by dinner followed by a trip to his apartment to watch \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\n\"We just never ran out of things to say,\" he said. The dating was easy. The relationship grew.\n\nOn March 1, 2017, their one-year anniversary, they decided to celebrate by going to see \"Hamilton.\"\n\nUnbeknown to Ms. Schwartz, Mr. Markowitz also planned on proposing that night. Through a friend of a friend who knew a member of the \"Hamilton\" cast, he arranged to take Ms. Schwartz onstage after the performance, where he would pop the question in front of family members and friends.\n\nDetermined to keep his plan a secret, Mr. Markowitz returned home from work that night with the engagement ring hidden in one of his socks and later at the theater, he excused himself and went to the bathroom to switch the ring to a jacket pocket.\n\n\"When I got back to my seat, I moved Catherine away from me every time she got close enough to feel the ring box,\" he said.\n\nAt show's end, Mr. Markowitz told her he wanted to have their photo taken near the stage and was met there by the actress Mandy Gonzalez (who plays Angelica Schuyler.) Ms. Gonzalez, who knew what was about to happen, took them onstage where other cast members were milling around.\n\nMr. Markowitz texted his sister to bring in both families, but he began sweating when she texted back: \"Stall.\"\n\nA few family members were about two minutes late, and now it was up to Mr. Markowitz, who feared security would soon escort him off the stage, to keep the conversation flowing until they arrived. \"It was the longest few minutes of awkward small talk in my life,\" he said.\n\nMr. Markowitz and Ms. Schwartz were soon in the spotlight, surrounded by cast members and invited guests who watched him drop to one knee and begin another conversation, this one ending with her \"Yes,\" and a rousing ovation.",

                "body": "But it is far from clear that such agreements will be completed and, if they are, who will be on the winning end.\n\nWhat is increasingly clear to many on Capitol Hill and in the business community is that the White House is seizing on trade as a negotiating tool, trying to use the nation's economic dominance as leverage to pressure other countries to bend to its will.\n\n\"Trump prefers to negotiate at the point of a gun,\" said Robert E. Scott, a senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington. But he questioned the wisdom of not outlining the goals of the negotiation at the outset, particularly with allies.\n\n\"I think it would have been better to make this explicit when they laid out the tariffs,\" Mr. Scott said.\n\nThe approach is rattling some of Mr. Trump's otherwise ardent supporters, who worry that his unpredictable trade actions could hurt many of the industries and workers he has pledged to protect.\n\n\"While serious problems persist in the global steel market, President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs were a blunt and misaimed response,\" J. D. Foster, the chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote on Friday morning.\n\nAdministration officials seem to see the chaos and fallout from blunt trade moves as a cost of doing business in a global economy.\n\nRobert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, struggled on Thursday to soothe farm-state senators on the Finance Committee who worried about Chinese retaliation against their constituents' products.\n\n\"Every time we take a trade action, agriculture is in the cross hairs,\" Mr. Lighthizer said. \"It's something we're very sympathetic to,\" he added, though he did not detail how the administration might try to mitigate that impact.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was similarly pressed on Thursday by House Republicans and Democrats who, after American companies were forced to apply for steel and aluminum tariff exemptions, called it a chaotic process.\n\nRepresentative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, described the \"ashen\" faces he had seen at a company that was being forced to apply for individual exclusions for a large number of the imported products it needed.\n\nMr. Ross offered him little comfort. \"It's the best we could do, sir,\" he said, referring to the department's process for evaluation those applications.\n\nHe later rattled free-trade Republicans when, on CNBC, he agreed that the Chinese tariffs would produce \"some ultimate retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.\"\n\nNervous Republicans on Capitol Hill say the administration's frequently and hastily altered plans to impose the tariffs suggest that Mr. Trump and his aides are devising trade policy on the fly. Even some supporters of the tariffs say it is unclear from the outside how Mr. Trump plans to leverage them to catalyze a broader global offensive against the overproduction of the metals by countries such as China.\n\nOther supporters remain optimistic that Mr. Trump will succeed in using the threat of tariffs to win concessions from trading partners that benefit America.\n\nMr. Trump has long argued that China is cheating under the global rules of trade and has vowed to reduce the United States' trade deficit with China and other countries. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with cheap steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country, and which motivated Mr. Trump's initial declaration last month that he would impose what is effectively a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum from every country in the world.\n\nHe has since backtracked, in a series of decisions that have stirred chaos in Washington and abroad. On Thursday, the United States temporarily exempted the European Union, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs. And the White House raised the specter of another showdown, saying that the tariffs would be lifted only until May 1, pending negotiations, and that it could impose quotas on metal imports from those countries at any point.\n\nInside and outside Congress, trade experts have found themselves guessing at what is coming next on trade, and whether Mr. Trump has a broader strategy.\n\nA theory in trade policy circles is that Mr. Trump may have announced the tariffs -- and set the window for negotiating with exempt allies -- to pressure those allies to impose their own tariffs on steel and aluminum from the countries that the Commerce Department has identified as the worst offenders in global overproduction of those metals, including China and South Korea.\n\n\"Clearly, those are the countries that are the source of most excess capacity,\" Mr. Scott said. \"So the best thing to do would be to find a way to circle the wagons, and wall off the rest of the world from those bad actors.\"\n\nIf that is the administration's goal, it has chosen a curious route to it. For one, it has thus far denied an exemption to Japan, a prominent ally and now America's largest source of steel that still faces the tariffs. And it temporarily exempted South Korea, which most trade hawks consider a major source of the steel overcapacity problem.\n\nThe Korean inclusion points to a second possible strategy, one that is less about walling off excess steel in China and more about using the metals tariffs as a weapon to win trade concessions from individual partners. Mr. Ross seemed to offer some clues on Friday that this was the strategy, when he said a new trade agreement with South Korea would address the tariffs -- known in trade jargon as Section 232 -- and other issues.\n\n\"We believe we are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with the South Korean government,\" Mr. Ross said. \"It will encompass, if it goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues. And we hope by sometime next week to be able to have a real announcement.\"",

                "body": "Inside New Japan's headquarters in Tokyo, Katsuhiko Harada, the company president, has a classroom-sized Rand McNally map of the United States. Dozens of cities, including New York and Chicago -- now W.W.E. strongholds -- are circled like targets.\n\n\"I believe there are people who want a different type of way from W.W.E., some fans who prefer other kinds of pro wrestling,\" Mr. Harada said, with that map behind him. \"For those people, we just want to show another option and for them to see New Japan.\"\n\nNew Japan's growth has been fueled in part by Bushiroad, a Japanese card gaming company, which became its majority shareholder in 2012 and emphasized appealing to wider audiences, Mr. Haruda said.\n\nIntense bouts with layered storytelling and spectacular ring entrances has made New Japan a darling among die-hard fans who sometimes bemoan W.W.E.'s booking, which has become increasingly tailored for mass consumption.\n\nNew Japan's growth has been helped by YouTube, which has made New Japan's matches more accessible to an audience outside of Asia, said Dave Meltzer, publisher of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, which has followed the sport since 1983. Capitalizing on this rise, New Japan launched an online streaming service -- similar to the W.W.E. Network -- in December 2014.\n\n\"W.W.E. does the 'entertainment' part of 'sports entertainment' so, so well,\" said Cody Rhodes, a New Japan star who left W.W.E. in 2016. \"New Japan does the 'sports' part of 'sports entertainment' like nobody else.\"\n\nLast year, New Japan sold out its first two shows in the United States, and all the seats for an event on Sunday in Long Beach, Calif., were gone shortly after going on sale in January.\n\nBut evolving from a buzz-worthy niche to mainstream acceptance remains a daunting task.\n\nProfessional wrestling has historically been colored by fierce territorial wars, with promoters battling over in-ring talent and the audience that pays to see it. Without serious competition, W.W.E. has built a business that allows its stars to reach levels of opulence never before associated with wrestling, both in income and crossover appeal. A top star like John Cena can appear with W.W.E. one night and guest-host NBC's \"Today\" show the next morning. There are, however, only so many Cena-level spots available.\n\nNew Japan's rise has come, in part, from offering its performers more artistic freedom as well as additional avenues for income that are not always available to those working for W.W.E. For example, some wrestlers can negotiate with New Japan to also work for other promotions and to sell their own branded merchandise.\n\n\"It's important to play your music how you want to play it,\" Mr. Rhodes said. \"To be the writer, director, cameraman, and actor all at once. A company like New Japan builds the set, fills the seats, but allows us to do what we do how we want to do it.\"\n\nFor years, wrestling in Japan was seen as a rite of passage for foreigners. Mr. Rhodes, the son of Dusty Rhodes, one of the most popular pro wrestlers of the 20th century, always found Japan appealing because of his father's trips there.\n\nNow with Japan as their base, Mr. Rhodes and his North American colleagues Matt and Nick Jackson and Kenny Omega -- collectively known as The Bullet Club -- have become among the most popular wrestlers in the industry.\n\nRyan Barkan, whose company prowrestlingtees.com is the official U.S. seller of New Japan apparel, began producing Bullet Club shirts in 2014, and they immediately became his best seller. The classic Bullet Club logo shirt was also the top-selling T-shirt at retailer Hot Topic in 2017, according to Barkan, who has supplied 470,000 units of New Japan products to the store since brokering a deal with them last June.\n\nNew Japan's entrepreneurial spirit calls to mind how Mr. Cuban amassed his fortune through a series of business deals that started with a tech firm he started in the 1980s. (Since Mr. Cuban has gone into partnershop with New Japan, published reports have cited a history of alleged sexual harassment in the Dallas Mavericks organization. Mr. Cuban has denied those allegations and New Japan declined to comment on them.)\n\nDespite New Japan's ability to present critically-acclaimed matches and the company's impressive tally of T-shirts sold, television remains a key to mainstream visibility.\n\nAXS has less reach than USA Network, which broadcasts W.W.E. programming, but Andrew Simon, chief executive officer of AXS TV Fights, said viewership for New Japan is \"up tremendously year over year,\" although he did not disclose exact ratings.\n\nThis month, New Japan's exposure continued to grow with an English-language DVD distribution deal and the opening of a training center in Southern California. When Chris Jericho, one of W.W.E.'s biggest stars, performed for New Japan in January, the announcement received coverage in Forbes and Rolling Stone.\n\nNew Japan's quick ascent has impressed many in the business, but comparisons to W.W.E. might be premature.\n\n\"It's like a great foreign film coming to the U.S.,\" Mr. Meltzer said. \"It's not going to be competition for the blockbusters, but it could be a better movie and often is.\"\n\nStill, New Japan's influence has even reached W.W.E. On April 8, at W.W.E.'s signature \"WrestleMania\" spectacular, the bill's main event will feature Shinsuke Nakamura against A.J. Styles, an American who reinvented his career overseas.",

                "body": "On this rainy afternoon, by the fireplace in the Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired stone and wood living room of his dreamy mansion, Mr. Diller is all charm, with a healthy dose of self-deprecation. He's dressed in a red checked flannel shirt, a burgundy Hermès hoodie, baggy jeans and black Tods loafers.\n\nWe are eating cold salads and drinking hot tea, served by the butler, Victor. And we are hopscotching topics, from Silicon Valley taking over Hollywood to Jared & Ivanka & Josh & Karlie to pornography to his company's dating websites to the time Harvey Weinstein tried to throw Mr. Diller off a balcony in Cannes to how his friend Hillary Clinton is faring to the mogul's dismissal of Donald Trump (whose Secret Service code name is Mogul) as \"a joke\" and \"evil.\"\n\nI tell him that a friend of mine, an executive in network television, fretfully asked her Hollywood psychic how long Mr. Trump would last as president and the psychic asserted that it wouldn't be more than two years and that the president would be felled by a three-page email. (The only problem with this prediction being, I don't think Mr. Trump emails.)\n\n\"I would so love it if he were being blackmailed by Putin,\" Mr. Diller says with a sly smile. \"That would make me very happy. This was a man of bad character from the moment he entered adulthood, if not before. Pure, bad character. Ugh, Trump.\"\n\nHe shrugs off what he calls Trump's \"normal, vicious Twitter attacks\" on him. After Mr. Diller mocked Trump's campaign in 2015, Trump tweeted: \"Little Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me. He is a sad and pathetic figure. Lives lie!\"\n\nMr. Diller waves off talk of Mr. Trump opening the door to more celebrity presidents, saying, \"I want this to be a moment in time where you go in and pick out this period with pincers and go on with life as we knew it before.\"\n\nHas the media gone overboard in criticizing Mr. Trump?\n\n\"Are you kidding?\" he replies.\n\nMr. Diller says that he and his wife, Diane von Furstenberg, are friends with Josh Kushner and his supermodel girlfriend, Karlie Kloss, but do not hang out with Jared and Ivanka.\n\nHe has put Chelsea Clinton on the boards of two of his companies, but that is not likely to happen with this first daughter.\n\n\"I mean, we were friendly,\" he says of Ivanka, in the time before Mr. Trump became president. \"I would sit next to her every once in a while at a dinner. And I, as everyone did, was like, 'Oh, my God, how could this evil character have spawned such a polite, gracious person?' I don't think we feel that way now.\"\n\nAt 76, having seen around the corner to tech and pulled together the ragtag group of internet ventures at IAC into a thriving whole, Mr. Diller has \"mellowed beautifully,\" as one producer here who has known him for many years puts it.\n\nHis dogs are jumping up on our chairs. He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late, beloved dog Shannon, a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland.\n\nFor about $100,000, a South Korean firm \"reincarnated\" Shannon in three pups: Tess, short for \"test tube,\" and DiNA, a play on DNA, who live in Beverly Hills; and Evita, who lives in Cloudwalk, the Connecticut home of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg.\n\n\"These dogs, they're the soul of Shannon,\" he says. \"Diane was horrified that I was doing this but she's switched now to say, 'Thank God you did.'\"\n\nMr. Diller has started a trend in Hollywood, inspiring his friend Barbra Streisand, desolate over the loss of her Coton de Tulear, Samantha, to clone her.\n\nDoesn't he want to clone himself into a \"Killer Diller,\" as his protégés, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Eisner and Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, are known?\n\n\"God forbid,\" he says with a grimace.\n\nI ask Mr. Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen's joke at David Geffen's recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine's house in Los Angeles that Mr. Geffen, Mr. Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented \"the world's third-largest economy.\"\n\n\"It is a funny joke,\" he says. \"It's close to true.\"\n\nIs it a cool club to be in, I wonder, or a back-stabbing one?\n\n\"For me, it's stimulating,\" he says. \"Diane hates it. So I am both in it, because I like it, and ripped out of it, because Diane says, 'Too much money, too many rich people, let's go.' I've got a good personal boomerang process.\"\n\nHe says he met Mr. Geffen, whom he considers \"family,\" when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said, 'I'm in the mailroom at William Morris in New York. I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here.' And I thought 'Oh, my God, on your vacation?' Because for me, vacation was Hawaii.\"\n\nWe talk about how Hollywood has changed, and I ask how the #MeToo era will affect the content of movies.\n\n\"'Red Sparrow' has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine,\" he says. \"O.K., it was made a year and a half ago. Would it be made today in the same way? Probably so. So I don't think it affects content.\n\n\"I mean, if you take the effect of pornography on young people today. Pornography until recently was fairly staid. Today, online, pornography is so extreme and so varied, with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing. The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that.\"\n\nOnce, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more. I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography.\n\n\"I see it in our companies, where the relationships between people are changing,\" Mr. Diller says. \"We recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, 'Here's the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let's presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \"Yes\" or \"No.\" If it's \"Yes,\" go in good health and if it's \"No,\" then it's full stop.'\n\n\"But the end result of that is a guy, let's presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, 'Oh, this is a smart guy. I'm promoting him.' A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin'.\n\n\"God knows, I'm hardly a sociologist. But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation. Because I think all men are guilty. I'm not talking about rape and pillage. I'm not talking about Harveyesque. I'm talking about all of the spectrum. From an aggressive flirt. Or even just a flirty-flirt that has one sour note in it. Or what I think every man was guilty of, some form of omission in attitude, in his views. Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that's what we have. You get accused, you're obliterated. Charlie Rose ceases to exist.\"\n\nMr. Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia, and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties, including Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Tinder, Match and OkCupid. I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture.\n\n\"It's just like the princess phone evolved to the internet,\" he says. \"Match.com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did. And now I'm starting to hear that out of Tinder. It's funny, though, on Bumble, the women get to choose first and they don't want to. I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating, which is less appealing to me.\"\n\nI ask Mr. Diller, a Los Angeles native, about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz, another Los Angeles native, that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally.\n\n\"Does Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world?\" Mr. Baitz asked. \"Hollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes. Can you imagine anyone now making 'Norma Rae,' 'Silkwood,' 'Five Easy Pieces,' 'Reds'?\"\n\nSince Mr. Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr. Beatty's epic \"Reds,\" he should know.\n\n\"What an undertaking,\" Mr. Diller says. \"But isn't it amazing how it holds?\"\n\nCalling \"Red Sparrow\" \"awful\" and \"The Shape of Water\" \"beautiful but silly,\" he says he wouldn't want to run a movie studio now. \"It would be like saying, do I want to own a horse-and-buggy company? The idea of a movie is losing its meaning.\"\n\nOf the Academy Awards nominees this year, he said, \"essentially, no one went to see them.\"\n\nGrowing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business -- he says there are still streets out here named \"Dillerdale\" and \"Barrydale\" -- Mr. Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood.\n\n\"They were real characters -- overblown, exuberant, nasty, but each of them in their own way were genuinely interesting people,\" he says. \"The only thing that I've learned, that I think I've had some instinct for, is instinct. And these people operated completely out of instinct. As against today, when people operate out of research and marketing.\"\n\nHe says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into \"a completely different universe.\"\n\n\"It's something that's never happened in media before, when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production, like spending more than $100 million dollars to make 'House of Cards,' instead of buying old stuff,\" he says. \"It blows my mind. It's like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside. And they cannot be outbid. No one can compete with them.\"\n\nHe calls Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, the most remarkable person in the media business: \"He has so much original thinking in so many different areas, he's really impressive.\"\n\nI ask how the tech community's noxious bro culture will affect the business here, given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism.\n\n\"They're tech people,\" he says with a shrug. \"They don't have a lot of romance in them. They don't have a lot of nuance in them. Their lives are ones and zeros.\" But they can grow, he says. \"When I met Bill Gates, I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail. And now you can see him cry.\"\n\nHe corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords. \"Our overlords are not them,\" he says. \"Our overlords are artificial intelligence.\"\n\nAt several points during our three-hour interview, Mr. Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun. When I assure him it's fascinating, he looks skeptical.\n\n\"Yeah, right,\" he says. \"Don't seduce me. I'm a very seducible person.\" He also says he's a \"jinxable\" person.\n\nMs. von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr. Diller 43 years ago, \"What I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful, determined and engaged human being, there was shyness and reservation. He's not a pig. I mean, in no way.\"\n\nHe impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E-Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket.\n\nOn another occasion, driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house -- Mr. Diller likes to drive fast -- they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly, holding on to each other.\n\n\"Both of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing: 'One day, we will be that couple,'\" she recalls. \"The only thing we disagree on is, he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington.\"\n\nThe other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity.\n\n\"When he knows about something, he knows more about it than anyone else, and when he doesn't know something, he wants to know more about it than anybody else,\" says Scott Rudin, who has produced movies, plays and television with Mr. Diller (including \"Lady Bird\" for the screen and \"Betrayal,\" \"The Humans,\" \"A Doll's House, Part 2,\" \"Three Tall Women\" and \"Carousel\" for Broadway). Mr. Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so-called Diller Island, an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district.\n\nGiven that Mr. Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch -- and blessedly greenlighted \"The Simpsons\" -- I wonder if he feels like Dr. Frankenstein.\n\n\"I left Fox before Fox News came into being,\" he says. About the sale of Fox to Disney, he notes that his former boss \"played a bad hand very well.\"\n\nI observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on.\n\nMr. Diller recalls that once in Cannes, when he was the chief executive of Universal, Stacey Snider, the head of the movie division, told him that \"Harvey had treated her terribly and made her cry. So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said, 'Harvey, don't ever treat an executive at my company that way. Don't you ever talk to anyone in that manner.'\n\n\"And Harvey, about six feet away, said, 'I'm going to throw you off the terrace.' And this gorilla, because he looks like a gorilla, starts walking towards me, right? And truly, I was scared. I thought, how, without cutting and running like a chicken, do I stop him? And somehow a bear came into my mind.\" He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance, as you're supposed to do if you have to confront a bear.\n\n\"And it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor,\" he says.\n\n(Ms. Snider told Kim Masters in a 2007 Esquire article that Mr. Diller was such a tough boss that she teared up with him, after she made a blunder at a meeting. Mr. Diller apologized to her afterward.)\n\nHe adds: \"Other than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\"\n\nSpeaking of bad behavior, I ask if he knew Mr. Trump back in the day in Manhattan.\n\nHe said that when he was in his mid-30s, running Paramount, Mr. Trump invited him to lunch.\n\n\"And you know when people compliment you without foundation?\" Mr. Diller says. \"And they do it too much? It's really irritating. It's kind of offensive. And he spent the entire time saying how great I was. He didn't know me. And afterward, I walked around the corner and I thought, 'I never want to see that man again.' Decades passed and we would run into each other, but I literally never spoke to him again.\"\n\nHe says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that \"she's well with herself again and she has a role to play.\"\n\nAfter the interview, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks, I call him to see what he makes of Facebook's role.\n\n\"Since the beginning of media and advertising, the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads,\" he says. \"Along comes the internet with almost perfect aim, and now the entire concept is being called antisocial. That's a most ironic but momentous thing.\"\n\nMr. Diller's friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy. He flinches when I use the term \"Diller Island,\" saying it should be called \"Pier 55.\"\n\nNow he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg, Diane's son whom Mr. Diller also calls his son, to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it, so that people can tour and hike around it.\n\nHe is very proud of the success of the High Line, the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan. \"Who would have dreamed so many people would come?\" he marvels.\n\nAndrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, pulled the Hudson Island project, a $250 million family park and cultural center, out of the ashes, moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it. (Hasn't that family done enough damage?)\n\n\"The delay cost us $25 million or something like that,\" Mr. Diller says. \"But here's the thing. My family's lucky. So who's counting? Can I actually say, 'Who's counting?' That's awful. But it's true. There's a lot about the absurdity of wealth. I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it. I think if you're really lucky, who's counting?\"",

                "body": "They are the latest services offered by an industry that has been around for some time. Websites like Upwork, which started in 2003, allow customers to hire freelancers of all kinds, including personal assistants. TaskRabbit came along in 2008, connecting customers to helpers in the neighborhood.\n\nFor personal assistance on an even tighter budget, there are companies like Fiverr, which hires freelancers around the world, resulting in lower prices, though perhaps a slightly more alienated feeling.\n\nI tried a few of these services. Here's what I found.\n\nOn Day 1 of signing up with Fin, my hopes are high. After reading through the website's live feed of customer requests, I'm convinced that the app can take whatever I throw at it, no matter how obscure the request.\n\nThe first task is my insurance coverage, which is set to expire in a few weeks. It's a prime example of my most dreaded task, the kind I'd normally put off.\n\nFirst on the website chat box, then with voice-to-text on my phone, I ask Fin to look into it and find me the cheapest plan it can. Later in the day, I also ask it for help with shipping my car out of state. I have found one service, but ask if Fin can find something better. Then I sit back, remembering my own days as a personal assistant, thinking how the tide has turned.\n\nBy the end of the day, Fin has given me estimated health insurance quotes and a link to an online insurance website. But when I try to open the link, I have to re-enter all of my information again myself to see anything. Didn't I pay Fin to do this? Later that night and the next morning, Fin sends me car shipping services, but they aren't faster or cheaper than what I'd found myself in a few minutes of quick research.\n\nI get frustrated and decided to do the job myself on my commute. About 45 minutes later, I have found a faster shipping service and booked it. All of Fin's calls and emails on my behalf start to feel like halfhearted busywork.\n\nLater that second morning, I consider giving Fin one last task but decide to check my balance first. The problem is, I can't find it anywhere. One long search later, I do find it and my jaw drops. Fin says it spent 215 minutes on the requests, and with an initial free 60 minutes deducted, is going to charge me $181.\n\nI call customer service, which eventually reviews my case and says Fin should have kept me more informed about the time it was spending. They give me a 100-minute credit.\n\nI begin trying Magic around the same time as Fin. I'm feeling sick, so I ask Magic to schedule me a last-minute doctor's appointment for the same day. It's both a challenging request and something I really don't want to do myself. Magic promises encryption for personal data, so I feel comfortable giving it my health insurance and personal information. It tells me it'll check back with me in 35 minutes.\n\nMy doctor isn't available for at least two weeks, so Magic ends up finding me an appointment at an urgent care center. In the end, Magic hands the task back to me -- the doctor's office won't let it schedule the appointment for me because of privacy concerns. But Magic does tell me who to call, and that I can see a doctor that day. Since I'm already stressed and feeling sick, I find that Magic's help does actually feel helpful. At least it got the process started.\n\nAfter my experiences with Fin and Magic, I'm ready to try something low risk. I search around on Fiverr and find a virtual personal assistant named Rex, based in Nigeria, who charges $10 an hour and has five-star reviews.\n\nWith Rex, I decide to start with a non-research task: listing some items I want to sell on eBay. But right away, we run into problems. It's raining hard in Lagos, where Rex is based, and his internet keeps going out. Once the rain eases up, I give him my eBay login information, but before long, eBay has noticed the unusual activity on my account and shuts it down.\n\nAfter we solve that issue, Rex needs my PayPal information, and I remember a conversation with Mr. Chen about protecting personal information. Magic and Fin guarantee security with data encryption, but Rex is working on his home computer. He keeps reassuring me it's fine, but I decide to switch up the task. Instead, I ask him to research the amount of time I have to find new health insurance. He sends me snapshots of the Covered California website that I don't find very helpful, but we part on good terms.\n\nAfter searching the online freelancer marketplace, I selected a Florida-based \"personal virtual assistant\" named Corin because of her 100 percent job success rating, and her low hourly rate ($20). In only a few hours, she accepts my invitation to do the job. With my budget running low, I decide to offer Corin as much as I think she could possibly do in one short hour: check on a medical insurance rule for me, call my bank about my car loan, list the items I still want to sell on eBay.\n\nBefore half the hour had passed, Corin has already sent me a Google doc answering my first two questions, and following up about my eBay products. By the end of the hour, she hasn't listed everything but tells me she'll finish the task for no extra charge. For the first time in the experiment, I actually do trust my virtual personal assistant to get things done without draining my wallet.\n\nAs the experiment drew to a close, I realized that my initial mistakes had come from the fact that I wanted a personal assistant to do my work, but I didn't necessarily anticipate the work of managing a personal assistant. Would I use some of them again? Probably. But as Mr. Lessin said: \"We always talk about what we're competing with, and what we're competing with is people doing tasks themselves.\"",

On her first day of work, she was coerced into posing half-naked on his floor -- afraid to object \"for fear of the consequences.\" Should she continue to work for the artist, or quit and face unemployment?\n\nThe lawyer and organizer Saru Jayaraman joins the Sugars to discuss the power dynamics between low-paid employees and the people who sexually harass them. \"Harassment is not about individual actions, it's about systemic situations of structural power,\" Ms. Jayaraman explains. \"We need women to feel supported, we need them to be able to stand up for themselves, and we need to change laws and policies that create these systems in the first place.\"\n\nMs. Jayaraman is the co-founder and president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and the director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.

                "body": "Discussing her career rise -- from a design department assistant at David Yurman to overseeing her own atelier in Germantown, a small town along the Hudson in upstate New York -- Ms. MacGill credits her father as the key motivating figure.\n\nAfter graduating from Brown University, when her friends were taking off for Europe, Mr. MacGill encouraged his daughter to work for Mr. Yurman. Then he lent her his garage when she decided to strike out on her own and design jewelry. And Mr. MacGill provided his daughter with her first big break.\n\nIt was an introduction to Kazuko Oshima. A muse to Mr. Frank, Ms. Oshima, the Japanese-born polymath (who died in 2007), became a darling of the downtown New York art world after Madonna wore a lace veil she had crafted in the video of the 1984 hit single, \"Like A Virgin.\" Bianca Jagger was among the fashion icons who flocked to Barneys New York to buy the one-off pieces that Ms. Oshima created by twisting gold wire around semiprecious stones. \"I was 14,\" Ms. MacGill said with a laugh, recalling when she realized, over tea with Ms. Oshima, that jewelry was definitely her calling.\n\n\"We had a serious conversation,\" she added. \"Kazuko said she would introduce me to her gold vendor and her bead vendor. I still work with them. Kazuko set me up.\"\n\nThe path to Venyx, Ms. Niarchos's opulent fine jewelry brand (she derived its name by merging Venus and onyx) came from her childhood friend, Gaia Repossi. As creative director of Repossi (jeweler to the House of Grimaldi), Ms. Repossi commissioned Ms. Niarchos to create two collections in 2007.\n\nThe experience prompted Ms. Niarchos, who had studied fashion and interned for John Galliano, to apprentice in the fine jewelry department of Christie's in New York. She also studied at the London branch of the Gemological Institute of America.\n\nWhile the training provided a technical foundation, master paintings and modern art seem to be the creative fuel of Venyx. Ms. Niarchos, however, is somewhat tight-lipped discussing her family's collection, possibly because of its magnificence and value.\n\nIn 1957 Ms. Niarchos's grandfather, the shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos, bought what has been called the greatest collection of French Impressionists ever assembled by an American, the Warner Bros.' actor Edward G. Robinson -- prompting Vogue to refer to his homes as museums. El Greco's \"Pietà\" and \"St. Peter\" hung in Mr. Niarchos's New York apartment, while Degas' \"Dancer\" -- along with canvases by Gauguin, Manet, Renoir and Rouault -- were on his three-masted-schooner, the Creole.\n\nMs. Niarchos's father, Philip Niarchos, has significantly increased the value of the collection with his own additions, including self-portraits by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Van Gogh.\n\n\"I never sit down and think about it, but, somehow, there will always be an artistic reference on my mood board,\" Ms. Niarchos said, referring to the inspirational images she collects at the start of her design process.\n\nFor example, Van Gogh's \"The Starry Night,\" inspired lustrous star-shaped jewels in her 2014 Theiya collection. A Dan Flavin fluorescent light piece proved the motivation for the glow-in-the-dark enamel that lends an otherworldly quality to Oseanyx, a 2015 collection inspired by aquatic life and outer space.\n\nIn her 2017 Elementa collection, Ms. Niarchos's credits her admiration of Monet's shimmering Houses of Parliament series for her use of vibrant stones, including carnelians, fire opals, orange sapphires and amethysts.\n\nAnd a trio of Elementa necklaces, showcasing striking intarsias (polished stones set within marble), appear to be miniature masterpieces.\n\nBut Ms. Niarchos said she discovered the intarsias at the Tucson Gem, Mineral and Fossil Showcase, an annual trade fair in Arizona that she attends in Arizona, and then created the precious metal and gemstone frames: \"I thought it would be nice to wear a little painting around your neck.\"\n\nThe first jewelry Ms. Sheibani designed were gold brooches that also resembled picture frames.\n\nThe designs, now a motif in her collection of bold 18-karat pieces, were motivated by her memory of a pin, a small Picasso etching encased in gold. Claude Picasso, the artist's son and legal administrator of his estate, gave it to Mrs. Sheibani's mother, Christine Bischofberger.\n\nMrs. Sheibani's father is Bruno Bischofberger, the Swiss art dealer generally credited with introducing Pop Art and Neo-Expressionism in Europe and propelling the career of Gerhard Richter.\n\nHe represented Mr. Basquiat (with whom Mrs. Sheibani painted as a child) and Mr. Warhol, with whom he co-founded Interview magazine. And he has opened his own museum outside Zurich to showcase his collection of furniture by Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Frank Lloyd Wright, Eileen Gray and Jean Prouvé, which W magazine has called the world's most extensive.\n\n\"I loved making jewelry always,\" Mrs. Sheibani said. \"The first money I ever earned, from working in my father's gallery, I put half in the bank and spent the other half on a Roman and Greek bronze ring which I wore every day, for like, five years.\n\n\"Looking at art has influenced me -- 100 percent,\" she added. \"But I'm not copying anything. I just love color and interesting shapes.\"\n\nIf there is a forerunner -- or inspirational figurehead -- to this band of designers, it is another Picasso offspring, Paloma Picasso. She once described her childhood with her father: \"I used to spend hours drawing next to him.\"\n\nChanneling this experience into jewelry making, Ms. Picasso trained as a goldsmith, studied jewelry design and made her first pieces for Yves Saint Laurent, who credited her flair (which relied on inventively mixing vintage flea market finds as well as turbans and red lipstick), for inspiring the '40s flair of his spring 1971 Scandal collection.\n\nIn the early '70s, Tiffany & Company noticed her after a limited-edition collection of weighty gold necklaces and bracelets for the Greek jeweler Zolotas regenerated the brand.\n\nIn 1979, it introduced her namesake Tiffany line, which continues to thrive.\n\nThis year she turns 69, and her natural successors seem to be among this group of female jewelry powerhouses.",

                "body": "Expanding the flagship into what had been an antique jewelry shop didn't seem to be the right move. \"It's intimate but not very welcoming,\" Ms. Schwarzer said about the ultraglamorous, Peter Marino-designed space. \"As a luxury, high-jewelry brand, we can be a bit intimidating.\"\n\nIt decided the answer lay in the Old Curiosity Shop. Back in fin-de-siècle Rome, Mr. Bulgari had picked the name of Charles Dickens's novel in hopes of attracting well-heeled British and American tourists in the Eternal City. \"Sotirio Bulgari didn't want to only attract Italians,\" Ms. Schwarzer said. \"He already knew then that he wanted Bulgari to be international.\"\n\nBut rather than a Victorian cabinet of curiosities, his was a paean to objects collected on his travels: jewelry, of course, but also silver buttons, glass perfume bottles and objects etched with the Islamic and Byzantine motifs that then were all the rage. The Old Curiosity Shop was a temple for the inquisitive, imaginative and well-traveled -- and a profile that, more than a century later and some 300 boutiques on, was not far from the Bulgari customer of today.\n\nSo the New Curiosity Shop was born, playing on Mr. Bulgari's founding ideas of discovery and inspiration, most notably by changing the shop's theme, décor and products every six months. \"Bulgari has over 130 years of history, and with each change, we can reveal a piece of this history in a younger, modern way,\" Ms. Schwarzer said. \"It's about curiosity -- and curiosity is never static.\"\n\nVisitors to the shop first encounter a stylish mirrored gold bar, its surface doubling as a touch-screen interface to information about the Bulgari brand. During a visit in February, customers were seated around it, casually trying on jewelry, watches and handbags they had taken from the displays and glass drawers. (There are shop assistants but they don't seem to spend a lot of time guarding product-filled vitrines, like the salespeople of yesterday.)\n\nIn one drawer was an archive picture of Mr. Bulgari; in another, a piece from Bulgari's heritage collection: a round gold cigarette lighter from the '80s.\n\nHanging above was an impressive, custom-made chandelier by the Murano glassmakers Venini -- which took eight people to install -- and hip dance music played.\n\nBehind the bar was a room Ms. Schwarzer called \"Italian hospitality,\" where '40s-era Guglielmo Ulrich tables and chairs, upholstered in funky contemporary fabrics, offered a place to have a drink while browsing Bulgari books, or signature collections like B.zero1 rings or ceramic Serpenti watches.\n\nThe third, and final, room was dedicated to personalization -- that millennial power word -- where visitors can order customized Bulgari handbags. The choice of leathers, clasps and straps are stored in a wall of brass-fronted cabinets that, again, are open to all.\n\nIt was exciting to think that in six months, the entire shop will look entirely different.\n\nThe debut theme was Mirabilia, Latin for marvels, interpreted by Bulgari in futuristic, outer-space decorations. Nestled among the products were handmade paper artworks of planets and astronauts, which Bulgari commissioned from the young Italian artist Mauro Seresini. And there was an installation of furniture and the whimsical black-and-white portrait plates by Maison Fornasetti.\n\nTo increase the sense of exclusivity, Bulgari also will be creating one-off collections for each theme.\n\nMirabilia's selection included a necklace and ring set of diamonds, blue topaz and tanzanite in its Divas' Dream style, which was displayed alongside the handwritten label: \"Only in R*me Exclusivity.\"\n\nAlso sold only in the shop: a special Condotti10 jewelry line featuring a pink-gold bracelet and matching ring with interior design elements from both the flagship and New Curiosity Shop: graphic circles, stars and squares set in diamond pavé, malachite and mother-of-pearl. Prices are on request.\n\nThere also is a limited-edition watch, a Serpenti Twist Your Time design featuring interchangeable pink and blue metallic wraparound leather straps. The 20 timepieces were spread among several Bulgari stores.\n\nBulgari actually doesn't know precisely where the original Old Curiosity Shop was located along the street, or even when it closed.\n\n\"In Bulgari there is still a lot we don't know,\" Ms. Schwarzer said. \"Every time we discover past pieces or special collections, there is something from our history that we find out.\"",

                "title": "Charmed, We're Sure",
                "body": "The house's charm bracelets range from a glittering diamond, ruby, tanzanite and emerald trinket bracelet for Net-a-Porter.com to a bracelet with charms honoring Shiva, the Hindu god, which Tribe by Amrapali introduced in February. It sold out online almost immediately; there are plans to restock it.\n\nEven the way people wear charm bracelets has changed.\n\n\"It's all about stacking,\" Ms. Petersson said. \"We see charm bracelets being worn with Cartier Love bangles, ID bracelets -- and in the summer, it's multiple colorful bangles to complement their tans.\"\n\nThe vintage aspect of the style has had an attraction, too, especially as, auction house representatives noted, charm bracelets don't often appear in sales.\n\n\"Their popularity at auction tends to flow with two things, fashion and gold price,\" Kristian Spofforth, head of Sotheby's London jewelry sales, wrote in an email. \"The price of gold has also been quite high over the last few years, and charm bracelets tend to be solid gold.\"\n\n(The house's Fine Jewelry sale March 20 listed a Van Cleef & Arpels bracelet with five diamond-set charms, including a racing dog and an airplane.)\n\nAt Christie's Magnificent Jewels sale in December, Mamie Eisenhower's 14-karat gold curb link bracelet with 21 charms, depicting her marriage, World War II and her husband's presidential election victory, sold for $20,000. The sales estimate was $4,000 to $6,000.\n\nMrs. Eisenhower was hardly the only public figure to love charm bracelets. Queen Victoria sparked a 19th-century craze with hers, including one with 16 oval- and heart-shaped lockets enameled in black on gold that is in the Royal Collection. In Hollywood, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis and Natalie Wood were photographed with theirs.\n\nFrom a jewelry designer's standpoint, the challenge of creating a charm is considerable.\n\nAs Andrea Buccellati, creative director and president, pointed out about his house's multigold and diamond Macri Classica bracelet featuring a Renaissance-style rosette on a round disc: \"The back has to be finished exactly like the front because as it moves, you see both sides, so it is not nice to see one side nice and the other not finished.\"\n\nFor its charm bracelets, Loquet London had tiny details like the antennas of its scarab charm filed by hand, \"to make it true to the drawing,\" said Sheherazade Goldsmith, who founded the house with Laura Bailey.\n\nBut the style also offers creative joys. Charles de Viel Castel, the New York-based private equity financier and founder of CVC Stones, said, \"it is more playful, designing charm bracelets.\"\n\nHis first charm bracelet collection -- created with Leandra Medine, the fashion blogger and founder of Man Repeller -- was introduced in July. It continued his hallmark style of setting diamonds into stones collected on beaches from Greece to Argentina but added coral, pink sapphires and more.\n\n\"I could do a lot more diamonds and precious stones on the charms than there are on our regular stones as the gemstones are smaller,\" he said, \"and I liked the idea of finding a stone that would work on both sides, so not only the side you are wearing it but the other side, too.\"\n\nHe also added clips to his charms, so they can be easily removed and added to other jewelry or chains.\n\nCarolina Bucci, the Italian-born and London-based designer, has a similar approach. \"Charms always push me to have fun with fine jewelry so I have to keep coming up with new offers for new charms,\" she said, like creating bracelets of colorful beads like bamboo coral or white jade interspersed with charms. Or contrasting spiky star charms with round freshwater pearls: \"Putting two things that almost don't go together, together,\" she said.\n\nShe also has done a take on the cotton friendship bracelets of her childhood, recreating them in an 18-karat gold diamond-cut chain braided with colored silks, which the wearer then ties in a double knot to secure. The bracelets are finished with charms like balloons, palm trees and an evil eye amulet.\n\nWhen it comes to trends, charm bracelets even stand up to the gender-fluid style of recent fashion.\n\n\"Even men wear a lot of these bracelets around the wrist, whether in silver or black and gold with dead heads or bones,\" said Caroline Scheufele, Chopard's artistic director and co-president.\n\nShe was wearing a prototype of the Happy Heart charm bracelet, which wraps four times around the wrist, that Chopard will be introducing at the Baselworld fair this week.\n\nAnd, in the future? There are, she said, \"more fun things coming up.\"\n\nWe asked some fans of charm bracelets and charms about their favorites. Their replies have been edited.\n\nAn art consultant, curator and owner of Poderi di Capo d'Uomo wine and property estate in Italy\n\nMy favorite charms are from Pomellato. They are a yellow-gold sun and moon; a little dolphin in rose gold; labrador's head, as I had a lab in the past; and a starfish that is blue and yellow gold. I wear them on a rose-gold Pomellato bracelet in winter, for a more formal look and a bright pink leather bracelet in the summer. They are small, cute and sophisticated and I wear them altogether. I also inherited a gold chain bracelet from my grandmother with several charms. I love the sphere with little stones all around because it's full of color and a perfect circle, so there was lots of hard work involved. There's also a traffic light with a red ruby, yellow semiprecious stone and an emerald, which I find so contemporary as well. I wear it a lot during the winter in the evening with a cocktail dress or smart jacket. It comes from my grandmother so it is like having that person near that I love. I also wear a Prada robot on my simple black Prada bag or light pink Fendi Peekaboo bag. It's fun because the robot has fur and very cheering. It's a very nice detail which adds color and makes the difference on an otherwise simple bag.\n\nThe British actress, recently of the TV series \"Peaky Blinders\" and \"Fearless\"\n\nDame Judi Dench gave me my sea gull as a brooch on the first night I played Nina in Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" and she was playing Arkadina early in my career. And now every first night I will always pin it somewhere in my costume to still give me good luck. I wear it inside of a pocket so I know it's there but the audience never sees it.\n\nThe founder of The Perfumer's Story, a fragrance line based in London\n\nI've collected charms since I was 7 as I was fascinated with anything that glittered. My charms are quirky and eccentric like the Rich Tea biscuit by True Rocks, which has a bite taken out of it, which I wear on a bracelet and as a necklace. I bought it last year when the designers had a mini pop-up at the Groucho Club as I love these biscuits and ate packets when I was pregnant so means something to me.\n\nA shareholder in her family's Basaltina stone quarry in Italy\n\nI wear my Bulgari sun charm every time I travel, on a Bulgari necklace. It's a lucky charm and every time I wear it I feel empowered. When I wear it for professional reasons I wear it with a suit, and being yellow gold with diamonds, it's a chic, sophisticated accessory and brings glamour to every suit and a feminine touch. I bought it on a trip to the Caribbean with cuff links for my husband. I also wear a white gold and diamonds Chantecler bell as a necklace when I ski.\n\nA junior specialist in jewelry at Bonhams New York\n\nI have been collecting charms for my silver bracelet since I was a child. I can turn the wheels of the little roller blades and can turn the bucket in the wishing well; I like the mechanical ones. Most are gifts from my mother and the rest I've bought. I saved up my pocket money during a family trip to Disneyland when I was 10 to buy a Magic Kingdom charm.\n\nManaging editor, Because Magazine\n\nI have no idea what the charm is in my ear as it is a woven abstract shape. It's like a hanging half-circle in gold braiding with little things hanging from it, which dance around as I walk. It is purely decorative and I liked the idea of having something charm-like in my ear and close to my face because it is at eye level. I wear it when I want to peacock a little bit.",

They all whipped out their smartphones -- and tapped the KiraKira+ icon, the wildly popular app that adds twinkling effects to iPhone and Android pictures and videos.\n\n\"I remember when friends on the front row first started using KiraKira+ last season, we were all completely obsessed and wanted to know what it was and how we could use it too,\" said Doina Ciobanu, a model and fashion blogger based in London who has 372,000 followers on Instagram. Her sparkle-enhanced content proved a huge hit, she added, and she has used the app regularly, particularly for jewelry posts.\n\n\"I think people are always looking for something new and fun that can make their pictures really stand out,\" Ms. Ciobanu said. \"KiraKira+ helps users do that, and is particularly female orientated, given how pretty and dreamy it makes everything look.\"\n\nKiraKira, which means sparkly in Japanese, was introduced in 2015 by Kentaro Yama. He created the app as a side project to his full-time job at Tha Ltd., an interactive design studio in Tokyo. But after its enthusiastic adoption last fall by Eva Chen, Instagram's head of fashion partnerships, its success has been stratospheric.\n\nAt 99 cents in the Apple iOS store, it's now rated as the second most-popular app in the American store's Photo & Video group.",

                "body": "When they approached François Curiel, Christie's' chairman for Europe and Asia, with the idea, he agreed.\n\n\"I immediately said, 'What can we do to help you?' \" Mr. Curiel said. \"The more people there will be in Geneva the better for us. Even if they're not all buying at auction, it will create a buzz in the city.\" He added that Christie's is supporting the fair with a GemGenève booth at its Geneva preview as well as coverage in its magazine and auction catalogs.\n\nThere are many art fairs, Mr. Curiel said, \"but not so many for jewelry. With 100 exhibitors of such high quality, I think the chances of success are very good.\"\n\nDavid Bennett, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's international jewelry division, also was supportive. \"It will further enhance Geneva's position as a major hub in the worldwide jewelry and precious stones markets for amateurs and professionals alike,\" he said.\n\nThe idea originated last February, when Mr. Faerber and Mr. Totah considered alternatives to Baselworld.\n\nMr. Faerber, a Baselworld exhibitor since 1973, said antique and gem dealers had felt increasingly marginalized by its organizers, with hard-to-find exhibition locations and high costs. After talking with the organizers last year, \"we finally understood we couldn't get any further,\" Mr. Faerber said.\n\nBaselworld's organizers said it would not be affected by GemGenève.\n\n\"We consider the concept of Baselworld -- showcasing the best of the industry in all its diversity -- the most promising solution and agree about this with the globally most important players in the gemstone market, who will participate in Baselworld 2018 again,\" Christian Jürgens, a spokesman from Baselworld's press agency, said in an email.\n\nThe event has shortened its run to six days, March 22 to 27, from the eight-day schedule of previous years. And, 650 exhibitors are expected, compared with the 1,300 who participated in 2017.\n\nThe majority of the GemGenève exhibitors are not shifting from Baselworld.\n\nMartin Travis, the founder of Symbolic and Chase, an antique jewelry dealer in London, has not exhibited in Switzerland previously. He has shown at several art and trade fairs, including Masterpiece London and others in Miami and Las Vegas.\n\nHe said he was attracted to GemGenève because he saw it as an opportunity to form alliances with Swiss dealers he did not know and to present to an international clientele already focused on buying jewelry.\n\n\"There is a glut of shows,\" Mr. Travis said. \"We're focusing on the ones that present new opportunities for us.\"\n\nFor Hannah Martin, a contemporary jeweler based in London, seeing serious spenders who are serious about jewelry also is an important part of the event's appeal.\n\n\"I'm not interested in wholesale,\" the designer said. \"This is much more about the collector's market.\"\n\nShe will be part of the fair's Designer Showcase, a select group of private jewelers from around the world selected by Vivienne Becker, a jewelry historian and writer.\n\nMr. Faerber said the fair's priority would be serving a professional audience, but he said he believed it was important to follow the lead of trade fairs such as the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie and Baselworld in opening to the public as well.\n\n\"In this fast-paced world, we have to open up a little bit,\" he said, noting that when he started in the '70s, the lines separating dealer, retailer and client were never crossed.\n\n\"If you still follow the rules that everyone used to, you end up being the only one.\"",

                "body": "PARIS -- The French jeweler Robert Goossens, who died in 2016, isn't exactly a household name; his clientele, however, included some of the most renowned designers of the last century, including Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Cristóbal Balenciaga.\n\nAt the moment though, the profile of Goossens Paris, the brand he founded in 1950, is growing, as part of a strategy steered by Mr. Goossens' son Patrick, its artistic director, and Chanel, which purchased the company in 2005.\n\n\"We had this idea a few years ago that we developed very slowly with Patrick, to give more visibility to the brand,\" Bruno Pavlovsky, president of fashion at Chanel, said. \"We decided to treat Goossens as a start-up and to relaunch the story, being able to capitalize on the DNA.\"\n\nLast year, Barneys New York began carrying a selection of items from the collection; it has been part of Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche's jewelry assortment since February 2016. In late 2015, a sleek Goossens Paris boutique opened on Rue Saint-Honoré, stocked with jewelry as well as the brand's tabletop items, like a thick curved glass dish nestled on top of an ornately tooled metal base that is priced at slightly less than $1,000. Furniture, from small items to large chandeliers and tables, has always been part of the brand's assortment.\n\nGoossens Paris is part of Chanel's Métiers d'Art group of acquisitions, which consists of specialized heritage brands like Lesage, the embroidery house founded in 1924, and Maison Michel, which has made hats since the 1930s. Its look has essentially stayed the same since its inception: Pieces are earthy, tactile and bold, usually combining metal with both semiprecious and costume stones.\n\nOne popular style, an extra-wide cuff based on a style owned by Ms. Chanel, epitomizes the aesthetic. It is encrusted with dramatic stones of deeply pigmented rock crystal and garnet in a cross pattern; it makes a statement but is casual enough to be worn with sportswear on a Sunday afternoon. The bracelet on which the stones sit is made from brass coated with 24-karat gold, a metal blend that's prevalent in the collection; at $1,500, it costs less than might be expected considering its size, materials and craftsmanship.",

                "title": "At Swedish Preschool, Boys Learn to Dance and Girls Learn to Yell",
                "body": "For instance, the children at these schools do not show a strong preference for playmates of the same gender, and are less likely to make assumptions based on stereotypes. Yet, the scientists found no difference at all in the children's' tendency to notice gender, suggesting that may be under a genetic influence.\n\nAt the Seafarer's Preschool, the effort sometimes has the feeling of a venture into uncharted territory.\n\nOn a recent Friday in Hammarbyhojden, south of Stockholm, Elis Storesund, the school's in-house gender expert, sat bent over a work sheet with two teachers of the 4- and 5-year-old Seagulls, reviewing their progress on gender objectives.\n\n\"When we are drawing,\" said Melisa Esteka, 31, one of the teachers, \"we see that the girls -- they draw a lot -- they draw girls with lots of makeup and long eyelashes. It's very clear that they are girls. We ask, 'Don't boys have eyelashes?' And they say, 'We know it is not like that in real life.'\"\n\nMs. Storesund, 54, nodded thoughtfully. \"They are trying to understand what it is to be a girl,\" she said.\n\nMs. Esteka looked frustrated. She had set a goal for herself: To stop the children from identifying things as \"for girls\" or \"for boys.\" But lately, her students were absorbing stereotypes from billboards and cartoons, and sometimes it seemed like all the slow, systematic work of the Seafarer's Preschool was flying away overnight.\n\n\"There is so much they bring with them,\" she said. \"They bring the whole world with them. We can't stop that from happening.\"\n\nSweden's experiment in gender-neutral preschools began in 1996 in Trodje, a small town near the edge of the Baltic Sea. The man who started it, Ingemar Gens, was not an educator but a journalist who dabbled in anthropology and gender theory, having studied Swedish men seeking mail-order brides in Thailand. Newly appointed as a district \"equal opportunity expert,\" Mr. Gens wanted to break down the norm of stoic, unemotional Swedish masculinity.\n\nPreschool struck him as the right place to do this. Swedish children spend much of their early life in government-funded preschools, which offer care at nominal cost for up to 12 hours a day starting at the age of 1.\n\nTwo schools rolled out a what was called a compensatory gender strategy. Boys and girls at the preschools were separated for part of the day and coached in traits associated with the other gender. Boys massaged each other's feet. Girls were led in barefoot walks in the snow, and told to throw open the window and scream.\n\n\"We tried to do that -- to educate boys in what girls already knew, and vice versa,\" said Mr. Gens, now 68. A wave of criticism broke over him, but that was expected.\n\n\"They said we were indoctrinating the kids,\" he said. \"I say we're always indoctrinating kids. Bringing them up is indoctrination.\"\n\nTeachers were required to review videotapes of themselves with the children, to identify subtle differences in the way they interacted with boys and girls. Many found that they used more words, and more complex sentences, with girls.\n\nHelena Baggstrom, who taught at one of the schools, recalled watching footage of herself in a cloakroom, attending to children as they bundled up to go outside. She saw, to her shock, that she had helped one boy after another get dressed and run out the door. The girls, she realized, were expected to dress themselves.\n\n\"It was hard at first to see patterns,\" she said. \"We saw more and more, and we were horrified at what we saw.\"\n\nThe strategy of separating boys and girls was later set aside in favor of a \"gender neutral\" approach intent on muting differences. Still, the spirit of Mr. Gens's experiment had percolated through the government. In 1998, Sweden added new language to its national curriculum requiring that all preschools \"counteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns\" and encourage children to explore \"outside the limitations of stereotyped gender roles.\" Adoption of the practices varies widely, depending on the school's director.\n\nTraditionalists have raised occasional protests, complaining of liberal brainwashing. The far-right Sweden Democrats party, which won about 13 percent of the vote in 2014, has promised to roll back teaching that \"seeks to change all children and young people's behavior and gender identity.\"\n\nBut in a political environment deeply split over immigration, gender-equality policies enjoy the support of Sweden's largest parties, the center-left Social Democrats and the center-right Moderates.\n\nA columnist and mathematician named Tanja Bergkvist, one of the few figures who routinely attacks what she calls \"Sweden's gender madness,\" says many Swedes are uncomfortable with the practice but are afraid to criticize it in public.\n\n\"They don't want to be regarded as against equality,\" she said. \"Nobody wants to be against equality.\"\n\nIn Trodje, the first wave of preschoolers to attend gender-neutral preschools are now 20-somethings.\n\nElin Gerdin, 26, part of that first wave, is studying to be a teacher. In appearance she is conventionally feminine, her long dark hair coaxed into spirals with a curling iron. This is something she points out -- that in appearance she is conventionally feminine. It is the first sign that she views gender as something you could put on or take off, like a raincoat.\n\n\"This is a choice I have made because this is me,\" she said of her appearance. \"And this is me because I am a product of society.\"\n\nThere are moments when her early education comes back to her in flashes.\n\nMs. Gerdin's friends have begun to have babies, and they post pictures of them on Facebook, swathed in blue or pink, in society's first act of sorting. Ms. Gerdin gets upset when this happens. She feels sorry for the children. She makes it a point to seek her friends out and tell them, earnestly, that they are making a mistake. This feels to her like a responsibility.\n\n\"We are a group of children who will grow up, and we will have children, and we will talk to them about this,\" she said. \"It is not easy to change a whole society.\"\n\nThat process was just beginning at the Seafarer's Preschool on a recent morning, when the children scrambled out of voluminous snowsuits. Underneath his, Otto, a sturdy 3-year-old, was wearing a dress.\n\nOtto prefers to wear dresses because he likes the way they fan out when he spins around, and it does not make him unusual here. Up until now, no one in Otto's life -- not his grandparents, or babysitters, or fellow 3-year-olds -- has told him that boys do not wear dresses, said his mother, Lena Christiansson, 36, matter-of-factly. She would like this to continue as long as possible.\n\nThis expectation has become increasingly common, said Ms. Storesund, the Seafarer's gender specialist.\n\n\"Now, parents ask us, 'What are you doing about gender?'\" she said.\n\nMs. Storesund is on hand to confront classroom dilemmas: When boys in the group for 3-year-olds refused to paint, or dance, and the group threatened to split along gender lines, she was brought in to unpack the problem, tinkering with the activities until she coaxed the boys back to equal participation.\n\nPreserving a gender-neutral environment is not simple. Carina Sevebjork Saur, 57, who has been teaching at the school for a year and a half, said she often catches herself saying the wrong thing, like an offhand compliment on a child's appearance.\n\n\"You are on your way to saying something, as a reflex, but you have to hold it back,\" she said. \"You can comment on clothes in other ways: 'Oh, my goodness, how many polka dots!'\"\n\nThe effort is compensated, teachers said, by the impression that they are unraveling mysteries, and as spring approached, some changes could be observed among the Penguins.\n\nOne of the group's teachers, Izabell Sandberg, 26, noticed a shift in a 2-year-old girl whose parents dropped her off wearing tights and pale-pink dresses. The girl focused intently on staying clean. If another child took her toys, she would whimper.\n\n\"She accepted everything,\" Ms. Sandberg said. \"And I thought this was very girlie. It was like she was apologizing for taking up space.\"\n\nUntil, that is, a recent morning, when the girl had put a hat on and carefully arranged bags around herself, preparing to set off on an imaginary expedition. When a classmate tried to walk off with one of her bags, the girl held out the palm of her hand and shouted \"No\" at such a high volume that Ms. Sandberg's head swiveled around.\n\nIt was something they had been practicing.\n\nBy the time March rolled round, the girl had gotten so loud that she drowned out the boys in the class, Ms. Sandberg said. At the end of the day, she was messy. The girl's parents were less than delighted, she said, and reported that she had become cheeky and defiant at home.\n\nBut Ms. Sandberg has plenty of experience explaining the mission to parents.\n\n\"This is what we do here, and we are not going to stop it,\" she said.",

                "title": "At Hemmerle, Medals Inspire an Anniversary Collection of Jewelry",
                "body": "\"We've tried to use all the Hemmerle classics to bridge the gap between now and then: the materials of today with the design of before,\" said Yasmin Hemmerle, who runs the company with her husband, Christian, the great-grandson of one of the founders, and his parents, Stefan and Sylveli. (The family members share all the work, so no one has the kind of business or creative titles common in other jewelry houses.)\n\nFor years they had skirted tubs full of the stamps that were stored in the cellar of the workshop, not far from the boutique.\n\nIt was only when they thought about making the medal designs the basis of the anniversary collection that they hired a historian.\n\nThe historian, who did not want to be named, said he had been collecting Hemmerle medals since he was 7 years old. He told them to look for a ledger, noting which stamps were used for which decorations, as well as proof sheets of the stamps' designs.\n\nA treasure hunt followed and, along with the ledger, they finally discovered a large box full of cards listing the medals and the corresponding stamps attached with wire. \"It felt like Christmas,\" Ms. Hemmerle, 34, said with a smile.\n\nThe most striking jewels in the anniversary collection -- which has nine earring designs, a bangle and a brooch -- are the Pegasus earrings. They depict the winged horse of Greek mythology in pavé diamonds, flying gracefully across a night sky of midnight-blue anodized aluminum.\n\nThe Pegasus motif originated with a tiny iron stamp once used for the arts medal of the Maximiliansorden, an order established in the 1800s by King Maximilian II of Bavaria to recognize outstanding achievements in science and art. Hemmerle started making the decoration in 1905, and the medal, held by a maximum of 100 people at any time, is one of only two it still produces for the Bavarian government.\n\nLike most of Hemmerle's creations, the earrings started with a rudimentary sketch. Despite the modernity of its aesthetic, Hemmerle rejects computer-aided design. \"The lines all look the same if created by computer, no matter the house designing them,\" said Christian Hemmerle, 37.\n\nInstead, the Hemmerles trust their 22 artisans to interpret what they want into hard metals and gemstones. \"Our sketches are a language that the goldsmiths must decipher. They're our hieroglyphics,\" said Ms. Hemmerle, who was born in Egypt.\n\nHer birthplace inspired an Egyptian collection by Hemmerle in 2012, and, in October, the house will present a second anniversary collection based on its hoard of ancient Egyptian faiences, at the art and jewelry event Tefaf New York Fall.\n\nSince 1904, Hemmerle's headquarters and shop has been on Maximilianstrasse, which commands some of the highest commercial rents in Germany and is home to international luxury companies including Cartier, Gucci and Dior.\n\nThe workshop, on a quiet street nearby, houses its goldsmiths and stone setters. Inside, the jewelers' benches were designed to be broader than traditional ones to maximize their flexibility for work, and drills can be attached with magnets for easy use.\n\nOutside the main workshop, along a corridor of whitewashed walls and checkerboard floor tiles, stands a wire puller, an apparatus used to create gold wire that might be found in any jewelry studio. The difference here is that the tool was created by Sebastian Hepp, a Munich-based artist and metalsmith who creates only one such piece every four years. Its elongated, rigorously minimalistic lines resemble a Donald Judd sculpture, but then, Mr. Hemmerle said, \"beauty has no limitations.\"\n\nThere is a close relationship between the Hemmerles and their craftsmen. \"How our creations come to life depends heavily on the talent in the workshop,\" Mr. Hemmerle said.\n\nGoldsmiths are assigned to create pieces of jewelry, depending on their skills in such areas as intricate filigree or working with a particular metal or kind of wood. And they work on pieces from beginning to end, rather than passing them along a production line.\n\nDiscussions between the artisans and the Hemmerles are constant, so designs evolve along the way (\"Creation is a process,\" Ms. Hemmerle said.)\n\nWhen it came to fixing the diamond-studded Pegasus to the rear of the earring, for example, questions arose about how to disguise the connection. The solution was to depict the constellation of Pegasus on the reverse, blending the connection into the star pattern.\n\nWhile this collection was linked to the anniversary, the Hemmerles usually stand by the tenet that creativity cannot be forced and don't approach their output from a seasonal or commercial point of view.\n\nWhatever is ready goes to the next show they are presenting at, whether in March at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht; the Netherlands, best known as Tefaf; or in October at the London design show PAD. Mr. Hemmerle recently became the only jeweler appointed to Tefaf's board of trustees, following some restructuring.\n\nMr. Hemmerle, who trained at the Gemological Institute of America in New York and as a diamond cutter, said the company had long benefited from the German system of apprenticeship, which involves a three-and-a-half-year placement. Hemmerle's head work-master joined as an apprentice and he now sits alongside the latest apprentice, who has been learning all aspects of goldsmithing and Hemmerle's signature techniques.\n\n\"We invest in our trainees so we want to keep them,\" Mr. Hemmerle said, noting that an advantage of creating one-of-a-kind jewels was that the job continued to be stimulating, so they were more likely to stay.\n\nHemmerle has come a long way from its founding in 1893 by Josef and Anton Hemmerle, brothers who took over a goldsmith's company that specialized in medals and dealt in antique jewelry. Despite having only the Munich shop, it has many private collectors around the world because, in part, of its participation in the international art shows.\n\nMr. Hemmerle said the critical thing was to have a vision shared by the entire family. \"We've always agreed that we want to create one-of-a-kind jewelry that will hopefully one day be exhibited in museums,\" he said -- and the house's works are part of the permanent collections at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nHe added with a smile, \"I found an old advertising card that said, 'We produce ornaments; we work in enamel; and we make repairs for cheap prices.' We've pivoted a little bit since then.\"",

                "title": "Glenn Spiro's 'Personality-Driven' Creations",
                "body": "Mr. Spiro's world now primarily focuses on a core group of 30 to 50 customers for whom he creates one-off pieces based on special stones. The process often takes years. For offbeat white-gold drop earrings, he paired pearls bought more than 10 years apart: one light brown and gray, the other whitish. For a funky cocktail ring, Mr. Spiro set an 8.17-carat cushion-shaped, fancy deep orange-brown diamond that he \"had for ages,\" and only recently surrounded it with a medley of 52 ancient Mesopotamian beads from a specialist dealer.\n\nA sense of old-school discretion and intimacy is Mr. Spiro's business style. His jewelry line, for example, is simply called G. (\"It feels like a signature or stamp of the house, as if you're part of it and will know who G is, I suppose,\" he said.) He has only two points of sale -- Harrods in London and Bergdorf Goodman in New York -- and prefers to meet clients privately in his appointment-only showrooms in Beverly Hills, Calif., and London, or in his Geneva atelier.\n\nThat's not to say, however, that Mr. Spiro avoids making changes. In November, he welcomed Arnaud Bamberger, a luxury veteran and former Cartier executive, as the business's honorary chairman.\n\nThe two men were interviewed recently at Mr. Spiro's London showroom -- an airy upstairs space in a Georgian mansion in the Mayfair neighborhood -- where Mr. Spiro explained how he hopes to tap into Mr. Bamberger's 40-plus years of experience at Cartier, the luxury giant owned by Richemont.\n\n\"Arnaud has seen more things,\" Mr. Spiro said. \"So maybe he tells me, 'Look, if you go this way, you're going to bang your head on the wall, so I'd go the other way.' And I would rather not bang my head on the wall.\"\n\nThe advice has included ideas on new collections and advertising, and finding and introducing new customers.\n\nMr. Bamberger, who was executive chairman of Cartier U.K., seems at ease in his new role. \"Glenn is the artist and the name,\" he said. \"In a very humble way, I can stay in the shadow. I don't need to be in the light; I did that with Cartier. What I want today is to try and help someone I respect, someone who has great vibrations in terms of creativity and vision.\"\n\nOne of the initial attractions for Mr. Bamberger was Mr. Spiro's boundary-pushing use of titanium. During the interview, the jeweler displayed his latest creations in that lightweight metal: two sets of earrings that Mr. Bamberger was seeing for the first time.\n\nThe first, priced at $144,000, was an oversize punk design, with rubies, pink sapphires and diamonds, which threaded through the ear and looked almost like a centipede against it. The second, $72,000 chandelier earrings, had a cosmic quality with stacks of rock crystal, diamonds, blue sapphire globes and sodalite drops.\n\n\"At Cartier we tried to do something with titanium, but it was very difficult,\" Mr. Bamberger said as he examined the blue chandelier design. \"It's a strong metal and very hard to work with, but Glenn does it so light and beautifully.\"\n\n\"This is the future of jewelry,\" he added. \"Of course, gold and platinum are lovely, precious metals, but it's not the most important thing anymore. It's now more the design and the making of jewelry.\"\n\nThe men's first joint project was also G's first watch, a jeweled piece that was displayed this month in the Netherlands at the European Fine Arts Fair, best known as Tefaf, and had its official introduction at Harrods.\n\nFour years in development, the 45-millimeter Reveal watch was fashioned as a lotus flower with eight petals that twist open to unveil a 15-millimeter dial pavéd in the buyer's choice of white diamonds, emeralds, rubies and other stones.\n\nThe case is a mix of titanium and 18-karat gold, and it has a quartz movement by the Swiss makers ETA.\n\nAs a limited edition, only 25 watches will be made in each stone combination; prices range from $150,000 to $185,000.\n\nAlthough the design has typical G elements -- titanium, precision engineering, motifs from nature -- it isn't for everyone, Mr. Spiro said, much like most of his work.\n\n\"We have a style that is personality-driven,\" he said. \"Nine times out of 10, someone asks, who the hell is going to wear that? But somehow a woman walks in, says it looks sensational because it suits her. It's not an easy model, but when it works, it really works.\"\n\nOne such fan is Anastasia Marsaglia, a London resident who said she had amassed \"quite a lot\" of Mr. Spiro's jewelry in the last six years.\n\nShe praised the designer for laboriously tracking down stones whose colors match perfectly, regardless of time, and added that a G creation can often leave one wondering whether it was made in the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s.\n\n\"There is this mystery with Glenn's work, while other designers just have a stamp of who they are,\" Ms. Marsaglia said.\n\nHis pieces are guaranteed to break the ice at a party. \"Both men and women,\" she said, \"whether in Gstaad, Palm Beach, Greece or London -- wherever I am -- will always come over and compliment his jewelry.\"",

New high-jewelry pieces also were to be displayed, part of Chopard's collaboration with Eco Age's Green Carpet Collection initiative.\n\nTo ensure its raw materials are responsibly sourced, Mr. Scheufele said, the brand would use gold from two sources: small mines verified by the Swiss Better Gold Association or refineries certified as meeting the Responsible Jewellery Council's Chain of Custody Standard, which has strict environmental and social guidelines.\n\nBecause Chopard does all of its manufacturing in-house, he added, the brand will be better able than many rivals to oversee its supply chain from sourcing to final product, and to measure Chopard's impact on issues such as environmental and land use, community support, youth education and health care.\n\nThis latest move by the brand, which began its focus on offering ethical and sustainable products in 2013, reflects a broader trend in the luxury industry as consumers demand and expect high standards.",

                "body": "Ms. Deroche had long worked for the fashion house as a press liaison. Now 73, she was part of the team that selected pieces from Mr. Saint Laurent's vast archive to be displayed in Marrakesh, making what she said were \"four or five\" visits to Morocco to complete the job.\n\nFor the accessories displays alone, she said, there were about 20,000 pieces to consider. She made selections with Pierre Bergé, Mr. Saint Laurent's former business and personal partner (who died in September), and the exhibition designer, Christophe Martin.\n\n\"Everything started in 2015,\" Ms. Deroche said during an interview in late February in Paris, surrounded by racks of clothing from the designer's Rive Gauche label. That was when Mr. Bergé asked for her help.\n\n\"It's the first time I've curated, but he knew me very well because I had started working there in 1966 and he knew that I knew a lot\" about the Saint Laurent style, she said.\n\nShe knew, for example, that the designer's taste in jewelry was rarely understated. \"He put a lot on each look,\" Ms. Deroche said. \"Sometimes he would add two or three necklaces at once, or two or three bracelets,\" drawing from house creations overseen for decades by Loulou de La Falaise, one of his many muses. He also worked with houses and craftsmen like Roger Scemama, Paul Caillol, Gripoix and Robert Goossens.\n\n\"Saint Laurent liked accessories very much, but he always said they had to be fake, big and fake,\" Ms. Deroche said. \"He didn't like to play with real diamonds.\"\n\nBut what about, for example, that set of two gold stars dotted with red stones: Surely those are, at least, garnets?\n\n\"Fake, fake, fake,\" Ms. Deroche emphasized. \"He loved that, you know. But he always worked with the top sculptors and real jewelers. These pieces aren't glued, they're encrusted.\"\n\nIn his jewelry creations, Mr. Saint Laurent also favored forms and materials from nature (brooches shaped like doves or sunflowers) and motifs he considered to be lucky (stars, crosses, hearts and four-leaf clovers). Opulence sometimes would be added, like the gold leaf on an African-influenced wooden bracelet.\n\nWheat also was a recurring theme in his pins and bracelets. \"Straw gives you luck and strength,\" Ms. Deroche said. \"So even in his private office, we always added a bouquet of wheat.\" (It became so closely associated with the designer that Catherine Deneuve, a longtime friend and client, carried a sheaf of wheat to the designer's funeral.)\n\nPerhaps the most eye-catching items in the Marrakesh vitrine -- and among the most valuable, according to Ms. Deroche -- are two pieces of wearable gilded bronze by the French sculptor Claude Lalanne, made from casts of the waist and bustline of the model Veruschka in 1969.\n\nThey were worn on the runway with breezy chiffon dresses in place of a necklace or a belt.\n\n\"Saint Laurent always said that for him, a button or a belt is also a form of jewelry,\" Ms. Deroche said.",

                "title": "Georg Jensen: All in the Family",
                "body": "Georg Jensen, considered one of Denmark's most famous and influential designers, was born in 1866 in Radvaad, a small town north of Copenhagen. He began training as a goldsmith at 14, also studied sculpture and applied arts and then trained with a master silversmith. In 1904, he decided to open his own silversmith business.\n\nBut, \"he employed silversmiths to do the smithing while he concentrated on drawing, designing and business,\" said Dr. Krogsgaard, 64, an orthopedic surgeon and professor of sports traumatology and arthroscopy at the University of Copenhagen and Bispebjerg Hospital. So, while everything in the Krogsgaards' collection was designed by Mr. Jensen, only about 100 pieces -- all in solid silver -- were made by him.\n\nMr. Jensen's business grew; he sold shares in 1916, but by 1918, as the company was opening a shop in Paris, he had become a minority shareholder. In 1924, the designer, who lost three wives to illness over the years, also lost artistic control of the business because his third wife's family, who were shareholders, refused to work with him after he married a fourth time. He died in 1935.\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, however, the Georg Jensen name still is all but synonymous with Danish silver design.\n\n\"There is a lightness in his things,\" Dr. Krogsgaard said. \"They are not clumsy -- most of them, anyway -- but at the same time he used more silver than normal. A lot of his things they are much thicker than you would get from other silversmiths at that time. It was a very high standard and people got value for money.\"\n\nNature was a constant theme in the designer's work, which was influenced by the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movement of the time, and opals, green agate and amber were often incorporated in his creations.\n\n\"I can show you his first known piece,\" the doctor said, rummaging around in the boxes, trays and individually wrapped items. \"The Adam and Eve belt buckle from 1899.\" The cast silver piece, which the doctor said showed Mr. Jensen's transformation from a sculptor to a silversmith, depicted Eve offering the apple to Adam while Satan, in the shape of a serpent, looked on.\n\nWhen the buckle was auctioned in 1969, it was identified as being made by Mr. Jensen while he was still an apprentice. (\"It definitely was not,\" Dr. Krogsgaard said, noting that Mr. Jensen's apprentice days were long past by 1899.) The Krogsgaards obtained the buckle in 1999, when it was auctioned again.\n\nThe couple also has the last piece that Mr. Jensen worked on: a small tray that was on his work top when he died.\n\nIn addition to building the collection, Dr. Krogsgaard founded the Georg Jensen Society in 2000 to promote the designer's work. It now has about 100 members -- including Mr. Jensen's descendants -- and they generally meet once a year for a lecture or tour.\n\nDr. Krogsgaard said he thought there had been renewed interest in the designer's work in recent years, partly thanks to exhibitions like the retrospective, \"Georg Jensen -- A Tale of Danish Silver,\" that opened in September 2015 at Koldinghus Museum in southern Denmark. (There also have been auctions, like the 2005 Georg Jensen silver event that produced $8.9 million in sales for Christie's New York.)\n\nThe designer's reputation \"grows,\" Dr. Krogsgaard said. \"Unfortunately it grows\" -- adding, with a laugh, that the designer's work has also become more expensive.\n\nDesigns by Mr. Jensen can be seen throughout the Krogsgaards' house, from the candlestick, fruit bowl and intricately designed ashtrays in the kitchen to the pair of candlesticks, one of which sits atop a stack of auction catalogs and books about the designer. There is also a wooden and silver box, made by the designer in 1906, that holds a seemingly endless supply of jewelry.\n\nAnd with so much silver in the collection, how much time is spent polishing it? Not much, Dr. Krogsgaard said, noting that the collection's wrappings help to maintain the shine. As for the items on display, they are polished \"when necessary,\" he said. \"If we have guests, it should look perfect.\"\n\nThe Krogsgaards have chosen to concentrate on Mr. Jensen's early work. But when it comes to the brooches, rings, bracelets and cuff links produced by the company, the doctor has bought numerous versions of the same items. Laying them out in small trays, he said, it is possible to track the progress of Mr. Jensen's workmanship.\n\n\"When I see a very early piece I buy it even though I have it already, because you can see the difference,\" he said. \"You can see it's handmade. He rarely made a mistake.\n\n\"I mean, a lot of silversmiths they have a lot of pieces that are not that good, or they are heavy or clumsy or not very nice looking, but he was always elegant.\"",

                "body": "PARIS -- The works of François Victor Bazin, a World War I aviator turned artist, are familiar to automobile fans and collectors.\n\nSigned examples of the French sculptor's radiator ornaments -- such as his first, \"La Cigogne,\" a stork in flight designed in 1920 for Hispano Suiza, or the head of the African woman Nobosudru, created in 1925 for Citroën's Croisière Noire -- can sell for well into the four figures at auction.\n\nNow, a granddaughter that Mr. Bazin never knew is reviving some of his works for a wider -- and distinctly more feminine -- audience, both as decorative objects and in a collection of sterling silver jewelry.\n\n\"I grew up surrounded by his sculptures, bookends and car mascots -- I always wanted to do something more,\" Julie Gardel Bazin said. \"They may be iconic to classic car fans, but as sublime examples of Art Deco I felt they, and my grandfather, merited a broader reach.\"\n\nLast year, Ms. Bazin, a longtime project director for the Paris luxury packaging company Aesthete and a former artistic director at Asprey in London, introduced F. Bazin Paris with bronze statues. The elephant head, a centaur, the stork and the Nobosudru head were presented: numbered editions of eight in large formats and 100 in smaller sizes.\n\nThe pieces were cast by the art foundry Fusions, a heritage business recognized by the French state, based in the Auvergne region. Prices begin at 950 euros ($1,170) for a small centaur; large sizes are available by order.\n\nThis spring, that lineup has expanded into jewelry, beginning with the Croisière Noire collection: four variations of Nobosudru, said to have been the favorite of a Mangbetu chief in the Belgian Congo (now, the Democratic Republic of Congo). The most striking is a 3-D statement piece that reprises her elongated profile on a ring. The Favorite earrings sway with chain fringe; the Mangbetu bracelet portrays her in full-face relief. Coiffe, the most discreet and gender-neutral theme, reinterprets the concentric circles of her headdress on pendant and bracelet discs.\n\nPrices for jewelry range from €150 for a silver and leather bracelet to €460 for the fringed earrings. Like the sculptures, the pieces are made using the lost wax technique and finished by hand. Ms. Bazin said she deliberately chose to work in silver without rhodium plating so that, with wear, the jewelry would take on the same kind of patina as a sculpture.\n\nMs. Bazin said that, of the 70 or more possible ornaments to choose among, she decided to start with Croisière Noire for its femininity: \"With jewelry, you can talk about the woman, the sculpture, adventure and an extraordinary era all at once.\"",

                "body": "Myriad things inspire the design of a jewel. It could be the bloom of a flower or the curve of a bird's wing. Rarely is it a childlike scribble. And yet Cy Twombly, the American artist whose work was commonly described in those terms, inspired Graff Diamonds' latest collection.\n\nThat Graff, a contemporary classicist among today's jewelers, should turn to the abstract expressionism of contemporary art is perhaps less surprising given that Laurence Graff's passion -- beyond seeking the world's rarest diamonds -- is his personal art collection.\n\nMr. Graff, the house's chairman, has a considerable trove of 20th-century masters, with pieces by Twombly alongside the likes of Warhol, Basquiat and Picasso.\n\n\"I have been collecting modern and contemporary art for many years and am fascinated by Cy Twombly and other artists in his oeuvre, including Christopher Wool,\" he wrote in an email. \"The grand canvases on which they paint intensely physical scribbles are filled with an urgent energy.\"\n\nBut how does one capture the verve and spontaneity of a brush stroke or a pencil line in the painstaking process of setting hard stones in metal?\n\nMr. Graff said that challenge was eased considerably by the skills of artisans in the house's design studio and workshop, and its wide selection of gemstones. \"It was a challenge to capture the essence of these works,\" he said.\n\n\"But we are diamond artists and our experience, combined with an unrivaled inventory of stones, ensure our designers and master craftsmen have the freedom to experiment.\"\n\nIn one pair of earrings, a seemingly spontaneous squiggle of diamonds dances down from the ear and flatters the jawline before ending with the punctuation of pear-shaped drops. A necklace is formed from what appears to be an infinite, three-dimensional loop of alternating baguette- and brilliant-cut diamonds. The unnamed collection, all one-of-a-kind-pieces with prices available on request, is to be introduced at the Baselworld trade fair this week.\n\nMr. Twombly, who died in 2011, once said that the creation of a piece was instinctual. \"It's more like I'm having an experience than making a picture,\" he said in an interview with the art critic David Sylvester.\n\nIt is that fleeting moment, rather than the more traditional flutter of a butterfly's wing or the fall of snowflakes that Graff seeks to freeze in time. \"I am absolutely delighted with the new jewels, which capture succinctly what I love most about modern art: the spontaneity,\" Mr. Graff said.",

                "body": "MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands -- In theory, someone selects jewelry because it is personally expressive in some way. But with \"Meaningful Jewels,\" a collection of 46 antique European pieces exhibited for the first time at the European Fine Arts Fair earlier this month, Sandra Hindman aimed to highlight what she called a \"more loaded\" interpretation.\n\nThat is why Ms. Hindman, founder of the gallery Les Enluminures in Paris and Chicago, and her colleagues -- Beatriz Chadour-Sampson, a jewelry historian, and Cynthia Hahn, a reliquary arts specialist, the authors of a book on the collection -- decided to frame the exhibition with the quote: \"The thing of mine I have loved the best.\"\n\nThe phrase came from the will of a medieval English duchess. And the \"thing,\" which Ms. Hindman, a medieval manuscript dealer, sold to a museum 25 years ago, was a two-inch-tall psalter with eight illuminated pages. She deduced that it was a talisman, something so precious that it was made to be handled and worn. Jewels, she realized, were just as moving.\n\nCompiled over 15 years, the \"Meaningful\" collection includes many crosses, representations of saints and scenes of the Annunciation and Crucifixion.\n\nBut Ms. Hindman noted that, despite the devotional touch points, the pieces have almost nothing to do with traditional religion, nor are they fashion items, accessories or traditional art objects. \"These are personal adornment with everyday power. They're different, almost magical,\" she said. \"It's less about a visual aesthetic than how they interacted with you as a person, on your body.\"",

                "body": "To unearth the secrets of Quebec City, I turned to Richard Linteau, the avuncular doorman at the Château Frontenac who has worked at the grand hotel for 29 years.\n\nOverlooking the frozen Saint Lawrence River, the hotel has been a fixture of the city stretching back to 1893. It has been the setting of a Hitchcock film (\"I Confess\"), was host to Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and, three weeks ago, was hostto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nRichard, whose father-in-law also worked at the hotel, was a talented hockey player before he traded in his hockey stick for a doorman's cap. \"I hear and see everything but hear and see nothing,\" he said with a mischievous smile.\n\nRichard said the strangest request he had ever received was from a New Yorker, who asked him to rent a tow truck to take his car around town during a snowstorm. He didn't want its tires to touch snow. \"Then he drove back to New York.\"\n\nQuebecers, he added, are a hospitable bunch. \"I am not sure about Paris or New York, but if you fall on the floor here, a Quebecer will come pick you up.\"\n\nJoin the conversation on Instagram here.\n\nJbcbrooklyn: Let him know that we New Yorkers will pick him up off the floor if he visits.\n\nIn Quebec City, the windows of the main mosque are still pocked with bullet holes. This week I met there with Mohamed Labidi, the director of the mosque where six people were killed by a Quebecois shooter more than a year ago.\n\nSpeaking after prayers at the mosque, where dozens of worshipers from North Africa, Africa and the Middle East knelt on the floor, Mohamed said many Muslims were still reeling from the attack. He said it had deeply shocked him and underlined some growing fissures in Quebec society.\n\nLast year Mohamed's car was lit on fire in front of his home after he sought to build a cemetery for the Muslim community. But he says he is undeterred.\n\n\"The situation for us has gotten worse over the past decade,\" he said. \"It has taken blood to flow for us to build bridges again.\"\n\nJoin the conversation on Facebook here.\n\nAhmed Salihbegović: Blessed are the peacemakers (and bridge-builders) of any & every extraction and background.\n\nDozens of readers urged me to meet Louise Penny, the best-selling detective novelist and an Anglophone who conjures up French-speaking Québécois characters. Her police detective, Armand Gamache, has become to Quebec what Hercule Poirot is to Belgium.\n\nSo it was that I found myself having a lively coffee-fueled chat with Louise in the snow-covered town of Knowlton, in the Eastern Townships. Sleepy, bucolic Knowlton inspired the fictional Three Pines of her novels, where her likeable and inquisitive Chief Inspector Armand Gamache excavates the town's dark secrets. After 13 books in the series, Louise noted wryly that Three Pines had struggled to \"sustain the murder count.\"\n\nLouise's novels were translated into 23 languages before they were finally translated into Quebec French in 2010, partly reflecting the cultural divide in the province.\n\n\"My books are love letters to Quebec -- the language of my characters is French and I wanted my characters to live in that language,\" Louise said. \"The translation meant so much to me because I wanted my friends and neighbors to be able to read them.\"\n\nJoin the conversation on Instagram here.\n\nRevirgriver: Love her! She came to my store last year for an event. A total joy.\n\nCezin Nottaway learned how to kill and skin a beaver at age 5. She is as at home in the forest as she is running her catering company. She is part of a rising generation of Indigenous cooks and scholars trying to preserve and spread the food culture of their ancestors.\n\nSpeaking on her Algonquin reserve of Kitigan Zibi, near Maniwaki, Quebec, Cezin told me she had been shaken to the core by the recent case of Colten Boushie, a young Cree man shot dead by a white farmer in Saskatchewan who was found not guilty of murder.\n\n\"I had thought we were making progress, but the verdict made me sad and angry,\" she told me. \"I've warned my son never to trespass anywhere, I've told my daughter never to be vulnerable. There is no justice for Indigenous people in Canada.\"\n\nIn a community plagued by drugs and alcohol, Cezin and her husband, Wesley, are notable success stories. Wesley was a drug dealer who will soon prescribe medicine as a doctor when he finishes McGill Medical School.\n\nHow did he transform his life? Cezin explains. \"I told him: 'Enough is enough! What do you choose, drugs or your family?'\"\n\nMany young people I spoke to here credited strong women -- mothers, wives, grandmothers -- for changing their lives.\n\nWesley jokes that not listening to Cezin wasn't really an option.\n\nBy Day 5 of my road trip, it was time for a beer break. And so I made my way to Shawinigan, in central Quebec, at the red-neon-lit brewery of Le Trou du Diable (The Devil's Hole), with Isaac Tremblay, the laid-back founder of one of Quebec's most successful microbreweries.\n\nIsaac, a former film technician on movie sets, first conceived of the idea for the brewery at age 25 with a group of friends from Shawinigan. He named it after a mythical bottomless caldron at the base of Shawinigan waterfall that leads straight to hell (he wrote his business plan on set during breaks). Isaac likes to draw, and his beer labels feature intricate narratives and psychedelic colors.\n\nMany readers urged me to visit a microbrewery because beer is such a part of Quebec's social fabric. Quebec's first brewery, the Brasserie du Roi, was established in 1668 by Jean Talon, the chief administrator after the French colonized Quebec. Today, there are roughly 150 microbreweries in the province, reflecting an appetite for local producers, and artisanal beer.\n\nOver a dinner of beef tartare and a citrus and coriander-infused pint of Blanche de Shawi beer, Isaac noted that, in this former pulp and paper industrial region, the \"taverne\" has long been a place that marked the end of a factory shift, a place for beer-fueled political banter and letting loose. \"Quebec is a melting pot of France, Britain and Irish immigration, and drinking beer is part of its bon vivant spirit,\" he said.\n\nJoin the conversation on Instagram here.\n\nJf_dugas: But not a microbrewery anymore... Big Beer Molson-Coors bought them a few months ago which created a shock wave in the microbrew world. Un débat très polarisant dans le Québec brassicole. (Translation: A very polarizing debate in the Quebec brewery world.)\n\nShady Hafez is the son of an Algonquin mother and a Syrian Muslim immigrant father. He grew up between Ottawa and Kitigan Zibi.\n\nAfter completing an undergraduate degree in law and Canadian studies, he is completing a master's in Indigenous governance so that he can serve his community. His demand? That Canada give Indigenous people back their stolen land so they can finance their own institutions.\n\n\"If you move people off their land and oppress them,\" he said, \"don't be surprised when they develop drinking problems.\"\n\nTo unwind, he sings and dances and is learning how to hunt. Asked the secret of his success, he credited his strict Muslim paternal grandparents.\n\nJoin the conversation on Instagram here.\n\nJeanb51: Je suis Québécois depuis 66 ans, et chaque jour j'apprends quelque chose de nouveau sur mon pays dans votre chronique. Merci de ce regard rafraîchissant. (Translation: I have been a Quebecer for 66 years, and every day I learn something new about my country from your dispatches. Thank you for this fresh outlook.)\n\nGabriel Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc Mélenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 \"Maple Spring,\" the huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty.\n\n\"Quebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,\" he told me over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province's National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that the separatist movement was \"not at its peak,\" he stressed that about 30 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls.\n\nJoin the conversation on Instagram here.\n\nOnawaytrepanier: So much I admire about their platform. But their aim is Québec independence and I just can't go there.\n\nIn 1954, 27-year-old Phyllis Lambert wrote an eight-page, single-spaced letter to her father, Samuel Bronfman, head of the Seagram distillery empire. Her father planned to build a new headquarters in New York, and the banality of the proposed building filled her with dread.\n\n\"Dearest Daddy,\" the letter began. \"No, No, No, No, No,\" she wrote, outlining with a mixture of passion and analytical verve why her father had a civic responsibility to build a memorable building that would change the world. The result -- the towering Seagram Building on New York's Park Avenue -- transformed 20th-century architecture.\n\nPhyllis took charge of its construction, choosing the modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe as its architect. Among its innovations, Phyllis noted, the building had a 90-foot-deep marble and granite plaza, breaking up the city's plodding uniformity.\n\n\"It changed New York,\" she told me over tea in her kitchen in a triplex in Old Montreal with a dramatic skylight, an interior elevator and playful modern Canadian art.\n\nPhyllis has brought that same determination to her native Montreal. She is the city's most important conservationist, even if that has meant opposing projects financed by her own family. Among her crowning achievements, she helped found Heritage Montreal and founded the Canadian Center for Architecture, a pioneering global center for architecture. Acutely intelligent with an easy sense of humor, she shows little signs of slowing down and recently curated an exhibition about Montreal's historic greystones.",

It wasn't glamorous, but the job enabled him to afford a two-story suburban house with mustard-colored aluminum siding. After more than three decades in the United States, Mr. Tran felt that he was the living embodiment of the American dream.\n\nAnd then it all started to crumble.\n\nIn 2014, according to Mr. Tran, his boss ordered him to lie to customers who were facing foreclosure. When Mr. Tran refused, he said, he was fired. He worried that he wouldn't be able to make his monthly mortgage payments and that he was about to become homeless.\n\nJoining a cadre of former employees claiming they were mistreated for speaking out about problems at the bank, Mr. Tran sued. He argued in court filings that he had been fired in retaliation for blowing the whistle on misconduct at the giant San Francisco-based bank. Mr. Tran said he didn't want his job back -- he wanted Wells Fargo to admit that it had been wrong to fire him and wrong to mislead customers who were facing foreclosure.",

Firmdale's first New York property, Crosby Street Hotel, in Soho, opened in 2009 and is considered to be among the city's most fashionable accommodations. The company's co-owner and design director, Kit Kemp, has a flair for creating unique hotels, and the Whitby, too, is a place with serious design personality: each of the 86 rooms is individually decorated, and original art by contemporary artists from around the world adorns both guest rooms and public spaces.\n\nThe Whitby is on 56th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Trump Tower, a popular tourist spot ever since Donald J. Trump was elected as the president, is steps away. While this may deter some overnight guests because of the crowds snapping pictures, the property's central location is undoubtedly appealing: attractions such as Rockefeller Center, Central Park, the Museum of Modern Art, top restaurants and the stores on Fifth Avenue are all within walking distance. Taxis are readily available, and several subways are within a 10-minute walk including the N, R, F and E lines.",

                "body": "He said recent surveys, which show growing support for more restrictive laws on guns and assault weapons and declining support for the N.R.A., feed his optimism that the country may be experiencing a \"phase shift\" on guns.\n\nBut David Farmer, who led the Maine effort for universal background checks in 2016, said that supporters of gun rights can be particularly persuasive once a concrete proposal is unveiled. In Maine, polling support for the measure declined between introduction and the final vote, before failing, 52-48.\n\n\"We know for a fact we lost the argument at the kitchen table and the bar and the bowling alley,\" he said. \"The gun enthusiasts were talking to their friends and relatives and neighbors. They felt about it in a way that was so passionate that they won those one-on-one encounters, and they were very successful in bringing in people to their side.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm of gun rights activists doesn't show up just in personal conversations. Over the last few decades, they have been more likely to speak to their legislators or give money to gun-related political groups, according to research from the Pew Research Center. Those actions have sent a signal to legislators that there is robust opposition even to laws that show strong public support in polls.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that favors stricter gun laws, thinks the energy imbalance is shifting. He said the group's donations, membership and Instagram follows have all risen since the Parkland shootings, a suggestion, he said, that members of the public who back Everytown's agenda are increasing the intensity of their support.\n\nHe also noted a string of recent state legislative successes on gun restrictions for domestic abusers, including some in Republican-led states, and the recent passage of a law in Florida that allows judges to temporarily confiscate guns from people who are judged a threat. (On Friday, an N.R.A. spokesman declined to offer the organization's views of public opinion on gun measures.)\n\nMr. Farmer said he is also optimistic that his side can do a better job of persuading voters in the future. He said he's particularly heartened by the recent groundswell of activism by young Americans. He said he sees parallels between their energy and that of the opposition.\n\nSeveral polls since the Parkland shootings show a rise in support for gun restrictions, including some that go beyond universal background checks. President Trump's proposal to arm schoolteachers has received more lukewarm support -- with fewer than 45 percent of the public supporting it in two recent surveys. It will take some time to see whether the trends hold.",

Follow them on Twitter.\n\n* Sign up for the Morning Briefing for news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day.\n\nThe mission statement on the organizers' website says the marches on Saturday are to \"demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues.\"\n\nSeveral of the Stoneman Douglas students have spent the last few days meeting with political leaders.\n\nJaclyn Corin, 17, a junior and lead organizer, will give a speech at the rally, and in an interview she compared the march to protests against the Vietnam War and rallies for civil rights. She recently spoke with Representative John Lewis, a key player during the civil rights era. \"He said he saw himself and his friends and his movement in us, in our movement,\" she said.\n\nThe event will be a show of strength for a group that will soon have access to the ballot box -- something marchers plan to emphasize.\n\n\"What we're doing is because we're not scared of these adults,\" Ms. Corin said, \"because we have nothing to lose, we don't have an election to lose, we don't have a job to lose -- we just have our lives to lose.\"\n\nA group called HeadCount is sending roughly 5,000 volunteers to register people at 30 marches across the country.\n\nThe student activists also hope to elevate gun control as a key issue in the coming midterm elections, and to build support for candidates with whom they are aligned on issues such as universal background checks and bans on assault-style weapons.\n\nIn Florida, a state that is notoriously stubborn on guns, the students' activism helped spur a newly passed law that raises the minimum age for gun purchases and creates a waiting period for buying guns, among other things, but does not ban assault weapons or strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Washington march will draw many survivors of mass shootings. It will also draw people like Dantrell Blake, 21, and his cousin Deshon Hannah, 20. Both were shot as teenagers in Chicago, and they said they hoped their visit to Washington would bring attention to the plight of their city's many shooting victims.\n\n\"When something like that happens,\" Mr. Blake said of Parkland, \"it's like, 'It's a massacre.' But it's a massacre in Chicago every day -- and this definitely can be talked about.\"",

While he's unassuming in the extreme, the 40-year-old has already left a distinct footprint with his new Andean outpost, Mil, which opened at the end of February.\n\nHaving formed a co-op of sorts with the tiny nearby farming communities of Kacllaraccay and Mullaka's-Misminay he's aiming to chronicle and revive ancient local ingredients and food practices that might otherwise be lost to time. Among others in his merry band of preservationists are his wife Pía León, an acclaimed chef in her own right; his sister Malena Martinez, head of the group's native ingredient-cataloging operation; and Francesco D'Angelo Piaggio, the staff anthropologist and community outreach consigliere who has the best backstory of the bunch: When he was still working on his thesis in a nearby rural community, his mother saw the Virgilio Martinez episode of \"Chef's Table\" on Netflix and insisted her son do the same, given the gentlemen's eerily simpatico sensibilities. A series of emails and a job at Mil soon followed.\n\nThe result of the group's efforts is unlike anything else in my restaurant-going experience: Lunch (there is no dinner service as of yet) consisted of eight courses, a gustatory grand tour of altitudinous ecosystems, each stop an opportunity to use age-old ingredients and techniques to arrestingly modern effect.",

That summit meeting, which both sides have agreed to hold in late April, is expected to be followed within weeks by a meeting between Mr. Kim and President Trump.\n\nUnification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon will lead the South's delegation to the talks next week, which will be held Thursday on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles the border. The North's delegation will be led by Ri Son-kwon, one of the senior North Korean officials who visited the South during the Winter Olympics last month, part of the stage-setting for the current détente between the Koreas after a year of high tension over Pyongyang's nuclear program.\n\nThe North on Saturday accepted the South's proposal to meet at Panmunjom, the Unification Ministry statement said.\n\nThe Koreas agreed earlier this month that their leaders would meet in late April, on the South Korean side of Panmunjom. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump surprised much of the world by accepting Mr. Kim's invitation to sit down for talks.",

                "title": "This Is What I Do When I Hear the Bombs Explode",
                "body": "This would be the eighth suicide bombing I've witnessed here in Kabul, and I am sick to death of them.\n\nIn some ways it was the worst one I've seen, perhaps because one of the first things I noticed was a boy lying on his face, his leg blown off, and from a short distance away he looked just like my little brother. Again, I almost called home to check where Ehsan was, before I remembered I had just left him.\n\nPeople at the scene were angry and chased away all the other journalists. I guess because I was shaking so much nobody noticed me.\n\nI understand their anger. They don't want their agony to be material for journalists; in the moment of their awful sorrow, they don't want their spectacle to be shared by strangers.\n\nThey're looking for someone to blame, and we're right there; the terrorists are not.\n\nBut I want them to know that first of all I'm a reporter and I should do my job. I want to see what is happening, see how people are dealing with it. And most of all, I want the world to know about Afghanistan, about how they are killing my people. I also want them to know that I have not forgotten the face of a single one of those victims I've seen and I probably never will.\n\nI was a civilian, not a journalist, at the first suicide bombing I witnessed: the Enlightenment Movement Bombing in 2016. (Like others who have experienced international acts of terrorism -- 9/11, the Munich Massacre, London Bridge -- we Afghans name our bombings.)\n\nI was very close to that one. The Enlightenment Movement, started by my fellow Hazaras, a largely Shiite minority group, drew a huge crowd to an anti-government demonstration by mainly young people like me. We were filled with enthusiasm and happiness that we were finally reclaiming our people's long-denied rights. It was a hot July day and I took refuge from the afternoon heat in the shade of a wall.\n\nThat wall saved my life. I have no words to describe the horrible sound of that blast, a sound I had never heard before. Dust filled the air and I was lying on the ground, too shocked to move. Which was fortunate because a few minutes later came another blast -- a vicious trick of terrorists to get first responders as well. Flying glass cut my nose, but I had no other injury.\n\nFar worse was what I saw: the dead and dying, the dismembered victims and distraught survivors, the terrible screams of agony and suffering, and the howls of despair and rage. The blast killed 84 and wounded more than 400.\n\nPolice at the scene were as shocked as everyone else; and some of them were out of control, firing everywhere for no reason. One officer leveled his pistol straight at me. He looked crazed, as if he were about to shoot, when a man came and knocked his gun arm down. I was frozen with shock until an old man grabbed my hand and ordered me to run with him.\n\nMany of my friends were among the dead and wounded, I would later learn. \"We are changing history,\" my friend Sharif Dawlat Shahi, a ministry of education employee, wrote on his Facebook page that morning. It was the last thing he ever wrote.\n\nAfter that I had a hard time sleeping; I couldn't stop thinking about those who perished, and the scenes I had witnessed. When I did sleep, I dreamed of them.\n\nDuring the day, some noise or incident would remind me of what happened and I would begin shaking all over. People thought I looked cold, but it happened on hot days, too. At those times, I would forget the most simple words in my native Dari; sometimes it was so bad I couldn't even speak English anymore.\n\nI got a temporary job with Oxfam in the remote province of Daikundi, which brought some respite because there was no internet there, so I couldn't see the news of what was happening in Kabul. Phones didn't usually work either, so I couldn't call my brother.\n\nThat bothered me after awhile, so I returned to Kabul and worked as a freelance journalist until July of last year, when I was hired by The New York Times.\n\nIt has been a bad period for suicide bombings. I went to seven more as a reporter; they happened to occur on days when I was on duty or on call, though my colleagues went to many as well.\n\nWhen I had just started at The Times, there was the Sar-e Kariz Bombing, in which 38 civilians were killed, many of them young professionals in the mining ministry.\n\nThen in October came the Imam Zaman Mosque Bombing, in which 58 were killed by a fellow worshiper, who did his ablutions with explosives strapped to his chest and blew himself up as they all knelt to pray. When I heard the bomb go off I immediately got the shakes, and rang my brother. His phone was switched off and I was frantic until I reached my mother, who reported he was asleep in bed.\n\nIn January of this year, there were two suicide bombings. In the Intercontinental Hotel Attack, suicide bombers and gunmen killed at least 18, and maybe many more. I reached people inside who were hiding under beds, convinced they would soon die. Some did. I kept thinking: 'They could be my father, my mother, my brother, my sister.' \"\n\nIn the Ambulance Bombing, at the old Ministry of Interior, 95 were killed by a suicide bomber driving an ambulance -- another shameful trick.\n\nLate last year, when the Tebyan cultural center in western Kabul was hit, killing 41, at first we thought the bomb had gone off in Dasht-e Barchi, where my family lives. I rang my brother and he picked up, but instead of saying, \"Hello, who's calling?\" he promptly said: \"Hello sweetie. I'm O.K. I heard the bomb go off and I'm not there. You're such a crazy girl. Don't worry.\"\n\nThen early this month a bomb did go off in our neighborhood, and this time my brother did not answer his phone. My mother and I were both calling him. I was shaking and crying, but I went to the scene anyway, and en route my sister texted that Ehsan was okay. He had been playing football.\n\nThat blast, near the Musala Mosque, killed \"only\" 10 people, so it wasn't big enough to get its own name, though we covered it.\n\nA lot of my friends and family members ask why I keep doing this kind of reporting. \"If I don't, who will?\" I respond.\n\nThe world has tired of the story of poor bombed-out Afghanistan. It's hardly news anymore: 150 killed on a Wednesday, 84 killed on a Thursday, 10 killed on a Friday, oh well.\n\nOften the police keep us journalists so far away that all we have is the numbers, and they are sometimes deliberately falsified, as happened last year in the Military Hospital Attack, where many think the death toll was triple what officials admitted.\n\nI said Wednesday's bombing was maybe the worst I've experienced not because it killed 33 but because I got so close. But it was also the best, for the same reason. That helped us, I hope, to convey some of the real human misery in a way that no numbers ever will. It made the effort worth it.\n\nThe mother of that boy, Mustafa, who looked like my brother, Ehsan, kept talking to his body, and everyone around her was terrified by her towering grief: \"My handsome son, my handsome son. My teenager. God knows how I raised you. Why has he let you die?\"\n\nFinally it got too dangerous to stay at the scene so I texted my bureau chief that I had to leave. I was shaking, of course.\n\nAs I left I saw a boy on a bike. He was dressed just like my brother. I had told Ehsan, \"Stay home!\" So I chased after the boy until I caught up to him. It was someone else.",

He was quickly swallowed by Syracuse's zone, but somehow managed to kick it out to Duke's lone senior, Grayson Allen. Allen nailed a 3-pointer and pointed at Bagley in acknowledgment.\n\nAside from brief moments like that one, Duke never really solved Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim's celebrated 2-3 zone. And maybe it should have, given that Duke now runs the same defense.\n\nStill, in a game that was sloppy and came down to the final seconds, Duke held on for a 69-65 win in the round of 16.\n\nEven though upsets have spiced up much of this year's bracket, the Midwest regional final on Sunday will feature Duke against the quadrant's top seed, Kansas, which outlasted Clemson, 80-76, on Friday night.\n\nDuke's shots from long range did not drop as they typically do. Its 3-point percentage was 19.2 percent, compared with a season average of 38.3 percent. In the second half, the Blue Devils went 2 for 18 from deep.",

While wearing a standard brace, he tried to return for No. 2 seed Purdue's win over Butler, but the rule would not allow it.\n\nSo before Friday's matchup with No. 3 seed Texas Tech, he was outfitted with a new brace. The N.C.A.A. said it would amend its rules to allow Haas to play, and he warmed up gingerly. But ultimately he remained rooted to the bench, a critical absence for Purdue in a 78-65 loss to the Red Raiders at TD Garden.\n\nWithout its 7-foot-2 center, the Boilermakers were outrebounded by the Red Raiders, nearly outscored in the paint, and overwhelmed by one of the nation's best defensive teams.",

In a March 1956 article, The New York Times described the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as \"a rather soft-spoken man with a learning and maturity far beyond his 27 years.\" It's an early example of the mainstream media's coverage of King. This new documentary, narrated by the NBC anchor Lester Holt, uses King as its center as it examines the power of the media and images in the Civil Rights movement, and features a discussion of present-day activists' use of media. It begins by comparing Diamond Reynolds, who live-streamed the aftermath of the 2016 shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile, to Mamie Mobley, the mother of Emmett Till whose decision to allow her son's remains to be published in Jet magazine helped bring the brutality of the era into the public record. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the activist Diane Nash and the Rev. Al Sharpton are interviewed.\n\nATOMIC BLONDE (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO. What happens when you reimagine James Bond as a blond, female spy? According to the The Times's Manohla Dargis, you get \"lavishly violent, inventively choreographed fights that have been glued together by nonsense and Charlize Theron.\" Ms. Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton, a British secret service spy who is on an assignment in Berlin shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, with a cast that includes James McAvoy and John Goodman.\n\nPACIFIC RIM (2013) 8 p.m. on F.X. If you're planning on seeing \"Pacific Rim: Uprising,\" (and you might want to, our critic writes), this first installment directed by Guillermo del Toro will get you acquainted with the robots-versus-monsters story. \"If you walk in expecting subtlety, or even novelty, you may find yourself more tormented than entertained,\" the Times's A. O. Scott wrote. \"But 'Pacific Rim' is also a reminder -- either just in time or much too late -- that this kind of movie can and should be fun.\"\n\n2018 KIDS' CHOICE AWARDS 8 p.m. on Nickelodeon. With everything else going on in the world, viewers might take comfort in the fact that they can still tune in to watch celebrities get doused in green slime during this annual children's film awards show. John Cena returns to host.\n\nRED TREES (2017) on Netflix. Marina Willer's documentary tells the story of her father's family, one of 12 Jewish families to survive the Nazi occupation of Prague during World War II.

                "body": "The policy announcement outraged advocates for transgender troops, and the advocates vowed to fight the limits in court.\n\n\"There is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy,\" said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, which focuses on sexuality and the military. \"Our troops and our nation deserve better.\"\n\nIn a series of Twitter posts in July, Mr. Trump announced that \"the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\"\n\nHe said he decided to issue the ban after consulting with generals and military experts, although Mr. Mattis was given only a day's notice. In August, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to reverse an Obama administration policy that had allowed transgender people -- or those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or had discomfort with their biological gender -- to serve in the military.\n\nIn October, a judge in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia temporarily blocked Mr. Trump's ban and said the reasoning behind it was most likely unconstitutional because it represented a \"disapproval of transgender people generally.\" Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly had ruled that the military's current policy should remain in place.\n\nMr. Trump's new order allows the defense secretary and the homeland security secretary to \"exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\"\n\nIn a memo to the president, dated Feb. 22, Mr. Mattis cited \"substantial risks\" about military personnel who seek to change or who question their gender identity.\n\nHe said that allowing some of them to serve would amount to an exemption of certain mental, physical and sex-based standards, and \"could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military that is not conducive to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nMr. Mattis's assertion contradicts a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation, which found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would \"have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs\" for the Pentagon.\n\nThe study estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. It concluded that there were 2,000 to 11,000 active-duty troops who are transgender.\n\nCiting research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected \"little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness\" in the United States.\n\nMr. Mattis, in his recommendation to Mr. Trump, complained that the RAND study \"heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness, and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own.\"\n\n\"In short,\" Mr. Mattis concluded, \"this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or Rand assumed.\"\n\nIn her ruling last October, Judge Kollar-Kotelly rejected the Trump administration's argument that it needs more time to prepare to process transgender recruits for military service. \"The court is not persuaded that defendants will be irreparably injured by allowing the accession of transgender individuals into the military beginning on Jan. 1, 2018,\" she wrote.\n\nOn Friday, Pentagon officials said they would continue to comply with federal law. A Defense Department spokesman said the Pentagon would \"continue to assess and retain transgender service members.\" The new policy must first be published in the Federal Register, which generally requires new rules to be reviewed and subject to a public comment period before they are enacted.\n\nMr. Trump announced the ban in July to resolve a quietly brewing fight on Capitol Hill over whether taxpayer money should pay for gender transition and hormone therapy for transgender service members.\n\nBut rather than addressing that narrow issue, Mr. Trump opted to upend the entire policy on transgender service members. His decision was announced with such haste that the White House could not answer basic questions about how it would be carried out, including what would happen to transgender people on active duty.\n\nNow, eight months later, what will happen to transgender people on active duty is still unclear.\n\n\"What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy,\" Joshua Block, a senior staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union L.G.B.T. and H.I.V. Project, said in a statement.\n\nThe new policy, according to the A.C.L.U. memo, \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"",

                "body": "Kalani Brown had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Baylor, which took its first loss since falling 68-62 at U.C.L.A. in November.\n\nThe Beavers weren't intimidated by Baylor's winning streak or size, working around the latter with crisp passing and controlling the boards throughout. Gulich thrived in both cases, hitting midrange shots. Perimeter shooting was the difference, with Tudor and Corosdale combining for seven 3-pointers on 13 attempts. McWilliams' late 3-point shot was the difference.\n\nJust as the Lady Bears seemed to find their rhythm with Brown, they steadily fell apart after halftime and never found consistency. Making just 3 of 17 from long range didn't help, but being outrebounded after entering with a plus-26.5 margin was the biggest shortcoming for a team that had been dominant since early November.\n\nU.C.L.A. 84, TEXAS 75 Jordin Canada scored 22 points and took control of the game in the fourth quarter, leading second-seeded U.C.L.A. past Texas to avenge a round of 16 loss to the Longhorns two years ago.\n\nCanada scored seven straight for the Bruins at one point, then contributed to every crucial play down the stretch. Monique Billings added 17 points and Kennedy Burke had 15 for the Bruins (27-7), who finally made it to the round of 8 after falling a game short the past two seasons. They will face top-seeded Mississippi State on Sunday.\n\nAriel Atkins had 20 points and Jatarie White had 17 for the third-seeded Longhorns (28-7), who kept falling into deep holes, slowly digging their way out, and then letting U.C.L.A. pull away again.\n\nTexas made one last charge when it got back-to-back 3-point shots from Atkins and Alecia Sutton to make the score 76-72 with less than two minutes left. But Burke answered with a layup for U.C.L.A., and Canada's jump shot with just under a minute to go helped put the game away in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nMISSISSIPPI ST. 71, N.C. STATE 57 Teaira McCowan had 24 points and 15 rebounds and Victoria Vivians added 14 points as top-seeded Mississippi State routed North Carolina State in Kansas City, Mo., to reach the round of 8.\n\nMorgan William posted 13 points and Roshunda Johnson, who lost her grandfather earlier in the week, added 12 as the Bulldogs (35-1) broke their school record for wins in a season. They'll have a chance to add to it Sunday, when they play for a spot in their second consecutive Final Four.\n\nKiara Leslie had 27 points to pace the fourth-seeded Wolfpack (26-9), who led early in the second quarter before coming undone. Foul trouble set in, Mississippi State clamped down defensively and North Carolina State Coach Wes Moore was hit with a technical foul as the Bulldogs pulled away.\n\nThe Wolfpack also had no answer for McCowan, whose size presented all kinds of problems. The only junior in a senior-dominated starting lineup, she finished 11 of 11 from the field and made both of her foul shots on a night that would have been perfect except for a trio of turnovers.\n\nThe Bulldogs, who lost to South Carolina in last year's title game, looked like they would cruise to the doorstep of another Final Four when they roared to a 17-7 lead in the first quarter. North Carolina State leaned on its defense, and one of the best rebounding margins in the nation, to claw back. Leslie's 3-point shot early in the second quarter gave the Wolfpack a 20-19 advantage.\n\nMississippi State responded with another run, fueled almost entirely by McCowan, its 6-foot-7 star. She easily grabbed rebounds over the smaller Wolfpack, scored a series of layups and wound up with 16 points on 7-for-7 shooting in the first half, as the Bulldogs took a 36-41 lead at halftime.\n\nMoore became incensed in the third quarter, when the Wolfpack's Akela Maize picked up her fourth foul. Official issued a technical foul, then mostly ignored him as Moore continued his diatribe. William made two foul shots and Johnson added a layup, and the Bulldogs eventually pushed their lead to 20 points.\n\nLOUISVILLE 86, STANFORD 59 Asia Durr had 24 points and Myisha Hines-Allen added 17 as top-seeded Louisville rolled past Stanford in Lexington, Ky.\n\nArica Carter had 13 points and Jazmine Jones scored 10 for the fourth-seeded Cardinals (35-2), who trailed for just 53 seconds to win their 10th consecutive game and advance to their first regional final since 2014. Louisville thrived offensively, shooting 52 percent and building a lead that reached 27 points with one minute and 24 seconds remaining to finish their third consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament rout.\n\nHines-Allen, who also grabbed five rebounds, made 8 of 15 baskets and surpassed 2,000 career points.",

                "body": "But in this election there are more than 40 truly competitive districts, including many where you can make a real difference by helping replace an incumbent who consistently supports the gun lobby with a challenger who won't.\n\nGo to the suburbs of Philadelphia, where Representative Ryan Costello (who has an A rating from the N.R.A.) is being challenged by several Democrats, including Chrissy Houlahan, a former Air Force captain who supports closing the loophole on sales at gun shows and renewing the federal assault weapons ban, among other steps. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's redrawing of the state's district lines has transformed Mr. Costello's already competitive district from one that was almost evenly split between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to one that supported Mrs. Clinton by 9 points.\n\nMarch to the southern tip of Florida, not to vacation in flip-flops but to flip a district. There, Representative Carlos Curbelo (who has a B+ rating from the N.R.A. and an \"N.R.A. lap dog\" label from the Brady Campaign) is also being challenged by several Democrats, including Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, whose father was shot to death when she was 24.\n\nMs. Mucarsel-Powell supports banning the sale of military-style weapons like the AR-15 used in the Parkland shootings and would strengthen background checks so that domestic abusers, those affected by mental illness and terrorists can't purchase guns. This district historically swings between Republicans and Democrats. You can push it the right way.\n\nToo hot in Florida? Try the suburbs of Minneapolis-St. Paul, specifically the Second and Third Congressional Districts. Mr. Trump was virtually even with Mrs. Clinton in the Second and lost to her in the Third. Representative Jason Lewis supported concealed-carry reciprocity, and opposed universal background checks and any ban on semiautomatic weapons. His neighbor, Representative Erik Paulsen, shares the same position on concealed-carry reciprocity and universal background checks. Both have A ratings from the N.R.A.; both have opponents supporting sensible gun security laws.\n\nYou can canvass in the shadows of the Catskills in New York, in the suburbs of Denver and in Fairfax, Va. You can phone-bank in the competitive districts in Orange County, Calif., as well as the northern San Joaquin Valley, northern San Diego and eastern Los Angeles County. Ask your peers to show up at campaign events and town halls in the exurbs of Chicago and in Iowa.\n\nIf you live in a heavily Democratic district in a place like New York State, your member of Congress is already with you. Send a note of thanks and support that incumbent. The possibility of change is beyond the horizon, literally, in that morphing of suburbs, exurbs and rural areas, in that convergence of districts with incumbents whose support for the gun lobby is virulent, but who, in the November election, are vulnerable.\n\nYou don't have to win every district. Replacing just a handful of incumbents in districts that are highly competitive while also offering a vivid contrast in positions on guns could bring the larger change you need and deserve.\n\nWhy? Because there's nothing on Capitol Hill more clarifying than watching colleagues pay the ultimate political price for their positions. Seeing a colleague defeated because of a hard-core position tends to soften the resistance of those who survive.\n\nMarch not left, nor right, but right up the middle, into those moderate competitive districts where high school students, people at the coffee shops and diners, and soccer moms and dads shake their heads at the intransigence of a member of Congress who won't support enhanced background checks, \"No Fly, No Buy\" and other reforms.\n\nYou can stage marches and school walkouts, but then walk into the swing congressional districts that matter. In the end it's not about standing up to be heard. It's about changing who sits in Congress.",

She posted on Twitter that Sano, an All-Star third baseman, forcibly attempted to kiss her following an autograph session at a mall in 2015.\n\nBetsy Bissen tweeted she screamed and resisted Sano until he gave up \"after a solid 10 minutes of fighting.\" Bissen, who has worked for publications including the popular fan blog Twins Daily, said in her tweet she long feared telling her story would cost her access to photograph Twins games.\n\nIn 2015, M.L.B. and its players union unveiled a new policy covering domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse.

It was history -- the first time a No. 16 seed had won a first-round game in the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament.

But a second-half surge propelled the Wildcats to the round of 8 with a 90-78 victory at TD Garden.\n\nThere is a balletic quality to the Wildcats when their offense is running on all cylinders. The Mountaineers, on the other hand, came looking for a street fight.\n\nWithin 10 minutes, there was blood on the court. There were flying elbows and jammed wrists. There was nearly a dust-up when, during a timeout, West Virginia's Sagaba Konate wandered toward Villanova's huddle, prompting Phil Booth to shove him away.",

Today's is suitably treacherous. Mr. Walden notes below that he's halfway to a prestigious record, constructor of the most Saturday Times puzzles, but for all we solvers know, Mr. Walden could go on to make a thousand of these infernal flummoxers. Enjoy!\n\nOh, speaking of treachery and prestige, the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament is on, babies. If you are actually there, banzai! Pat yourself on the back for every right answer: I have been picking through old puzzles and they are hard. If you are home like me, get over to that site and try some yourself, or fork over a very reasonable $20 and participate remotely.\n\n15A: I thought this clue -- \"Mr. or Mrs. Right?\" -- was clever, but a bit cruel, as any hopes for a romantic bon mot were wanton; the answer is GOPER, meaning one in the Grand Ol' Party, man or woman. The entry has been a word since 1951. Researching the origin of the term led me to an event I'd never known about, the New York Zoo Escape of 1874, a newspaper hoax that quite possibly inspired Thomas Nast to create the elephant and donkey's symbolic roles in politics today.\n\n18A: Aw, Little Orphan Annie, so cute! That curly red hair, those little brown boots, those soulless, blank, EMPTY EYES. Shiver! This reference is to the comic, where none of the characters actually have pupils, and whose popularity was superseded at one point by the musical, then by more than one cinematic treatment. There are a few interesting tidbits to the Annie origin story:\n\n30A: This particular definition for CLEAVE hasn't been used in the Times puzzle since the early '50s, but it's perfectly valid -- cleave can mean to split from or stick to. This is an example of a homograph, of which there are many in the English language. Fewer are homographs that are also antonyms; these are known as contronyms, or even \"Janus words,\" after the Roman god of beginnings and passages, who was depicted with faces on the front and back of his head. My particular favorite of these is \"sanction.\" It seems like a word tailor made for politics, doesn't it?\n\n54A: The misdirection was strong on this one, for me at least. I imagined \"Achieved green efficiency?\" as meaning \"gone solar\" or something like that, even considering the question mark -- some \"green\" technology, right? The game of golf, while availing a \"green\" as well, seems to be an example of inefficiency, famously \"a good walk spoiled,\" and infamously a wasteful assault on the environment. But I digress. When someone wastes no time and energy upon reaching the green, and \"drains\" the golf ball into the golf hole in one shot, they've ONE PUTTED. Thereby making room in their schedule for more golf.",

                "body": "Juan Villarino counts cars. If one passes him every minute, that's excellent; one every five minutes, and he gets worried. One every 20 minutes, and he knows he's really in the middle of nowhere. He once waited for two days in Tibet before a single car stopped; for 24 hours, on a frigid winter route, in Patagonia. Based on notes he keeps in pocket-size spiral journals, he compiles statistics, including average wait times in every country he has ever hitchhiked across, and the numbers aren't what you would expect -- which is, in part, why he collects them in the first place. As he noted in a \"Guide to Hitchhiking,\" a primer published in 2016 with his travel partner, Laura Lazzarino, the countries with the shortest average wait times are:\n\nPeople generally believe hitchhiking takes no particular know-how; and it's true that to catch one ride, you don't need to do much but stand there. But when, like Villarino, you rely entirely on hitchhiking to traverse tremendous distances, there's a great deal of skill involved to quickly and safely arrive at your destination. Villarino has cataloged every ride he has ever caught: 2,350, totaling about 100,000 miles in 90 countries, or enough to circumnavigate the globe four times. I met him on the final leg of his latest transcontinental journey, this one through Africa, about which he is writing a book with Lazzarino. For the 14 months before our meeting, Villarino had been thumbing it 20,000 miles along a route that included the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he skirted the country's civil war, and Somaliland, where he was stoned by an angry mob and held at gunpoint by border guards after refusing to pay a bribe. My plan was to join him on his travels from central Namibia to Cape Town, South Africa, a route of about 1,000 miles, or roughly the distance from New York to Florida.\n\nEqual parts Don Quixote and Che Guevara, Villarino describes his peregrinations as protests not just against boredom but also against parochialism and even capitalism. \"The 12-hour workday,\" he wrote in an early manifesto, \"is more dangerous than hitchhiking.\" As a Latin American, from a downwardly mobile middle-class family -- he watched his parents be crushed by those 12-hour days -- he defies the old characterization of hitchers as \"uptight, middle-class white people, imitating poverty,\" as James Baldwin once famously put his pin in the Beats' balloon. Villarino didn't choose to be poor, but he did choose how to be poor, and for him, hitchhiking is less about simulating poverty than about chasing after the world he wants to live in. \"The media shows images of the world that are worse than it actually is,\" he said. \"And it's a feedback loop -- those images make us think we're actually worse than we really are. It's a cycle of fear.\"\n\nWe were perched on Namibia's B4 highway as it snaked toward a coastal town called Lüderitz. Around us, the desert unscrolled in every direction. Villarino wore a big grin slapped across his face -- \"an idiotic smile is the only weapon I carry\" -- the sun squeezing through the cracks of his squinted eyelids. Broadcasting his beaming optimism, he stuck his thumb out as if telling the world: Good job!\n\nFor a modern-day hobo, he kept to a tight schedule: up at sunrise, out on the road by 8, when long-distance traffic is at its peak. He believes getting a ride or not -- and doing so safely -- is largely the responsibility of the hitchhiker. \"You don't catch a ride with your thumb,\" he said, as we waited. \"You catch it with a smile.\"\n\nBefore us was a bend in the road pocked with a huge, five-foot-wide pothole, which Villarino described as \"perfect.\" The ideal pickup spot, he explained, has not only a place for cars to pull over safely but also some obstacle or obstruction that forces them to slow down as they approach you. Standing just before or after a hill, or a train track, or a wye, a stoplight, a traffic circle, or even a speed bump would have worked just as well as our pothole. Villarino forbids hats and sunglasses because they hide your eyes from drivers; sitting is discouraged because it obscures your physical size. He intentionally dons the uniform of a backpacker -- brown hiking boots with red laces, gray synthetic cargo pants that unzip at the knees -- because people all around the world are familiar with that archetype.\n\nA Yaris hatchback groaned up the road. Villarino's gestures involve a deceptively complex process: After the driver makes eye contact, he pivots his left foot toward the car and subtly changes his hand signal from a thumbs-up to a pointing motion with his index finger in the direction he hopes to go, like the \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" dance. If the car still passes, Villarino smiles widely, all white teeth and dimples, so the driver might notice him in the rearview mirror and, seeing his genial countenance, decide to reconsider. Sometimes he folds his hands in prayer. It's a performance designed to advance the conversation between hitchhiker and driver, to evolve the communication between strangers toward mutual trust. In reply, drivers make a swirling hand motion to say they're just driving around locally; they point straight ahead to signal they're not going very far; they put a fist into their palms and make a grinding motion to show they're stopping up ahead. \"A driver has less than three seconds to make a decision,\" Villarino said. \"And that decision is made in response to unconscious factors and subliminal communication.\"\n\nHitchhiking, he believes, is a form of dialogue, not a test of strength or stamina, and he contrasted it to other \"extreme\" activities like rock climbing or sky diving. \"These activities stress independence,\" he said, \"but hitchhiking is about cooperation and dependence.\"\n\nHis techniques, which at first struck me as a little silly, paid off almost immediately. The Yaris passed, slowed down over the pothole, accelerated, and then the driver seemed to undergo a moral reckoning and pulled onto the shoulder and stopped. It was just the third car we'd seen. We had waited less than 10 minutes.\n\n\"We don't see many people like you guys around here,\" the driver, Rita, said, after we climbed in.\n\n\"Why not?\" Villarino said, a flirtatious smile creeping across his face. He put his hand on Rita's arm. \"Because we're so handsome?\"\n\nVillarino gave in to the siren song of the highway after the collapse of the Argentine economy in 2001, when he was 23. His parents moved into a smaller apartment without room for him; inflation erased people's life savings, and his friends protested and clashed with the police in the streets. Villarino, then a psychology student at the National University of Mar del Plata, about 200 miles outside of Buenos Aires, dropped out. \"I realized that you could work your whole life for a house, a career,\" he said, \"and overnight it all could vanish.\"\n\nIn 2003, he moved to Belfast, where he worked in a cheese factory, as a security guard and as a bellhop, and sent remittances back to his parents. But after a couple of years, with $4,000 in savings, he made \"the most important decision of my life\" and set off on the trip that would form the basis of his first book, \"Hitchhiking in the Axis of Evil.\" On a budget of $5 a day, he recreated, loosely, the old Hippie Trail through Europe, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, with detours in Syria and Iraq. His quest through the Middle East was motivated not just by a desire to fulfill his fantasies but also by a sense of political provocation. Iraq and Afghanistan, he felt, had been unfairly maligned by the Bush administration and the international press, and the vilification of Arabs and Middle Easterners, he thought, was a handmaiden to United States imperialism. In Belfast, he had protested the Iraq War with some Irish socialist friends but felt as if it didn't accomplish anything. Maybe he needed a grander gesture. \"I travel to depict human goodness,\" Villarino wrote, describing his motivations, \"above all because I believe that in our time, portraying examples of hospitality has a political character.\" Or as he told me: \"Hitchhiking is a process of reconciliation between the haves and have-nots. I like to put myself in a position of powerlessness and see what happens.\"\n\nAt the border crossing into Afghanistan, he almost lost his nerve and turned back. After tamping down his fears and hitchhiking to Herat, the first large city across the border from Iran, he was given free lodging in a home and slept with a knife next to his pillow, just in case -- he didn't yet believe his own gospel about the kindness of strangers. The following morning, he was ashamed to find that the hosts he feared might kidnap him had instead cooked him breakfast. He next hitched a ride straight through Taliban territory with an Indian contractor who, Villarino later learned, would himself be abducted and murdered by militants. \"Obviously I know perfectly well that there are debased people everywhere, victims, killers, people who ruminate on the hatred that the system produces,\" he writes. But he made it to Kabul without incident and found that, even in Afghanistan, just as in Iran and Iraq and Syria and Turkey, strangers invariably \"support you, they give you lodging, they get behind you and give you what you do not have, because they feel that it is necessary that you continue doing what you are doing, precisely because of the quixotic nature of the quest and perhaps sometimes because they feel your dream is also theirs.\"\n\nWhen he finished his trip, he rented a cheap room in Chiang Mai, Thailand -- sharing it with an entire circus troop -- and wrote a draft of the book, which he sold to a mainstream Spanish-language publishing house. \"Hitchhiking in the Axis of Evil\" made him a cult celebrity in Argentina. He would walk into bars peddling pirated copies of his new best seller for $5, ripping off his own publishers. In hostels, he stumbled on copies of the book, left by travelers and inscribed with dozens of testimonials from people who had been inspired to quit their jobs and hitchhike around the world. In Buenos Aires, three men tried to mug him, but when they realized who he was, the thieves gave him money. \"Hitchhiking is dangerous,\" one said, before slinking off. \"Be careful!\"\n\nSoon, Villarino set out on a journey for his next book, \"Invisible Routes,\" an attempt to hitch the length of the Americas, from Antarctica to the Arctic. At an internet cafe in Jáchal, Argentina, he received an email that caught his attention. He always hoped he would find a \"wandering princess,\" and he had a premonition that this fan, Laura Lazzarino, a 24-year-old travel agent from Rosario, Argentina, might be her. After a passionate exchange, Villarino proposed they travel to the village of Alemania, where, while hitchhiking as a 24-year-old college dropout, he had first dreamed of \"becoming a nomad.\" He would teach Lazzarino to hitchhike; she would provide him some much-needed companionship.\n\nVillarino didn't tell her at the time, but he had always feared the wages of nomadism were bachelorhood and loneliness, that \"suffering is punishment for hedonism.\" And she didn't tell him that she had already decided to run away. Not long before writing him, she had shown up to work one day to discover the owners had shuttered the shop and disappeared with the back pay they owed her. Soon after that, someone recommended \"Hitchhiking in the Axis of Evil,\" and she bought it the same day. By the second page, she was in tears. \"If he felt that way and I found it in a book,\" she would later write, \"then I must not be the only one with unease about the world that went beyond adolescent capriciousness. If there were others like me, then I wasn't alone.\"\n\nBy their third day together, they'd fallen in love. They hatched a plan: Villarino would break his contract for \"Invisible Routes,\" and they would instead write the book together as a quatre mains and self-publish it, which Lazzarino believed (correctly) would be more profitable. They spent the next 18 months hitchhiking through the Americas. They were robbed and slept on the streets when no strangers opened their homes to them, but Lazzarino finally felt free. \"I had, I'm not going to deny it, the illusion that I was the star of a movie,\" she wrote about meeting Villarino in \"Invisible Routes\" when it was published in 2014 by the publishing house they founded. The pair sold 6,000 copies in the first few months, and they've made enough money from book sales to finance their travels indefinitely.\n\nThey have been hitchhiking together ever since, and Lazzarino's blog, Los Viajes de Nena, devoted largely to the peculiarities of life on the road as a female, today has about 100,000 followers, narrowly eclipsing the readership on Villarino's site, Acróbata del Camino. The blogs bring in advertising dollars, and they recently earned $3,000 each for starring in an online commercial for the Colombian airline Avianca. They continue to live on about $7 a day each and travel as they always have, leading a life almost entirely on the highway, without a fixed address or jobs or bills. Lazzarino had been taking a brief respite from their African journey and was going to meet Villarino at the South African border. Barring disaster, they would ride together into Cape Town, the final destination in their 15-month trek.\n\n\"You slept in a location?\" said a man named George, after we boarded his 50-ton semi. We were three days into our trip, having hitched 12 rides, covering about 300 miles. The night before meeting George, we slept in a town called Grünau, in a formerly segregated shantytown, or what Namibians call a \"location.\" It was a bleak place to pass the evening, with biting dogs and passers-by warning us to be careful not to get stabbed, but Villarino couldn't have been happier. \"What could be better than this?\" he told me after we pitched our tent in a woman's dirt yard.\n\nGeorge thought just about anything would have been better than that, and he wondered aloud where Villarino \"got the guts to do what you do.\" The 23-year-old grandson of Scottish immigrants, George was our first white driver. He'd worked a few summers near Duluth, Minn. \"That's dangerous, man.\"\n\nAs we rattled south, the desert gave way to grape and wheat fields, and black thorn and bird plum trees replaced central Namibia's alien dunes. Without prompting, George said he was considering moving to Ireland, but he was afraid, because he had no idea where to start or how to make such a move. Villarino calls drivers' tendency to confess secrets or fears the taxicab effect: Once a soldier in Turkey revealed that he'd lived his whole life as a closeted gay man; in Colombia, a father took Villarino and Lazzarino to visit his two secret families, and then invited them to dinner at his wife's house, who knew nothing of the mistresses or other children.\n\n\"How do you get a job?\" George asked. \"An apartment? How do you just go and do all that? You can't just arrive with nothing.\"\n\n\"Think about the bravery of your ancestors,\" Villarino said. \"They came from Scotland to here. Think about the bravery and uncertainty that took. You'd be paying them homage by moving to Ireland.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" George said, a look of revelation on his face. \"I'd never thought of it like that before.\" Perhaps he was just swept up in the moment, but he swore to us that he was going to do it.\n\nGeorge dropped us off at a Wimpy's restaurant and gas station about three-quarters of a mile from the crossing into South Africa. We went inside to eat a burger. In three days I'd spent less than $5, and I was happy to splurge. At the entrance, an old mixed-race Namibian asked where we were going. When we told him, he warned us. \"Be careful with your stuff,\" he said. \"There are lots of gangsters in South Africa.\"\n\nVillarino relishes crossing borders on foot. As a result, his mental map of the world, he says, isn't a disparate set of unconnected places whose boundaries and textures begin at airports or bus stations or ports; the world is one quilt, the seams of each country stitched together at the edges and touching, as one social fabric gives way to another. But transitions can sometimes cause trouble. Between Somaliland and Djibouti, border guards tried to extort the couple for $60 and pointed AK-47s at them, so Villarino and Lazzarino pitched their tent in no-man's land and said, \"O.K., we'll just stay here.\" On the Malawi-Tanzania border, a money-changer tried to take half their money before Villarino snatched his cellphone and held it as ransom. Once, after being denied passage from Chile back into Argentina, a border guard pointed at a list of restrictions on the office wall and said, \"Sorry, these are our rules.\" Villarino slammed a copy of \"Hitchhiking in the Axis of Evil\" on the official's desk and said, \"These are my rules!\"\n\nWe walked into the Namibian immigration office to get an exit stamp. \"How will you get to your destination?\" the uniformed woman asked.\n\n\"I'm going to find a ride,\" Villarino said.\n\nShe looked perplexed, holding her stamp over his passport and glaring at him.\n\nAt the time of our visit, South Africa was strained with tension: The since-deposed president, Jacob Zuma, had threatened to expropriate white-owned farms for use by impoverished blacks, which sparked outrage among some landowners. Standard & Poor's had just downgraded the country's credit rating to \"junk\" status. There were an astronomical 52 murders per day -- a murder rate six times as high as that in the United States. Especially inauspicious for us was a common tactic by highway robbers to pretend to be distressed on a roadway only to then kill good Samaritans and steal their cars. None of this was apparent to us as we walked out of the immigration office and into the country. Villarino smiled as he strolled down this ribbon of virgin highway.\n\n\"Mi amor!\" Lazzarino called out when she saw us. \"I thought you'd never make it.\" She was standing on a glittering patch of asphalt and had already arranged a ride -- a Namibian farmer named Margaret, who was driving into the South African interior in order to sell some equipment for scrap metal. \"It's my day to be a saint,\" Margaret said, congratulating herself as we crammed our bodies and packs into her Toyota S.U.V., which idled on the side of the road. Juan, clearly exhausted, as was I, let Lazzarino do the talking; they held hands, and Villarino drifted off to sleep.\n\nLazzarino cuts the image less of a hobo than of a stylish spring-breaker. She dresses in khaki shorts and tank tops, and her eyes are soft and smoky, her coal-black hair lassoed by a calico scarf. Her prettiness can be a liability, but more often it's an asset: It helps them get rides, and to many drivers, who often go to extraordinary lengths to help her and Villarino, she's even more perplexing and intriguing than he is -- a female hitchhiker? In Africa? It echoes one of the general paradoxes of hitchhiking, which is also a paradox of romance: The less desperate and needy you seem, the more likely you are to be picked up, and thus the people who probably need a ride the most are the least likely to get one.\n\n\"Do you think there's a big difference being a woman traveling?\" Margaret said, touching Lazzarino's leg as she spoke.\n\n\"You have to be more careful,\" Lazzarino said. \"There are things you don't do alone: sleep in cabs with truckers, take rides from large groups of men.\" Lazzarino is more candid about danger than Villarino, and her experiences in Africa emboldened her to be slightly more forthcoming about her fears. After she was sexually assaulted by a cabdriver near Alexandria in Egypt -- Villarino ran the assailant off -- she found herself reflexively covering her crotch with her hands in public. She has never written about the actual attack or its lingering trauma, though she spoke candidly about it with me, and it prompted her to write a moving essay, \"We Aren't Unbreakable,\" on her blog. \"I'm afraid of traveling, I'm afraid of thinking, I'm afraid of writing, I'm afraid of saying what I feel,\" she wrote. \"I knew Africa was going to be difficult, but I didn't think it would be that difficult.\"\n\nWe pulled off the highway and dropped down a valley into the town of Springbok. \"It's the end of the month,\" Margaret said, nodding toward the town's main street, which was knotted with men and women and children, carrying baskets on their heads, shopping at markets. \"These people got their government assistance today. The blacks. They don't like to work.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first racist thing Margaret had said, and after she dropped us off -- with the parting wisdom that we would have a fine time in South Africa \"as long as we didn't catch a ride with any blacks\" -- I asked Villarino why he didn't do more to try to change Margaret's mind. We had, after all, been given far more rides by black drivers than white ones. \"The road isn't the place to demonstrate your politics,\" he replied, a little defensively.\n\nI understood how silence could be a survival skill, but still, it seemed to me like a position of convenience more than principle. In both their writings and their conversations, the couple seemed to skirt some of the most difficult issues raised by their type of travel, especially the way their freedom to roam might be predicated not only on fearlessness and skill but also on precisely the sort of prejudices they claim to want to repudiate. If successful hitchhiking is all about communicating and signaling and trust, I wondered, what did it mean that the greatest signal you could communicate, at least in a place like South Africa -- your skin color -- was one you couldn't change? And how did that complicate the story Villarino and Lazzarino told about the kindness of strangers?\n\nThis question would come up again, and more pointedly, on a different day in South Africa as we tried to catch a ride near two black hitchhikers. By this point we were exhausted after a string of bad luck and long waits, and I thought the presence of other hitchhikers meant we had found a good, time-tested spot. Villarino disagreed. \"We never stand near locals,\" he said, before shooing one of the men away and telling him, \"You know, it's really hard for us to get a ride with you standing there.\"\n\nVillarino's logic made sense: Any driver who would pick up a black working-class person would almost certainly not pick up a white foreigner, and the reverse was also probably true. But still, telling the guy to take a hike felt cynical. The discomfort of it all reached a climax when a German couple in a silver Subaru S.U.V. literally swerved around the black hitchers in order to offer us a ride. As we sped away, I realized Villarino's strategy had been totally right, but the whole transaction still felt wrong.\n\nOr maybe, Villarino and Lazzarino were just realists, which only seemed so odd because of the idealistic premise of their mission. They did their best to balance their dream against the demands of reality and accepted when they had to be shrewd, even cunning, to reach their destination. The circumstances demanded it. Namibia ranked near the top of Villarino's \"Best Places to Hitchhike\" list, but South Africa would turn out to rank near the bottom.\n\nThat day in Springbok after Margaret dropped us off, for example, no one picked us up. We were stranded. The apologetic smiles and hand motions of Namibians were replaced by drivers with empty passenger seats or empty truck beds gritting their teeth and pretending not to see us. White, black, everyone ignored us, except for a few people who jeered.\n\n\"We should not look like threats to them,\" Villarino said, \"but in the process of becoming fearful, they may have just gotten selfish.\"\n\nThere were other moments like this in our journey. Excruciating waits, tense exchanges, cruel indifference. One day, when traveling alone, I got marooned on a country back road in 95-degree weather and, dozens of miles from the nearest town, ran out of water. Even a cop passed me without stopping to help. Another time, a driver asked for money and slammed the door in my face when I said I was hitchhiking. We experienced real flashes of fear too, like when a driver aggressively confronted us, mistakenly thinking we intended to carjack him. And yet salvation always arrived, in one vehicle or another, sometimes in startling fashion: A white supremacist who took me far out of his way and then bought me dinner; a vineyard caretaker who let us sleep amid his grape vines; a carload of drunken men, one of whom told me, \"I hate white people -- but I love you.\" Villarino likes to say that if people treated their neighbors the way they treat strangers, there would be world peace, and I had to admit, maybe he was on to something.\n\nWe finally got out of Springbok too. It took two days. After failing to get a ride that first night, we pitched our tent on a rugby field in town, and in the morning, after another several hours waiting with our thumbs out, a white driver and black passenger in a little hatchback, both men drinking beers for breakfast, took pity on us.\n\nThe driver, Abrey, didn't explain away the unkindness that we experienced -- the racial tension, the dagger stares, the squinted glares -- but in a way, he didn't have to. Here he was, a white man and his black friend sharing Saturday cocktails and listening to R.& B. on the radio. This one little car ride instantly redeemed us and rejuvenated us, offering an almost irrational hope for what lay ahead on the road. This, I realized, was the real magic of hitchhiking: not how it supposedly affirmed your faith in the goodness of humanity, but how it could make and break that faith, over and over again, often multiple times in a single day. For someone who likes to wager on existential matters -- are people good or bad? -- I suddenly grasped how the constant daily gamble it demanded could be so addicting, even if for most people, myself included, it was an exhausting game to play, and one in which the stakes seemed, simultaneously, a little too low and a little too high for all the effort required.\n\n\"We're writing a book about the kindness of strangers,\" Villarino told Abrey, after he gave him his standard spiel about traveling from Cairo to Cape Town. Villarino and Lazzarino held hands in the back seat beside me as they puttered toward their destinies.",

Really, would you rather contemplate two of the highest-ranking officials in modern American history talking smack, or John Bolton?\n\nThe squabble inevitably brought up the question of whether Biden was going to try to challenge Trump in 2020, when he would be 77. Looks like he's interested. The other two constantly mentioned Democratic possibilities are Bernie Sanders, who'd be 79, and Elizabeth Warren, who'd be 71.\n\nOf course, Trump would be 74. And a Biden-Trump matchup would be a good way to illustrate my own personal theory of aging, which is that people can keep getting better at their work as time goes on, but that at some point it gets much harder to switch to a whole new skill set.\n\nThis is why Donald Trump as president is just a reality TV star with a different address. If Biden had the job we'd get that good old veep with veto power.\n\nSo age doesn't seem like that big of an issue. And it's nice to have a chance to start evaluating the possible Democratic contenders -- if only to distract us from the fact that we're still just a quarter of the way through Year 2.\n\nBiden's take-Trump-out performance came during an emotional talk to students at the University of Miami, as part of a campaign against sexual assaults on college campuses that was started in the Obama administration.\n\nThis is a tender subject for Biden. There's always got to be the memory of how he had failed to step up when Anita Hill was telling her harassment story, making him both the man who helped give us 25 years of Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court, and a Judiciary Committee chairman who failed to chide fellow senators for suggesting that having to listen to your boss talk about breasts is no big deal.\n\nSo he threw himself into the subject and told the students how he'd like to be back in high school so he could beat up the \"guy who ended up becoming our national leader\" for saying he could \"grab a woman anywhere and she likes it.\"\n\nIt is not actually a good idea under any circumstances to advocate an assault on the president of the United States, even if you don't refer to him by name and restrict your threats to stuff that might have happened back in junior year.\n\nAnd Biden couldn't let it go at that. \"I've been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life,\" he said. It was a disconcerting segue for those of us who have learned over the last few years to cringe whenever a politician starts discussing conversations around the lockers.\n\n\"Any guy who talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room,\" he concluded. It was a reminder that Biden has a tendency to put even noble sentiments in a distracting way.\n\nSo as a president, we'd probably get a man who could be expected to occasionally ... talk strange. Like the time he complimented Barack Obama as \"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. ...\"\n\nOf course Trump had to jump right in. This is a man who once got into a Twitter war with the father of a college basketball player who failed to thank him for the fact that his son was released from jail in China. (\"Ungrateful fool!\")\n\nAfter Biden announced he was yearning to beat the president up, Trump came back with his crying-all-the-way retort. And inevitably the nation started envisioning a septuagenarian face-off, maybe in WrestleMania. Or preferably Claymation.\n\nWho won the verbal war? I'd vote for the former vice president, if only because he seems to have gone quiet. It's been days now and we have not had a single new Biden remark to complain about. Trump, meanwhile, was busy tweeting about Crooked Hillary and threatening to \"VETO\" the spending bill, shortly before he announced he was signing it.\n\nAlso, presumably, waiting to see what shoes would drop over the weekend. If Joe Biden got into trouble over campaign financing, it wouldn't be over the legality of giving hush money to a porn star. Not the kind of plus mark we are used to considering in a presidential contest, but here we are.",

                "title": "Opinion | The Tragedy of Hubert Humphrey",
                "body": "Vietnam destined Humphrey to a miserable four years as Johnson's vice president. For his dissent against the war (his \"disloyalty\"), Humphrey suffered the brunt of Johnson's unpredictable wrath. Humphrey's advisers felt Johnson's intimidating, dismissive treatment was the reason Humphrey reversed his position on Vietnam a year later: why he defended the war as a necessary fight against Communism that provided jobs, hope and prosperity to suffering Vietnamese. It was his only way back into his boss's good graces.\n\nHumphrey's support for the war condemned him in history as a supporting player in the tragedy of Vietnam. The war alienated Humphrey from liberals, civil rights activists and young Americans -- the same people who, for decades, had loved Humphrey for his support of racial justice, full employment and the labor movement -- and ultimately cost him the presidency in 1968. Voters thought Humphrey meant continued war, while Richard Nixon promised \"an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.\"\n\nBut given what we now know the history of the Vietnam War after 1968, Hubert Humphrey -- both his life and political career -- deserves re-examination. Humphrey forces us to consider the history that might have been: the possibility of ending the Vietnam War before 1973, an expansion of the Great Society in the 1970s, a different America. Without Vietnam (and his being Johnson's vice president), Humphrey might have won in 1968. The country -- and the world -- would be drastically different.\n\nHubert Humphrey arrived in the Senate in 1949 as a liberal in an illiberal institution. Southerners held the reins of power in Congress, and they hated Humphrey for his opposition to Jim Crow segregation and \"that speech\" at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nWhile he was determined in his quest for social justice, his legislation often stalled in committee. He gravitated toward the one man who could help him: Lyndon Johnson. By 1954, Johnson needed Humphrey too -- Johnson had become Senate majority leader and wanted liberals to fall behind his leadership; Johnson concluded Humphrey was the brightest and most pragmatic of them. It was a devil's bargain: Johnson helped Humphrey with his relationships with Southerners, and Humphrey vowed to keep the liberals in line.\n\nThe partnership between Johnson and Humphrey was as close as that of two antagonists could be. When Johnson became president in November 1963, Humphrey ensured that the Civil Rights Act overcame the Senate filibuster the following summer. Johnson recognized Humphrey's talents as a legislator and orator (\"There are so many ways I envy you,\" Johnson said in 1951), and chose Humphrey as his vice president in 1964 -- but not before asking Humphrey for his backing (\"unswerving loyalty,\" as Humphrey recalled) on all his decisions. When Mississippi civil rights activists tried to force the Democratic Party to recognize them over the state's official, segregationist delegation at the 1964 national convention, it was Humphrey who, on Johnson's orders, made them back down.\n\nOnce in office, Humphrey tried to keep his commitment to Johnson, but on Vietnam his convictions conflicted with his promises. Humphrey had been suspicious of American involvement in Vietnam since the mid-1950s, but became more incredulous of the war's success after meeting with the veteran intelligence officer Edward Lansdale in 1964, who argued that a political solution to the war was possible. Humphrey sent several memos to Johnson in 1964 implying Johnson should pull back on the conflict, and that he meet with Lansdale. Johnson dismissed each one.\n\nThen, on Feb. 7, 1965, American forces were attacked at Pleiku and nine Americans were killed. Bundy, the national security adviser, sent panicked cables to Johnson demanding the United States retaliate. When Johnson asked Humphrey his thoughts on bombing North Vietnam, Humphrey responded, \"Mr. President, I don't think we should.\" Johnson ordered the bombing anyway. Then Humphrey wrote his Feb. 17 memo, and his fate was sealed for 1965.\n\nBut Johnson gave Humphrey one last chance to prove his loyalty, sending him to South Vietnam in February 1966 (almost one year to the date of his memo). On that trip, after meeting with Gen. William Westmoreland, American and Vietnamese soldiers, and South Vietnamese civilians, Humphrey convinced himself of the truth he wanted to believe: Vietnam was winnable; it was a war for democracy; it represented a global mission for peace and prosperity.\n\nHumphrey's adviser Thomas Hughes recalled that Humphrey returned from Vietnam \"saying things that were crazy\" about the virtues of the war. In a meeting of the National Security Council in June 1966, Humphrey said, \"I have come around reluctantly to accepting the wider bombing program.\"\n\nFor two years, Humphrey seemed to genuinely believe that Vietnam was a necessary war, that it represented a fight against global poverty and Communist tyranny. Humphrey convinced Johnson he believed this, that he had changed, and was welcomed back into Johnson's good graces. (After Humphrey encouraged Johnson's staff members to send the president his speeches supporting the war, Humphrey was admitted to the president's luncheons on Vietnam.)\n\nBut as he promoted the war to the American people (his main task after 1966), Humphrey was increasingly taunted by the antiwar movement. When Humphrey emerged as the Democratic candidate in 1968 -- after the assassination of Robert Kennedy and the upheaval at the Democratic National Convention -- \"Dump the Hump\" became a common motto. Signs with slogans such as \"Killer of Babies\" and \"Humphrey's Johnson's War Salesman\" regularly greeted him on the campaign trail.\n\nThe protests agonized Humphrey. \"All I had ever been as a liberal spokesman seemed lost, all that I had accomplished in significant programs was ignored. I felt robbed of my personal history,\" he recalled.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1968, Humphrey had enough of Johnson and his war, and in a speech in Salt Lake City he demanded a halt to the bombing. Humphrey called Johnson to warn him of the speech hours before. Johnson reacted coldly: \"I take it you are not asking for my advice. You're going to give the speech anyway.\" Johnson then shunned Humphrey for the remainder of 1968 -- indeed, the question remains whether Johnson favored Richard Nixon over Humphrey in the election, and whether Johnson's hatred of Humphrey led to his loss.\n\nBut what if Humphrey had not been Johnson's vice president -- what if Humphrey remained in the Senate? What if Eugene McCarthy received the vice-presidential nomination in 1964 as he wanted? McCarthy would have become Humphrey: forced to defend America's policy in Vietnam, and painted as a patsy for Johnson's War. Humphrey would be the skeptic on Vietnam, and eventual vociferous critic -- but also more palatable to the party establishment than McCarthy ever was. Divisions within the party would be united under a Humphrey candidacy in 1968, the wounds Vietnam opened among \"New Democrats\" healed by a Cold War liberal.\n\nHumphrey could have won in 1968 under these circumstances. Would Humphrey have faced the same pressure as Nixon to end the war with \"peace through honor?\" Most likely, and certainly during his first term. But Humphrey would have immediately searched for a political solution to the war -- for the conflict to end peacefully, and without further military commitment. Needless to say, he also would have continued to expand the Great Society, and not begin its long demolition, as Nixon did.\n\nFor these reasons, Humphrey represents the possibilities for a different history for the United States after 1968, particularly for Democrats looking today to rebuild their party and understand the mistakes of the past. Vietnam turned America's leading liberal into a personification of liberalism's failures. This is the tragedy of Hubert Humphrey and his Vietnam War -- one that shapes Americans today.",

                "title": "They Can't Wait: Yankees Try Leading Off With Aaron Judge",
                "body": "Along with his prodigious power, Judge has another desirable attribute at the plate: a keen eye. He led the A.L. with 127 walks last season and his on-base percentage was .422, third in baseball behind Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds and Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, who also mostly batted second in their lineups.\n\nSince each spot further down in the lineup translates into anywhere from 13 to 16 fewer at-bats over the course of the season, according to Fangraphs, the best hitters on a team are increasingly slotted second in the lineup instead of third.\n\nThe Yankees have occasionally deployed power-hitting leadoff hitters over the years -- Bobby Bonds and Alfonso Soriano among them -- but it was typically because those teams lacked a traditional leadoff hitter.\n\nDespite having Jose Altuve, one of the best hitters in baseball, the Houston Astros used George Springer, their top home run hitter, in the leadoff spot last season. It worked out well: The Astros won the World Series and Springer was the Series' most valuable player.\n\nRed Sox Manager Alex Cora, the bench coach for the Astros last season, said Springer \"controls the strike zone for how powerful he is.\"\n\n\"His swing decisions are good,\" Cora added. \"He'll swing at strikes. It's not like he's swinging at bad pitches and trying to hit home runs.\"\n\nPlacing Judge in the leadoff spot presents a trade-off: It guarantees that nobody will be on base for Judge at least once each game, but it also makes certain that no other Yankee will have more trips to the plate.\n\nBoone said he was considering using Judge as the leadoff hitter only in rare circumstances: when the Yankees were facing a left-handed pitcher and their usual leadoff hitter, the left-handed-hitting Brett Gardner, was in the lineup. That will be the case in the season opener against the Toronto left-hander J. A. Happ. When Gardner, who figures to sit more frequently against left-handers, is out of the lineup, Aaron Hicks is likely to hit leadoff.\n\nBut with three left-handed hitters -- shortstop Didi Gregorius, first baseman Greg Bird and Gardner -- in the lineup, using Judge in the leadoff spot will allow Boone to stack two right-handed hitters between each lefty, as he did on Friday when Bird batted third, Gregorius sixth and Gardner ninth. And batting the switch-hitter Neil Walker and Gardner in the Nos. 8 and 9 spots will allow Boone to have two high on-base hitters in front of Judge after his first trip to the plate.\n\n\"If you have a lefty specialist, maybe they have one bullet in the middle of the game,\" Boone said. \"They're not going to ride those three guys out. With your switch-hitters, you can kind of protect guys -- and I don't think you would ever consider it if we didn't have as deep a lineup as we do. We're going to have guys at the bottom of the order with the capability of getting on base, so you feel like the top of the order is going to have good opportunities anyway.\"\n\nBoone added, \"I think there's a strong case to be made for it, but we'll kind of see.\"\n\nThough Boone never managed before this season, these are the types of decisions that he had to consider when he interviewed for the job. The Yankees presented each managerial candidate with an exercise: Take a list of nine anonymous player statistics and configure a lineup.\n\n\"We just take the emotional attachment to a name away from the long stat lines,\" said General Manager Brian Cashman, who called the drill informative. \"We just want to see what makes the manager tick when they're putting the lineups together. You want to see how they construct one through nine and then the more important part is why.\"\n\nWhile Boone had previously considered the idea of moving Judge to the top of the order, he said he gave it more serious consideration on Thursday on the bus ride back from Fort Myers, Fla. He phoned Judge, who had stayed in Tampa, to gauge his interest.\n\nJudge said he was fine with it.\n\n\"I might have done it in a high school game once, but not really,\" Judge said before he singled, struck out twice on called strikes and grounded into a hard-hit double play.\n\nJudge added that he would not change his approach if he was moved up one spot in the order.\n\n\"If the first pitch is there, I'll take a swing,\" he said.\n\nINSIDE PITCH\n\nThe third baseman Brandon Drury was hit on the elbow by Brian Johnson and left the game. X-rays were negative, but the Yankees will know more about the severity of the injury when Drury is examined on Saturday.",

                "body": "In 1994, John Bolton said that if the United Nations Secretariat building in New York \"lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\" The quote makes an appearance nearly every time Bolton's critics compile a hit parade of his alleged infamies.\n\nMy question is: Why is the remark even controversial?\n\nThe U.N. is a never-ending scandal disguised as an everlasting hope. The hope is that dialogue can overcome distrust and collective security can be made to work in the interests of humanity. Reality says otherwise. Trust is established by deeds, not words. Collective security is a recipe for international paralysis or worse. Just ask the people of Aleppo.\n\nAs for the scandals -- where to start? U.N. peacekeepers caused a cholera epidemic in Haiti that so far has taken 10,000 lives. Yet it took U.N. headquarters six years to acknowledge responsibility. An Associated Press investigation found \"nearly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other personnel around the world\" over a 12-year period, including 300 allegations involving children. \"But only a fraction of the alleged perpetrators served jail time.\"\n\nIn Rwanda in 1994, U.N. peacekeepers all-but abandoned the country at the outset of genocide that took at least 500,000 lives. In Bosnia in 1995, U.N. peacekeepers stepped aside in Srebrenica and allowed more than 7,000 men and boys to be killed and countless women raped. It's a similar story in Sri Lanka in 2009 and South Sudan in 2016.\n\nAnd then there are comparatively lesser scandals. Like Oil for Food, the multibillion-dollar program intended to feed hungry Iraqi children and used by Saddam Hussein in a kickback scheme involving a rogue's gallery of international enablers. Or the use of U.N. schools in Gaza to store weapons aimed at Israel. Or the 2016 admission by a U.N. oversight body that some U.N. agencies \"continue to remain in a state of near denial with regard to fraud.\"",

                "body": "Her family members described how Ms. Ortega appeared to be unraveling emotionally in the months before the murders, weeping frequently, losing weight and complaining of insomnia. She also spoke cryptically about hearing disembodied voices and fearing a \"black man\" was trying to divide her family.\n\nNone of the friends and family members who have testified so far warned Marina and Kevin Krim, the couple for whom Ms. Ortega worked as a nanny, that she seemed to be going through a crisis.\n\nMs. Ortega, 55, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and faces life in prison. She is accused of fatally stabbing 2-year-old Leo Krim and his 6-year-old sister, Lucia, inside the bathroom of the Krim's Upper West Side apartment, before stabbing herself in the throat. Marina Krim discovered the grisly scene at about 5:30 p.m. on Oct. 25, 2013.\n\nMs. Ortega has entered a plea of not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect. If acquitted, she would be sent to a maximum security psychiatric hospital.\n\nHer lawyer, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg, contends Ms. Ortega has experienced hallucinations and delusions since she was 16, but her illness was never treated until after her arrest. The prosecution maintains she killed the children because she was angry at their mother over her workload.\n\nMs. Ortega's sisters, Delci Ortega, 60, and Miladys Garcia, 64, both testified that Ms. Ortega professed to love the Krim children. Despite her odd behavior, they said they had no clue that she wanted to hurt them.\n\n\"At no time did I think she was going to do this,\" Ms. Garcia said. \"It was not herself that killed them. She had become something else. Something evil.\"\n\nHer sisters said Ms. Ortega was born and raised in Santiago de Caballeros, a city in the Dominican Republic, where their father owned a bodega. When she was 16, a younger sister, Rosa, died suddenly. Ms. Ortega slipped into a black depression, unwilling to leave the house for a year, her sisters said. Eventually her parents took her to a doctor and she recovered, Ms. Garcia said.\n\nIn 1985, Ms. Ortega graduated from a local university with an accounting degree and moved to New York City, where Ms. Garcia was living in an apartment at 610 Riverside Drive. Ms. Ortega found steady work at a printing company.\n\nBy 1995, she had married and given birth to a son, Jesus Alberto Frias. Four years later, she split up with her husband and took her toddler to the Dominican Republic, her family said. She gave him to Ms. Garcia, who had returned to the island, to raise, and returned to New York to seek work.\n\nThough she worked many menial jobs, her only work as a nanny was taking care of her nephew's children in Dallas for four months in late 2006 and early 2007, the children's mother, Glendalys Garcia, 38, testified.\n\nMr. Frias said that while he and his mother were separated, she stayed in touch, calling him every day and visiting him four or five times a year. But it was not until 2008 that she returned to the Dominican Republic for an extended period, while Miladys Garcia went back to the United States.\n\nThat year, in April, a close friend of Ms. Ortega's shot himself in the head on the balcony of her childhood home, Mr. Frias said. He said his mother became a paranoid shut-in, so fearful of crime she would not let him go to baseball practice, and so scared of intruders she made him hide under the bed every time a dog barked.\n\n\"She would step outside and she would hear someone say, 'Go back, go back,'\" Miladys Garcia testified. \"She heard voices speaking to her.\"\n\nIn August, Miladys Garcia returned to take charge of Mr. Frias, and Ms. Ortega, who was gaunt and complaining of constant headaches, flew back to New York.\n\nA year and a half later, Ms. Ortega landed the job as a nanny with the Krims, through her sister, who was a nanny. She used a relative, Jacqueline Severino, as a false reference. Ms. Severino had no children, but wrote a glowing fictional review of Ms. Ortega for the Krims, according to evidence presented at trial.\n\nFor two years, Ms. Ortega thrived at the job, but then, in April 2012, she began to go to pieces emotionally, her family members testified. She quarreled with Miladys Garcia, who had the lease on the family apartment, and moved to the Bronx apartment of another relative.\n\nThat summer, she called Glendalys Garcia three or four times a day, saying she felt betrayed by her sister. \"She cried every day,\" Glendalys Garcia recalled. \"She just said 'pray for me.'\"\n\nIn June, Mr. Frias, now a senior in high school, moved to the Bronx and in with his mother. The city school system had threatened to hold him back a year, so his mother took $7,500 in cash out of her savings to pay for a private Catholic school, he said.\n\nBy September, Ms. Ortega's money was running low, and she was forced to move back in with Delci Ortega, who was now living at the family apartment on Riverside Drive, the witnesses said.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Ms. Ortega complained to Delci that the Krims changed her schedule often, playing havoc with her own plans. She also complained of skin problems from detergents.\n\nOne night she woke at 4 a.m., banged her head into the wall and plucked out her hair. \"I want to go back to the way I was before,\" Delci Ortega recalled her saying.\n\nEvery night Ms. Ortega prayed aloud in her narrow room on her twin bed, with a picture of the infant Jesus, candles and an illuminated Bible. \"She prayed to God to take away all the things she was feeling in her body and mind,\" Delci Ortega said.\n\nThe night before the murders, Ms. Ortega was \"very nervous,\" depressed and took medication for a headache, Delci Ortega said. Then Ms. Ortega told her sister to take \"good care\" of her son, \"to raise him well\" and let him know \"that I do love him.\"\n\nShe described how she had been hearing voices and had seen \"a black man\" who wanted to separate the family. Ms. Ortega said she had prayed for \"the black man\" to go away.\n\nThe next day, at 1:30 in the afternoon, Ms. Ortega visited a young neighbor in her building, Jennifer Reynosa. Ms. Ortega's eyes were darting side to side, and she said she was being followed by a \"black shadow\" that spoke to her.\n\n\"It scared me,\" Ms. Reynosa testified in Spanish. \"I looked at her and said, 'My God, this woman is crazy.\"\n\nA short time later, Ms. Ortega left for her job at the Krims.",

                "body": "His lack of a journalism background did not bother Grant Tinker, the chairman of NBC, who hired him.\n\n\"We have an awful lot of people who have a lot of experience in news,\" said Mr. Tinker. \"We are hiring a man in whom we have great faith.\"\n\nSoon after taking over, Mr. Grossman told The New York Times that his mandate was \"not to make NBC News first in the ratings\" but to build an organization \"of which we can all be proud.\"\n\n\"And there was no talk of any time frame in which it had to be done,\" he said.\n\nHe hired Tim Russert, then a political aide to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, as a vice president (before Mr. Russert became one of NBC News's top on-air personalities as the moderator of \"Meet the Press\"). And he had some successes, including \"Today's\" return as ratings leader among morning news programs and an increased regard for \"NBC Nightly News,\" which had risen briefly to No. 1 in the ratings in 1987 before falling to third place.\n\nBut after G.E.'s acquisition of RCA, NBC's parent company, in 1986, Mr. Grossman fell out of favor with his new bosses -- Jack Welch, G.E.'s chairman, and Robert C. Wright, NBC's president, as well as with Tom Brokaw, the anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\"\n\nTo Mr. Grossman, corporate ownership of news divisions (Loews controlled CBS and Capital Cities had bought ABC) had increased the pressure to make a profit.\n\n\"It was quickly apparent that the most costly thing in putting on nightly news programs is covering the hard news,\" he said in 2001 in an interview with Harry Kreisler of the Institute of International Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn his book \"Three Blind Mice\" (1991), Ken Auletta described awkward encounters between Mr. Welch and Mr. Grossman, like one in which Mr. Grossman pushed for a four percent budget increase for the news division, not the five percent cut he had been told to make.\n\n\"How dare you come in at four percent above 1986 when the word is out that you have to keep below the current budget?\" Mr. Welch shouted.\n\nAfter Mr. Grossman told him, \"That's what we need,\" Mr. Welch reproved him, saying, as quoted by Mr. Auletta: \"You guys spend more money! My kids could do better!\"\n\nThe next day, Mr. Welch, still angry, ordered Mr. Grossman to make the budget cut. But Mr. Grossman stayed for nearly two more years and supervised layoffs. He was forced out in 1988, replaced by Michael Gartner.\n\nIn an email on Friday, Mr. Brokaw wrote that NBC News had needed \"an aggressive seasoned hand\" with experience in journalism and production to \"go against Roone Arledge,\" the president of ABC News, \"and the CBS veteran team.\"\n\nHe added that Mr. Grossman had \"failed to appreciate the change represented by the arrival of Jack Welch and G.E. Jack knew the department needed fresh ideas, but Larry failed to provide them.\"\n\nLawrence Kugelmass Grossman was born in Brooklyn on June 21, 1931. His father, Nathaniel H. Kugelmass, was a lawyer; his mother, the former Rose Goldstein, was a high school administrator. His father died when Lawrence was 3, and his mother later married Nathan Grossman, also a lawyer, who adopted him.\n\nAfter attending Midwood High School -- where a journalism teacher opened his mind to the world of communication -- he graduated from Columbia University, where he studied English and political science. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Alberta Nevler, who was attending Radcliffe.\n\nBut he left Harvard after a year and joined Look magazine in the promotions department. Hoping to be a journalist, he sent story ideas to editors there but found no takers.\n\nHired in the mid-1950s by CBS to do advertising and promotion for the news division during the era of Edward R. Murrow, he continued to hope for a journalism job but did not succeed.\n\nThen, at NBC, where he was a vice president of advertising from 1962 to 1966, he met Mr. Tinker, who was then in programming; their friendship would lead Mr. Tinker to consider only Mr. Grossman for the presidency of NBC News.\n\nBut that was still nearly two decades away. After leaving NBC for the first time, he opened an advertising, marketing and communications firm. PBS, one of his clients, hired him as its president in 1976.\n\nIn 1980, he refused to bow to pressure that PBS not show \"Death of a Princess,\" a film based on a true story about a Saudi princess who had been publicly beheaded for adultery a few years earlier. Mobil Oil, a major PBS underwriter, protested. Some members of Congress spoke out. And Warren M. Christopher, the secretary of state, relayed a letter of concern from the Saudi Ambassador to the United States.\n\nMr. Grossman's stance \"was the single most important thing he did at PBS,\" Richard Wald, a professor emeritus at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and a former NBC News president, said in a telephone interview. \"He created a sense in PBS that they were doing important work, and it caused PBS to stand up straighter. It was enormously important to how PBS conducted itself thereafter.\"\n\nIn addition to his wife, who is known as Boots, and his granddaughter, Mr. Grossman is survived by three daughters, Susan Grossman, Caroline Grossman and Jennifer Grossman Peltz; a brother, Daniel; five other grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nAfter leaving NBC, he wrote \"The Electronic Republic: Reshaping Democracy in the Information Age\" (1995), about how interactive telecommunications of that era -- faxed petitions, email lobbying and 900-number telephone polls -- were providing citizens with more direct participation in politics and making them the \"new fourth estate.\"\n\nIn her review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote that Mr. Grossman expresses his ideas in \"strong, clear language, eschewing both the naïve optimism about technology that has colored so much American thinking in the past and the doomsaying of many contemporary critics.\"",

But both before and after that time -- from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2018 -- pay for troops rose at the exact rate as the index grew.\n\nMr. Trump's proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 had requested pay increases of 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent -- rates that were lower than the statutory formula, and that were ultimately ignored by Congress.\n\nThis needs context.\n\nMr. Trump accurately noted that military officials had expressed concern about degraded troop readiness and delayed modernization of supplies. Both are what officials have described as consequences of protracted combat and budget restrictions, known as sequestration, that were imposed by Congress.\n\nIt's worth noting that military spending has decreased in recent years, after the United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2011.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, total military spending swelled to more than $774 billion in 2010 from roughly $400 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That period was the peak of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars wound down, so did military spending, which declined to $583 billion by the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nWar-related spending aside, the Pentagon base budget alone was still larger in 2017 than it was in 2007 or 1997. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined.\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nIn September, Mr. Trump moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program began by President Barack Obama that shielded eligible young undocumented immigrants from deportation and gave them the right to work.\n\nIt is highly misleading to suggest that Democrats \"fought\" efforts to solidify the program into law. Democratic leaders have rejected Mr. Trump's demand to pair the program with funding for a border wall, but that is not nearly the same as not wanting a legislative solution at all.\n\nDemocrats met with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers in January to discuss a deal, during which Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested a \"clean DACA bill.\" At the meeting, Mr. Trump agreed.\n\nBut hours later, the White House said Mr. Trump's concept of a \"clean DACA bill\" included border security. Negotiations stalled, and weeks later, Democrats briefly shut down the government over the issue.\n\nIn February, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, delivered an eight-hour speech about the plight of the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in a letter dated Feb. 28, said Mr. Trump had \"thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief for Dreamers\" and listed a few examples.",

They also said that no foul play was suspected in the deaths.\n\nLuis Avila, the president of the Adams County Fair and Racing Association in Corning, Iowa, said he had known Mr. Sharp, who was a stock car racer and a board member for the association, for about a decade. \"He was a good family man,\" he said.",

                "title": "Novak Djokovic's Swoon Continues at the Miami Open",
                "body": "Before Friday, Djokovic had won 16 straight matches at the Miami Open (he did not enter last year's event) and had a 21-match unbeaten streak against players from France. He was also 58-1 against Frenchmen since 2010. But he said that Paire, ranked 47th, was the better player, which was true, at least on Friday.\n\nPaire was the aggressor with his whipping forehand, and his serve was electric, leaving Djokovic walking side to side along the baseline after each ace. When the match was over, Djokovic, the No. 9 seed, hardly seemed surprised. He shook Paire's hand, gathered his things, waved politely to the crowd and signed autographs for his fans.\n\n\"I'm not at the level they would like to see me at and I would like to see myself at,\" he said. \"But it is what it is, and life goes on.\"\n\nLess than two years ago, no player on the men's tour was better than Djokovic, who at one point in 2016 held all four Grand Slam titles.\n\nBut last July Djokovic was forced to pull out of a quarterfinal match at Wimbledon because of a sore right elbow, which had long bothered him.\n\n\"I don't want to sit here and whine about my last couple of years,\" he said. \"The truth is that it wasn't easy. Obviously, I compromised my game and the movement and everything because of the injury.\"\n\nHe did not play again until this year's Australian Open, and he came back with a tighter service motion designed to alleviate pressure on his elbow.\n\nAfter a run to the fourth round in Melbourne, Djokovic seemed to suffer a setback. He flew to Switzerland, where he had what he described only as a \"small medical intervention\" on his right elbow, raising concerns that it had deteriorated.\n\nDjokovic went to the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., but lost there in three sets to Taro Daniel, who was ranked 109th at the time. Djokovic's timing and accuracy were so off that he said he felt at times as if he were playing a tennis match for the first time. He started well, but faded in the last set, making some wild, uncharacteristic errors.\n\nAlthough he did not make such egregious mistakes against Paire, a similar pattern unfolded. The match started evenly, but soon Paire had the advantage and Djokovic looked lost again. He later said he \"ran out of gas.\"\n\nThe closest Djokovic came to pinpointing the overall problem was when he said the injury had curtailed his ability to train properly, contributing to a general loss of stamina and strength.\n\n\"That's probably it,\" he said. \"I guess that's one of the things, but it's an accumulation of different things, obviously.\"\n\nThe plan after the elbow procedure was to play at Indian Wells and Miami in order to test the joint and get time on hard courts before returning to Europe for the clay-court season. It did not work out as he had hoped.\n\nStill, Djokovic, 30, has time to regain his best form and challenge for the top titles. He said, though, that he held no expectations about whether he would be able to do that. He could not even promise that he would be able to play at the Monte Carlo Masters, which begins in about three weeks, although the event is on his schedule.\n\n\"I know that you can't be the person that you were yesterday, and the player,\" he said. \"You have to keep on training, evolving, trying to improve your game.\"",

He was humble. He was always thinking of others. He was very supportive.\"\n\nHis death comes as the department mourned the deaths of two firefighters, Lt. Christopher J. Raguso and Fire Marshal Christopher T. Zanetis, who were among service members killed last week in a United States military helicopter crash during a transport mission in western Iraq.\n\nFire officials said Mr. Davidson, who joined the department in 2003 and was assigned to Engine 69 in Upper Manhattan, was the 1,150th person in the department's history to be killed on duty.\n\n\"Firefighter Davidson bravely battled many fires and responded to countless calls for help from New Yorkers throughout his 15 years of dedicated service,\" Daniel A. Nigro, the New York City fire commissioner, said in a statement. \"Our department and our entire city mourn this tragic loss of a very brave firefighter.\"\n\nMr. Davidson was cited four times for bravery and lifesaving actions, officials said. Last year, he helped resuscitate a woman who had gone into respiratory and cardiac arrest. And in 2005, he was working the nozzle as a fire swept through room after room of a Harlem apartment building, spreading across three floors; he burned his hands but did not retreat.\n\n\"Some people might back up and start again. Mike didn't stop,\" said Pete Driscoll, a firefighter who had also responded to the call and marveled at the way Mr. Davidson handled himself in many situations. \"That was him. Once he got started on something, there was really no stopping. Whether it was a fire or an argument in the kitchen, there was no stopping him.\"\n\nOn Friday, firefighters in plainclothes arrived at the brick firehouse on West 143rd Street where Mr. Davidson was assigned, hugging and patting one another on the shoulders. Police officers delivered food. Jacqueline Harrison was among the people living nearby who brought flowers.\n\n\"It's sad, I feel for his family,\" Ms. Harrison, a teacher, said. \"He's doing something for us.\"\n\nMr. Davidson lived with his family in Floral Park, in Nassau County, in a colonial home with gray siding. His death was discussed in the neighborhood barbershop and at the pizzeria where he would bring his children. The postal worker who delivered his mail recalled how he \"always had a kind word to say.\"\n\nKim Kerekach, who lives two doors away, said he had shoveled for almost all the houses on the block after Wednesday's snowstorm. \"I was going to go to his house today and say thank you, and then we heard the news very early this morning,\" she said. \"It's very sad.\"\n\nMr. Davidson enjoyed taking his children to sports practices and fire department events, his wife said. They would play basketball in the driveway, and he recently built a snowman with his children in the yard. \"It was always about his kids,\" Ms. Davidson said. \"I could tell when he had a rough tour, but it was never about him.\"\n\nNow, his family and other firefighters were grappling with his death. He had been so vital and such a force in their lives -- \"he had this, like, aura about him,\" his brother Eric, who is also a New York City firefighter, said.\n\n\"He was invincible to me,\" said Ken Reilly, who fought fires alongside Mr. Davidson. \"I felt invincible because he was there.\"",

                "body": "An explanation for readers who may not have followed my old blog: In my later years I have found myself, unexpectedly, a fan of indie music, and began running a regular feature I called \"Friday night music,\" with performance videos by bands I like - sometimes ones I shot myself, sometimes pulled off others.\n\nWhen the blog got folded into the column, so that what are basically blog posts are listed along with regular op-ed articles, I got inhibited; what had been more personal seemed almost inappropriate alongside serious pieces on trade policy and tax reform.\n\nBut you know what? The hell with it. I'm going to revive the series, this time with an old favorite, whom I was lucky enough to catch up with (and meet!) early in their rising arc.\n\nOne of the things I love about indie bands is how different their approaches are, ranging from practically orchestral (San Fermin) to interplay among equal players (Warpaint, Lone Bellow, Wild Reeds) to bands built around a stunningly talented star (Samantha Fish). Lucius is built around Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, who always sing in unison, with awesomely gorgeous harmonies.\n\nI saw them again last night at Town Hall, where the only thing as amazing as the band was the bond with the audience. I shot a couple of videos on my phone, but the lighting was, I think, too theatrical for my equipment. Luckily someone else did a better job, so here's one snapshot from a wonderful evening:",

                "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- For the past week, Mark Zuckerberg has grappled with a backlash from lawmakers, regulators and users over Facebook's mishandling of data privacy. He has also had to face another restive group: his own employees.\n\nThe Facebook chief executive has taken multiple steps over the past few days to communicate with the social network's 25,000 employees over revelations last week that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly obtained data of 50 million Facebook users.\n\nThe Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica, featuring one of Facebook's lawyers, Paul Grewal. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Zuckerberg addressed employees directly, according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Mr. Zuckerberg also spoke with staff on Friday at a regularly scheduled employee meeting, said two people who attended the event.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on the meetings.\n\nSpeaking to Facebook's employees was a crucial prong of what has become an apology tour of sorts for Mr. Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica fallout. The revelations have raised calls for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to explain himself, as well as a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg had stayed silent on the matter for days, until he released a statement on Wednesday vowing that Facebook had to do better and gave several interviews to quell the crisis. That has not stopped pressure from Congress, with bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee saying on Friday that they had sent a formal request for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in a hearing over Facebook's \"harvesting and sale of personal information\" related to Cambridge Analytica.",

                "title": "Opinion | The New 'Superpredator' Myth",
                "body": "California has pursued this punitive approach for many years and has little to show for it. For example, the Los Angeles Police Department's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit, tasked with combating gang-related crime, achieved a temporary drop in crime. But the unit disbanded in the late 1990s after officers were accused of widespread brutality, framing of suspects and stealing then reselling drugs. The city's problem with gang violence persists.\n\nLos Angeles, Chicago and other major cities also use gang databases to subject young people to heightened surveillance, criminal penalties, deportation and inclusion in broad-reaching civil injunctions. These databases have come under scrutiny because a child may be included for arbitrary reasons, like wearing a certain color of clothing or hanging out in a particular park. Portland, Ore., eliminated its database last year after a local journalist pressed the Police Department for information about its contents and use. California also passed a law requiring that people be notified when they're added to a database and giving them the right to petition to be removed from it.\n\nSimilar concerns have been raised about the use of gang injunctions that criminalize people based on their alleged connection to a gang. The restrictions on association are often impossible to abide by, given their broad scope. In many cases, to avoid associating with \"known gang members\" means people can't see certain relatives, walk to school with certain friends or visit local parks.\n\nThe use of large-scale conspiracy cases is also problematic. A few years ago, the New York Police Department began Operation Crew Cut, which involves long-term investigations of people suspected of being gang members in high-violence areas. Working with prosecutors, the department has conducted dozens of high-profile raids in which more than 2,000 young people have been arrested on state and federal conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Police Department believes that by targeting small groups of people responsible for much of the city's gun violence, such raids have helped reduce the number of shootings over the past two years. Crime is down in targeted areas, but crime is also down across the city and the country. So it's impossible to isolate the raids as the reasons for these declines.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the gains in New York will be durable. Gang-suppression efforts in other parts of the country rarely show long-term success, in part because teenagers in poor, racially segregated communities will continue to face the challenges of insecurity and hopelessness that drive youth violence.\n\nThrough the New York Police Department's use of conspiracy cases, these raids cover a wide range of behaviors that are not acts of violence, like marijuana possession. This approach misunderstands the nature of gangs and the dense social networks inhabited by these young people targeted for prosecution. Despite overheated rhetoric from the police, politicians and the media, there is often very little evidence in these conspiracy cases of an organized hierarchical structure to these alleged gangs, which instead are often loose affiliations without purpose beyond socializing and seeking mutual safety.\n\nMost of the raids in New York have been concentrated in and around public housing developments, where teenagers have little choice but to develop continuing relationships, even if those acquaintances are involved in violence. The police claim that because these young people spend time together in a park, were previously arrested together and are seen together in Facebook posts, they are in a well-defined gang engaged in ongoing crime and violence. But that is much too simplistic.\n\nProsecutors rely heavily on these conspiracy charges, not because they involve true criminal enterprises but because they can be used as leverage against defendants. State conspiracy and federal RICO anti-racketeering statutes allow prosecutors to threaten decades of prison time based merely on evidence of associations and potentially unrelated low-level criminal charges from the past.\n\nThe gang designation also usually makes defendants ineligible for bail, giving them a stronger incentive to provide evidence against others or take a plea deal. In many cases, the only evidence against a defendant accused of violence is the testimony of someone in jail hoping to avoid prosecution. Many young people have complained to their public defenders that during questioning, the police have pressured them to hand over social media passwords, even when they have not been charged with a crime and in the absence of a parent or legal representative.\n\nMany of the defendants in the New York City cases are jailed before trial for long periods of time and face possibly decades in prison, even though a vast majority of them are not being accused of actual involvement in violence. That leaves their families to choose either getting evicted from public housing or agreeing that their child will be banned from their home forever. Communities are undermined as young people are forced to testify against their neighbors to avoid prosecution.\n\nInstead of doubling down on gang-suppression policing, New York City should invest in better alternatives. The city supports 18 Cure Violence programs to reduce shootings. The program's sites, often a substantial portion of the area's police precinct, rely on community-based \"violence interrupters\" who work with young people. New York also promulgates anti-violence public health messaging and involves young people in social activities like art programs and service projects.\n\nThe John Jay College of Criminal Justice reported last fall that neighborhoods with Cure Violence sites had significant crime reductions compared with similar control areas without them. In the East New York site run by Man Up, gun injury rates fell by 50 percent over four years; the control site in East Flatbush fell by only 5 percent. Similarly, shootings were down by 63 percent in the Save Our Streets South Bronx area, but only 17 percent in the East Harlem control neighborhood.\n\nWhen community-based alternatives are well funded and well operated, they can make a real difference in reducing gun violence. Though no one program will solve all of our violence problems, it's time to dial back the criminalization approach and give communities the resources they need to create lasting public safety.",

                "body": "On Thursday, separatist lawmakers tried to elect a new regional leader to replace Mr. Puigdemont, but the candidate of the main separatist parties, Jordi Turull, failed to gain enough votes from lawmakers in the regional assembly.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Turull was one of the five politicians who responded to a court summons, only to find that Judge Llarena had decided to send them to jail, denying them bail.\n\nMr. Turull argued that he was being sent to jail for remaining \"loyal\" to his political mandate, as an elected separatist politician. He failed to get a majority of votes in the Catalan Parliament because he was not endorsed by the smallest of the three separatist parties that hold a narrow majority of seats in the assembly. The separatist parties have been squabbling over whether to stick to the goal of seceding unilaterally from Spain, in defiance of Spanish courts and the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\n\nAdding another twist to Spain's territorial conflict over Catalonia, another Catalan politician, Marta Rovira, failed to appear in court on Friday and instead fled to Switzerland. She issued a letter explaining why she had chosen \"the path of exile,\" but Judge Llarena later added her name to his list of international arrest warrants.\n\nThe Catalan politicians face an array of charges ranging from misuse of public funds to rebellion, the most serious crime, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 years upon conviction. Thirteen of the defendants have been charged with rebellion by Judge Llarena.\n\nMr. Turull was the third candidate proposed by the main separatist parties since December, when they narrowly retained their parliamentary majority in a snap election called by Mr. Rajoy.\n\nLast October, after separatist lawmakers declared independence, Mr. Rajoy used emergency constitutional powers to oust Mr. Puigdemont's administration and place Catalonia under direct rule from Madrid. Hoping to end the separatist challenge, Mr. Rajoy then called the election, which instead left Catalonia in a political deadlock.\n\nSince then, Mr. Rajoy has repeatedly called on the separatists to form a new government that recognizes Spanish sovereignty and is not led by one of the politicians indicted by Spain's judiciary. After the failed attempt to elect Mr. Turull, the separatist parties now have two months to form a government or force Catalonia to hold a new election, a possibility that Mr. Rajoy said Friday that he hoped to avoid.\n\nThe case against Catalan separatists is now led by Judge Llarena from the Supreme Court, but two other courts, one in Madrid and another in Barcelona, are also investigating officials accused of civil disobedience and other offenses, including organizing the independence referendum held last October, even after it was declared illegal by Madrid.\n\nProsecutors want the main Catalan politicians to stand trial before the end of the year, but it is unclear whether Spain's judiciary will be able to force the extradition of those who have fled the country. Judge Llarena is reactivating an arrest warrant that he dropped last year against Mr. Puigdemont and other former members of his cabinet, amid concerns that courts in Belgium, where he fled, would instead soften the charges against them.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Puigdemont agreed to drop his bid for re-election. But he has since continued to defend the separatist cause and has traveled this month to Switzerland and Finland to attend conferences.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, protesters gathered in downtown Barcelona on Friday evening, cutting off one of the city's main avenues. The issue of independence not only has generated a conflict with Madrid but also has split Catalan society.\n\nIn December, separatist lawmakers won 47.5 percent of the votes, but that was enough for them to keep their majority of parliamentary seats, under a system of proportional representation that favors their dominance in rural areas.",

                "body": "Firefighter Davidson went looking for the flames. The fire commissioner, Daniel Nigro, described in a news conference how Firefighter Davidson \"was the nozzle man of the first-to-arrive engine company.\" The working assumption, Fire Department officials said on Friday, was that he entered the club -- where the film crew had been shooting -- and made his way down to the cellar with his team.\n\nImmediately, they struggled.\n\n\"Conditions worsened after the hose lines were brought down to the cellar,\" Commissioner Nigro said. \"They encountered heavy fire. They did the best they could. The fire continued to advance.\"\n\nOne city official briefed on the early stages of the investigation said the team's air began to run low. When the canisters have about 7 or 10 minutes of air left, they vibrate and emit an alarm, the official said. The so-called vibra-alerts went off on the canisters, and the firefighters left the building, following a \"hand line\" to find their way out, the official said.\n\n\"Somehow while backing out of that building, Firefighter Davidson was separated from the rest of the unit,\" Commissioner Nigro said.\n\nBut when they got out, they noticed Firefighter Davidson was not with them. Other firefighters went looking for him in desperation.\n\nHe was found above the cellar, on the same level of the jazz club where the film shoot had taken place, the city official said. He had apparently run out of air -- when he was found, his mask was off. The official said he may have removed it instinctively when his air supply ran out. Firefighter Davidson also had burns on his legs.\n\nHe was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he died of his injuries.\n\nFirefighter Davidson, 37, left behind a wife and four young children. He was a 15-year veteran of the department and he came from a family of firefighters. His father was one, as was a brother and at least one cousin.\n\nTwo other firefighters were injured as well; one remained hospitalized on Friday afternoon.\n\nTwo separate inquiries are underway. One, which might take a year, will examine procedures and decision-making, and will provide a step-by-step account of the fatal fire. The second will focus on the cause and origin of the fire. As of Thursday night, there were several feet of water in the cellar that promised to slow down the second inquiry. But there was no immediate indication, a city official said, that any of the electronics associated with the movie shoot had played a role in the ignition.\n\nThe filming of \"Motherless Brooklyn\" had, until Thursday night, been a source of amusement, curiosity, and minor frustration for the neighborhood.\n\nThere were the usual annoyances and slights linked to movie shooting: the traffic, the demands of the crew. Some residents, for example, were told to keep quiet during filming.\n\nBut the classic cars -- including a blue-finned Chevy Bel Air -- were a draw, and people dropped by to take photos of them. And neighbors popped by to get a peek at how the crew had restored St. Nick's Pub. There was speculation that some of the filming was not in titular Brooklyn because Court Street and its surrounding blocks, where so much of the book's action take place, were no longer sufficiently -- scruffy? authentic?\n\nSpelman Beaubrun, an actor who lives upstairs from the shuttered club, said that when he learned that there would be a major movie filmed right beneath him, he was hopeful that he might be able to wrangle a bit part and catch a break.\n\n\"Maybe something will happen, they'll give us a part,\" said Mr. Beaubrun, 54. \"It was exciting.\"\n\nThat did not happen. He was in bed before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and the next thing he remembered was smelling smoke. At first he figured it was probably just a group of crew members smoking cigarettes outside. Then he realized the smoke was much thicker.\n\n\"So I reach for my flashlight and saw it was all over the room,\" said Mr. Beaubrun, who had rented the apartment for the past five years. He leapt from bed and ran to the bathroom, intending to soak a towel that he could line the bottom of his door with to keep the smoke out while he figured out his escape.\n\nHe turned the knob of his faucet and nothing came out. Coughing and panicking, he made his way to his refrigerator for a pitcher of water. He doused his T-shirt and held it to his mouth. He groped his way to his window so he could call down to the sidewalk for help.\n\nThen he heard firefighters through his front door.\n\n\"I heard, 'We're here,'\" Mr. Beaubrun said. \"They came and grabbed me.\"\n\nThe two firefighters began to cough along with Mr. Beaubrun as they helped him down the stairs. He said the smoke was so thick he could not see their faces.\n\n\"I'm coughing, they're coughing, but they were not thinking about themselves, they were thinking about saving me,\" he said.\n\nHe gasped fresh air when the firefighters got him outside.\n\nWho or what started the fire was not clear by Friday evening. The landlord of the building, Vincent Sallozzo-Lampkin, 57, said \"nobody has a clear answer\" yet on the cause of the fire. He said that the building -- a handsome five-story Harlem rowhouse at 773 St. Nicholas Avenue, built in 1920 -- was well maintained, and that he was responsive to the needs of the five tenants who lived in apartments above the shuttered club.\n\nMost major film shoots in New York City are powered by generators, although technicians do sometimes plug into what they refer to as \"house power.\" A burning smell is common on film shoots, sometimes traceable to nothing more than a dusty light bulb. But other times, there is a more serious problem.\n\n\"It's too early to speculate,\" a Fire Department spokesman, James Long, said on Friday afternoon, adding that fire marshals were still investigating the cause and origin of the fire.\n\nThe city official who had been briefed on the early stages of the investigation said the fire appeared to have begun in the rear of the cellar.\n\nMarshals were particularly interested in the boiler and the electrical system, both of which are on the lower level, the official said.\n\nThe boiler attracted attention, the official said, because the building's landlord was having work done on it beginning either on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\n\"There was an issue with the boiler that they were addressing,\" the official said.\n\nThe official noted that the film crew had permits for two smoke machines and for cigarettes and cigars on set, but that at the moment none of those appeared to be connected to the blaze.",

East Regional final, one stop from its first Frozen Four.\n\nMiller arrived at Air Force from Providence College, which won its first N.C.A.A. title in 2015, his only year as an assistant there. He also was an assistant on the United States team that won gold at the 2017 world junior championships, and was George Gwozdecky's top lieutenant when the University of Denver won consecutive national championships in 2004 and 2005.\n\nMiller's coaching skills have long been recognized. The American Hockey Coaches Association in 2009 presented him the Terry Flanagan Award, which is given annually to an assistant hockey coach, for his career body of work.\n\nWhen U.S.A. Hockey tabbed St. Cloud State's Bob Motzko to coach the national team at the 2017 world junior championships, Motzko said Miller was one of the first coaches he wanted for his staff.\n\n\"Wherever he's been,\" Motzko said, \"he's been the glue of the coaching staff.\"\n\nGwozdecky hired Miller as a graduate assistant in 1991, his second year at Miami of Ohio, then took him to Denver's program in 1994.\n\nHe called Miller \"the diamond in that rough piece of coal\" when he hired him. Through 19 years at Denver, they forged a deep friendship. Their families have spent holidays together, and Gwozdecky is the godfather of Miller's oldest child, Alexis.\n\n\"He's an extended part of our family,\" Gwozdecky said.\n\nDenver was Miller's finishing school, where he eventually graduated to Gwozdecky's No. 1 assistant. In addition to being responsible for the defense and penalty kill, Miller became a renowned recruiter. Two of his recruits, the defensemen Matt Carle, in 2006, and Will Butcher, in 2017, won the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top men's college hockey player.\n\nLast season, Air Force led the nation in killing penalties at 89.8 percent, a remarkable number. This season, Ohio State ranks first at 89.3 percent, a year after finishing 57th among 60 teams. The Buckeyes also are fifth in goals against, at 2.11 per game.\n\nDuring last year's N.C.A.A. tournament, Air Force defenseman Johnny Hrabovsky said Miller was \"probably the smartest hockey mind I've ever been around.\" He added, \"And he's one of the funniest guys I've ever been around.\"\n\nMotzko, an assistant with Miller on Gwozdecky's staff at Miami, said Miller treated his players like his own children and the players \"bleed for him.\"\n\n\"Once you're one of his players, you're stuck with him for the rest of your life,\" Motzko said. \"He never leaves you.\"\n\nAdrian Veideman, who played on two Denver title teams and was a captain his senior year, noted that even after he graduated, Miller would stop in and visit his parents on recruiting trips to British Columbia.\n\nAt Denver, after the pregame skate on Friday mornings, Miller would lead the informal pickup game for players not in that night's lineup. \"But everyone wanted to play,\" Veideman recalled, \"because Killer was playing.\"\n\nAsked what kind of player he was in high school, Miller described himself as a \"135-pound power forward.\"\n\nMiller endears himself to players with his prodigious sports memory as well as a passion for music. He listens to everything from classical to country to opera, and has been known to belt out rap songs when among players. He said he still prepared for games by listening to the same songs, including \"Somewhere I Belong\" by Linkin Park and \"Tsunami\" by DVBBS & Borgeous.\n\nProvidence Coach Nate Leaman called hiring Miller a no-brainer. He said he valued Miller's hockey I.Q., his ability to prepare teams for championship play and his relentlessly positive disposition.\n\n\"He's a really, really easy person to like and enjoy,\" Leaman said, although he added, \"He has some bite to him.\"\n\nVeideman, who played 14 years of professional hockey, appreciated Miller's directness.\n\n\"He gets right to the point, the good and the bad,\" he said.\n\nOther than a short, unsatisfying stint as the general manager and coach for a Madison, Wis., franchise in the United States Hockey League, which ended before the team's first game, Miller has never been a head coach. He said there were a couple of college jobs he went after, but never with gusto.\n\n\"I like being a sergeant, in the fray with the guys,\" he said.\n\nGwozdecky said that Miller would make an outstanding head coach, but that his selfless nature might have kept him under the coaching radar.\n\n\"He's never, ever, ever a self-promoter,\" Gwozdecky said. \"He doesn't force you to notice him.\"\n\nMiller says he is content in Columbus, Ohio. His wife and three children, who live outside Denver, are set to join him in Ohio after the season.\n\n\"I would love to be a head coach if the right opportunity came around, sure, but that's not what motivates me,\" he said. \"If I'm never a head coach, I'm good.\"",

                "title": "De Blasio Could End Up a Witness in Case He Sought to Avoid",
                "body": "But in an ironic legal twist, Mr. de Blasio may have protested a bit too much -- or perhaps just enough to end up on the witness stand himself.\n\nOn Thursday, not for the first time, defense lawyers at the Long Island trial raised the possibility that they might call the mayor as their own witness, and have him repeat to a jury the attacks on Mr. Singh's credibility that he has made in other public places.\n\nWhile the defense has not yet subpoenaed Mr. de Blasio, such a move could result in the unprecedented spectacle of a sitting New York mayor being hauled into court to describe as dishonest a man who has described him as corrupt.\n\nThe actual defendants at the trial, in Federal District Court in Central Islip, are Edward Mangano, the onetime Nassau County executive, and John Venditto, the former town supervisor of Oyster Bay, N.Y., both of whom Mr. Singh has already pleaded guilty to bribing.\n\nFor much of the week, Mr. Singh has been testifying about the men's alleged misdeeds -- among them accusations of accepting thousands of dollars in furniture, plane tickets, discounted limousine rides and other gifts from Mr. Singh, in return for helping him get bank loans and county contracts between 2010 and 2014.\n\nAs part of his testimony, Mr. Singh said on Thursday that he had also improperly raised money for Mr. de Blasio in order to win better terms for a lease on the Water's Edge, his restaurant on city-owned property in Queens. Earlier this year, Mr. de Blasio said that he \"was thoroughly looked at\" by investigators, and that there \"were no charges brought because there was nothing there.\" On Friday, both the city's Law Department and Mr. de Blasio's personal lawyer declined to comment on the prospect of him being called as a witness.\n\nIf, however, Mr. de Blasio does get a subpoena, he would not be the first big-city mayor to be asked to testify at a federal court proceeding. In 2016, two Chicago police officers sought to compel testimony from Mayor Rahm Emanuel after Mr. Emanuel spoke about his police department's so-called code of silence in speech to the Chicago City Council.\n\nLawyers for the city tried to block the court appearance, arguing that Mr. Emanuel was busy at City Hall and had no \"actual and unique knowledge\" of the case. They contended that it was \"absurd to suggest that the mayor of the third largest city in the United States should be required to testify in a case of which he has no personal knowledge.\"\n\nNonetheless, a federal judge ruled against them and ordered Mr. Emanuel to testify. It never happened, though, because the case was settled before it went to trial.\n\nIn a similar situation, a group of black firefighters who were suing New York City for racial discrimination asked a federal judge in 2009 for permission to depose Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in their case. The judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, sided with the firefighters and allowed the deposition, ruling that Mr. Bloomberg had direct personal knowledge of the matter and that his testimony would not \"significantly interfere\" with his management of city business.\n\nBut mayors -- in New York City and elsewhere -- have only rarely appeared as witnesses at criminal proceedings. In 1988, Mayor Edward I. Koch took the stand as a prosecution witness at the federal bribery trial of Bess Myerson, his onetime cultural affairs commissioner. Ms. Myerson stood accused of attempting to influence a judge in the divorce case of her married boyfriend, Carl A. Capasso, a millionaire sewer contractor. Fidgeting and sighing, Mr. Koch showed up in court and told the jury he had \"no recollection\" of the matter. Ms. Myerson was eventually acquitted.\n\nLast year, lawyers for the Lake Boyz, a group of gang members in Fort Myers, Fla., issued a subpoena to the city's mayor, Randy Henderson, trying to force him to testify about policing practices at their trial. But the subpoena was quashed by the city's chief lawyer, Grant Alley, who successfully argued to a judge that the city's manager, not its mayor, was in charge of the police.\n\nMr. Alley, however, noted that things might turn out differently for Mr. de Blasio.\n\n\"In a criminal case, you have to err on the side of the rights of the criminal defendant,\" he said. \"If a mayor has relevant information related to a theory of defense, it will be difficult to shield that mayor from a protective order.\"",

During the morning rush, she heads from Upper Manhattan to the theater district with hordes of other commuters. But at night, when she stays past the curtain call to brush up an updo or rethread a toupee, she waits endlessly on a platform, craning her neck for trains that take forever to arrive.\n\nMs. Callahan is part of a growing army of riders who rely on the subway outside of typical commuting hours and who are poorly served by the system, according to a report by Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller.\n\nThe report, released on Friday, found that though ridership in the early morning and late at night -- fueled by a surge of tourists and employees working nontraditional hours -- has risen significantly, the subway has not kept pace, with the number of trains actually decreasing during some off-peak hours.\n\n\"While we are all focused on massive overcrowding and train delays, those traveling early in the morning and late at night are being touched by this crisis in a different way,'' Mr. Stringer said on Friday, during a news conference at a subway station in Union Square. \"They are getting robbed of a huge amount of time, at work and with their families.\"\n\nThe number of riders between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. increased by 14 percent from 2000 to 2016, but the number of trains running during those hours fell by 3 percent. Between 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. during those years, ridership increased by 13 percent, while the number of trains running increased only 3 percent.

                "title": "Egypt's Election Should Be a Lock. So Why Is President Sisi Worried?",
                "body": "The reason, experts and diplomats in Cairo say, lies within the precincts of true power in Egypt -- the military and security agencies that form the bedrock of Mr. Sisi's authority. While the vote is expected to be a stage-managed confirmation, along the lines of those in China and Russia last weekend, it has exposed a rumble of discontent inside the security establishment that appeared to rattle Mr. Sisi.\n\nTensions spiked in the early stages of the election when two former generals stepped forward to challenge him. He quickly dispatched their bids -- one man is in jail while the second, after a month in detention, disavowed his ambitions.\n\nFew analysts gave either candidate much chance of beating Mr. Sisi, who retains broad support for his tough policies against Islamist militancy. But his unsparing reaction to their bids stoked speculation that they enjoyed support from a corner of the security establishment, a smidgen of dissent that Mr. Sisi found intolerable.\n\nThe security apparatus, which removed Mr. Sisi's predecessor in 2013, poses the only real challenge to his power, said Robert Springborg, an Egypt scholar at King's College. \"The election puts that into relief,\" he said. \"It provides the shadows on the wall of the struggle that's going on underneath.\"\n\nEgypt's modern leaders are often likened to pharaohs -- all-powerful leaders of a disciplined state. Mr. Sisi has encouraged that image, whether standing imperiously at the prow of a boat plowing through the Suez Canal, or posing against the backdrop of the pyramids.\n\nBut a more apt historical analogy, some say, lies with the Mamluks, a fractious military caste that ruled Egypt in the Middle Ages. For almost three centuries, Mamluk sultans ruled from Cairo's citadel, but their supremacy rested on a cabal of restless subordinates who jockeyed for supremacy.\n\nUnder Mr. Sisi, a tight circle of generals and security chiefs wield vast economic and political power, overseeing secretive business and media empires while cracking down on any hint of opposition. Deciphering the inner workings of this circle is notoriously difficult, and the subject of a sort of Kremlinology among Western officials. But this year's election seemed to crack open the lid on hidden strains.\n\nThat the two retired generals would run for office was no surprise. Ahmed Shafik, a former air force commander who served briefly as prime minister in 2011, ran for president in 2012. Sami Anan, who led Egypt's army from 2005 to 2012, backed out of the 2014 presidential election after he was attacked in pro-state news media.\n\nBut this time they offered rare public criticism of Mr. Sisi and proposed to loosen his harsh rule.\n\nMr. Shafik, in his video message to launch his campaign, said: \"A true democracy and basic human rights are not a given.\" Mr. Anan tendered an olive branch to the young revolutionaries who helped oust President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and who have been hounded by Mr. Sisi.\n\nMr. Anan was charged with breaching military rules and thrown in jail, where aides say he has been interrogated by military officers in balaclavas. Mr. Shafik was detained at a luxury hotel for a month before he publicly withdrew his candidacy.\n\nA third military-linked candidate, an American-educated officer named Col. Ahmed Konsowa, was court-martialed in December and sentenced to six years imprisonment.\n\n\"Their attempted candidacies said to the Egyptian public that Sisi is doing a bad job and Egypt needs new leadership,\" said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy. \"That's very provocative.\"\n\nMr. Sisi rejected the notion that he pushed the other candidates out of the race.\n\n\"It is not my fault,\" he said in a television interview on Tuesday. \"I swear to God I wished there would have been more candidates for people to choose who they want. But they were not ready yet. There is no shame in this.\"\n\nWith his rivals derailed, Mr. Sisi sought to shore up his own military credentials. He announced a sweeping military drive against Islamic State militants in Sinai and last month donned his old army uniform to open a new military command center.\n\nIn improvised remarks in January, he warned that Egypt's security would be compromised \"over the dead body of the military\" -- a statement that appeared to be aimed as much at internal critics as at the militants.\n\nAnd he increased pressure on the news media. A journalist who interviewed Mr. Anan's running mate was jailed. Last month, the government expelled Bel Trew, a reporter with The Times of London, despite a private protest from the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The news organization says it has not received an explanation.\n\nTo some analysts, Mr. Sisi is merely consolidating his power as he heads into a second four-year term. Despite the repression, many Egyptians still support him as an antidote to the turmoil they suffered after the Arab Spring.\n\nThe economy is improving as a result of tough economic reforms, many prescribed by the International Monetary Fund, even if they have inflicted painful inflation on tens of millions of poor Egyptians.\n\nMr. Sisi also enjoys the support of powerful foreign allies like President Donald J. Trump and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, who paid Mr. Sisi a three-day visit this month. He has drawn closer to Egypt's old enemy, Israel, through discreet cooperation on counterterrorist operations in Sinai.\n\nBut Mr. Sisi has also made many contentious decisions. The military's prominent role in running the economy is unpopular with businessmen and some military officers, a senior western diplomat in Cairo said.\n\nThe decision to hand two Red Sea islands, Tiran and Sanafir, to Saudi Arabia in 2016 was opposed by several senior defense officials, Ms. Hawthorne said, citing Egyptian media reports.\n\n\"I think it's a vulnerability for Sisi,\" she said. \"He can try to move past it but people don't forget.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Sisi has faced talk of dissent before -- in 2015 a military court reportedly convicted 26 officers on charges of plotting to overthrow him -- experts say he is believed to enjoy staunch support among the military high command.\n\nBut they also note that he is tightening his inner circle, relying more heavily on his family. One son, Mahmoud, is a senior figure in the General Intelligence Service and has been an interlocutor in meetings with American officials in Washington. Another son works in an influential anti-corruption body.\n\nWhatever Mr. Sisi's popularity may be, this election will not be a reliable indicator. Egypt's weak, fractured opposition has already written it off. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that briefly enjoyed power until the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power in 2013, is outlawed.\n\nMr. Sisi's only challenger, Moussa Moustapha Moussa, held just two public events, one of which was attended by more journalists than supporters. \"I'm no puppet,\" he insisted to The Guardian this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Sisi called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory last weekend, having also congratulated China's Xi Jinping on his unanimous election in the National People's Congress.\n\nBoth leaders have found way to circumvent term limits, and there are signs that Mr. Sisi has similar ambitions.\n\nLast August, a member of Parliament loyal to Mr. Sisi proposed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits. In November, Mr. Sisi insisted he would not seek any changes.\n\nMr. Sadat, the opposition politician and nephew of his namesake, Egypt's former president, said a broad coalition of opposition groups had started to hunt for candidate to contest the 2022 election -- when, if the proposed constitutional changes take place, they expect to face Mr. Sisi again.\n\n\"Sisi hates politics and that's what we are seeing in this election,\" he said. \"What worries me is what will come next. Are we going to see a Chinese model? That is the issue.\"",

He was killed by the police when they stormed the supermarket.\n\nMichael R. Davidson, 37, was a 15-year veteran of the department, with four commendations for bravery, and a father of four. He was somehow separated from other firefighters as the blaze intensified and forced them to pull back.\n\nThe building, which was one of Harlem's few remaining jazz clubs before it closed, was being used for the filming of \"Motherless Brooklyn,\" based on a book by Jonathan Lethem and directed by Edward Norton.\n\n____\n\n7.

She was inspired by the movie \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\"\n\nKat Sullivan says she was abused by a teacher at the Emma Willard School. A report commissioned by the school concluded that the teacher was fired for sexual abuse -- but was still given a recommendation to teach elsewhere.\n\nThe statute of limitations has expired, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So she bought the billboards, one of which pushes a bill that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges.\n\n____\n\n8.

                "title": "Uber's Self-Driving Cars Were Struggling Before Arizona Crash",
                "body": "And there also was pressure to live up to a goal to offer a driverless car service by the end of the year and to impress top executives. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, was expected to visit Arizona in April, and leaders of the company's development group in the Phoenix area wanted to give him a glitch-free ride in an autonomous car. Mr. Khosrowshahi's trip was called \"Milestone 1: Confidence\" in the company documents.\n\nTech companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft, as well as automakers like General Motors and Toyota, have spent billions developing self-driving cars in the belief that the market for them could one day be worth trillions of dollars.\n\nThe crash, which occurred Sunday night, was a major setback for Uber, which has been trying to improve its image since Mr. Khosrowshahi replaced Travis Kalanick as the company's chief executive in a messy transfer of power last August. In February, Uber also settled a longstanding legal fight with Waymo.\n\nOn Monday, Uber halted autonomous car tests in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. It is not clear when the company will revive them.\n\nThe Tempe Police Department said it was investigating the crash, and has not determined whether the car was at fault. A Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle equipped with Uber's sensing technology struck Elaine Herzberg, 49, while it was going 40 miles an hour in a 45-mile-an-hour zone. According to the police, the car, with one safety driver and operating in autonomous mode, did not slow down before impact.\n\nA video shot from the vehicle's dashboard camera showed the safety driver looking down, away from the road. It also appeared that the driver's hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what drivers are instructed to do so they can quickly retake control of the car. Ms. Herzberg, pushing a bicycle across the street, appeared in the camera right before she was hit.\n\n\"As we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way,\" said Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman. \"We're heartbroken by what happened this week, and our cars remain grounded. We continue to assist investigators in any way we can.\"\n\nUber has been testing its self-driving cars in a regulatory vacuum in Arizona. There are few federal rules governing the testing of autonomous cars. Unlike California, where Uber had been testing since spring of 2017, Arizona state officials had taken a hands-off approach to autonomous vehicles and did not require companies to disclose how their cars were performing.\n\nWaymo and Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, reported their \"intervention\" numbers to California regulators. Uber's goals in Arizona were mentioned in internal documents -- Arizona does not have reporting requirements -- and it has not been testing self-driving cars in California long enough to be required to report them.\n\nUber's first road tests in its self-driving car effort, code-named Project Roadrunner, were actually in Pittsburgh in September 2016. The Phoenix area was added a year ago, and quickly became the company's main testing ground, with 400 employees and more than 150 autonomous cars driving local roads because of \"favorable regulatory environment, favorable weather conditions,\" according to a company document.\n\nWhen Mr. Khosrowshahi took over as Uber's chief executive, he had considered shutting down the self-driving car operations, according to two other people familiar with Mr. Khosrowshahi's thinking.\n\nBut he became convinced that it was important to Uber's long-term prospects. His visit to Phoenix was seen by the Arizona team as a critical opportunity to demonstrate their progress, according to the people familiar with the company's operations in the Phoenix area. They wanted to take him on a ride without human interventions to demonstrate that the cars could handle so-called edge cases, tricky road situations that are hard to predict.\n\n\"With autonomy, the edge cases kill you, so you've got to build out for all the edge cases,\" Mr. Khosrowshahi said at a conference in November. \"Which makes it a very, very difficult problem.\"\n\nBy September 2017, Uber's autonomous cars had driven one million miles in a year nationwide. Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents.\n\nEarly on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \"stressed\" the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed.\n\nA larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \"bad experience\" like hard braking, according to a company document.\n\nAround October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \"as quickly as possible.\" The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable.\n\nAround the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties -- one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety.\n\nWaymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location.\n\nBut Uber's autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers.\n\nMr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven.\n\nWhen Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber's operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role.\n\nUber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car's middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber's operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions.\n\nWaymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode.\n\nNot all drivers followed Uber's training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber's operations.\n\nUber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \"longer-term financial viability.\"\n\nAlready, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber's plans for autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"The collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people's minds,\" said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \"Every other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven. For Uber, it's going to be hard to shake.\"",

                "body": "Elizabeth Ann Bowser was born on Aug. 19, 1944, in Norfolk, Va. Her father, John, was a salesman, and her mother, the former Elizabeth Martin, was a homemaker.\n\nMs. Bowser graduated from Granby High School in Norfolk in 1962 and enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan University, where she joined the student newspaper and quickly displayed a trait that would mark her whole career: versatility.\n\n\"Betty Ann started off at the weekly Ohio Wesleyan Transcript as a cub reporter, covering general university news that ranged from the serious to campus hi-jinx,\" recalled Larry Heinzerling, who was her editor there and went on to a distinguished career with The Associated Press. \"In the first category was coverage of faculty efforts, eventually successful, to have Ohio Wesleyan end racial discrimination at its fraternities and sororities. The latter included a story in May 1965 on 'spring fever.' \"\n\nThat spring fever article reported on an epic campus water fight.\n\n\"A parking ticket for the Dean of Women, four flat tires for the campus policeman and free 1:30s for coeds\" -- the privilege of staying out until 1:30 a.m. -- \"were some of the side effects of the season's first all-campus water battle last Thursday night,\" Ms. Bowser wrote in her opening sentence.\n\nPursuing a double major in English and journalism, Ms. Bowser graduated in 1966 and took a job at WAVY, a Norfolk-area TV station, and later moved to WTAR, a station in the same market, where she was a co-anchor of the news report. She joined CBS in 1974.\n\nThe PBS article said she would sometimes tell the story of scoring a brief interview with Richard M. Nixon, shortly after he resigned the presidency in 1974, by dropping in at a golf course near his California home on a whim. The modest scoop impressed Walter Cronkite, the CBS anchor, enough that he made a congratulatory phone call to the recently hired Ms. Bowser, who credited the incident with elevating her profile at the network.\n\nShe ranged far and wide as a CBS correspondent, covering national stories as well as international ones like the persistent famine in parts of Africa. In 1980 she became a host of \"30 Minutes,\" a newsmagazine program aimed at teenagers. The program won some Daytime Emmys but was canceled in 1982 because of low ratings.\n\nMs. Bowser left CBS in the mid-1980s, amid cutbacks at the network. She almost left journalism as well. She intended to go into the real estate business, and did briefly. But then her husband, Chris Kelley, a former Pentagon correspondent at CBS, got a job in Texas, and the housing market went dormant.\n\n\"I was in Texas, I was unemployed and we needed money,\" she told The Virginian-Pilot in 1997, \"so I went to the local PBS station looking for some freelance work for 'NewsHour.' \"\n\nIt was a step she took reluctantly, she said. She had become disillusioned with television news and concerned about whether women in the TV news business would be allowed to \"age gracefully\" in their jobs.\n\n\"I went back kicking and screaming,\" she said. But \"NewsHour\" proved a good match; she became a general assignment correspondent, covering stories that included the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995.\n\nIn the PBS tribute, colleagues recalled her ability to connect and sympathize with ordinary people, as was evident in her work on the Oklahoma City attack, which killed 168 people. She spent weeks reporting on the friends and family members of victims, and returned several times later.\n\n\"I followed people's lives,\" she told The Virginian-Pilot. \"There are incredible stories about what people have done, all these individuals who've risen to the occasion and done amazing things with their lives.\"\n\nMs. Bowser became the \"NewsHour\" health correspondent in 2006, reporting on issues like the shortage of dental care and primary physicians in parts of the United States. In 2013 she returned to Oklahoma to report on a growing problem that has since garnered much more attention: deaths from the misuse of prescription opioids.\n\n\"The people dying from painkiller abuse don't fit the profile of illegal drug users,\" she said in the segment, which focused on a football player at the University of Oklahoma who died at 22.\n\nMs. Bowser retired in 2013. Her marriage to Mr. Kelley ended in divorce in 1996. In addition to her son Patrick, she is survived by another son, Matthew.\n\nIn the PBS tribute, Brian Gill, a cameraman, recalled working with Ms. Bowser covering Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\n\"People we talked to would open up to her,\" he said, \"because they knew that she cared about them and their situation.\"",

Dior announced the latest in designer shake-ups Monday morning: Its longtime men's designer, Kris Van Assche, is stepping down, and the former Louis Vuitton men's artistic director, Kim Jones, will take his place. On Thursday, word arrived that Lanvin's new owners are parting ways with Olivier Lapidus, its beleaguered artistic director, and installing a new chief executive. Lawsuits are flying in the case of Who Really Owns the Bamboo It Bag, as small companies and big ones fight for the right to make and market a number of very similar-looking purses.

See the towering -- and, in some cases, illuminated, St. Patrick's Day-themed, spinning or musical-instrument-shaped -- looks in our slide show.\n\nEvery week on Open Thread, we will answer a reader's fashion-related question, which you can send to us anytime via email or Twitter. Questions are edited and condensed.\n\nQ: I am passionate about the overlap of fashion and sustainability and am interested in transforming my wardrobe to collect sustainable pieces. I struggle, as most of these items are expensive. How do you suggest I go about curating a sustainable -- but not super-high-priced -- wardrobe? -- Neeharika, San Francisco\n\nA: Great question. Fashion is grappling with the question of sustainability and its responsibility to improve its practices, given the scope of its production and distribution. There are designers who have been leading this charge for years -- Stella McCartney comes to mind -- but often, shopping sustainably means paying more (which is likely one reason it hasn't yet been broadly adopted).\n\nThat's not to say improvement isn't possible. Many lower priced brands are moving in the right direction, even if in some cases incrementally.\n\nEverlane, the West Coast startup dedicated to transparency in pricing, has been moving steadily toward more sustainable manufacturing, with its denim launch last September as its first big move. The company worked with a LEED-certified sustainable denim factory that recycles 98 percent of its water, relies on alternative energy sources and repurposes its byproducts by turning them into bricks for affordable housing. Its new underwear, which will go on sale shortly, is made in a factory chosen for (among other things) its progressive manufacturing, commitment to environmental initiatives and drive to eliminate toxic chemicals from its procedures.\n\nAnd while fast fashion, at an even lower price point, is often held up as an example of just how environmentally unfriendly fashion is (and not without cause), companies like H&M are trying to improve. The retailer regularly offers \"conscious\" items that are made more sustainably (look for the telltale green hang tags) and the occasional \"Conscious Exclusive\" collection, which is made entirely of more sustainable materials. (The next arrives in stores and online on April 19.) H&M has also made long-term commitments to use only \"more sustainable\" cotton by 2020, to use more sustainable or recycled materials across all of its products by 2030 -- and to be climate-positive across its supply chain by 2040. Let's hold them to it.\n\nLastly, buying something that already exists can be greener than something new. Do what I do: Buy vintage. -- MATTHEW SCHNEIER",

                "body": "Today, companies' policies on granting early access to drugs are a confusing patchwork that tends to favor affluent and well-connected patients at leading medical centers, who have the resources and know-how to navigate the system.\n\n\"You have to be pretty sophisticated,\" said Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University who has been working with companies, including Johnson & Johnson, to develop better early-access programs. But the bill passed this week, he said, \"does somewhere between nothing and absolutely nothing to help you.\"\n\nThe bill's passage represented a victory for proponents of \"right to try,\" a campaign championed by Vice President Mike Pence and initiated by the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank that favors limiting the scope of the F.D.A. At least 38 states have passed local versions of right-to-try laws, which allow patients to sidestep F.D.A. approval once they have received permission from a company.\n\nThe right-to-try measures are opposed by a broad coalition of groups, which contend the bill will not help patients and will undermine the authority of the primary regulatory agency, the F.D.A. Four former F.D.A. commissioners, including two each from Democratic and Republican administrations, oppose the bills, as do dozens of patient groups, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Lung Association.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry, while not taking a position on the issue, has been circumspect. A spokesman for its main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said on Friday, \"We believe any legislation must truly benefit and protect patients and not disrupt the future of clinical trials, U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight and the research and approval of new medicines.\"\n\nThe bill's future is unclear. On Thursday, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, failed to secure unanimous consent in the Senate to pass the House version of the bill after it was blocked by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York. Mr. Schumer said that the Senate had already passed its version and that he wanted to work on a compromise bill.\n\nIn a statement, Senator Johnson said the next step would be to persuade the House to pass his version.\n\n\"Patients and their families are running out of time,\" Mr. Johnson said in the statement. \"I promise to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of desperate patients for their right to try -- their right to hope.\"\n\nSupporters say that right-to-try measures will eliminate an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy -- obtaining approval from the F.D.A. The legislation includes incentives they say could encourage companies to participate, such as shielding them from lawsuits and preventing the F.D.A. from considering the experiences of patients on the drugs in their eventual decisions about whether to approve them.\n\n\"All we're trying to do with Right to Try is open up another avenue for patients who need it and aren't served by existing programs,\" said Starlee Coleman, a senior policy adviser at the Goldwater Institute.\n\nThe F.D.A. already approves 99 percent of such applications, and the agency has streamlined the approval process. Drug companies also have many other reasons to bar access -- often, companies do not have enough extra product to give to patients, or they worry that the logistical work of granting access could slow efforts to get the drug approved, when it would become available to any patient who needed it.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the drug does not work -- many experimental products fail in late-stage trials.\n\n\"It\"s not going to fix the problem because there are still a lot of reasons why the companies will choose not to share their drugs,\" said Nancy Goodman, the founder and executive director of Kids v Cancer, an advocacy group that helps connect patients with companies offering early access to treatment. Ms. Goodman's son, Jacob, died in 2009 at age 10 of cancer, and she said she asked eight companies for access to their experimental therapies and was turned down every time.\n\nMs. Goodman said that dying patients do need better access to drugs during what she described as the \"uncomfortable\" period between when there is consensus that a drug works and when it reaches the market.\n\nStill, she said of the companies, \"I can understand why they say no, even though my heart was broken so many times.\"\n\nSome companies said they would continue to seek F.D.A. permission, even if a right-to-try bill becomes law.\n\n\"In our view, the F.D.A. plays a really important role,\" Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, the chief medical officer of Johnson & Johnson, said in an interview Thursday. Johnson & Johnson initiated a program in 2015 that delegates decisions about early access to a program set up by Dr. Caplan. The F.D.A., Dr. Waldstreicher said, has \"information that we don't have necessarily; they see safety and efficacy information on products that may be similar.\"\n\nIt is not always clear which patients would benefit under such a law, including those whose names are included in the bills' title. Both the House and Senate versions carry the name of Jordan McLinn, an Indiana boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative and ultimately fatal disease with no cure. Jordan and his mother, Laura McLinn, have campaigned with Mr. Pence in favor of a law, and a video about them is featured on the Goldwater Institute website.\n\nIn the video, Ms. McLinn discusses an unnamed medicine that she said she believed would allow her son to live a \"long, productive life.\" But in separate remarks at a public event in February, Ms. McLinn said that her son was in a clinical trial for an experimental drug.\n\nIn an email message Thursday, she said, \"Our journey has evolved over time with right To try,\" adding, \"There is not a drug that we are presently trying to access.\"\n\nShe said she still supported the measure because \"we should have that option if it is a pathway that makes sense and works for a treatment we may want to access in the future.\"\n\nMs. Coleman, of the Goldwater Institute, said the video about the McLinns was three years old, \"and all of Laura's statements were accurate at the time and are still reflective of the situation many patients experience.\"\n\nIn recent years, more companies have developed formal policies on what is often called \"compassionate use\" in the wake of high-profile campaigns by dying patients and their families.\n\nIn 2014, executives at the biotechnology company Chimerix received death threats after refusing to give an experimental drug to a 7-year-old boy, Josh Hardy of Virginia, who was dying from a viral infection. The company ultimately provided the drug to the boy, but the episode led to the departure of the chief executive, Kenneth I. Moch, who has since become a proponent of granting fairer access to experimental drugs. (In 2016, Josh died at age 10 of complications from a rare cancer.)\n\nBefore the Hardy family made its request, Mr. Moch said he and his company had been flooded with pleas, ranging from longtime friends to a billionaire, seeking access to the drug, brincidofovir, which still has not been approved by the F.D.A.\n\n\"You get these requests and you have to make your judgment,\" he said.\n\nSince the episode, he said dozens of companies had contacted him for advice. In addition to Ms. Goodman's group, another organization, the Reagan-Udall Foundation, also provides information about company programs.\n\nMr. Moch and others who oppose the legislation acknowledged that it has served a positive purpose.\n\n\"The only good thing I see coming out of the right-to-try legislation is the increased awareness within the medical community about expanded access,\" he said.",

                "body": "To stay in business in China, Apple has had to set up a data center there to store Chinese customers' personal information. Amazon recently had to sell equipment to its Chinese cloud services partner to comply with new Chinese rules. Facebook and Twitter are blocked in the country; newer American players, such as Snap, are not even trying to enter anymore.\n\nIn the United States, regulators have repeatedly thwarted attempts by Chinese tech groups to acquire American firms. And espionage concerns have for years kept Huawei -- one of the world's biggest suppliers of telecom gear, and a powerhouse of China's tech scene -- largely out of the American market.\n\nThe Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\n\n\"China's abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\" said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"So there's no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\"\n\nStill, as much as American companies complain about how they are treated in China, it could get even worse if Beijing amplifies its retaliation beyond the tariffs, announced Friday, on $3 billion worth of goods.\n\nChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.\n\nIt could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China's Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm's proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.\n\nBoth countries' efforts to kneecap each other's tech champions are as much about national security as economic might. Likewise with the race to dominate frontier fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation wireless internet. Mr. Trump recently blocked a hostile bid by Broadcom to buy Qualcomm. He did so not because the bidder was Chinese -- Broadcom is headquartered in Singapore -- but because the administration said the deal would weaken Qualcomm, leaving Huawei with a stronger hand to shape 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology.\n\nThis is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research -- but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\" said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"That hasn't happened before.\"\n\nChina's angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.\n\nFor most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook's and Google's, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.\n\nAnother great paroxysm of worry came in 2013, when Edward J. Snowden leaked documents showing ties between American technology providers and the National Security Agency's vast surveillance program.\n\nFor China, \"one of the major takeaways was, 'We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,'\" said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nA Communist Party-linked newsmagazine singled out the American companies that it said had penetrated most deeply into China's information infrastructure. The \"Eight Guardian Warriors,\" as they were called -- Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm -- had been able to \"drive right into China,\" the article said, whereas Huawei and another Chinese equipment maker, ZTE, had been kept out of the United States.\n\nBeijing swung into action. It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft's offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.\n\nCisco partnered with a Chinese firm to sell networking systems. Microsoft, in conjunction with a state company closely tied to the Chinese military, developed a version of Windows more suitable for China's government. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Qualcomm began working with Chinese organizations in microchips, which China imports in huge quantities to put into smartphones, computers and other electronics.\n\nDespite the boost from America's giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China's semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\n\"They are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\" said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \"But they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\"\n\nOne stumbling block for China: Attempts to scoop up foreign chip makers mostly have not worked out. State-owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology, a memory chip maker based in Idaho, for $23 billion in 2015, but regulatory worries scuttled the deal.\n\nThe Trump administration last year blocked a China-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, an Oregon-based manufacturer. And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group's plan to buy Xcerra, even though the Massachusetts-based company makes chip-testing equipment and not chips themselves.\n\nIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country's growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\n\n\"If the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\" Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \"that would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven't been addressed.\"",

                "body": "Legette-Jack said: \"I had a feeling a call was coming from Sue, so I was already smiling when I saw it. We had so much love to share in that moment.\"\n\nIn a March notable for its profusion of upsets in N.C.A.A. tournament brackets -- a spring of Sister Jean, Maryland-Baltimore County and a stunning early exit by Tennessee's women -- the presence of two No. 11 seeds in the second weekend of the women's tournament might be one of the more surprising developments. But the connections go far beyond their seedings.\n\nBuffalo and Central Michigan are the first members of the Mid-American Conference to advance to the regionals since 2007. Buffalo became the first MAC team in 22 years to earn an at-large N.C.A.A. bid, and the Bulls and the Chippewas are the only double-digit seeds left in the field. But they have cruised through the first two rounds, winning their four games by an average of 17.5 points, and now face their biggest tests yet.\n\nBuffalo will play No. 2 South Carolina, the defending national champion, on Saturday morning in Albany, a few hours before Central Michigan faces No. 2 Oregon in Spokane, Wash. Buffalo is a veteran team, led by 11 juniors and seniors, but also an international one, with four Australians, two Canadians and a Nigerian. The Bulls can pile up points. Led by guard Cierra Dillard, they scored 102 points in their first game and 86 in their upset of Florida State. They complement their scoring with composure-shattering defense.\n\n\"I think the way this team has been constructed is a masterpiece,\" point guard Stephanie Reid said. \"We're so knowledgeable of each other and this quirkiness that we have. It's something that we love.\"\n\nCentral Michigan's roster is quite different, with all but one of its 16 players hailing from Michigan. The Chippewas also can score -- their average of 82.7 points ranked seventh in the nation this season -- even though Guevara plays a short bench, with the five starters averaging nearly 32 minutes a game. Forward Tinara Moore and guard Presley Hudson power the offense; each averages more than 18 points a game.\n\nGuevara and Legette-Jack acknowledged the obvious: Their teams are underdogs. Again. But they do not see their teams as any less capable of reaching the next round, or even the Final Four.\n\n\"We are not flukes, no way,\" Legette-Jack said. \"This is the way the game is evolving: Good teams are everywhere. There is room for everybody at the top. You just have to keep working and trying to get there.\"\n\nBoth coaches know how long, and how difficult, the journey can be.\n\nGuevara, 63, is a link to the do-it-all early Title IX years of women's college athletics. In her first job, she served as the softball coach, assistant basketball coach and cheerleading coach at what is now Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan in 1978. She climbed the coaching ladder as an assistant at Ohio State, Ball State and Michigan State before getting her first head coaching job, at Michigan, in 1996.\n\nIt was there where Guevara met Legette-Jack, an assistant at Michigan State from 2000 to 2002.\n\nBut Guevara, one of the most successful coaches in Michigan women's basketball history, stepped down after a 3-13 Big Ten season in 2003. An assistant's job at Auburn led to her second chance as a head coach at Central Michigan. She has rebuilt the Chippewas into a team that won the MAC regular-season title in 2017 and the conference tournament this year.\n\n\"I admit it: My confidence was gone after what happened at Michigan,\" Guevara said. \"I doubted myself. I learned you don't give up in life when the tough times come. You put your head down, keep going, because the better times will come. I am happier than a pig in mud right now.\"\n\nLegette-Jack, 51, experienced a similar professional resurrection. A star player at Syracuse in the late 1980s, she landed her first head coaching job at Hofstra in 2002. That led to a move to Indiana in 2008, but four years later, she was fired after a 6-24 season.\n\nAfter that, she said, people in the women's basketball community told her she was unhirable, even as an assistant. Months of anxiety ended when Anucha Browne Sanders, then Buffalo's senior associate athletic director, called her to see if she would apply for its head coaching position.\n\n\"The end at Indiana was awful because I knew in my heart the job I did was good -- half my team had at least a 3.5 G.P.A., we had 3,000 fans at our games,\" Legette-Jack said. \"I just didn't win enough. It crushed me.\n\n\"Anucha called me to interview, but also warned me: I may not get the job. I told her and Buffalo: 'Give me a try. You will be hard-pressed to say no to me.' \"\n\nLegette-Jack got the job, and by 2016 the Bulls had won their first MAC tournament and made their first N.C.A.A. appearance. She has won 20 or more games in each of the past three seasons, something Buffalo had not done since the mid-1990s.\n\nShe has learned to cherish the good times, seeing Buffalo's team successes as signs of a faith rewarded, and to share them, whenever possible, with close friends like Guevara.\n\n\"Indeed, to be one of 16 teams left in Division I still playing basketball is a dream come true,\" Legette-Jack said. \"As a player or an assistant, I never accomplished that. But I never lost my faith in God or hope. I want to share that to others through this.\"",

He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 with a bachelor's in philosophy, a passion for Thoreau and an unfulfilled sense of purpose.\n\nHe left law school at George Washington University because \"he didn't admire his professors,\" his wife, Irene Liberman, said. She met him in 1967, when he was doing graduate work in English literature in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Liberman, a graphic designer, Mr. Lincoff is survived by their son, Noah, and a younger brother, Bennett.\n\nThe couple moved to New York in 1968, and Mr. Lincoff set out to write a novel about a draft dodger who waits out the Vietnam War living in Central Park. In his research he got hung up on a question: What would the protagonist eat?\n\n\"I took six months off to learn everything there was to know about survival in the city -- wild foodwise,\" Mr. Lincoff told The New York Times in 1978. \"I began to see that every tree, every weed, wasn't alike. I got into minutiae.\"\n\nHe and Ms. Liberman led forays to gather edible plants for suppers of acorn burgers, pokeweed shoots and Juneberry pies. In 1971, the couple went on their first walk with the New York Mycological Society. \"I said, 'Let's promise not to eat anything,' and we ate nine wild mushrooms that day,\" Ms. Liberman recalled. Mr. Lincoff had found his calling.\n\nHe steeped himself in mushroom studies and eventually persuaded the New York Botanical Garden to let him teach despite his lack of formal credentials. In 1978, he published a book on toxic and hallucinogenic mushroom poisoning and was soon recruited to write the National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, which was published in 1981 and is in its 31st printing. He served for nine years as president of the North American Mycological Association.\n\n(Mr. Lincoff had never tried hallucinogenic mushrooms when he wrote the poisoning book, Ms. Liberman said, but when he finally did, in the 1980s, \"He was delighted.\" At least once, he found the hallucinogen Gymnopilus junonius, known as \"laughing gym,\" in his beloved Central Park. \"I came out of the park with a big cluster of it and I walked smack into three cops,\" he said. \"I thought, 'This is it.' But they just said, 'You better be careful if you don't know those.' I said, 'I'm going to take these back and study them.' \")\n\nMr. Lincoff helped found the Telluride Mushroom Festivalin 1981. It was conceived by a Denver radiologist and mushroom-lover as an alternative to stuffier mycological conferences.\n\n\"We had an 'Edibility Unknown' party every year that would horrify serious professional mycologists,\" said the alternative-medicine guru Dr. Andrew Weil, another festival co-founder. No one ever got sick, Dr. Weil said, though the pioneers discovered that one species tasted like old tires.\n\nMr. Lincoff was in demand as a tour leader and headed expeditions to more than 30 countries, on every continent except Antarctica. When he was back in New York, he served as lecture coordinator and animating presence of the New York Mycological Society. Three years ago, he decided that unlike other mushroom clubs, the society should hold walks year round.\n\nThis past New Year's Day, with the mercury around 10 degrees, he led a walk in Central Park.\n\n\"We walked for two hours and found almost 50 species,\" said Vivien Tartter, one of Mr. Lincoff's many acolytes. Someone found a cluster of Eutypella scoparia -- - tiny hairlike tufts too small to be seen without a loupe -- growing on a twig. \"Gary was very excited.\"",

                "title": "Trump's Tariff Moves: What You Need to Know",
                "body": "Of course, the worst fears of exporters could still come true. The fact that the Chinese did not hit bigger American targets from the outset suggests that the Beijing government is guarding its most potent weapons. If Mr. Trump decides to raise the ante on the Chinese, things could get ugly.\n\nChina is the United States' third-largest export market, and a top destination for agricultural goods harvested in Trump strongholds. Beijing said that it would impose a 15 percent tariff on goods like fresh fruit, nuts, wine and seamless steel pipes, and that it was considering a second round of levies, of 25 percent, on other goods, including aluminum.\n\nMr. Trump campaigned on the promise to resurrect American steel mills, and vowed to bring those factory jobs back by stemming the flow of cheap imports into the country. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with undervalued steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country.\n\nThat's why the administration initially announced that its steel and aluminum tariffs would apply worldwide. While the tariffs are explicitly based on national security -- the White House argues that the nation is vulnerable because it relies too much on foreign steel and aluminum -- there are obvious economic reasons for trying to increase domestic production.\n\nBut the 25 percent charge on foreign steel and 10 percent levy on aluminum will, at least for now, not apply to a broad group of allies that includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and the European Union. The excluded nations sent more than half of the $29 billion in steel imports that landed on American shores last year. The administration has said it may require those countries to limit their exports to the United States, and will decide whether to make the reprieve permanent by May 1.\n\nSo, what's the point of tariffs on steel if they don't apply to the biggest foreign suppliers? The short answer is that no one -- not the lawyers representing allies, the lobbyists representing steel mills or the nation's foremost experts on trade -- knows for sure what the president's grand plan is.\n\nA good bet, trade experts say, is that Mr. Trump is using the tariffs as a bargaining chip to bring corral allies into adopting a harder line on China.\n\nThe White House also invited other countries to negotiate their own exemptions, raising the possibility that Japan, the fifth-largest supplier of steel to American companies, could also get a break.\n\nPersuading allies to turn away cheap Chinese steel could force China to cut down production even more than it was already planning to.\n\nIf the Chinese face such a disruption, \"then they have to eat all that steel,\" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I think that's the game that's going on here, to try to get the other countries to play the same game we are, and push the problems back on the Chinese.\"\n\nAs for helping the domestic producers, the early indications point in the other direction. Several steel companies are now trading lower than they were before Mr. Trump announced the tariffs, after getting an initial lift from the news.\n\nMaking metals more expensive will annoy a lot of manufacturers -- tens of thousands -- that buy them to produce everything from washing machines to beer cans. But will the tariffs make it impossible for those companies to do business?\n\nAnswering that question will be the task of the Commerce Department, which this week invited American executives to begin applying for exemptions. To avoid paying the tariffs on the steel or aluminum they import, businesses will need to show that American mills don't make the piece they use, or at least don't make enough.\n\nRailroads make some of their tracks with Japanese steel, for example, because of its unique ability to withstand pressure and extreme temperatures.\n\nCompanies have to file separate requests for each type of steel or aluminum product they use. In theory, dozens of companies could ask about the same product and one company could file requests for dozens of slightly different products.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the department could \"grant blanket requests\" if it became clear that a particular product couldn't be found in the United States.\n\nAmerican producers, meanwhile, will have the right to file an objection to each exclusion plea, piling on yet more paperwork.\n\nThe Commerce Department anticipates 4,500 requests and 1,500 challenges. It will take up to 90 days for the department to respond to each.",

                "title": "Olly Wilson, 80, Dies; Composer Meshed African and Western Music",
                "body": "In his review of the New York Philharmonic's performance of \"Sometimes\" in 1977, Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote that the tenor William Brown \"handled its vocally excruciating demands to gripping effect,\" and that the \"sibilants, gurgles and moans\" from the tape \"produce an almost suffocating mood of isolation and sadness.\"\n\nMr. Wilson, whose music was played by orchestras around the world, aligned himself with an African-American musical heritage that includes Frank Johnson, a 19th-century bugler, bandleader and composer; Harry Burleigh, a composer and baritone soloist; and the contemporary composer T. J. Anderson. His other influences, he said, ranged from Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Varèse to Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.\n\n\"Music is experience consciously transformed, and because my experience has been an African-American experience, I think it expresses that,\" he told Bruce Duffie, a radio producer and interviewer in 1997, when asked if he were conveying African-American ideas in his pieces.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mr. Wilson wrote a viola concerto for Marcus Thompson that had an improvisatory feel, with riffs associated with a jazz saxophone or trumpet and a bluesy middle section. Mr. Thompson said in a telephone interview that, compared with other viola concertos, Mr. Wilson's was special \"because he writes from a completely different medium; he's a jazz player who's written all sorts of chamber music.\"\n\nThe work, titled \"Viola Concerto,\" had its long-delayed premiere in 2012 with the Rochester Philharmonic. Stuart Low, of The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, called the work \"searing and haunting.\"\n\nOlly Woodrow Wilson Jr. was born in St. Louis on Sept. 7, 1937. His father was a butler and a cook; his mother, the former Alma Grace Peoples, was a domestic. Theirs was the second African-American family in their neighborhood.\n\nThe elder Mr. Wilson, a tenor who sang in choirs around St. Louis, \"insisted that all of his children learn to play the piano,\" Olly Wilson told an oral history project at Berkeley. \"He thought understanding the piano was fundamental.\"\n\nYoung Olly, who also played the clarinet and string bass, was in an acoustic band as a teenager that played local bars in St. Louis when Chuck Berry arrived one day; this was early in Mr. Berry's rise to stardom, when he performed with house bands. The band -- with Mr. Wilson on piano alongside a drummer, a bassist and a saxophonist -- tried in vain to keep up with Mr. Berry, who brought an amplifier to augment his guitar.\n\n\"So we played, but it really didn't make any difference because you couldn't hear us,\" Mr. Wilson said in the oral history. \"He just wiped us out -- bang, bang, bang -- on his guitar.\"\n\nRecalling Mr. Berry's famous duck walk, which made women in the bar swoon, Mr. Wilson said, \"We considered that silly music because we were jazz aficionados.\" He and his friends were more enamored of Mr. Parker and Mr. Davis.\n\nMr. Wilson graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a bachelor's degree in music, then earned a master's in music composition from the University of Illinois and a Ph.D. in music composition from the University of Iowa, where his dissertation was a long piece called \"Three Movements for Orchestra.\"\n\nAfter teaching at Florida A&M University from 1960 to 1965, Mr. Wilson joined the faculty of Oberlin's Conservatory of Music. In addition to teaching music theory and composition, he established a course in African-American music as well as the school's electronic music studio. After his departure, the studio turned into a program known as \"Technology in Music and the Related Arts.\"\n\n\"With electronic media,\" he told a music department publication at Berkeley in 1997, \"you can work with sound like a sculptor or painter.\"\n\nHe joined Berkeley in 1970 -- where he would teach until 2002 -- and soon after received the Guggenheim grant to study music in Ghana. His year in West Africa was the inspiration for an orchestral piece, \"Shango Memory,\" a celebration of Shango, a Nigerian deity, and what he called the \"cultural memory of African ideas reflected in music.\"\n\nAt Berkeley, he was also an administrator dealing with affirmative action in the 1970s and '80s and helped diversify the music curriculum.\n\nMr. Wilson received numerous commissions, including two from the conductor Seiji Ozawa -- one when Mr. Ozawa was music director of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, the second when he was music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAnother commissioned work, for the Boston Musica Viva ensemble, was \"A City Called Heaven,\" which has elements of swing music, blues, spirituals and boogie-woogie. It was first performed in 1989.\n\n\"You can't think of that piece without being overwhelmed by its imagination,\" said Mr. Thompson, who is also a music professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"It's all based on the spirituality that's common in the black community. He had the courage and skill to do it, and that's how black culture appears in the classical canon.\"\n\nIn addition to his daughter,Mr. Wilson is survived by his wife, the former Elouise Woods; his son, Kent; his sisters Marion Palmer and Barbara Washington; and six grandchildren.\n\nMr. Wilson described in the oral history how his work as a scholar affected his work as a composer.\n\n\"Because I studied African music and the history of African-American music doesn't necessarily mean that I consciously drawn upon that when I do my work as a creative artist,\" he said. \"But I think the pleasure that that gives me and the understanding that gives me does reflect positively on what I do as a creative artist.\"",

He accepted a post as ambassador to Canada last September, saying his role as first vice president was \"more about protocol than about executive action.\" He arrived in Lima, the capital, shortly after midnight on Friday to assume the presidency, one day after turning 55.\n\nHe told reporters waiting at the airport that they should have \"faith and optimism\" and that \"Peru always comes first.\" But he has been mostly silent in the past few weeks as Mr. Kuczynski's administration unraveled.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have spoken highly of him in recent days and reiterated his need for a supportive legislature.\n\n\"We need to give Martín Vizcarra room to govern, just like we did before with Mr. Kuczynski,\" said Congressman Héctor Becerril of the Popular Force party.\n\nStill, he may have a hard time finding unwavering political allies. Mr. Vizcarra is not a member of Mr. Kuczynski's party, Peruanos por el Kambio (Peruvians for Change), which was created by the former leader so that its initials, P.P.K., would match the initials of his name. (The correct spelling is cambio.)\n\nBut even if he were, the party holds a small minority of seats in Congress. Popular Force, a right-wing party controlled by the daughter of former President Alberto K. Fujimori, is the largest faction in Congress, and it played a decisive role in Mr. Kuczynski's ouster.\n\nMr. Kuczynski had narrowly averted a previous impeachment effort last December, with the help of Mr. Fujimori's son, but his support collapsed this week after tapes surfaced that appeared to discredit the son and his allies as they tried to mobilize support for Mr. Kuczynski.\n\n\"Martín Vizcarra's government should be one of national unity that ends the confrontation between the executive and Parliament,\" Congressman Gilbert Violeta, the party's president and one of Mr. Kuczynski's most loyal supporters, wrote in a post on Twitter. \"We are all disgusted by national politics. We owe the country an apology.\"\n\nMercedes Aráoz, who was the second vice president under Mr. Kuczynski, will remain in that role. She had been serving as prime minister since last year.\n\nMr. Vizcarra will need a prime minister to lead his cabinet. He may need to appoint members of the opposition Popular Force to his cabinet, to gain its support for legislation.\n\n\"I suppose he is going to build a an administration of national coalition where surely he will assign a ministerial cabinet composed of different political parties,\" said Congressman Carlos Tubino, a Popular Force member.\n\nMinutes after Mr. Kuczynski's resignation was accepted by Congress, the police removed fencing that had prevented cars from getting near his private home in the upscale district of San Isidro.\n\nProsecutors said they had started investigating tapes that showed key allies of Mr. Kuczynski appearing to entice a lawmaker to back the former president in an impeachment vote.\n\nA judge has scheduled a hearing for Saturday at 10 a.m. to decide whether to bar Mr. Kuczynski from leaving the country, since he no longer has presidential immunity. Prosecutors are investigating accusations that he was involved in money-laundering activities.",

Masterminded by the Kyoto-based architecture firm Sankakuya, known for restoring ancient shrines and temples in Japan, the minimalist pale-wood space was constructed exclusively using traditional joinery techniques and centuries-old Japanese timber: hinoki (Japanese cypress) for the eight-person dining room and ash for a smaller six-person private room. The former will also feature a 200-year-old sushi counter that was aged for 40 years in chef Noz's hometown of Hokkaido.\n\nInside, guests will eat a 17-25 course meal, complete with appetizers, the chef's choice of sushi and dessert (a sweet tamago dish or seasonal fresh fruit). Originally trained in Tokyo-style Edomae sushi, chef Noz will merge the tradition's pared-down staples, which focus on the simplicity of the fish and rice, with his own contemporary spin, offering simmered octopus with chickpea paste and nigiri served with boiled Scottish langoustines. \"I try not to add or subtract unnecessarily,\" Noz says of his approach. The $300-including-gratuity omakase will include seafood flown in from the Tsukiji market in Tokyo, which will be preserved in an Edomae ice chest, a traditional storage container that keeps fish fresh using only blocks of ice. Sushi Noz will be the first restaurant in the United States to have one.\n\n\"So many people have helped us on our way, including many craftsmen in Japan,\" chef Noz says of the restaurant, which took four years to conceive and complete alongside his business partners, the restaurateurs Josh and David Foulquier. From the architects to the artisans, the fishermen and farmers, \"their spirits reside in this restaurant, and it is my job to finally pass their spirits to the diners.\" Sushi Noz opens March 30 at 181 East 78th Street, 917-388-1792 -- ALEXIS CHEUNG",

In Honolulu, we lived in my maternal grandparents' house, a wooden plantation-style 1940s bungalow shaded from the late-afternoon sun by a copse of pink and red torch ginger that had grown so tall and dense that its leaves poked through the sea-glass-green jalousies. In New York we lived in an apartment building overlooking the East River, where all the residents with children would leave their front doors open during the day, turning the floors into a honeycombed communal space for us kids to inhabit. In Texas, before we moved into a house, we lived in a one-bedroom apartment, my brother and I sleeping in the living room on soft cotton chairs that unfolded into futon-like mattresses.\n\nBecause we were so transitory, I grew up associating the idea of home less with a physical structure than with the objects that inhabited it: A place became ours, mine, only when the 19th-century pine chest was positioned in the living room, when the early American quilt with its worn calico squares was hung on the wall, when our books had been unpacked and placed on the shelves.\n\nThat was one ritual. The other was the leave-taking. And with each place we departed, we left something behind, some evidence that, yes, we had been there, and that for a short time, we had possessed that space. In Baltimore, we left dozens of parrot tulips that had been my father's pride; in Texas, a vegetable garden of wildly curling squash vines where once there had been only silt; in Irvine, Calif. -- still, in the mid-'80s, rising from an empty stretch of clay -- my brother's and my heights, notched into a white-painted door frame.\n\nThe instinct to mark the place one has occupied in the world is not particular to humans -- animals create middens or nests made of saliva or dung or bits of straw -- but it is, like the very act of collecting objects, one of the impulses from which culture is born and defined. None of us can resist announcing our presence, no matter how temporal or humble our dwelling might be; we write ourselves into walls as a way of protesting the relentlessness, the uncaringness, of time.\n\nSometimes, as in the case of Alfred Liechtenstein and his wife, Alice, that transcription becomes its own sort of decoration. The Austrian castle they live in with their children is both a puzzle and a palimpsest: The first of its 52 rooms were built in the 12th century; Alfred's family has inhabited it since the 19th. Throughout, proof of ghosts from the past can be seen -- ancestors who have painted their portraits on its ceilings, who have etched their names into its surfaces. Now, the couple is leaving their own mark: a trippy Op Art-inspired elevator; a collection of furniture from contemporary designers. The castle is on loan to them from the generations that will succeed them, but for the moment, it's theirs.\n\nThen there's the Polish-French artist Marc Camille Chaimowicz, whose uncategorizable art -- holistically conceived room-size works that smudge the line between decoration and installation -- is inseparable from his own London apartments, one of which he is vacating after nearly 40 years. To see it now, unchanged and preserved since the 1970s, with its palette of eau de nil and peach, its glossy painted chairs and hand-drawn murals, is to wonder whether you are seeing one man's home ... or an artistic projection of an idea of home. But it is also a reminder of our eternal, collective search for someplace we can call our own, for the place we imagine when we shut our eyes -- a yearning that takes on special meaning in our current age of refugees, who endure one of the great cruelties of the human experience: being forced to forsake their land for another. Chaimowicz's father, too, was a refugee, from a different era; it's perhaps not surprising that his very art is the recreation, again and again, of home. We say, with our spaces: We were here. Will you remember us? Memory is brief. But a house endures.",

                "body": "What's set Shawn Mendes apart from other rising pop stars is his ability to pump up traditional singer-songwriter dynamics with steroids, making grand anthems out of interior thoughts and moods. \"In My Blood,\" the first single from his forthcoming third album, has some of that muscle, especially in the chorus. But it stands out from his earlier hits for just how scarred and forlorn he sounds: \"Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing/I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something/I can take to ease my mind, slowly.\" In the hook, his blood is biological determinism: the thing that won't let him succumb. But in the rest of the song, his blood -- his self -- is what's betraying him. It's a tug-of-war, not a triumph. JON CARAMANICA",

                "title": "Perú tiene nuevo presidente después de que el Congreso aceptó la renuncia de Kuczynski",
                "body": "LIMA -- Martín Vizcarra, un ingeniero de bajo perfil quien también fungía como embajador en Canadá y el primer vicepresidente de Perú, asumió el cargo presidencial después de la renuncia del presidente Pedro Pablo Kuczynski debido a un escándalo de corrupción.\n\nLa abrupta renuncia de Kuczynski el 21 de marzo, después de darse a conocer videos y grabaciones que implicaban a su abogado, un ministro y otros socios políticos en la supuesta compra de votos de congresistas de oposición a cambio de obras públicas, convulsionó a la nación andina, aunque no fue sorpresa para muchos peruanos. El mandatario estaba gravemente debilitado por un escándalo que se había desarrollado a lo largo de varios meses y había evitado por un estrecho margen un esfuerzo previo para destituirlo en diciembre.\n\nEl Congreso de Perú se reunió este viernes para debatir si aceptaba la renuncia de Kuczynski o procedía con un proceso de destitución formal. Finalmente, los legisladores votaron y aceptaron con 105 votos a favor, 11 en contra y 4 abstenciones la dimisión del mandatario.\n\nVizcarra, de 55 años, fue gobernador de su región natal, Moquegua, en el sur de Perú, la cual incluye partes de la costa desértica y los Andes, pero no buscó la reelección. En vez de eso, dos años después, se unió a la candidatura de Kuczynski como su primer vicepresidente. Durante la campaña, Kuczynski llamó a Vizcarra una de sus dos \"pólizas de seguro\" en caso de que muriera en el cargo.\n\nVizcarra también fue parte del primer gabinete de Kuczynski, como ministro de Transportes y Comunicaciones, pero fue obligado a renunciar después de que legisladores de oposición cuestionaron sus planes para un aeropuerto en Cusco, el destino turístico más importante de Perú. Después de su renuncia, fue designado embajador en Canadá.\n\nEl 22 de marzo, un juez peruano dijo que consideraría una solicitud para prohibir que Kuczynski abandonara Perú si el Congreso controlado por la oposición decidía aceptar la renuncia, lo que pondría fin a su inmunidad presidencial y lo haría vulnerable a enfrentar un proceso judicial.\n\nPerú tiene una larga historia de presidentes involucrados en escándalos de corrupción.\n\nAlberto Fujimori desvió decenas de millones de dólares en recursos del gobierno en la década de los noventa para comprar los favores de políticos y periodistas, y hasta hace poco estaba preso en Perú; Alejandro Toledo, fue acusado de recibir un soborno de 20 millones de dólares a principios de la década de los 2000 del gigante de la construcción Odebrecht, y Ollanta Humala y su esposa fueron puestos bajo prisión preventiva por acusaciones de lavado de dinero por 3 millones de dólares en dinero de Odebrecht para financiar su campaña presidencial en 2011.\n\nFue Fujimori quien, después de quejarse de que el Congreso no lo dejaba gobernar, ayudó a establecer el sistema político actual. Envió tanques para disolver el Congreso en 1992 y después elaboró una nueva Constitución que estableció un Congreso unicameral sin Senado.\n\n\"Un sistema de gobierno requiere pesos y contrapesos, y los perdimos con nuestra Constitución actual\", dijo César Landa, un abogado constitucionalista. \"Tener una sola cámara en el Congreso no es parte de nuestra tradición democrática\".\n\nEn 2016, Kuczynski derrotó por un estrecho margen a la hija mayor de Fujimori, Keiko, pero el partido de derecha que ella lidera, Fuerza Popular, logró el dominio del Congreso. El partido del presidente ganó una pequeña minoría.\n\n\"Kuczynski estaba políticamente aislado y era virtualmente rehén de las exigencias del sector de Keiko Fujimori\", dijo Cynthia McClintock, una profesora de Ciencias Políticas en la Universidad George Washington.\n\nEl débil gobierno de Kuczynski puso a prueba los límites de las frágiles instituciones democráticas peruanas. Durante sus diecinueve meses en el cargo, el Congreso despidió u obligó a renunciar a tres ministros y, en determinado momento, forzó la renovación de todo el gabinete en una moción de no confianza; los legisladores también intentaron despedir al fiscal general y a cuatro jueces del Tribunal Constitucional. En dos ocasiones, acusó a Kuczynski de \"incapacidad moral permanente\" y cada vez organizó una votación para determinar su destino.\n\n\"Estamos regresando a la dictadura, pero desde el Congreso\", dijo este mes Mercedes Aráoz, quien fungió como presidenta del Consejo de Ministros.\n\nLos enemigos de Kuczynski negaron que el Congreso haya abusado de sus poderes.\n\n\"Pienso que hemos fortalecido la democracia\", dijo Úrsula Letona, una legisladora de Fuerza Popular. \"No hemos fracturado todo el gobierno, simplemente hemos pavimentado el camino para una transición presidencial ordenada y constitucional\".\n\nQueda abierta la pregunta de si Vizcarra tendrá más espacio para gobernar. \"Personalmente, estoy muy optimista\", dijo Carlos Tubino, también un congresista de Fuerza Popular.\n\nExisten varias propuestas para reinstaurar el Senado, lo cual dificultaría que un solo grupo tuviera tanto poder legislativo. Pero sería una lucha difícil.\n\n\"La gente no quiere dos cámaras del Congreso porque significa gastos adicionales\", dijo Letona, quien dirige el comité del Congreso encargado de las enmiendas constitucionales. \"Y no somos una rama del gobierno especialmente querida\".\n\nEl camino político de Kuczynski estaba íntimamente ligado con la familia Fujimori.\n\nKenji Fujimori, el hijo menor del expresidente, se enfrentó abiertamente a su hermana mayor, Keiko, y dio cierto respaldo a Kuczynski. Kenji se separó de Fuerza Popular en diciembre pasado junto con otros nueve diputados, que se abstuvieron en el voto de destitución de Kuczynski y con eso evitaron que fuera removido del cargo. Poco tiempo después, el entonces presidente otorgó un indulto por razones médicas a Alberto Fujimori y este salió de prisión, donde cumplía una condena por delitos de lesa humanidad. Kuczynski llevó a Kenji y a por lo menos tres legisladores de esa nueva facción a sus viajes a bordo del avión presidencial.\n\nEste mes, ante el segundo intento de destitución en su contra, Kuczynski de nuevo buscó el apoyo de Kenji. \"Sin duda me va a apoyar\", dijo al periódico local Trome.\n\nY fue cuando resurgieron las antiguas tácticas estilo Fujimori.\n\nUn aliado de Keiko buscó reunirse con Kenji y sus aliados, aduciendo que consideraba cambiar de bando para respaldar al presidente. Sin avisarle, grabó a Kenji con sus asistentes cuando este presumía que aquellos que apoyaban a Kuczynski conseguían beneficios a cambio.\n\nEl partido de Keiko difundió los videos el martes, con lo que dio un golpe final a Kuczynski y posiblemente terminó con las aspiraciones políticas de su propio hermano. El Congreso ahora analiza desaforar a Kenji y a otros legisladores que aparecen en los videos.\n\nLa extorsión y la vigilancia secreta recordaron a las tácticas usadas por el principal asesor de Alberto Fujimori, Vladimiro Montesinos, un exespía que grabó cientos de encuentros en los cuales entregó sobornos. Fue uno de los llamados vladivideos el que apuntaló la caída de Fujimori en 2000.",

                "body": "In other words, it's rare. When was the last time a pair of Delawareans were playing key roles this late in March? \"It's been a while,\" Stan Waterman, the coach at Sanford School in Hockessin, said. \"I can't really remember.\"\n\nIn fact, there have been more N.B.A. players to hail from Montana (10) than from Delaware (seven).\n\nAnd while, yes, Montana outdoes Delaware in size and population, consider that the District of Columbia has 10 times the N.B.A. pedigree with only two-thirds the population.\n\nThere are some reasons for this. Delaware was one of two states last year in which more high school boys played lacrosse than basketball (the other was Maryland). There were more athletes playing soccer and football in the state as well.\n\nRichard Lapchick, chairman of the sports business management program at Central Florida and director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, said a lack of opportunity and top-flight competition in the state was mostly to blame. Delaware has only 59 high schools competing in one division in high school basketball.\n\nDoug Gelbert, author of \"The Great(er) Delaware Sports Book,\" which at 250 pages is a light read, said the state's best players, such as the former Temple and N.B.A. guard Terence Stansbury, frequently traveled to Philadelphia from Newark, Del., for pickup games.\n\n\"It's not just hoops,\" Gelbert wrote in an email. \"Delaware has not had a national reputation in any sport since the days of rifle shooting about 100 years ago. Maybe billiards in the '30s.\"\n\nThis has left Delaware with a bit of a Napoleon complex when it comes to basketball. It isn't new. Spencer Dunkley, a University of Delaware center, once guaranteed to \"walk back to Delaware\" if his 13th-seeded team lost to fourth-seeded Louisville in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Naturally, it lost.\n\nThat was in 1993. Delaware remains winless in the tournament. And the state is eager to shed its reputation as the drive-through interlude on Interstate 95 between two basketball hotbeds: Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\n\"Those states kind of ate us up,\" Mark Sills, a longtime organizer of youth basketball, said of Pennsylvania and Maryland. \"We've had great players come out of here, but we don't get the publicity.\"\n\nEven the publicity that players do get can have a sarcastic undertone. Villanova Coach Jay Wright, for instance, has called DiVincenzo the Michael Jordan of Delaware. The nickname has stuck.\n\n\"He's certainly put Delaware on a map,\" DiVincenzo's high school coach, Brendan Haley, said.\n\nDuval has put Delaware on his leg. The area code, 302, is tattooed on his left calf, along with the name of his hometown (Newcastle). Though he went outside the state for high school, he maintains a connection. Last year, he returned to Sanford School, which serves grades K through 12, and where he went to middle school, to attend prom.\n\n\"A lot of people are excited,\" Scott Klatzkin, the voice of University of Delaware athletics, said. \"There's a lot of in-state pride when somebody from little old Delaware makes it.\"\n\nFolks in Delaware still talk wistfully about Walter Davis, an adopted son (he was born in North Carolina and played at Sanford for a year, in 1973), and A.J. English, who was born in Wilmington and played two years in the N.B.A. for the Washington Bullets.\n\nThe closest comparison for a player like Duval, however, might be Delle Donne, the Wilmington native and transcendent superstar for the University of Delaware, who was drafted second over all by the W.N.B.A.'s Chicago Sky in 2013. Sills said he had detected a clear uptick in interest among girls' players thanks to her influence.\n\nThe hope, Waterman said, is that Duval will have a similar impact for boys' basketball in the state.\n\n\"Whether he wants to, he's carrying the flag right now,\" said Waterman, a five-time state champion. \"Everybody's watching him. All the youth league coaches are talking about him and putting his face out there for all the youngsters.\"\n\nUnlike Duval, DiVincenzo stayed around for high school, winning two state titles for Salesianum School in Wilmington. Before he showed up, the program had won more than 150 state titles in sports like swimming, cross-country and lacrosse, but never in basketball.\n\nAt Salesianum on Tuesday, some students were wearing Villanova hats, which is understandable considering the campus is 30 miles away. Faculty members were eager to reminisce about DiVincenzo's dazzling days as a Sallie.\n\n\"He had some natural athleticism that was just so rare,\" the Rev. Chris Beretta, the school's principal (and assistant basketball coach), said. \"You just never knew. He could all of a sudden just turn it on.\"\n\nBut after DiVincenzo's junior year, a rumor began to circulate that he was planning to leave to attend a prep school out of state. It grew pervasive enough that Villanova's coaches called Haley at Salesianum to assure him that they were not the ones encouraging him to leave.\n\n\"If you're in Delaware, that's almost the thing to do,\" Haley said. \"People start talking about where you're going to go.\"\n\nClearly, it touched a nerve. This is a problem for Delaware. Its best players are too often emigrating out because the competition outside the state is superior.\n\n\"Better opportunities, bigger stage,\" Duval said about his own decision to leave, a phrase Delawareans have heard often. Eric Ayala, a top 2018 prospect who is committed to play at Maryland, left Sanford after his sophomore year to attend a prep school in Connecticut and then IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla.\n\n\"Sometimes you're that big fish in a small pond,\" Waterman said. \"And they just want to try different things.\"\n\nDiVincenzo stayed, won another state title, and has been considered basketball royalty in the state ever since.\n\n\"Every time I go home now, everyone knows who I am,\" he said. \"They welcome me anywhere.\"\n\nIt would be easy for the adulation to go to his head. But even the Michael Jordan of Delaware still plays with a chip on his shoulder.\n\n\"I don't want to say he's better than Walter Davis,\" Haley said, \"but he's given Delaware a new look.\"",

Individual members of many species also have unique and identifiable genetic profiles. As with human beings, a large number of variations in a relatively short sequence of DNA can make it possible to identify an individual and to distinguish that animal from other members of the species.\n\nDNA fingerprinting is commercially available for dogs, for example, for purposes like identifying a lost or stolen pet or tracing a pedigree.\n\nThe approach is also used in wildlife research. It can determine whether an isolated population of wild birds has become too inbred for survival, for instance, so that some can be moved elsewhere.\n\nScientists at the University of Arizona and elsewhere also have turned to genetic fingerprinting to identify individual animals that have been poached or illegally trafficked, as well as to determine where imported animals came from.",

After spending a day doing laundry, catching up with his wife and three daughters, and waiting for his visa to be processed, he flew to Anaheim. Two days later, Kelly, 37, played in his first N.H.L. game in almost a year.\n\nHis whirlwind season started with a failed tryout with the Edmonton Oilers. Kelly joined the minor league affiliate of the Ottawa Senators and contemplated retirement before his Olympic opportunity emerged.\n\nWhen the N.H.L. decided not to participate in the Olympics, it provided a unique opportunity for a variety of less-heralded players from around the globe. The Olympics, in turn, provided a path to the N.H.L. for some players.\n\nLike Kelly, the American Brian Gionta is a longtime N.H.L. veteran who captained his national team in Pyeongchang after failing to secure a pro contract at the start of the 2017-18 season. Also like Kelly, Gionta parlayed his Olympic experience into an N.H.L. contract, signing with the Boston Bruins in the days after the United States' quarterfinal loss to the Czech Republic. He skipped the closing ceremony and reported to the Bruins shortly thereafter.",

                "body": "John R. Bolton, chosen by President Trump to be his new national security adviser, does not need the Senate's endorsement to succeed H. R. McMaster in the job. But in 2005, the extraordinary refusal to confirm his nomination to be President George W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations by a Republican-controlled committee is worth revisiting for what it revealed about Mr. Bolton and what it may portend for our national security.\n\nOne moment singularly derailed his nomination. Testifying before the usually staid Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April 2005, Carl W. Ford Jr. -- the former assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research -- called Mr. Bolton a \"kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\" and a \"serial abuser\" of people beneath him in the chain of command. Mr. Ford -- a self-described conservative Republican and Bush supporter -- made vivid an emerging portrait of Mr. Bolton as a bully who repeatedly sought retribution against career intelligence analysts with the temerity to contradict him.\n\nBack then, I served as the Democratic staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee. Under the leadership of its Republican chairman, Richard Lugar of Indiana, and its ranking member, Joe Biden of Delaware, a Democrat, the committee was an oasis of comity in an increasingly rabid Washington. Even my Republican colleagues were surprised at Mr. Bolton's nomination. After all, this was a man who had famously declared: \"There's no such thing as the United Nations,\" adding that if the United Nations building in New York \"lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\n\nMr. Bolton, President Bush's under secretary of state for arms control and international security, had a general disdain for diplomacy that rankled several Republican members of the committee, including George Voinovich of Ohio and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. Mr. Lugar had quietly counseled the administration not to nominate him.\n\nThat disdain, in and of itself, did not sink his nomination. Rather, it was the testimony we heard and evidence we uncovered that Mr. Bolton had a habit of twisting intelligence to back his bellicosity and sought to remove anyone who objected.",

He said the dead and wounded included many children, and some of the wounded were in critical condition.\n\nMost of the victims were civilians, but some were security officials, said the Helmand governor, Hayatullah Hayat. Mr. Hayat blamed the Taliban for the attack. \"The enemy has been beaten up badly by our brave security forces across Helmand Province, and now they are trying to take revenge on civilians,\" he said.\n\nHelmand is heavily dominated by the Taliban, and there are no known Islamic State operations in the area. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest bombing, but similar attacks in Lashkar Gah have been attributed to the Taliban.\n\nThe bombing came two days after an attack in Kabul claimed by the Islamic State, and aimed at a Shiite shrine; 33 died there in the latest count, according to police in Kabul.\n\nAccording to Abdul Razaq, one of the spectators, the matches had ended and spectators joined in the evening prayer before filtering out of the area. Then the car bomb exploded at the gates, where security officials were stationed.",

                "title": "A Downtown Jewelry Store That Celebrates the Personal",
                "body": "Foundrae, the fine jewelry line Beth Bugdaycay launched with her husband, Murat, in 2015, is all about the mix. Wearers stack rings, pair enameled charms and create custom, 18-karat gold pieces that pull from the brand's 60-strong lexicon of symbols -- a triangle for transformation, a lion's head for strength, a Bowen knot for true love. Foundrae's first store, opening next month at 52 Lispenard Street in downtown Manhattan, takes a similarly eclectic approach: An antique roll-top jeweler's bench (where shoppers can see items get soldered) and a suite of 1970s-era rounded leather armchairs by Giancarlo Piretti for Castelli sit alongside contemporary pieces such as a moody, eight-by-ten-foot landscape painted by Tyler Hays of the furniture company BDDW. \"To me it's totally Hudson River Valley,\" says Bugdaycay, a longtime admirer of American arts and crafts. (Before she was a designer, she was a kid growing up in the border town of Brownsville, Tex., and paying close attention to her parents, who made traditional rocking chairs.)\n\nThe Bugdaycays bought the TriBeCa building -- a long-abandoned cast-iron warehouse built in 1867 -- three years before starting the brand, with the intention of converting it to a townhouse that they would then sell. Beth was still working as CEO of the ready-to-wear label Rebecca Taylor, but feeling, she says, \"ready to start a new chapter.\" And so she, Murat and their two children moved in themselves, leaving room on the ground floor for Foundrae's offices and an eventual store. \"It was a lifestyle decision that gives us access to our family,\" says Murat. \"The kids come after school to give us hugs and say 'Hi.'\" That homey quality is apparent in the public space as well. There are even shelves lined with books, including those by 20th-century American writer Jessamyn West, Bugdaycay's ancestor, that visitors can borrow. Nearby is a weighty 1930s dictionary in which a young Bugdaycay was made to look up words, and a playful sculpture by the London-based artist Stephane Godec that shows a young girl in danger of sleepwalking off the edge of a cliff made of books. \"People use our pieces to tell their own stories,\" says Bugdaycay, who has seemingly inherited an instinct for narrative. \"In my former role, I got so removed from the customer. With this, you end up being friends with everyone.\"\n\nCertainly the store marks the latest chapter in Foundrae's story. Next, Bugdaycay will release a line of men's pieces (oversized signets, slinky guard chains) for fall, and a new set of symbols is due for 2019. Among the jewelry that she wears on a daily basis is a medallion with a five-pointed star, the Foundrae symbol for dream. \"But there's also an arrow,\" she says, \"for action. The idea is to dream forward.\"",

                "title": "Budget Deal in Congress Includes Help for Affordable Housing",
                "body": "Still, according to industry analysts, the measure won't come close to closing the gap created by the tax cut at a time when close to half of renters struggle to pay their rent and homelessness is rising in cities around the country.\n\nThe low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986 as part of Congress's last sweeping tax overhaul and has grown into a $9 billion-a-year program. It funds virtually all of the nation's subsidized rental housing and created a sprawling industry of affordable-housing developers that now makes up a vital piece of the safety net -- especially in high-cost cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThe program has been increasingly important in the aftermath of the Great Recession. As home building declined sharply and millennials entered the work force, the number of renters surged by about one million a year -- the largest increase since the baby-boom generation came of age in the 1970s, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.\n\nRents have risen steadily since 2010, pushing the housing cost burden to punishing levels. In 2017, about half of renters paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and a quarter paid more than half.\n\nThe program works like this: The federal government allocates tax credits that are eventually awarded to affordable-housing developers. The credits are then transferred to corporations -- usually banks -- in exchange for investments in rental buildings for tenants who do not make more than 60 percent of the area's median income. The corporations then use the credits as a coupon against future taxes.\n\nThe tax bill that was passed last year amounted to a big cut in the program, because with corporations now paying lower tax rates, the credits aren't as valuable as they once were. Even though the law has been in place only for a few months, it has already forced developers and municipal affordable-housing agencies to scramble to make up millions in funding shortfalls that emerged as the value of the credits fell.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco, the tax law will reduce the growth of subsidized affordable housing by 235,000 units over the next decade, compounding an existing shortage.\n\nMs. Cantwell's provision would increase the number of tax credits available, but only for four years. It would also change the income cutoff for affordable projects, making it easier for developers to secure financing.\n\nStill, even if the increase in tax credits was made permanent, only about 30 percent of the decline in affordable housing due to last year's tax cuts would be restored, according to Novogradac's analysis.\n\n\"It's going to help us reclaim some of the units lost by tax reform,\" said Michael Novogradac, the firm's managing partner. \"However, there's still a large shortage of units that aren't going to get produced or preserved, so additional action is going to be needed to get back to the production levels before tax reform.\"",

                "title": "Oleg Tabakov, Revered Russian Actor and Teacher, Is Dead at 82",
                "body": "When he died in Moscow on March 12 at 82, among those expressing condolences was President Vladimir V. Putin, who, two years earlier, on the occasion of Mr. Tabakov's 80th birthday, had called him \"a man of exceptional talent and energy\" and praised him for \"uniting like-minded creative people around your captivating plans and ideas.\" A memorial for him last week at the theater lasted hours as people lined up to walk past his coffin.\n\nThe theater, announcing his death on its website, said he had been ill for some time.\n\nMr. Tabakov was known in Russia for a wide range of film roles, racking up his first credit in 1957 and his last 60 years later. One of his most acclaimed performances was as the title character in \"Oblomov,\" Nikita Mikhalkov's version of Ivan Goncharov's 1859 novel, which played at film festivals internationally to considerable acclaim. He also appeared in \"Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears,\" which won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1981. But in Russia children knew him as the voice of a cat in \"Three From Prostokvashino,\" an animated film from 1978.\n\nMr. Tabakov's biggest impact, though, was in the theater, as an actor, director and teacher. He led several important theater companies during his long career, championing not only Chekhov and the other Russian classics but also new works and directors and plays from abroad. Many actors who studied under him became well-known stars in Russia, and the theaters he ran drew healthy crowds.\n\nThe Sovremennik Theater, which he helped found in the 1950s, posted a tribute to him on its website. \"On the stage, in the frame and in life,\" it said, \"he was able to combine artistry with immediacy.\"\n\nOleg Pavlovich Tabakov was born on Aug. 17, 1935, in Saratov, in what is now southwestern Russia. His father, Pavel, and mother, Maria Andreyevna Berezovskaya, were doctors. According to his biography on the Moscow Art Theater website, his first public performance came when he was 7 in a skit for an amateur night in which he uttered the line, \"Daddy, give me a gun!\"\n\nAs a teenager he began performing with a children's theater group, and in 1953 he was accepted into the Moscow Art Theater School. In 1956 he and several other young actors founded the Sovremennik Theater, concentrating on contemporary works and hoping to re-energize what they viewed as a moribund theatrical scene by employing the acting principles of Konstantin Stanislavski. He joined the troupe full time once he graduated in 1957, and in 1970 he became its director, holding that post for six years.\n\nMr. Tabakov began teaching in the mid-1970s, forming a theater company for his young actors and carving a performing space, the Tabakerka Theater, out of an old coal warehouse. He joined the Moscow Art Theater troupe in the early 1980s. In 1986, he took over leadership of its theater school, a post he held until 2000, when he became producing artistic director of the Chekhov Moscow Art Theater, one of two branches formed when the theater split in the 1980s.\n\nAs an educator, Mr. Tabakov would handpick promising students from throughout the country for his master classes. In a 2010 meeting with Mr. Putin, in which he was asking for additional financial support, he told him matter-of-factly, \"I suppose if you put together a national team, then half of the players will be mine.\"\n\nBefore and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Tabakov actively worked to spread Russian theater to the West, staging productions in England, Denmark, Hungary, Germany, Finland, Austria and the United States. He also exported his teaching skills, forming partnerships with groups like the Juilliard School in New York and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. And he brought Western works to Russian audiences, sometimes with mixed results.\n\nIn 2015, the Russian Orthodox Church showed its displeasure with a production of Oscar Wilde's \"An Ideal Husband\" by throwing a pig's head with Mr. Tabakov's name scrawled on it at the theater.\n\nEven with his ever-expanding résumé, Mr. Tabakov continued to act.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Tabakov and the Russian actress Olga Yakovleva performed A. R. Gurney's two-hander, \"Love Letters,\" a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1990, at Tabakerka. One Russian reviewer, at least, seemed to think that their effort had vastly improved the work.\n\n\"The play by Albert Gurney, a prominent American dramatist, is professionally written and spot-on when it comes to character sketching, but no more than that,\" the critic, Nina Agisheva, wrote. \"Now, Tabakov and Yakovleva have fashioned it into a proper Russian psychological novel, complete with the subtle nuances of soul-searching, a host of recognizable particulars, and an absorbing tragic love story.\"\n\nMr. Tabakov's marriage to the actress Lyudmila Krylova ended in divorce in 1994. His survivors include his second wife, the actress Marina Zudina; two sons, Pavel and Anton; two daughters, Aleksandra and Maria; and several grandchildren.\n\nDuring the 1988 class he taught in New York, Mr. Tabakov spoke to the students about Chekhov's use of evening scenes and their symbolism.\n\n\"Just remember in the evening, or in the forest, or at a river, when the sun is about to set -- it's a very specific atmosphere,\" he said. \"The day is dying, the moon is born, and something inside us goes away. Think about it. It's very important. The entire first act is the end of the day, the moment when the birds go quiet. Tears come to your eyes very easily, and you can't understand why. The moment when human beings and nature are most connected. I don't know how it happens in America, but that's how it happens in Russia.\"",

                "body": "\"This is China stepping out of the shadows to play a more assertive role and to use its increasing leverage globally to get what it wants,\" said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nOnly the United States voted against the latest proposal at the 47-member council, though 17 other countries abstained. Several of those, including Japan, Australia and Switzerland, criticized the initiative.\n\n\"Cooperation is the essence of our time, which calls for mutual benefits to realize the goal of human rights for all,\" Mr. Yu told the council, adding: \"We live on the same earth, we face common challenges.\"\n\n\"It is clear that China is attempting through this resolution to weaken the U.N. human rights system and the norms underpinning it,\" countered Jason Mack, a senior United States diplomat.\n\nThe earlier Chinese resolution, passed by the council in June, promoted in similar language the key contribution of development \"to the enjoyment of all human rights.\" The People's Daily, the voice of the Communist Party, celebrated its adoption as a setback to the West's monopoly on rights and \"a major shift in the global human rights conversation.\"\n\nThe resolution adopted on Friday appeared to double down on that objective. The first draft circulated by Chinese diplomats echoed language from the speeches of President Xi Jinping, extolling the merits of \"win-win\" cooperation and the importance of \"forging a new form of international relations.\"\n\nMuch of that language disappeared before Friday's vote as Japan and Western governments pushed back and Chinese diplomats accepted amendments.\n\nBut language that remained could still weaken the fundamental principles of international law and practice, and pose a lasting obstacle to the promotion and protection of human rights, Valentin Zellweger, Switzerland's ambassador, warned the council.\n\n\"This is mutually beneficial cooperation for who?\" asked John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe resolution focuses on cooperation between states, he said, and lacked any balancing reference to the rights of individuals, the role of civil society groups or the mandate of the Human Rights Council to monitor abuses.\n\nIt's an approach backed by other governments on the defensive over their rights records. Initial co-sponsors of the resolution included Syria, Egypt, Myanmar, Venezuela, Burundi, Cambodia and Eritrea.\n\nChina itself, Mr. Fisher noted, had repeatedly taken reprisals against rights activists who tried to engage with the United Nations on its record, and had not cooperated with United Nations mechanisms monitoring civil and political rights.\n\nA reminder of how harshly China can approach human rights issues came on Friday when five United Nations experts expressed alarm over the deteriorating health of Jiang Tianyong, a prominent lawyer whose defense of other activists earned him a two-year prison sentence in November on incitement charges.\n\nMr. Jiang was reportedly weak, they said, and suffering severe memory loss, raising fears that he might have been drugged, tortured or ill treated in detention.\n\n\"Their interest is to promote their system and their system is not in accordance with universal human rights, so they are using every opportunity to distort human rights to protect their system,\" said Mr. Piccone, of the Brookings Institution. \"That's the ideological battle we are entering into in a whole new way.\"",

Similarly, Zoetis, a major livestock drugmaker, said on its website that farmers \"will see little difference\" in its tetracycline feed additives, beyond needing the appropriate paperwork from veterinarians.",

                "body": "Ms. Tompkins is so far the only woman in the pantheon of great self-taught artists -- among them Bill Traylor, Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and James Castle -- whose achievements came to light in the second half of the 20th century and have altered the shape of American art history.\n\nSeveral of these artists had what might be called, for lack of a better word, saviors: individuals who encountered their work, recognized its significance and were instrumental in preserving it and bringing it to a broader audience. Mr. Leon was Rosie Lee Tompkins's savior.\n\n\"Eli Leon turned the full force of his exceptional intelligence and visual acumen onto the field of African-American quilts,\" Lawrence Rinder, director of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, told The San Francisco Chronicle. \"His exhibitions and publications, as well as his phenomenal collections, leave a profound legacy.\"\n\nRobert Stanley Leon was born in the Bronx on June 27, 1935, the son of Benjamin and Sylvia Leon. His father was a jeweler and watch repairman, and his parents, first-generation Jews from Lithuania, ran a small accessory shop on the Lower East Side.\n\nHe attended the High School of Music and Art, where his interests included poetry, graphics and ceramics. While still in high school, he spent a summer at Black Mountain College in Ashland, N.C., studying with the potter Karen Karnes.\n\nAfter high school, Mr. Leon entered Oberlin College in Ohio before transferring to Reed College in Portland, Ore., where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology in 1958. He then earned a master's from the University of Chicago, where he trained in Reichian psychotherapy, the practice of which became his main source of income.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early '60s, he was briefly married to his college girlfriend, Anne Drummond, although they both knew he was gay. Sometime after that he changed his first name to Eli.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mr. Leon became a regular at flea markets in and around Oakland, buying quilts of all kinds. In short order, he decided to concentrate on African-American quilts because their irregular, improvisatory patterns appealed to him. He began asking people at flea markets if they knew of any local quilt makers.\n\nOne day he approached Ms. Tompkins as she was selling household items at a flea market. As he later wrote, \"She was evasive, but eventually let on that she herself dabbled in the craft.\"\n\nDazzled by her work, he began to buy whatever she would sell him while also buying from other members of a large community of African-American quilt makers in the Oakland area. Over 30 years he accrued a collection of around 3,500 quilts, including some 200 by Ms. Tompkins. (With his death, how that collection will be disposed of is not yet known.)\n\nMr. Leon also began studying the quilts, relating their ad hoc patterns to textiles made in West Africa. And he made trips to the area of northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana and southern Arkansas, where many of the African-American quilt makers he knew in California had come from, visiting their relatives, interviewing them and buying more quilts. In 1989, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to conduct research in the South.\n\nMr. Leon organized his first exhibition of quilts from his collection in 1987 at the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum under the title \"Who'd a Thought It: Improvisation in African-American Quiltmaking.\" He would go on to organize nearly a dozen exhibitions across the country\n\nAfter seeing Ms. Tompkins's work in a show that Mr. Leon had organized at the Richmond Art Center, Mr. Rinder, then a curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, organized her first solo exhibition in 1997. He also included her quilts in the 2000 Whitney Biennial while working as a curator at the Whitney Museum in New York.\n\nThe most ambitious of Mr. Leon's shows was \"Accidentally on Purpose: The Aesthetic Management of Irregularities in African Textiles and African-American Quilts,\" held at the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa, in 2006, the year Ms. Tompkins died.\n\nMr. Leon's house was filled with quilts. One had to negotiate among two-foot-high piles of them in his living room -- even though he had built a garage-size climate-controlled addition to contain the overflow.\n\nMs. Hurth spoke of efforts to get things under control. One year she helped stage a sale of the many Anglo quilts that Mr. Leon had acquired and in which he was no longer interested. But, she said, he was willing to part with only six.\n\nAsked if Mr. Leon had made any quilts himself, Ms. Hurth said he had -- seven of them -- to keep himself occupied while he was waiting to hear about the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1989. But she said he might have intended to make more.\n\nClearing out the quilts from his attic after he moved to the care facility in November 2016, Ms. Hurth discovered that the floor beneath them was covered edge to edge with at least 12 inches of clothing and vintage fabric.",

                "body": "\"Obviously the questions -- the big 'why' questions as well as the smaller 'why' questions, of globally, what precipitated this and what he was trying to do, but also the whys of why this person or that person or that house,\" Mr. Adler said. \"And we don't have answers to those questions.\"\n\nOver three weeks, the authorities said, Mr. Conditt placed or mailed six explosive devices, triggering five explosions that killed two people, injured several more and left Austin feeling like a city under siege. One package mailed from here exploded in Schertz, Tex., about 65 miles south. Mr. Conditt's activities came to a fiery end early Wednesday morning when, police said, he detonated another explosive device in the sport utility vehicle he was driving as law enforcement agents pursued him on Interstate 35.\n\nIn Austin on Friday, a sense of relief and a slow return to normalcy was mixed with lingering unease over how Mr. Conditt had selected the recipients of the package bombs. Both of the men killed in the explosions, Anthony Stephan House, 39, and Draylen Mason, 17, were black, and some residents still wondered if Mr. Conditt had intentionally chosen African-American victims. (Another bomb injured a Hispanic woman, and an additional bomb was placed in a largely white community.)\n\nMr. Adler, the mayor, said \"there's just not enough data points to know\" whether Mr. Conditt was driven by racial animus to specifically target minorities.\n\n\"I don't think we know how he picked the addresses or locations that he sent packages to,\" Mr. Adler said. \"So I'm not sure it would be accurate to say he was targeting. We don't know the answer to that, is my understanding.\"\n\nPolice said a roughly 25-minute recording discovered on Mr. Conditt's phone did not explain why he chose the addresses where he placed or intended to send his bombs. But it did provide a dark glimpse into Mr. Conditt's mind-set in the hours before his death.\n\n\"I wish I were sorry but I am not,\" Mr. Conditt said on the recording, according to The Austin American-Statesman, which cited law enforcement sources familiar with his statements.\n\nThe Statesman reported that Mr. Conditt had called himself a \"psychopath\" and said he would blow himself up inside a busy McDonald's if he thought law enforcement was drawing near.\n\nIn Pflugerville, Tex., the Austin suburb where Mr. Conditt grew up and lived, there was no sign of the officers who had surged into the neighborhood earlier in the week.\n\nPolice barriers were removed from the yellowish-gold frame house that Mr. Conditt partly restored with his father after the family bought the house about two years ago. Neighbors said Mr. Conditt had lived there for at least a year.\n\nThe 1950s-era house appeared unoccupied Friday morning, its front door and windows sealed off with plywood. A deteriorating shed that may have been built as a garage was littered with garden tools, flower pots, cans of white paint and a discarded toilet.\n\nA weight rack at the front of the shed held nearly 20 barbell plates, from 25 pounds to 45 pounds. About a dozen shirts, sizes small and medium, were still on hangers and stacked atop a large, empty red toolbox.\n\nTwo bicycles were parked on a porch at the rear of the house.\n\nThe mayor of Pflugerville, Victor Gonzales, 69, lives about two blocks from Mr. Conditt's home. He said he and other residents were still coming to grips with the news that their city had been home to the Austin serial bomber.\n\n\"I feel somewhat that Pflugerville has been hurt by this incident and the fact the bomber lived in Pflugerville,\" Mr. Gonzales said. \"I think this kind of sets a little bit of a crack in the dam, so to speak. Maybe we need to go back, re-evaluate that quality that we want to have in Pflugerville.\"",

                "body": "But it's a little harder to say whether a return to pre-World War II geopolitics and economics would be better or worse for China's global position.\n\nDoes a world defined by spheres of influence and mercantilism benefit China, allowing it greater sway over Asia and freedom from Western economic dominance? Or does it hurt China, which has risen in the American-led international system and relies on that system to prosper?\n\nThat's a difficult question for several reasons. One, no country like China (an enormous command economy but one reliant on foreign trade) existed in the 19th century. Two, Beijing itself has seemed uncertain about whether it wants to maintain or break the American-led order.\n\nChina joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 but has chafed against its rules. The country relies on American-imposed stability in parts of the world other than its own, but challenges that dominance in Asia.\n\nChinese companies need access to the enormous American market, and Chinese consumers rely on American products and services. But China also benefits from closing some markets that would otherwise be American-dominated, for instance on smartphone software, which gives Chinese firms space to grow their products.\n\nMaybe hardest to know is whether China's command economy is better- or worse-suited than the American free market economy to advance the national interest within a system of closed international trade.\n\nWe often hear comparisons to the Cold War, which supposedly proved that the American economic system prevailed over the Soviet-style command system. But the Soviet economy collapsed largely because it relied on commodity prices, a vulnerability that remained in place during Russia's catastrophic free-market 1990s and still today.\n\nAnd the American economy was more centralized during the Cold War than is widely remembered. Though Americans told themselves that their geopolitical advances sprang naturally from private enterprise, many came from state-led projects, such as those that developed the space program or the internet. The country also poured money into strategic industries such as automobiles and steel during a period, the 1950s and 1960s, when vast international markets were opening up.\n\nYet now the United States is drifting into a strange place where it really does have the decentralized, unguided economy that it told itself it had during the Cold War, but it is now also closing access to the international trade that such a system requires.\n\nAnd China, long unwilling to choose between an open or a closed world, is being pushed toward the latter. The country certainly presents itself as economically self-sufficient, something that becomes more true as its middle class grows into a robust domestic market. And its ability to direct vast resources to state-led projects, such as solar power or artificial intelligence, do promise the sort of geopolitical gains once achieved in the United States.\n\nBut the modern Chinese economy really dates only to the early 1990s, and it has always relied on American-led free trade, particularly access to the United States itself. While many critics of Mr. Trump's tariffs argue that a self-imposed American decline will naturally aid China's rise, this is merely another version of Mr. Trump's zero-sum worldview. Maybe it's correct. But it's also possible that China, however tentatively, bought into the American-led order for a reason, and that the decline of this system will hurt Beijing, as well.\n\nThe safest bet, however, is almost always on the forces of the status quo. Mr. Bush's 2002 foray into protectionism also initially looked like an end to the then-much-younger era of Chinese buy-in to the liberal world order. It wasn't, and this might not be either. Time will tell.",

Her high-low creations have won her fashion fans, including Marc Jacobs, who hired her to create a bootleg hoodie that purposely misspelled his name as \"Mark Jacobes.\" The $125 hoodies sold out in a single day last December. Ms. Nirui is also a writer, photographer and the digital editor at Helmut Lang. \"I've kind of become obsessed with customizing things and the fact that I can pay $5 for a Chinatown hoodie and change the context so it has the same value as a $900 sweatshirt,\" she said.\n\nBig Break: In 2015, the designer Demna Gvasalia was making waves with his Vetements x Champion capsule collection. Not wanting to spend $1,100 on a sweatshirt, Ms. Nirui dreamed up her own version: a black Champion hoodie with the Comme des Garçons logo embroidered using the hoodie's iconic C. \"I remember thinking it was so absurd that it was so expensive,\" Ms. Nirui said. \"So I decided, 'No way. I'm just going to do my own.'\" She posted her creation to Instagram and was flooded with messages from people wanting to buy it, including Chance the Rapper. She declined to sell it, which only stoked demand further. \"It wasn't about making money,\" she said. \"It was about taking a piece of history and reworking it into something nobody else could have.\"\n\nLatest Project: In January, the Museum of Modern Art enlisted Ms. Nirui to make a limited-edition hoodie for the closing of its exhibit \"Items: Is Fashion Modern?\" The hoodies were based on Maison Margiela's numerical logo, and were given out to museumgoers for free.\n\nNext Thing: While Ms. Nirui is planning more hoodies (she declined to name the designers she is collaborating with), she is branching into zines and other creative forms. Most recently, she created a line of Barbie doll outfits for the Miami street wear brand Stray Rats.\n\nBootleg for the Masses: Ms. Nirui doesn't consider her work as \"ripping off other designers,\" but as homage. \"Brands like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, they're the pinnacle of luxury, and things like that should be available to everyone,\" she said. \"If you can't afford it, make it. If that's what you want to wear, do it yourself.\"",

It happened again on Thursday when the Metropolitan Opera brought back Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\" The lovely soprano Olga Peretyatko-Mariotti had admirable qualities as Lucia, but Mr. Grigolo's hotheaded, vocally burnished Edgardo is the reason to see this production. He usually manages to make an impact even in bizarre productions, as in this 2017 video from a strange, modern-dress staging of Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" at the Paris National Opera. Here, as the duke, he sings \"La donna è mobile.\" Mr. Grigolo seems rattled at first: He and the orchestra take a phrase or two to get in sync. But once he takes off, Mr. Grigolo brings infectious swagger to the aria. When a roster of birdlike chorus girls enters the scene, he actually sings with more elegance. Catch the moment when he holds on to a melting high note as his silly companions shake their posteriors. ANTHONY TOMMASINI",

In the new $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Friday, both endowments actually saw a slight increase of about $3 million in their funding levels, to about $153 million each.\n\nIn Mr. Trump's first federal budget last year, he caused alarm after he became the first president to call for ending the endowments since they were created in 1965 -- even though the combined budgets of both make up a mere fraction of the federal budget. Arts groups around the country mobilized immediately to save the federal funding.\n\nIt turned out that the N.E.A. and N.E.H. also had support from key Republicans, including Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is the chairwoman of a crucial Senate appropriations subcommittee.

Mr. Trump called for slashing the endowments again in his second budget -- and the reaction was muted from arts groups after last year's threat didn't come to pass.\n\n\"With this funding, N.E.H. will be able to aggressively support essential cultural infrastructure projects across the country,\" Jon Parrish Peede, the senior deputy chairman of the N.E.H., said in a statement.

                "body": "After serving for years as the backdrop of John Waters films like \"Hairspray\" and \"Cry Baby,\" Baltimore will host a retrospective of Mr. Waters's visual art.\n\nThe exhibition, \"John Waters: Indecent Exposure,\" at the Baltimore Museum of Art, will feature more than 160 works, including photographs, sculptures, and video and sound pieces. It will be on view from Oct. 7 to Jan. 6, 2019.\n\n\"The wide-ranging influences and products of his work speak succinctly to popular culture within the context of the history of art,\" the museum's director, Chris Bedford, said.\n\nMr. Waters was born in Baltimore and grew up in Lutherville, Md., a suburb. He began to make art in the early 1990s. Lowbrow references, subversions of classic American culture and challenges to societal taboos are all present in his work, alongside a focus on race, gender and power.\n\nThe exhibition will include a photographic installation centering on famous films and their creators; a group of darkly humorous photographs of subjects including the Kennedy assassination and 9/11; and a piece called \"Kiddie Flamingos,\" a video work of children reading a G-rated version of Mr. Waters's 1972 film, \"Pink Flamingos.\" Some of his earliest films will also be shown in a peep-show format.",

                "body": "Mr. Bolton's appointment followed Mr. Trump's announcement of tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, which sent financial markets into a deep dive and ignited fears of a trans-Pacific trade war. New steel and aluminum tariffs also took effect on Friday, though the White House exempted several allies from the measures, sowing equal measures of relief and confusion.\n\nThe tumult occurred against the ominous backdrop of the Russia investigation. The resignation of Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, John Dowd, on Thursday signaled that the president was determined to sit down with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, even as he takes a more combative stance toward the overall investigation.\n\nBy midday Friday, officials at the White House and in Congress were equally mystified about what might come next.\n\nShortly before the president spoke on the spending plan, several of his top advisers -- including Defense Secretary Mattis, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- huddled in the Palm Court, preparing for an appearance that, like so many by Mr. Trump, could go in any number of directions. Mr. Trump's public schedule called for him to leave for a weekend at his Palm Beach estate at 4:40 p.m.\n\nAs is often the case, he filled much of his time Friday with a series of tweets.\n\nAt 8:55 a.m., after becoming agitated at the conservative backlash against the spending measure that dominated Fox News, Mr. Trump declared, \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\n\nIn a separate tweet, the president expressed anger at Democrats for failing to reach a deal with him to include provisions in the spending bill that would preserve Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program he rescinded last fall. The program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation. Democrats had rejected Mr. Trump's offer of a short-term fix to DACA after Mr. Trump retreated from an earlier position that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients.\n\nBut Mr. Trump was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation's southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants.\n\nThe measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security -- including new technology and repairs to existing barriers -- but not Mr. Trump's wall. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes, and allocates the rest of the money for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.\n\nMr. Trump's personnel moves, on the legal and national security front, suggest a president unleashed from those who have tried to constrain his impulses. The departing national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, urged Mr. Trump not to rip up the Iran nuclear deal -- something his hawkish successor. Mr. Bolton is an outspoken opponent of the deal.\n\nGeneral McMaster bid farewell to the staff of the National Security Council on Friday morning and was spotted walking briskly out of the White House complex. Staff members at the N.S.C. were stunned by the sudden change in leadership, even though General McMaster's status with Mr. Trump was known to be shaky for weeks.\n\nInside and outside the White House, the appointment drew increasing alarm.\n\nMr. Mattis, viewed as a moderating force on the president, told colleagues before the appointment was announced that he would find it difficult to work with Mr. Bolton, people briefed on the conversation said.\n\nDemocrats and others said Mr. Bolton's record of advocating military action against Iran and North Korea raised the risk of war.\n\n\"Mr. Bolton's tendency to try to solve every geopolitical problem with the American military first is a troubling one,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a tweet on Thursday. \"I hope he will temper his instinct to commit the men and women of our armed forces to conflicts around the globe, when we need to be focused on building the middle class here at home.\"\n\nDaryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said in a statement, \"Bolton's extreme views could tilt the malleable Mr. Trump in the wrong direction on critical decisions affecting the future of the Iran nuclear deal, the North Korean nuclear crisis, and the strained U.S. relationship with Russia, among other issues.\"\n\nAs Mr. Trump prepared to travel for the weekend to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rumors swirled at the White House that his purge might soon continue with the firing of David Shulkin, the embattled secretary of the Veterans Affairs department.\n\nMr. Trump is methodically shedding himself of those who have clashed with his views, including Rex W. Tillerson, his secretary of state, who was fired last week. But the president is also losing aides like Hope Hicks, his communications director and confidant, whose resignation is effective soon.",

                "body": "Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell in Season 5 of \"The Americans.\"Patrick Harbron/FX\n\nWhen \"The Americans\" returns to FX for its final season on March 28, the action will have leapt ahead three years to 1987, leaving us with a lot to remember from all of the spy games we've witnessed till now. Philip and Elizabeth Jennings have come a long way without their true identities as Russian spies being discovered -- so many close calls, so many wigs -- but with two moody teenagers on their hands, a host of dubious sources and an F.B.I. agent living across the street, how much longer can their luck last?\n\nAnd how much longer can they keep it together under so much stress? \"This has been hard for me, for a long time,\" Philip told Elizabeth last season. \"You know that, right?\"\n\nHang in there, Philip. Only one season left. Meantime, here's some crucial intel to catch you up:\n\nWhen we first met Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip (Matthew Rhys), their marriage was a complicated fiction, deep cover for their roles as K.G.B. officers. But then we saw their marriage become a little more real last season, with a traditional Russian wedding ceremony using their actual Russian names, Nadezhda and Mischa. The assumption was they would be heading back to Mother Russia soon.\n\nBut when they discovered that one their key targets, Isaac Breland (Frank Deal), was being promoted to the head of the Soviet Division of the C.I.A., they knew they couldn't go home as planned. Together, they decided to make some changes -- Elizabeth would assume most of the espionage work, and Philip would largely step aside. He would still handle Breland's daughter, Kimmy (Julia Garner); he would still help run the travel agency, which was about as neglected as their son, Henry (Keidrich Sellati); and he presumably would still keep an eye on Stan (Noah Emmerich) over Miller High Lifes. But what was that advice Elizabeth just gave their Vietnamese former protégé, Tuan (Ivan Mok)? \"You need someone, Tuan,\" she said. \"A partner. To do this with, to get through it with.\" What happens when her own partner retires?\n\nShe has mastered the fine arts of lying, spying and taking a punch; she has lost her Christian faith and taken a liking to Karl Marx: Paige (Holly Taylor) certainly seems to interested in joining the family business. But given the K.G.B.'s goal to place next-generation agents in the F.B.I. and the C.I.A, it may be in everyone's best interests to keep Paige on wig-care duty and out of harm's way. (It also gives her plausible deniability if her parents are ever captured).\n\nDespite his (surprising!) smarts, Henry is probably not heading off to a fancy New Hampshire boarding school. \"This family stays together,\" Philip insisted, back when he thought they were about to relocate back to Russia. Thanks, Dad -- as if Henry needed encouragement to spend more time with the more reliable and understanding Stan. (To be fair, it's easier to be a father figure than an actual father -- something Stan knows all too well). But might Philip have changed his mind now that the Russia plans are on hold?\n\nLast we saw Henry, he was already inadvertently leaking information about his family's movements and getting private tours of F.B.I. counterintelligence: Do his K.G.B. parents really want to put him in a position where he might someday have to choose between them and Stan? Could this be the season Henry finally gets a clue?\n\nIt's so hard to get good help. Who can Elizabeth rely upon, besides their handler, Claudia (Margo Martindale); their call center operative, Joan (Polly Lee); and the surveillance queen Marilyn (Amy Tribbey)? It will be interesting to see whether Elizabeth checks in with any of the former recruits still left in the game -- limited shelf lives, these players. Remember when a compulsive gambler named Sanford Prince (Tim Hopper) boldly recruited an Air Force colonel on the K.G.B.'s behalf in Season 1? That colonel was a strange catch -- he provided classified intel on the Strategic Defense Initiative, but he also shot Prince in the head in Season 2, claiming self-defense. Approach with caution.\n\nOver on the F.B.I. side, two sources -- Sofia (Darya Ekamasova) and her beau, Gennadi (Yuri Kolokolnikov) -- may become more active now that Gennadi has passed a polygraph test. (Guess the F.B.I. doesn't know about the old K.G.B. trick to beat the test by clenching).\n\nDating is hard in the spy world, where it's difficult to know whether someone loves you or your security clearance. Stan is in a vulnerable position with Renee (Laurie Holden) -- her move into Chez Beeman and the career advice she has given him are suspect. Philip has long wondered if Renee was a K.G.B. plant, but his former handler Gabriel (Frank Langella) has denied it. (\"You're losing it, Philip,\" were his exact words.) But Gabriel said -- and failed to say -- a lot of things. It would make sense for the Center to send a different agent to work Stan, given his history of romancing Rezidentura staffers and how little intel Philip has gleaned from him lately. (Another possibility: Renee works for an entirely different agency. Which one?)\n\nStan's extrajudicial killing of Vlad, the young K.G.B. agent from Season 1, is something that may still come back to bite the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence team. Stan has already confessed the crime to the deputy attorney general (Cotter Smith), and has threatened to go public with it. (\"The U.S. government killing innocent people? Splashed across the world's newspapers?\") It's a card he keeps in his back pocket, but for how long?\n\nMeanwhile, Stan's K.G.B. frenemy Oleg (Costa Ronin) could be facing some unhappy music of his own. The C.I.A. has already threatened him with blackmail after he admitted on tape that a Soviet defector was a spy, as part of his (ill-fated) attempts with Stan to rescue Nina. And he's been questioned about his role in blowing the cover of their bioweapons source (Dylan Baker).\n\nMischa Semenov, Philip's son with Irina, didn't get to meet his father in Season 5, but he did find some other relatives in the Soviet Union: Philip's older brother, Pyotr; his wife, Tamara; and their son. Philip had never mentioned having a brother, so this family reunion came out of nowhere. Now we're wondering how much more there might be to discover about this side of the family (beyond the fact that Paige and Henry have a cute little cousin).\n\nOn a less complicated happy note, Martha (Alison Wright), who was cruelly separated from her loved ones because of her exfiltration to the Soviet Union, might finally be able to start a family of her own by adopting the orphan Olya. Is a happy ending possible for these two? Poor Martha. It's nice to think so.",

                "title": "Nicolas Sarkozy and the Libya Investigation: The Key Questions",
                "body": "The case was opened in 2013, after a 2012 report by the investigative news website Mediapart suggesting that Mr. Sarkozy's campaign had received up to 50 million euros, or nearly $62 million at current exchange rates, from Colonel Qaddafi's government.\n\nInvestigators have been proceeding slowly, and their inquiries had featured in the news only sporadically.\n\nThe case files are sealed, and several of the Libyans said to have played a role are dead or exiled, making it hard to piece together a fully accurate picture of the investigation.\n\nIt involves a complex web of political and financial ties between Mr. Sarkozy's advisers, officials who were part of Colonel Qaddafi's government before he was ousted, and figures who played a murky role as intermediaries between the two as relations between France and Libya warmed up in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe accusations stem mostly from former Libyan officials and a Franco-Lebanese arms dealer named Ziad Takieddine, who acted as an intermediary and who says he personally delivered millions in cash. One official, a former oil minister for Colonel Qaddafi named Shukri Ghanem -- whose body was found in the Danube in Vienna in 2012 -- left behind documents that refer to payments made to Mr. Sarkozy in 2007.\n\nThe officials, and Mr. Takieddine, have given conflicting accounts about the sequence of events and the amounts of money involved. Some Libyan officials have even denied that Mr. Sarkozy's campaign received any funding.\n\nA report by investigators cited in the French news media appears to have established that Mr. Sarkozy's 2007 campaign had unusual amounts of cash on hand -- one of Mr. Sarkozy's top aides rented a large bank vault during the campaign, ostensibly to store documents and speeches. But the sums mentioned were in the range of tens of thousands of euros, not millions.\n\nStill, the fact that the French magistrates investigating the case have decided to place Mr. Sarkozy under formal investigation suggests they that there is evidence of potential wrongdoing, even if the exact scope and nature remain unclear.\n\nMr. Sarkozy has continually and strenuously denied the accusations, calling them \"grotesque.\" In a Thursday night interview on the French television channel TF1, he said that he had \"never betrayed the trust\" of the French people.\n\n\"There is not one document, not one picture, not one account, not one piece of material proof. There is only hatred, mud, mediocrity, malevolence and slander.\" -- Mr. Sarkozy, in an interview with French television.\n\nHe called Mr. Takieddine \"sinister\" and \"unbalanced.\" Noting that many of the accusations came from former Libyan officials, Mr. Sarkozy disparaged Colonel Qaddafi and his aides as \"assassins\" and \"criminals\" who could not be trusted.\n\nHe argued that the accusations were driven by a desire by allies of Colonel Qaddafi to seek revenge against Mr. Sarkozy. France, under his leadership, played a prominent role in the NATO-led campaign of airstrikes that ultimately led to the toppling of Colonel Qaddafi and his death at the hands of Libyan rebels in 2011.\n\nIn France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers, who place defendants under formal investigation when they believe the evidence points to serious wrongdoing.\n\nThis means that the investigation will continue for several months, if not longer. Mr. Sarkozy's conduct will be restricted as the magistrates do their work -- a first for a former president in recent French history.\n\nHe has been forbidden to meet with several people of interest in the case, including two close allies who have also come under scrutiny, and he is barred from traveling to a handful of countries, including Libya. Mr. Sarkozy's lawyer said on Friday that he would appeal the restrictions.\n\nBut Mr. Sarkozy will not necessarily stand trial when the investigation ends. The magistrates can drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed. Even if the judges order Mr. Sarkozy to stand trial, he can still appeal the decision.\n\nMr. Sarkozy has been dogged by accusations of financial impropriety since he left the presidency. That has hampered his ability to make a political comeback, despite his popularity with the base of his party.\n\nHe has been ordered to stand trial in two other cases. In the first, involving his 2012 campaign, he has been charged with exceeding strict limits on campaign spending. In the second, he is accused of trying to obtain confidential information from a court judge.",

I can go to a vintage house or a flea market and love digging through a five-foot pile of jeans because at the bottom there might be one that makes me happy.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Haller isn't taking apart Levi's, she's taking apart houses.\n\nShe and her husband, Craig Ekedahl, a real estate agent, currently own a half-dozen houses in the area. Since 2012 they have renovated multiple others in nearby Echo Park and Boyle Heights, a business they began as a way for Mr. Ekedahl to transition out of the television industry. As a producer on \"Basketball Wives of Los Angeles,\" he was traveling six days a week and was concerned about saving for college -- they have a 5-year-old daughter -- and retirement.\n\n\"We panicked a little bit,\" he said.\n\nStill, while many in their business make money flipping their properties, this couple prefers to rent them out. \"We're not hard-core bottom-line investors,\" Mr. Ekedahl said. \"Each house becomes a part of our family and we want it to be right. We want to recognize what the house is and what is has been.\"\n\nIf he is the pragmatic one, Ms. Haller is the visionary, packing her Instagram account with shots of her newel posts, brass handle sets, salvaged tile and Victorian chandeliers.\n\nSometimes knobs are from the salvage store; sometimes they're from knobs.com. In the bathroom, new black octagon-shaped tiles cover the floor, but the claw-foot tub was unearthed at Olde Good Things, an architectural salvage shop in downtown Los Angeles, and refinished in black. The brass faucets and marble sink top were found at another local salvage shop, the ReUse People.\n\nA tall wood Victorian mirror hung above the sink, donated by a man who sells her vintage Levi's. \"He just hoards amazing stuff,\" Ms. Haller said. The sconces flanking the mirror were flea market scores, and Ms. Haller was thrilled to uncover 100-year-old brick in the driveway.\n\nAt the 1907 Craftsman home she and Mr. Ekedahl live in just around the corner (its 2016 renovation was also captured on Instagram), their buffet table is covered in vintage lamp parts. Ms. Haller recently taught herself how to rewire chandeliers by watching YouTube videos.\n\n\"If I can have a glass of wine and tinker with lamps, I'm so happy,\" she said.\n\nLater that day at the NSF loft in the fashion district, Ms. Haller toured her \"denim archive,\" like a public library of jeans, with racks climbing up the walls and a ladder needed to reach the top.\n\n\"Just follow me into this hole back here,\" Ms. Haller said, disappearing behind a row of paint-splattered denim that she has collected for eight years.\n\nFor a moment it seemed as if she were heading into a John Malkovich-like portal, but then she appeared once again, her head popping up above the hues of faded blue.\n\n\"This is where I come,\" she said. \"I crawl back here in this hole.\"\n\nIf Ms. Haller is painting one of her houses, she'll purposely let her clothes get messed up because it gives her inspiration or an idea for a new wash (often covered in paint). \"Just loaded them up,\" she said of cargo pants copied from a pair she wore after intensive work on a midcentury modern house in Glendale.\n\nTo her, such purposefully sloppy dungarees reflect not indifference, but care.\n\n\"I'm always like, 'Is this emotional? Is someone going to want to pick it up off the rack?'\" Ms. Haller said, tenderly picking up a bedraggled pair of pants. \"First it has to suit what I want. Then it has to suit my style. But for me, it needs to be special -- always.\"",

He said the Tesla Facebook page \"looks lame anyway.\"\n\nThe posts, which sent the Twittersphere into a virtual frenzy, escalated a public feud between Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring, once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its \"house cats.\"\n\nMr. Zuckerberg has argued that people need to trust and embrace technology in their lives. When the Facebook chief executive was asked about Mr. Musk's warnings around artificial intelligence during a Facebook Live broadcast in 2017, he called Mr. Musk a \"naysayer.\" That's an insult in a technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism.\n\n\"With A.I. especially, I'm really optimistic,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said. \"People who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios -- I just, I don't understand it. I think it's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.\"\n\nIn response, Mr. Musk shot back that Mr. Zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues.\n\n\"I've talked to Mark about this,\" Mr. Musk wrote. \"His understanding of the subject is limited.\"\n\nThe two have also clashed on space travel. Mr. Zuckerberg traveled to Kenya in 2016 for the launch of a Facebook-affiliated satellite called Amos-6, which was set to go to outer space in a SpaceX rocket. But the rocket exploded. Mr. Zuckerberg released a chilly statement.\n\n\"As I'm here in Africa, I'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nMr. Musk is a frequent Twitter presence, who has posted increasingly macho and humor-focused messages including video of himself playing with a flamethrower.\n\nHe said he plans to keep using his Instagram account, which is owned by Facebook, and on which he has 6.9 million followers.\n\nWhen one reporter said on Twitter that it was remarkable Mr. Musk had so much time to troll online, Mr. Musk wrote, \"What, a troll, me!?\"\n\nFacebook and SpaceX didn't immediately have a comment on Mr. Musk's deleted pages. A Tesla spokeswoman did not have a comment beyond Mr. Musk's tweets.",

                "title": "Review: Vittorio Grigolo Is the Reason to See the Met's 'Lucia'",
                "body": "In most performances of Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor,\" it's hard not to feel a little sorry for the lead tenor during the final scene. This tormented moment for the character Edgardo is one of the composer's most inspired creations, but it immediately follows Lucia's famous mad scene -- usually the showstopper.\n\nBut thanks to a fearless performance by the tenor Vittorio Grigolo, Edgardo's scene was the high point of the evening on Thursday when Mary Zimmerman's 2007 production of \"Lucia\" returned to the Metropolitan Opera. Other cast members had their moments, especially the luminous soprano Olga Peretyatko-Mariotti, singing her first Lucia at the Met, who was at her best when it mattered most during the long, demanding mad scene. Still, all night Mr. Grigolo was in the zone with a fervor that no one else matched.\n\nMr. Grigolo put everything on the line for that final scene, at the graveyard of the Ravenswoods, a landed Scottish family in decline. Edgardo, the laird of that estate, has fallen in love with Lucia, the sister of a rival clan, the Lammermoors, now headed by her imperious brother, Enrico, who is Edgardo's sworn enemy. But to save the Lammermoors from financial ruin, Lucia, who adores Edgardo, has been forced into a marriage of convenience with a wealthy lord.\n\nEdgardo comes to the graveyard at the very moment he believes Lucia is entering her bridal chamber with her new husband. Mr. Grigolo mingled raw despair and feral intensity when he sang Edgargo's wrenching aria of farewell to life, as he anticipates being killed in a duel at dawn with Enrico and welcomes it. In the second part of the scene, when Edgardo learns that Lucia is dying (having gone mad and stabbed her husband to death), Mr. Grigolo's vocally burnished and wild-eyed singing made the young man seem unhinged.\n\nWas his performance over the top? Perhaps. But the field of opera could use a little more of Mr. Grigolo's animalistic intensity. This otherwise curiously tame \"Lucia\" certainly benefited from it.\n\nThere were admirable qualities to Ms. Peretyatko-Mariotti's Lucia. During her first aria, when she tells her handmaid Alisa (Deborah Nansteel) that she keeps seeing the ghost of a young woman slain by a jealous lover in the waters of a fountain at the castle, Ms. Peretyatko-Mariotti conveyed the emotional shakiness of her fragile character by injecting the ornate vocal lines with a touch of skittishness.\n\nThough the technical aspects of her singing were mostly secure, now and then, even during the otherwise compelling mad scene, Ms. Peretyatko-Mariotti seemed cautious and distracted -- for example, taking a moment to prepare for sustained high notes, then singing them shakily. During the heated romantic exchanges in Act I, Mr. Grigolo, with his unbridled passion, inspired Ms. Peretyatko-Mariotti to risk more. Her scene in Act II with Lucia's brother fell flat though, mostly because of the stolid singing of the baritone Massimo Cavalletti as Enrico. Ms. Peretyatko-Mariotti seemed disengaged.",

                "title": "A Crisp Cool-Weather Twist for a Classic Summer Salad",
                "body": "A satisfying salad of tuna and beans is a Mediterranean favorite, often served as a meal in warm weather. In my favorite version, the main ingredients -- rich tuna and creamy beans -- are accented with red wine vinegar, tomato and onion, finished with a flourish of extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nAt the moment, with no ripe tomatoes on the horizon, I offer this cool-weather variation, which features thinly sliced raw fennel, and fresh tuna seared in a cast-iron skillet. Using best-quality canned tuna is certainly an option, but the texture and flavor are quite different. While fresh tuna may be a bit of a splurge and take longer to prepare, the divine results are worth the cost.\n\nAs for the beans, freshly cooked dried white beans are preferred -- I always take the opportunity to proselytize for dried beans, which have a better texture and more flavor than canned -- and, with a little advance planning, easy to pull off. Cannellini or gigante beans, covered in cold water just before bedtime, take only about an hour to simmer the next day. Still, beans from a can will suffice. Drain the cooked (or canned) beans, and season them with salt, lemon and plenty of olive oil. (In fact, white beans dressed this way are delicious as an accompaniment to nearly any dish.)\n\nTuna is expensive, but you don't need much: 2 to 4 ounces per serving is plenty. So your salad can be bean heavy or tuna heavy, depending upon how flush you're feeling; it will be delicious either way. The main thing is to get the seasoning right. After salting it, I like to coat the fish with a generous amount of crushed fennel seed and black pepper. If I have it on hand, I'll amp up the floral flavor with a little dried fennel pollen.\n\nTo sear the tuna, get a cast-iron pan scorching hot. The cooking takes only about two minutes per side. I want the tuna to be quite rare, nearly raw at the center, but feel free to cook it more if you like. Or follow the New York chef Jody Williams, who serves a tuna and bean salad I admire at her restaurant Via Carota; it is made with diced raw tuna.\n\nFor the fennel, look for smooth, pale green bulbs that are not too big, with the feathery fronds still attached. Trim the fennel, removing the outer layer if it seems tough. Slice the fennel very thinly, with a sharp knife or mandoline, just before serving the salad. Dress it at the last minute with a lemony-garlicky vinaigrette, and arrange it over the room-temperature beans and tuna.",

                "body": "Ms. Peveler paid $135,000 cash for a one-story house with longevity in mind. One of the three bedrooms, she said, can be converted into an apartment if she needs a caretaker to move in. She is thinking of checking out assisted-living facilities in case she ever needs more than home care. (There is a family history of dementia, she said.) Several mini-strokes caused some cognitive impairment, so her doctor monitors her regularly.\n\nWith a brother on the West Coast and no nieces or nephews to step in, Ms. Peveler has, through her church and several civic activities, developed a surrogate family of friends and neighbors, many of them several decades younger, who keep tabs on her. For added protection, she signed up for a service, EyeOn App, that signals three friends if she does not reply within a half-hour to scheduled alerts on her cellphone.\n\n\"Once, I didn't respond, and everyone called me,\" she said. \"My next-door neighbor sent her daughter over.\"\n\nAlthough no plan is foolproof, Ms. Peveler said she was as confident as she could be. \"I know people would have my back,\" she said.\n\nMs. Peveler is among a growing number of older Americans who are unmarried and childless. By 2030, about 16 percent of women 80 to 84 will be childless, compared with about 12 percent in 2010, according to a 2013 report by AARP.\n\nWhile Ms. Peveler is trying to control the risks of aging alone, many so-called elder orphans may not fare as well. Older single and childless people are at higher risk than those with children for facing medical problems, cognitive decline and premature death, according to a 2016 study led by Dr. Maria Torroella Carney, chief of geriatric and palliative medicine at the Northwell Health system on Long Island. The study noted that about 22 percent of people 65 and older either are childless or have children who are not in contact.\n\nAdult children typically help elderly parents negotiate housing, social-service and health care options. Without such a fallback, elder orphans can reduce their risks by building their own support structures, Dr. Carney said.\n\n\"People who are aging alone need to make plans when they are independent and functional,\" she said. \"They need to learn about the resources in the community and the appropriate time to start using them.\" Those services could include senior-friendly housing and the growing number of home-delivered products and services aimed at the aging-solo market, such as healthy meals and doctors who make house calls, she said.\n\nOne of the first steps childless people should take is to hire an elder law lawyer, who can draw up documents that will protect them if they become incapacitated. Childless people typically turn to a friend, a lawyer, clergy, or a niece or nephew to make medical decisions, according to experts. A bank's trust unit can take on financial tasks, with a friend, a relative or a lawyer monitoring the bank's decisions.\n\nChristina Lesher, an elder law lawyer in Houston, suggests appointing a \"micro board,\" which includes the lawyer, the health care and financial agents, an accountant and a geriatric care manager. \"The board can step in if a client cannot make decisions,\" Ms. Lesher said. The client could assign a network of friends and neighbors to call the lawyer in an emergency or if they notice any cognitive decline.\n\nAs for housing, Dr. Carney recommends that people aging alone consider a senior-friendly \"congregate living\" arrangement. Besides offering a variety of services, such housing can lessen isolation, which her research shows can lead to physical and cognitive decline. If that is not possible, she said, elder orphans should move closer to shopping, medical care, recreation and senior support services.\n\nOne housing option with a built-in support system is a continuing care retirement community. Residents usually start in an independent living unit and, depending on the care needed, move to an on-site assisted-living unit or a skilled-nursing facility. Entrance and monthly fees tend to be hefty, however. Typical entry fees range from just over $100,000 to more than $400,000 while monthly services fees can range from $2,000 to $4,000, according to MyLifeSite, which tracks the pricing and financial information of more than 800 C.C.R.C.s.\n\nWith no one to oversee their care, elder orphans who want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible could enlist a geriatric care manager, who monitors elderly clients and coordinates care.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., clients of Iona Senior Services, for example, can arrange for a care manager to be on call as their health deteriorates, said Deborah Rubenstein, director of consultation, care management and counseling programs. If a client is discharged from a hospital, for example, the care manager, in consultation with the designated health care agent, would arrange for rehabilitation or home care, she said.\n\n\"More and more people were coming to us and saying, 'I'm O.K. now, but I'm realistic enough to know my health status could change,'\" Ms. Rubenstein said. Iona charges $150 an hour.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of volunteer neighborhood groups are providing both social connections and practical help to older people who are at home alone. More than 200 organizations in the Village to Village Network, including \"villages\" in the New York area, provide rides to medical appointments, snow removal, home repairs and computer support. Villages in 150 additional neighborhoods are in development. Tax-deductible membership fees can range from $100 to $400.\n\nEntrepreneurs and companies, many nationwide, are moving into the so-called longevity market. On-demand services, accessible by a phone app or a computer, can connect people to personal assistants and food delivery.\n\n\"The on-demand marketplace will be the best friend of elder orphans,\" said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant to companies that cater to seniors.\n\nFor example, the ride-hailing service Lyft is working with health care systems and retirement communities to provide rides to nonemergency medical appointments and other destinations. And because financial acuity often declines with age, childless singles can enroll in a service such as EverSafe, which monitors accounts for unusual spending and alerts the client or a trusted advocate of possible fraud.\n\nIn-home technology, like medication reminders, also can help people live alone safely longer, experts say. Besides her EyeOn home-monitoring system, Ms. Peveler uses an Amazon Alexa device.\n\n\"If I am reading a recipe, I can tell her what to put on a shopping list,\" said Ms. Peveler, who has a harder time remembering some details since her mini-strokes. And just for fun, she may tell Alexa \"to make cat noises, and one of my cats goes nuts.\"\n\nFor those aging solo, expanding a social network is essential, according to experts on aging. Two years ago, Carol Marak, who is in her mid-60s and lives alone in Dallas, started the Elder Orphan Facebook Group.\n\n\"I wanted a place to feel less lonely and to connect with others in the same situation,\" said Ms. Marak, who is also the spokeswoman for SeniorCare.com, a site that provides information on local care options. About 6,500 childless singles, mostly women, are members, she said.\n\nMs. Marak said she was struck by the number of members who worried about being \"isolated and disconnected from the community.\" She said she was trying hard to create her own social connections. She moved from a suburban house to a downtown condominium building, where she is making new friends. And she has organized brunches for Dallas members of the Facebook page.\n\nDetermined to stay healthy for as long as possible, Ms. Marak said she walks six miles a day and eats mostly vegan meals. \"I need to keep stronger because I am totally responsible for myself,\" she said.",

                "title": "Trevor Winkfield Brings Optical Heat to His Latest Gallery Show",
                "body": "Born in Britain in 1944, Trevor Winkfield has lived in New York since 1969 and exhibited here almost as long. For decades, he has cultivated a style of Formalist Pop Surrealism that balances between fine and commercial art. His precedents include the proto-Pop paintings of Gerald Murphy; Paul Outerbridge's advertising photography; and Picabia's mechanical portraits which Mr. Winkfield might be said to have fleshed out.\n\nMr. Winkfield's paintings are built to always look new -- both fresh and unfamiliar. Their complex palette of brilliant, compelling colors (seldom straight from the tube), their smooth surfaces and their locked-in compositions push everything to the brink of abstraction. He keeps the optical heat on by using bright yellows -- when he wants to lighten up -- and virtually banning white.\n\nBut his totemic figures built from half-recognizable insignia and symbols pulse with narrative implication, relationships and innuendo. This is especially the case in \"Saints, Dancers and Acrobats,\" a group of compact yet airy canvases from the last five years that form one of Mr. Winkfield's best shows. The prevailing composition here is of two figure-like totems facing forward as if standing at attention. In \"Signals,\" one totem seems ready to spin, while the other has open triangles that evoke arms akimbo. It brings to mind \"Signals,\" Merce Cunningham's landmark dance from 1970.\n\nMr. Winkfield's cryptic symbols and hyped-up color is itself a precedent for the flat representational styles of younger painters like Caitlin Keogh, Derrick Adams and Orion Martin. It's great to see Mr. Winkfield's work on the youth-oriented Lower East Side, at Tibor de Nagy, a gallery that has just moved here, after a long life uptown.",

                "body": "Mr. Miller was easily elected in November 2000 to serve the remaining four years of Mr. Coverdell's term. Bristling at attempts to make him follow \"a party goose step,\" as he put it later, Mr. Miller joined Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, to co-sponsor President George W. Bush's $1.6 billion tax-cut measure in early 2001.\n\n\"I agree with President Bush that the taxpayers are better judges of how to spend their own money than we are,\" Mr. Miller said. He was also one of only eight Democratic senators to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft, Mr. Bush's choice for attorney general. Soon, he stopped going to weekly lunches with Democratic senators.\n\nMr. Miller most famously demonstrated his independence at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, where he delivered a blistering attack on the Democratic nominee, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a man he had called \"an American hero\" only a few years before in tribute to Mr. Kerry's service in Vietnam.\n\nBy 2004, Mr. Miller had soured on Mr. Kerry, citing several votes in the Senate as evidence that he had gone soft on defense issues.\n\n\"This is the man who wants to be the commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces?\" Mr. Miller told the crowd at Madison Square Garden. \"U.S. forces armed with what? Spitballs?\"\n\nImmediately after the speech, Mr. Miller snapped at journalists who tried to pose questions. Then he was interviewed on MSNBC by Chris Matthews, who cited the about-face on Mr. Kerry and asked him to elaborate on the \"spitballs\" remark.\n\n\"Do you know what a metaphor is?\" Mr. Miller said. Quickly becoming more annoyed, he shouted, \"Get out of my face!\"\n\nMr. Mathews was actually a safe distance away; the two were communicating by microphone.\n\n\"I wish we lived in the day when we could challenge someone to a duel,\" Mr. Miller said. He later expressed regret for his outburst.\n\nThe 2004 speech was all the more remarkable in that Mr. Miller had delivered a keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in which he excoriated President George H. W. Bush and praised the party's nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who would go on to defeat Mr. Bush. Mr. Miller attributed his own rise to the achievements of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I made it because Franklin Delano Roosevelt energized this nation,\" Mr. Miller told the convention, which was also being held at Madison Square Garden. \"I made it because Harry Truman fought for working families like mine. I made it because John Kennedy's rising tide lifted even our tiny boat. I made it because Lyndon Johnson showed America that people who were born poor didn't have to die poor.\"\n\nZell Bryan Miller was born in Young Harris on Feb. 24, 1932. His father, Stephen Grady Miller, a teacher, died 17 days later. The widowed mother, Birdie, built a home with rocks that she had hauled from a nearby stream, Zell Miller recounted later, and raised the boy and his sister, Jane.\n\nMr. Miller attended Young Harris College before transferring to Emory University in Atlanta. Finding his life lacking in direction or purpose, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1953 and enrolled at the University of Georgia three years later, earning a bachelor's degree and a master's in history.\n\nIn 1954, he married Shirley Carver, who survives him, as do two sons, Murphy and Matthew; four grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nHe taught history and political science at Young Harris College and was elected mayor of Young Harris, serving in 1959 and 1960. He was then elected to two two-year terms in the State Senate. Next, he was executive secretary for Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia from 1968 to 1971. He was credited with exerting a moderating influence on Mr. Maddox, a segregationist, and spurring him to appoint blacks to his administration.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Mr. Miller spent 16 years as lieutenant governor under George Busbee and Joe Frank Harris, serving in that post longer than anyone else in Georgia history. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate seat in 1980, was elected governor in 1990 and re-elected in 1994.\n\nAs governor, Mr. Miller fought to have the Confederate battle emblem removed from the state flag, supported tough sentences for repeat criminal offenders and pushed legislation providing more money for public schools and scholarships for high school students. By the time he stepped down, after his second term, he was one of the most popular politicians in Georgia history.\n\nWhile in the Senate, Mr. Miller campaigned on behalf of Senator Max Cleland, a fellow Georgia Democrat, in Mr. Cleland's unsuccessful bid for re-election in 2002.\n\nYet as a former senator in 2008, Mr. Miller supported Senator Saxby Chambliss, the Republican who had unseated Mr. Cleland, asserting that Mr. Chambliss \"could well be the last man standing between a far, far left liberal agenda sailing through the Senate.\" Mr. Chambliss won re-election.\n\nMr. Miller acquired the nickname \"Zigzag Zell\" among some Democratic Party leaders. As he crossed into his senior years, he often endorsed Republicans in Georgia races. Yet he always insisted that he would be a Democrat \"until I die,\" and that the party had abandoned him on some issues, not the other way around.\n\nSo why did he remain in the Democratic Party?\n\n\"I compare it to being in an old house,\" he said just before he left the Senate. \"It's a house that I've lived in for years that's getting kind of drafty and hard to heat. The plumbing won't work, and some strangers have moved into the basement, and I don't know who they are, and there's no doubt I would be more comfortable in another house. But, you see, I was here first. I've lived in this house for years and years. It's home, and I'm not going to leave.\"",

That was 45 percent higher than the $21-per-share price at which the company sold 36 million shares on Thursday night. The initial public offering valued Dropbox at $9.2 billion.\n\nThe I.P.O. comes at a dicey time. Stock markets have been on a roller coaster, with investors anxious about the threat of inflation, possible trade wars and geopolitical risks. The technology industry in particular has been buffeted by the prospect of tougher government regulation.\n\nThe jump in price on Friday for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the investing public remains willing to offer a crucial exit point for investors in the largest Silicon Valley start-ups. And that could indicate that the venture capital market could continue to be hot for some time.\n\n\"It's going to put capital back in the system,\" said Jackie Kelley, an expert in initial public offerings at EY, the accounting firm formerly called Ernst & Young. \"There's going to be some large returns.

                "body": "On Wednesday, Weber said that while he is a frequent migrant down the sideline, one boundary is clear.\n\n\"My thing is, if you yell at the refs, you should get a technical,\" he said.\n\nBut , he defended his intention -- leading his team to victory -- and actions -- shouting, pacing, pushing the limits of the coach's box.\n\n\"If we're coaching our guys,\" he said, \"that's what we're paid to do.\"\n\nThe N.C.A.A. doesn't necessarily disagree. This is the first season of an expanded coach's box, which is the area the head coach may patrol during play. Vigorous sideline generals received an extra 10 feet this season; they may now roam from the baseline all the way to a mark 38 feet away. That's a midrange jump shot from midcourt, which is 47 feet from the baseline.\n\n\"I have had officials tell me that it was expanded for me,\" Weber said.\n\nCollege basketball coaches are easy subjects for ridicule. N.B.A. fans scoff at their hyperactivity and point to professional coaches' comparatively calm mien, even though N.B.A. coaches may stray as much as 43 feet from the baseline. Casual observers wonder why these blustering, nattily dressed bombasts can't stay cool.\n\nThe college coaches say they deserve sympathy. Their charges are younger than most players in the N.B.A. Their teams can feel especially far away while on defense, seeking crucial late-game stops out of vocal range for even the loudest coach. Most coaches are former players with decades of experience who now watch mostly helplessly as post-adolescents try to implement months of training in a few essential seconds. Their antics also make for great TV.\n\nYet they have to stay inside an invisible box during games or risk a penalty that could tangibly hurt their team. The correct call for a coach's box violation after a warning is a Class B technical foul, giving the other team one free throw and the ball, inbounded where it was when the foul was called.\n\n\"I have a young team, and sometimes they don't talk,\" Alabama Coach Avery Johnson said last week between first- and second-round games. \"You can hear it in my voice. I've got to talk for them. I got warned yesterday, and, probably, going to get warned tomorrow.\"\n\nDespite plenty of yelling and straying, Johnson and Alabama lost to Duke Sunday night.\n\nIn a world where referees \"T-up\" coaches for far more subjectively determined violations, there is an argument that the coach's box is extraneous, even condescending. Anecdotally, there appear to be few T's actually called (the N.C.A.A. said it did not keep the statistic). Kansas Coach Bill Self complained that he had been whistled once this year \"for sticking my toe two inches outside the box.\"\n\n\"We represent universities. We're grown men. We're employed. We get treated like we're immature. We've got to be in this small little confined area,\" South Carolina Coach Frank Martin said in a phone interview. \"We're not going to go to the other bench and instigate something.\"\n\nThis understanding was partly why the box was expanded, according to Art Hyland, secretary-rules editor of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball rules committee. It is also why referees are instructed to first give the bench a warning.\n\n\"People felt empathy that the coaches really needed a little more room in order to do their job correctly,\" Hyland said.\n\nAn extra 10 feet turns out to be a lot, Self said Thursday in Omaha, Neb., before the Jayhawks' round of 16 game. He thought it was a \"pretty insignificant change\" when it was announced last June, but now that it has been in place for a season, he said, \"It's been a great rule.\"\n\n\"You feel like you can actually have a little bit more communication on the other end of the floor,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, before Thursday night's violation, Calipari blamed the tight strictures of the old box for one of the most infamous coach's box technical fouls in the college game.\n\nIn 1992, Calipari's Massachusetts team was playing Kentucky in the round of 16 at The Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Minutemen had made up most of a double-digit deficit late in the second half when a referee called a technical foul on Calipari for a coach's box violation. The referee \"was 50 feet away from the UMass bench when he called it,\" The Baltimore Sun reported. The call swung the momentum back the Wildcats' way, and they won. (They lost the next game to Duke on Christian Laettner's famous buzzer-beater.)\n\n\"At the Spectrum where they had all those lines, I'm standing there and the guy calls a T from 90 feet away. 'You're out of the box,'\" Calipari said. \"And I really wasn't out of the box, but it looked like it.\"\n\nCalipari had no such defense or excuse Thursday night.\n\nIn practice, there is frequently a live-and-let-live dynamic between referees and hyperactive coaches. Warnings are issued; actual fouls, less so.\n\nEd Hightower, a retired referee, said officials often find that assistant coaches are better interlocutors for conveying the warnings. Speraw, Weber's assistant, said that the referees had spoken to the staff at halftime of the U.M.B.C. game.\n\nWhen warning coaches that they were in danger of violating this rule, Hightower said he would often say, \"You don't want to make me do something I don't want to do.\"\n\n\"Ninety percent of the time, I would say, the coaches are just so caught up in the moment, coaching their kids,\" Hightower said. \"It's an emotional sport.\"",

                "title": "We Asked 7 Lawyers to Untangle the Broadway Fight Over 'To Kill a Mockingbird'",
                "body": "At stake is how a new generation will encounter one of the 20th Century's most famous American stories. The Sorkin version is scheduled to open on Broadway in December, and, if successful, could ultimately be produced around the country and beyond.\n\nSo what happens now? The two sides could settle the dispute. Or the case could go to trial. In the meantime, we asked seven lawyers with relevant expertise to help us untangle the thicket -- how much change is permissible, and who gets to decide whether the script crosses that line?\n\n\"This case involves two titans of creative expression -- Harper Lee wrote an American masterpiece, and Aaron Sorkin is using his unique skills to bring it to the stage,\" said Joshua Simmons, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis. \"The thrust of the case is whether the integrity of Lee's novel has been compromised, or the play is a faithful adaptation within the scope of the producers' rights.\"\n\nHere is how our panel of lawyers looked at key issues in the case:\n\nThe play is not supposed to depart from \"the spirit of the novel\" nor \"alter its characters.\" What does that mean for the playwright's ability to interpret and change source material?\n\nThe language of the contract that is at issue -- \"the play shall not derogate or depart in any manner from the spirit of the novel nor alter its characters\" (emphasis added) -- could be interpreted in a limiting manner in the Lee estate's favor, but the underlying concepts \"spirit of the novel\" and what it means to \"alter\" a character are themselves ambiguous. Interpreting this provision strictly arguably could bar the addition of a new major character, which the letter seems to allege has taken place, but it also could be interpreted more broadly to allow for changes that are consistent with the spirit of the novel and meaning that existing characters' natures cannot be changed. It is quite possible that the parties had different understandings and it is no wonder that a dispute has turned to litigation.\n\n-- Cheryl Davis, general counsel of the Authors Guild\n\nDoes \"spirit\" have a definite and precise meaning, or could there be a difference of opinion as to what is \"the spirit\" of the novel? I do not think that a dictionary definition of \"spirit\" will resolve that question. Similarly, the contract states that the characters should not be altered. In its pre-action letter, Harper Lee's estate repeatedly states that the characters \"would never have\" and \"would not have\" done numerous things; unless as a matter of historical fact the characters would not have done something (because it had not yet occurred at the time when the novel takes place or when it was written), who is to say what a creature of fiction \"would never have\" or \"would not have\" done? The person who created those characters, Harper Lee, is dead.\n\n-- Jordan Greenberger, intellectual property lawyer\n\nMy own sense, having read the complaint, is that it includes a mix of valid concerns about anachronism and character arcs with highly contestable interpretations, ones we have no real way to know whether Lee would have shared. One might disagree, for example, about exactly how black men and women who \"knew their place\" (as the letter describes both Calpurnia and Tom) would behave and speak in light of that knowledge, especially where the audience is not having its experience filtered through the perceptions of a young white girl. [\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is narrated by Atticus's daughter, Scout.]\n\n-- Rebecca Tushnet, professor of First Amendment law, Harvard Law School\n\nMs. Lee retained the \"absolute and unconditional right\" to approve the choice of playwright, but her control over the script is more ambiguous -- the agreement says only that if she has concerns (or, since she has since died, if her estate does) the producer is to be notified, and there should be \"an opportunity to discuss.\" Under the terms of the contract, can the estate demand changes to the script?\n\nThe provision gives the author (in effect, now the estate) absolute approval rights only over the selection of the playwright. Thereafter the author's role seems primarily advisory.\n\n-- Jane Ginsburg, professor of literary and artistic property law, Columbia Law School\n\nThe relevant clause is very clear that Lee had the absolute, unfettered discretion to approve or disapprove a playwright, whether or not her choices were reasonable. The very next sentence is about the interpretation of the characters once the playwright was selected, and its language, in contrast, is not particularly prescriptive; it basically says that if there's a problem, the parties agree to hear each other out. The contrast in language suggests to me that Lee's control over interpretation was loaded onto the choice of a playwright. Of course that leaves the estate feeling betrayed, but because this question is about fidelity of interpretation, the contract was always going to leave at least one party vulnerable to the creative decisions of the other.\n\n-- Rebecca Tushnet, professor of First Amendment law, Harvard Law School\n\nDoes it matter that Mr. Sorkin is a known quantity?\n\nIf the parties included an express right of approval for the playwright, why did they not similarly include an express right of approval for the script? Further, by approving Aaron Sorkin as the playwright, did Harper Lee expect that the script would include Sorkin's unique voice?\n\n-- Jordan Greenberger, intellectual property lawyer\n\nThe estate's reading of the contract to give it extensive control over the script is perplexing because one would wonder why a playwright of the stature the estate seeks would agree to the constraints the estate says the agreement imposes. Exercising its absolute right to approve the selection of the playwright, the estate approved Aaron Sorkin; the estate has now identified numerous alleged departures from the novel in the way the characters in the play express themselves, but is it really surprising that Sorkin would filter the 1930s Alabama story through what the estate seems to perceive as an anachronistic contemporary New York sensibility?\n\n-- Jane Ginsburg, professor of literary and artistic property law, Columbia Law School\n\nThis is not a frivolous lawsuit, and barring settlement, Mr. Rudin and Mr. Sorkin should lose. According to facts set out by the Lee estate, the stage play in its current draft undeniably alters several of the central characters. (Beyond recognition? No. But that's not the standard in the contract.) Though Mr. Rudin's lawyer has argued to the contrary, the precise language of the contract is reasonably clear that if the stage play ultimately alters the characters, the deal is off.\n\n-- Barton Beebe, professor of intellectual property law, N.Y.U. School of Law\n\nBetween the contract language and the customs in the theater industry, I believe that the producers will be allowed to modernize and adapt \"Mockingbird\" to today's generation and the play will not need to mimic the novel.\n\n-- Dave Rein, lawyer at Erickson Kernell IP and chairman of the Literary Works Committee, American Bar Association",

                "title": "Opinion | 20 Years After the Shooting on the Playground",
                "body": "The ritual is now familiar, and I see it in the outpouring of support for the students from Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed last month. The list of the unthinkable -- kids shot at school -- has gotten so much longer since 1998. Every time another shooting occurs, I enter a near-catatonic state. It's almost impossible to talk about with anyone who hasn't experienced one, though. How do you bring that up on a third date after the shooting at Pulse or with your cubicle mate after the massacre at Newtown?\n\nThere's one group who understands all of this: my classmates from the playground, my fellow survivors. We call ourselves the Westside Warriors. It's with them, on our class Facebook page, that I feel least alone when new tragedies occur and where I can visit Paige in vivid color just as she was. I imagine that most alumni pages are saved for hilarious pictures of bad hair and weird jeans or used to swap stories about how crazy 10th-grade homecoming was. We don't share stories like that. We share pictures of the classmates we lost. We talk about how hard it is to turn off the TV after the newest deadly event. We communicate to keep the memorial garden, our old school playground, manicured. We collect condolence gifts to send to the newest victims as if we're the ambassadors of grief. It's what was done for us. Most important, the Facebook page is our refuge every March.\n\nThis March 24 will mark the 20th anniversary of the shooting at Westside Middle School. It's also the chosen date of the March for Our Lives rally, part of the movement led by students to do something about gun violence.\n\nI had already been dreading this March. Not only was I to mourn the 20th anniversary of our shooting, but also the Las Vegas shooting, from last fall, and Sutherland Springs, Tex., immediately following, in November -- the sadness of each shooting attached itself to my own. The Facebook page had been steadfast, though, there for anniversaries, other shootings or just the down days, and we members help each other get through. I imagined on the 20th anniversary that we would come together and indulge in our grief as always. We would post and text and email and call, carrying the torch for our sweet, sad, little day.\n\nThen 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nSo, this March 24 -- 20 years after the shooting on our playground -- will no longer be about just us. My immediate reaction to hearing about the March for Our Lives was anger and indignation, because now Paige's memory would be one mixed in with so many.\n\nI called a friend from the playground, and we talked it through and agreed to march. And it felt good to have something to do on that terrible day, a day when it's normally hard to even get out of bed. We now had a plan. We would be together in Washington, standing on our grown-up feet and remembering Westside while walking for everyone who's experienced this. And I thought the Warriors would agree; I thought that would be the clear consensus.\n\nThat's why my breath was taken away by a post to the Facebook group that denounced the march entirely. Some members were upset that the day was being taken from us, but many were even more upset about the agenda of the event. They thought it was purposely planned to drive a political point home, one that they did not agree with.\n\nPeople posted that the organizers were \"against all guns,\" that they chose \"our day of remembrance\" for their political agenda. People talked about arming teachers, increasing security, running \"lockdown drills.\"\n\nI understand that some people make an argument for preparedness over prevention, but it is an argument that I can't accept. If my classmates think back to 1998, I imagine they'll remember our teachers were white as sheets and frozen with fear. I personally had to shove a grown woman aside in order to dial 911 because she was in understandable shock. One teacher was able to pull a student to cover and safety, but that was the most she could do. She couldn't have fought off our attackers and I don't think it would have been right to ask her to. No person knows how he or she would react in a time like that, so the idea of arming teachers lends itself to a false sense of security.\n\nBeyond my lack of confidence in the practicality of arming teachers as a solution, the discussion made me incredibly sad. It meant we accept this as our new norm. Westside was the beginning of an epidemic. It was jarring to find a group of survivors -- my former classmates -- as divided as our country. It felt like they were responding with jaded, grown-up brains instead of the honest, childhood hearts we had when we were younger.\n\nI cannot accept that more guns will solve the issue of more shootings. Some of my classmates wrote that they \"don't want to be lumped into the gun debate,\" but you cannot talk about a shooting without talking about guns.\n\nThey send journals to the newest survivors, encouraging them to write their feelings and begin their healing. But this is a generation that has grown up with many platforms to voice their opinions, and they're not satisfied with hiding their thoughts in a journal tucked away on a shelf. Standing up, speaking out and marching may be part of their therapy. One of the comments to our Facebook thread read: \"It's just all different than ours was. These people have a serious agenda: to get rid of guns.\" That's true. It is different than ours. These victims are helping themselves by fighting for common-sense gun laws to save the future.\n\nEach March 24 is harder for me than the last because, as an adult, I'm able to better define how horrific the shooting really was. In less than 10 minutes on that playground, my classmates and I gained a deeper understanding of evil and fear than most people experience in their entire lives. I can't trade the Warriors for a group that agrees with me, but I can march this weekend in Washington to ensure that in 20 years Emma González won't be writing to remind you of her story and her friends. She'll be writing to commemorate the day we stood up and said never again.",

                "title": "Five Things I Learned on My Quebec Road Trip: The Canada Letter",
                "body": "Immigrant groups, whether Jews or Muslims or Sikhs, feel like a minority in a province where secularism is ingrained culturally because of the historic revolution against the influence of the Catholic Church in the 1960s. \"We are all minorities in Quebec,\" the detective novelist Louise Penny told me. \"It creates a frisson\" in everyday life.\n\n2. Quebecers sometimes act like British people who speak French. The French influence in the province is omnipresent in the language, the architecture, the exquisite bread and cheese. But the influence of British colonialism is still strong, especially when it comes to the Quebec kitchen, with its meat pies, or tourtières, and poutine, the artery-hardening hangover cure. At the same time, there is a seeming cultural propensity for politeness that reminds me of Britain, my previous home.\n\nThis bifurcated cultural swagger makes Quebec unique in Canada and, as a former resident of London and Paris, I sometimes feel transported back to those places without having to hop on a plane.\n\n3. Fear and loathing of Trump. From multicultural Montreal to Quebec's manufacturing regions, Quebecers expressed bemusement and concern about President Trump's America. In Saguenay, factory owners and workers told me they had lost sleep over fear that Mr. Trump would impose tariffs on Canadian exports like paper products or aluminum, and undermine their businesses and livelihoods.\n\nAt a sprawling aluminum factory in Chicoutimi, which supplies aluminum to American car companies, workers warned that American consumers would suffer in the event of a trade war. \"We just can't afford for that to happen,\" one told me.\n\n4. Separatism is sputtering. As I traveled across the province, many Quebecers, with rare exceptions, told me they were no longer consumed by the quest for independence or the cultural battles of the past. This was particularly pronounced among the younger generation.\n\nIn Quebec City, a large group of teenagers at St. Charles Garnier College told me they saw their future in a globalized Quebec that is firmly a part of Canada. In Montreal, young people seemed more intent on finding the hippest cafe than whether they needed to order a coffee in the language of Shakespeare or Voltaire.\n\nYet there were notable exceptions, including in industrial Saguenay where the desire for national self-determination remains strong. \"Our generation is facing the broken dream that independence isn't going to happen any time soon,\" said Gérard Bouchard, a leading intellectual.\n\n5. Bigger is better. When I was devouring a three-layered almond foie gras cake at Martin Picard's Cabane à Sucre au Pied de Cochon, it occurred to me that minimalism would not be on the menu during my Quebec road trip. That was only the first course and 12 courses followed, cementing that view. (To make room in our stomachs, a waitress brought periodic shots of cognac and maple delivered in a tube.)\n\nThis convivial excess became a leitmotif of the trip, and seems to reflect a culture marinated in French joie de vivre and a North American reverence for supersized everything. It also comes down to a Quebec spirit of hospitality and mischievous fun.\n\nNext week, I return the newsletter to Ian Austen. Thanks for reading.\n\nIf you missed any part of the road trip, catch up on my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts, as well as on The Times's Reader Center. And please be sure to let us know your reactions to the road trip and give us any other suggestions you have on our Canada coverage.\n\n-- Perhaps the most famous backyard rink in Canada was the one Walter Gretzky used to make in Brantford, Ontario, for his son Wayne. A citizen science project based in nearby Waterloo is tracking what may become the extinction of natural ice rinks in Canada.\n\n-- The latest New York Times Critics' Pick is \"Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story,\" a tale that take place in Halifax in 1908. It was written by Hannah Moscovitch, who divides her time between Toronto and Halifax, and is based on her great-grandparents' stories. In her review, Alexis Soloski wrote that the play is \"a broad allegory\" for the current refugee crisis that \"mixes bitter herbs with apples and honey.\"\n\n-- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government restored some gun control measures that had been loosened by the previous Conservative government. While the changes stopped well short of reviving a widely debated federal registry for rifles and firearms, they nevertheless angered some gun owners' groups.\n\n-- Larry Kwong's National Hockey League career was extremely brief -- perhaps a minute or so. But that one shift with the New York Rangers in 1948 made Mr. Kwong, who has died at the age of 94, the first N.H.L. player of Asian descent.",

                "title": "Trading Cards: A Hobby That Became a Multimillion-Dollar Investment",
                "body": "Mr. Hill and his wife have put about 20 percent of their net worth in baseball cards, he said. They did so for both investment and aesthetic reasons.\n\n\"What's more fun?\" Mr. Hill asked. \"Having a Babe Ruth rookie card or shares of stock where one false move and it goes down?\"\n\nThe cards make for remarkably portable assets. If Mr. Hill held his 1916 Babe Ruth card in one hand and his 1952 Mickey Mantle in the other, he would have about $1.2 million pinched between his fingers.\n\nThose sky-high values mean that collecting cards is no longer child's play; it's a big-money realm of affluent collectors who have their eye on returns. And Mr. Hill is part of a growing group of collectors who see their cards as investments, even if the type of investment they are -- artwork or security -- is debatable.\n\nPWCC, an auction site for trading cards of all kinds, is set to introduce a series of indexes modeled on the S.&P. 500 to help collectors track the value of their cards and understand what their portfolio is worth.\n\nThe company has three indexes of the top-trading high-value cards: the top 100, 500 and 2,500. The indexes are based on auction sales data from the past 10 years.\n\nThe top three are the 1952 Mantle, like Mr. Hill's; a 1954 Hank Aaron card; and a 1933 Babe Ruth card. Over the past decade, the Mantle card has appreciated 590 percent, the Aaron card 829 percent, and the Ruth card 305 percent.\n\n\"Most collectors feel they've done well with their cards as investments,\" said Brent Huigens, chief executive of PWCC Auctions. \"But there was no statistical analysis available. There was no data for them.\"\n\nMr. Huigens said card collecting was something of a hybrid of investing in stocks and fine art, and his indexes try to account for that. \"There's a lot of nostalgia in cards, which compares to the art markets,\" he said. \"But it's like a stock market because of all the data we have.\"\n\nPWCC, which is one of 10 or so big card auction sites, helped collectors sell $50 million in cards last year.\n\nLike any investment, what goes up can go down, and investing in trading cards has its own risks. Mr. Huigens pointed out that many cards in the top 500 have fallen in value. There have also been several card bubbles over the past three decades.\n\nHe said a small group of collectors with about $20 million among them ran up prices in 2016, but the broader collecting market did not follow. \"They put all their money into one card and not others,\" he said. \"They created outliers they couldn't maintain. The market has had to reassess itself.\"\n\nThe other driving force in turning a card hobby into an investment opportunity has been the acceptance of a single recognized grading system for the condition of the cards. An independent company called Professional Sports Authenticator will rate any card and give a grade from 0 to 10, which assesses a card's condition and, in most cases, determines its price.\n\nThe rising interest in cards as investments, though, is not spread evenly through the collecting universe; it is strongest at the highest end. Mr. Huigens said the rate of appreciation -- and high prices -- slows beyond the top 100 cards.\n\nBut like any investment, you need a strategy. Mr. Hill said he focused on cards where \"supply meets demand.\"\n\n\"You can't just buy rarity,\" he said. \"If it's the only one, everyone is going to know what you paid for it. There is no chance for appreciation. You have to wait for someone to come to your door and wrestle it away from you.\"\n\nThe PWCC indexes shy away from the rarest cards because, Mr. Huigens said, they do not trade often enough, and the indexes are a measure of cards that are liquid. One parameter he set was all the included cards must have been sold at least 10 times in the last 10 years, with at least two sales in the last two months.\n\nPWCC also uses the grade -- not just on the player, the year and the maker -- when picking cards for its indexes. The top card in the index is the 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle in Grade 8 condition, which is worth about $400,000. There are only 33 known examples of this card in the world, Mr. Huigens said.\n\n(There are more expensive examples of the 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle; a Grade 10 card is worth around $10 million -- but there are only three of those in the world and they don't change hands often, so they are excluded from the index.)\n\nSitting atop the excluded list is a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, once owned by the hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky. (Mr. Gretzky's own 1979 playing card is ranked No. 44, at a price of $25,000, the second-highest ranked hockey card behind Gordie Howe's.)\n\nTo collectors, this Honus Wagner card has a mystical aura. It has been in the collection of Ken Kendrick, managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, since 2007. He reportedly bought it privately for $2.8 million, but its value now would be far higher -- should he wish to sell it.\n\nMr. Kendrick owns the top 25 cards in the finest specimens available. Yet he remains a collector's collector. In an interview, he said that in the 1990s, when he stepped back from running Datatel, the technology company he founded, his first priority was to complete the sets that he and his brother created when they were boys.\n\nHe needed 40 cards for the full 1952 set, he recalled, and he went to work.\n\n\"During that time, I began to learn about the high-value cards with great grades,\" said Mr. Kendrick, whose Diamondbacks will host the Colorado Rockies on opening day on Thursday.\n\nHe made it his focus to acquire the top 25 cards in the highest grades.\n\n\"The cards that I own are more akin to works of art,\" Mr. Kendrick said. \"They're valued like rare paintings because they are so rare, and they do carry very high price tags if they're resold.\"\n\nMr. Huigens said that Mr. Kendrick's Honus Wagner and Mickey Mantle cards were together worth more than $20 million.\n\nWould-be collectors need not lay down so much money to get started; the prices for high-quality cards can be as low as the hundreds or thousands of dollars. \"I have cards worth $600,000 or $700,000,\" Mr. Hill said. \"But I also have another 1,000 cards that don't add up to that price.\"\n\nHe said he constantly bought and sold cards, both to realize gains and to fill holes in his collection.\n\nBaseball dominates card collecting, but other sports have climbed high in the PWCC index ranking, usually with cards of the sports' best players. The highest ranked non-baseball card comes in at No. 15: a Grade 10 rookie card of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson from 1980. It is worth about $75,000.\n\nThe highest ranked football card is a Joe Namath Topps card from 1965. It's No. 37 and worth $35,000 in a near-perfect grade of 8.\n\nYounger buyers are driving card collecting in a different direction. A first-edition set of the 1999 North American set of Pokémon cards with the top grade recently sold at auction for $98,000.\n\n\"The market has changed in terms of how the youth is involved or exposed to it,\" said Joseph Orlando, chief executive of Collectors Universe, the parent company of Professional Sports Authenticator. \"For a whole generation of millennials, Pokémon was a game with universal, global appeal.\"\n\nFor most collectors, a love of the hobby remains at the center. Mr. Kendrick said he was working on improving the quality of the cards in his 1952 Topps set.\n\n\"I have a full set of cards from that year and extra cards, but they're not the most highly graded,\" he said. \"I've moved up the rankings, and I'm No. 2.\"\n\nAs for No. 1? \"A lawyer in Alabama,\" Mr. Kendrick said. \"He knows I'm gaining on him.\"",

                "title": "Responding to Trump's Tariffs, China Shows 'Cautious Anger'",
                "body": "Analysts say the latest round of United States tariffs, if imposed, would likely have a minimal impact on the Chinese economy. While Mr. Trump chose confrontational rhetoric toward China in announcing his latest move, actual details were sparse and amounted in many ways to a threat as opposed to an actual imposition of tariffs.\n\nBut the escalating tensions, and the prospect of further action by China, has nevertheless raised concerns.\n\n\"We do seem to be entering a trade war,\" Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"The U.S. has unsheathed its sword after an extended period of saber rattling and the Chinese are now unsheathing their weapons.\"\n\n\"I hope this will not spiral into a very broad set of sanctions on both sides,\" he said, \"but I think, given Mr. Trump's instincts and his very keen desire to deliver a political win whatever the political fallout might be, I don't think it can be tamped down now.\"\n\nStock markets in Asia slid on news of the escalating trade confrontation. By the close of trade on Friday, benchmark stock indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell 2.5 percent and 3.4 percent respectively, tracking an overnight drop in Wall Street.\n\nThe American restrictions announced on Thursday would include tariffs of 25 percent on a list of specific goods, a proposal that is set to be made in the coming days, followed by a 30-day public consultation. During that time, the administration may hold more talks with the Chinese government, and lobbyists will wage an energetic fight to have their employers' products removed from the list.\n\nThe loss to China from the planned tariffs would amount to no more than 0.1 percent of China's economic output, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. JPMorgan said the potentially affected exports from China would account for 2.2 percent of the country's total exports, which totaled about $2.3 trillion in 2017.\n\n\"The upshot is that today's tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,\" Mr. Williams wrote in a note.\n\nChina would charge a 15 percent tariff on the American-produced products listed in Friday's announcement.\n\nAnother round of tariffs could be imposed on a second group of American-made goods after China evaluates the impact of the American trade measures against China. That group would be charged 25 percent tariffs. It said businesses and other parties had until March 31 to submit views about the retaliatory tariffs, meaning they could take effect only after that date.\n\nBut there are many ways that China, America's biggest foreign creditor and its third-largest export market, could intensify its response. In particular, it could add aircraft and soybeans -- both enormous American industries for which China is a critical market -- to its list of restricted items. The United States exports $12.4 billion worth of soybeans to China, and analysts say that Boeing, which competes against Airbus of Europe to sell jetliners to Chinese carriers, is another obvious target.\n\n\"China does not want to fight a trade war but is absolutely not afraid of a trade war,\" a Commerce Ministry representative said in a statement. \"We are confident and capable of meeting any challenge and hope that the United States will pause on the brink of a precipice, make careful decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\"\n\nFor now, the proposed Chinese penalties appear to be a carefully calibrated response to the American steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect on Friday. Beijing's restrictions would affect $2.97 billion worth of American steel, aluminum and pork. That is roughly equivalent to the $2.79 billion worth of steel and aluminum that China exported to the United States last year, according to Commerce Department data.\n\nThe goods that Beijing plans to penalize represents about 2 percent of the total size of American exports to China, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"It's not devastating economically by any stretch but it's certainly going to hurt those interests in the United States that are trying to export,\" Mr. Bown said. He pointed out that the retaliation by China sends \"a negative signal, that they are not seeking to de-escalate things.\"\n\nChina also picked its targets carefully by choosing goods that had political resonance, akin to what the European Union chose to do this month by targeting bourbon, bluejeans and motorcycles, products made in states with Republican politicians or which supported Mr. Trump in his 2016 election victory. In China's case, pork comes from Nebraska and the Midwest, states that backed Mr. Trump.\n\n\"I would say that China's proposal is quite restrained,\" said Song Guoyou, deputy director of the American Studies center at Fudan University in Shanghai. Mr. Song characterized China's response as \"cautious anger.\"\n\nThat may not last for long, as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing widens.\n\nIn February, China opened an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into sorghum imports from the United States, less than two weeks after the United States said it was imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines that were aimed at curbing cheap imports from China and South Korea.\n\n\"China is still being moderate and is appropriately counterattacking,\" said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, an agriculture consulting firm. \"Both sides appear to be sounding each other out.\"",

                "title": "Opinion | Quitting Heroin in the Sunshine State",
                "body": "I am 25, and these days everyone around me is mostly young, in their 20s and early 30s. And yet they are dying -- from bad batches of what is supposed to be heroin but is probably fentanyl or its more potent analogues: sufentanil, which is five to 10 times as potent as fentanyl; and carfentanil, which is 100 times as potent. In 2016, more than 64,000 drug users died by accidental overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than the number of Americans killed in Vietnam in 19 years of war.\n\nIn fact, so many are dying that President Trump announced new measures on Monday to combat the epidemic. But his ideas -- with the exception of calling for the death penalty for opioid dealers -- were almost too vague to note.\n\nThe president said he was devoting the \"most money ever spent on the opioid crisis.\" But his performance about getting \"tough\" on dealers will probably only distract from effective government programs that might relieve some of the damage wrought by the epidemic.\n\nIt's too late to help the dead, and I doubt he will do much to help the living, either -- those of us who cycle through relapse and recovery, the friends, acquaintances and housemates who vanish without word, sometimes for weeks at a time into the motels that are like holding cells for the down and out and dissipating.\n\nMy drugs of choice were heroin and cocaine, both of which I took intravenously almost daily for many years, beginning in high school. I had been diagnosed early in life with major depressive disorder and A.D.H.D., had taken Prozac since age 13, and Ritalin and its chemical variants, off and on since age 7. When I first encountered heroin and cocaine, they fazed me no more than any of the other psychotropics that I took to stabilize my moods.\n\nBy the time I got to the New School in Manhattan, I was undeniably a junkie; I studied literature, but I often skipped class to hang out with the crust punks of Union Square. They were such losers, all of them, and so was I, and there was kinship in that.\n\nMy friend Jessica lived on one of the park benches there, and we would squander days downtown, slouching across the East Village into Chelsea, where we would cop dope and shoot it in the bathroom at the Strand, where you don't need a code to get inside. After Jessica got her pit bull -- whom she found one morning in the Bronx, chained to a fence and covered in scabs, like he was meant to break your heart -- we went to the bathrooms in the basement at Petco instead, where an eight- millimeter syringe tip once broke off into my arm.\n\nWe were such apparent scum in those days, self-destructing in the wide-open, too sloppy and sinking to seem threatening, that it sometimes felt as if we were living below the law.\n\nJessica had hepatitis C. According to the most recent statistics from the C.D.C., there were an estimated 30,900 cases of new acute hepatitis C virus infections in the United States in 2015. Hep C is curable, but the treatment is expensive. There are programs that will cover the cost, but most will only take addicts who have been clean for a month or more. I lost track of Jessica, as I have with so many friends from those days. I can only hope she got treatment.\n\nBut, from a public health perspective, it would be far better to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases in the first place. The best way to do that is by dispensing sterile injection equipment.\n\nThe Harm Reduction Coalition, which was founded in 1993, is one of many organizations working to build a nationwide network of needle exchange programs that provide IV drug users with free clean syringes as well as training in how to administer naloxone (trade name Narcan), the antidote to opioid overdose.\n\nThe theory of \"harm reduction\" is born of the palliative notion that a person can be made safer and more comfortable even while he is actively in the throes of addiction. It concedes that \"drug use is part of our world and chooses to work to minimize its harmful effects rather than simply ignore or condemn them,\" according to the coalition's website.\n\nBut in many cities, it is hard if not impossible to find sterile injection equipment. Here in Florida, Palm Beach County is the only area that allows pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription.\n\nWhen I could not stop injecting drugs, and yet held out hope that I might one day like to live, access to clean syringes, as well as to sterile water, tourniquets, sharps containers and filters for IV solutions, enabled me to evade scourges like H.I.V., sepsis and endocarditis, which grows like a culture around the valves of the heart and can require surgery.\n\nBack when I was buying drugs deep into Brooklyn's ungentrified warrens, I'd often take clean syringes to addicts who were homeless, who either could not afford to or were not allowed to buy them from pharmacies. Such scarcity led many addicts to use the same syringe for weeks at a time.\n\nToward the end of my active addiction last winter, when I was myself homeless and panhandling in the East Village, Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center, at 25 Allen Street, saved me from having to share syringes.\n\nI am fortunate to have been covered under my mother's insurance plan, which allowed me the luxury of kicking smack in private treatment centers where all day long we drank Gatorade, and I took Valium for my restless legs while dozing to reruns of the \"Forensic Files.\" It was my mom who eventually insisted I commit myself to getting clean, and booked me into River Oaks, for which I'm grateful.\n\nDown here, passing from one detox center or rehab program to another is known as the South Florida Shuffle.\n\n\"The Florida Shuffle isn't necessarily going from bad place to bad place,\" said Dr. Dawn Silver, the clinical director of the Comprehensive Wellness Centers in Lantana, Fla. \"It's being at one place with your insurance money having dried up, and needing to go use again in order for insurance to cover you again -- and then finding a different facility that will pick you up.\"\n\nGaming the insurance rules like this is often the only way for addicts to keep getting legitimate and often lifesaving care, and to avoid ending up homeless. But it also leaves addicts vulnerable to \"body brokering,\" in which fraudulent treatment centers overbill insurers without really treating the patient.\n\nI did the shuffle for a while, getting lost in the run of days, phasing through detox and rehab, moving from Tampa to Boca Raton to Delray Beach to Lantana to Deerfield Beach to here. I have faltered along the way, but I have been sober now for six months.\n\nThey say in recovery that relapse is part of getting well. The writer Maia Szalavitz put it beautifully in this newspaper when she wrote: \"The ability to persevere is an asset: People with addiction just need to learn how to redirect it.\"\n\nIn 12-step meetings, tokens are handed out on anniversaries to signify periods of sobriety -- 30 days, 90 days, six months clean, a year or more sober, as if we are doing time. However, I think that using time to measure the quality of one's spiritual growth is reductive, and can actually refute progress.\n\nIt is, of course, difficult not to contemplate time when one is speaking of recovery, from any illness; one hopes there are stations of progress to which he can look forward to, or reflect upon, fondly, when in the end things seem to have turned out O.K.\n\nSometimes, when I am sitting around in therapy, or pedaling the elliptical at the gym, the thought will occur to me, not always, but from time to time, nothing serious, just a passing thought, a question -- and I will think: Where am I? I think it is strange that I should still be in Florida, seemingly building a life. I did not plan for addiction, and neither did I plan for life after it. But I am every day learning to live again on the better side of sanity.",

The hackers sent so-called phishing emails to unsuspecting people, who gave them access to their computers after opening those emails.\n\n\"These defendants are now fugitives from American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest,\" Geoffrey S.

                "title": "The Trump Boom Is Making It Harder to See the Next Recession",
                "body": "All of this may cause us to assume that the economy will expand forever -- and lead us to forget that recessions tend to come, on average, every five years (though lately, some have taken longer than that to develop). Since 1854, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the United States has had 33 recessions, and it has already been 105 months since the last one.\n\nIf the economy manages to expand for 16 more months, the United States will have set a record. But whenever a recession arrives, the timing is likely to surprise most economists. Data from 1968 to 2017, supplied by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in its quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters, shows that while professional forecasters as a group have had some ability to assess the probability that G.D.P. will decline in the next three months, they have exhibited no ability to do so a year in the future.\n\nIn fact, the latest survey gives a 17 percent probability that real G.D.P. will decline a year from now -- which is the average probability for a decline in one year given in all of the surveys since 1970. In essence, these forecasters are saying that nothing special is on the horizon. The risk of a recession is perfectly average. That might be comforting if these predictions were accurate, but, sadly, they are not.\n\nThen there are the confidence indexes, which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future. There are strong readings in much of the world. But these findings are limited in their scope.\n\nThe Conference Board, for example, in its compilation of the Consumer Confidence Index in the United States, essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of a recession, or may even be in one. The index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for a long and strong boom or a long and damaging depression, though it is a leading indicator of short-term shifts.\n\nAt the moment, Mr. Trump appears to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes. That's to be expected: He may well be the first president who is, at his core, a motivational speaker.\n\n\"Go with your gut,\" he said in the 2007 book \"Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life,\" which he wrote with Bill Zanker. (The title was later changed to \"Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life.\") \"Take chances,\" he said. \"If you think you have the ingredients that you need, take chances, because your biggest successes will happen when you go against the tide.\"\n\nMr. Trump seems to be a living example of going with your gut. Consider his comments on climate change. Scientists generally think global warming is real and human generated. Who would dare to take on all those scientists? Mr. Trump would, because their conclusions just don't sound right to him, even if he can't explain why. And the Trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success: a billionaire, a bon vivant and now president.\n\nIn the same book, Mr. Trump said his approach implied stress: \"I want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives. I want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being a great success.\" But he advocates stressful risk-taking, not quiet contemplation, for readers who can handle it.\n\nMr. Trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them, shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have a hard time capturing. The indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long-term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of high adventuresome spirit in business. Too high, actually.\n\nThis confidence crashed, shifting into the gloom of the Great Depression of the 1930s, a period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment. As the decade wore on, the term \"secular stagnation\" became prominent. That depression was \"great\" partly because it lasted more than 10 years. It wasn't the kind of greatness that Mr. Trump aspires to in his slogan \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nA future downturn isn't a widespread top-of-mind concern, the confidence indexes show. Instead, we may surmise that at the moment, many people are emulating Mr. Trump and trying to think big. Even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success, though this isn't being measured by the confidence indexes.\n\nBut at some point, a significant recession will appear. We can only guess what might make it materialize.\n\nContagious words and stories, analogous to those using the #MeToo hashtag, could be enough to change the public mood about the Trump boom. Maybe a shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot-com collapse: tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed.\n\nA downturn could be set off by compromising stories about Mr. Trump himself, possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war. Or maybe it will be something subtler, whose link to animal spirits and mass psychology is only indirect.\n\nWe don't really know what will do it. But rest assured, the next recession will surely come.",

The appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser places him next to the hand that has access to the nuclear button.\n\nMr. Bolton is the hawk extraordinaire, with a total disdain for accomplishing anything through negotiation. He was an important cog of the George W. Bush team that prosecuted the Iraq war in 2003 and remains adamant that it was the right policy long after even its most ardent proponents distanced themselves from that misadventure.\n\nHe has advocated military pressure against both Iran and North Korea. His attitudes kept him from the position of secretary of state under Mr. Bush when it was made clear to the president that he could not be confirmed.\n\nNow, in his emeritus years, Mr. Bolton has been given one last chance to pursue his extreme ideology, but this time with proximity to the one person who could make it reality. At best, this could mean additional ill-advised deployments of ever greater numbers of American troops. At worst ... well, who wants to consider that?\n\nThat leaves Congress to figure out roadblocks to the execution of a foreign policy that could accelerate every current problem to crisis and beyond. Someone must step up. The urgent need for the emergence of firm, measured leadership has probably not been this great since the Cuban missile crisis.

                "body": "UP IN THE AIR: If you murdered someone, would you know it? That's the premise of Chris Bohjalian's new novel, \"The Flight Attendant,\" which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. A seasoned flight attendant on a layover in Dubai -- a hard-partying, hard-working woman who's also a functioning alcoholic -- wakes up one morning to find the Russian businessman next to her dead, his neck sliced open with the shards of a Stoli bottle. There's a \"great crimson stain on the pillow, and a slick, still-wet pool on the crisp white sheets.\" Furred by the previous night's vodka, she doesn't remember what happened.\n\nThe idea for the novel popped into Bohjalian's head one evening: \"Three ingredients came together alchemically one night in a bar. I had just flown from Armenia to New York and was meeting a friend for dinner in Manhattan. I fly a lot, but I've never lost my wonder at the miracle of aviation. I had just had breakfast in Yerevan, and now I was having dinner in New York City. Second, I had flown through Moscow on Aeroflot. I've always been fascinated by Russia -- the literature, the soul and the fact they always wind up with a Bond villain running the show in the Kremlin.\" And then, he says, \"there was the booze before me. I was at a handsome bar and I was jet-lagged just enough to see the aesthetic beauty in the rituals around which we drink: the colors, the bottles, the glasses. I asked the bartender for all the scrap paper he had, and for the next 45 minutes I wrote frenetically. I think I wrote the first three and a half pages of the novel.\"\n\nBohjalian doesn't outline his novels. \"I'm in awe of writers who outline -- or even those writers who know how a book is going to end when they begin,\" he says. \"I never have even the slightest clue. I depend upon my characters to take me by the hand and lead me through the dark of the story. I've always loved the E.L. Doctorow observation: 'Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.'\"\n\nBohjalian admits that he likes writing books where a character's life changes in a heartbeat. \"I love stories that begin with cataclysmic disequilibrium. How do women and men deal with the sudden, disastrous and possibly ruinous trials? Will they rise to the challenges or be destroyed by them? I have no idea when I'm in the midst of the book,\" he says. \"Sometimes these characters break my heart. Other times they surprise me and, rather like a parent, I'm moved by their resilience.\"",

Starting in May, the series will feature full-color hardback volumes of the comics, many of which are in English for the first time. \"It's an international look at Disney comic creation,\" Michael Catron, the series editor, said.\n\n\"It's taking a look at the very large history of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck from around the world,\" he continued, \" bringing it back and putting it in a 'best of' package for North America.\"\n\nThe first volume is by Mr. Scarpa, a prestigious Italian cartoonist who started working for Disney in 1953. The 200-page volume features a story about Mickey battling against a poison rainstorm. Mr. Scarpa, who died in 2005, was one of the best-known Italian Disney authors.",

According to the latest data, published Friday in JAMA, 7.7 percent of American adults were severely obese in the same period.\n\nThe data -- gathered in a large-scale federal survey that is considered the gold standard for health data -- measured trends in obesity from 2015 and 2016 back to 2007 and 2008, when 5.7 percent of American adults were severely obese and 33.7 percent were obese. The survey counted people with a body mass index of 30 or more as obese, and those with a B.M.I. of 40 or more as severely obese.\n\nPublic health experts said that they were alarmed by the continuing rise in obesity among adults and by the fact that efforts to educate people about the health risks of a poor diet do not seem to be working.\n\n\"Most people know that being overweight or obese is unhealthy, and if you eat too much that contributes to being overweight,\" said Dr. James Krieger, clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington and executive director of Healthy Food America, an advocacy group. \"But just telling people there's a problem doesn't solve it.\"",

The tank sat in a bunkerlike room near Canal Street and Sixth Avenue. The room's owner, Trinity Real Estate, had lent it to Mr. Twist so he could rehearse his musical puppet-reverie \"Symphonie Fantastique.\" Now 20 years old, the show returns to the HERE theater, just a few blocks away, for a 12-week run on Thursday.\n\nBehind the tank, water splashed everywhere. (Mr. Twist estimates that he loses about 100 gallons per run-through.) A kind of scaffolding had been constructed around the tank, a miniature staging area. Puppeteers in wetsuits straddled the sides or scrambled into harnesses so that they could dangle above it, holding wires attached to fabric, feathers, tinsel, pinwheels. They lowered these into the water below at designated points in the music, Hector Berlioz's \"Symphonie Fantastique.\"\n\n\"Every puppet show with Basil, there's a choreography going on backstage,\" said Lake Simons, a longtime Twist puppeteer. \"It takes a lot to create those amazing stage pictures.\"",

                "body": "The flow of goods and services across national borders as a share of all economic activity hovered near 16 percent through the 1980s and early 1990s, then from 1993 to 2008 shot up to 31 percent. Then it stopped rising, instead bouncing around that level, according to data from the McKinsey Global Institute.\n\nIf you look at the international flow of money instead of goods and services, the results are even more stark. Cross-border financial flows peaked in 2007 at 22 percent of world G.D.P., but were down to 6 percent in 2016, about the same as the 1996 level.\n\n\"The interesting thing about tariffs on steel or other goods is that it's fighting the last battle, not the future one,\" said Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey who has researched these global flows. \"Global manufacturing has already reconfigured itself. That change happened, and the horse is out of the barn. We don't think globalization is over, but it has taken a new form.\"\n\nThat form consists of greater connectivity and communication, which may not show up in traditional data on trade or capital flows. That includes more people using social media platforms to connect with people in other countries, companies relying on freelance labor located around the globe, and small enterprises doing business with partners around the world through the internet.\n\nIn other words, it's not a form of globalization that endangers factory jobs, but one that could have big consequences in other areas -- leading to more competition for technologically advanced white-collar jobs, while also creating enormous new opportunities for American and Western European firms. That, in turn, helps explain why much of the trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the Trump administration withdrew from, focused on intellectual property rights, data security and privacy.\n\nThe M.I.T. economist David Autor and colleagues have done extensive work showing that the \"China shock\" that ensued with that country's entry into the World Trade Organization caused lasting pain to communities in the United States that competed with Chinese companies in making a range of manufactured goods.\n\nEven as those effects linger, he sees the risks involved in commerce with China as shifting elsewhere.\n\n\"The China shock on large-scale manufacturing and its mass employment effects, that part is largely behind us,\" Mr. Autor said. Now, the challenge is Chinese competition on more technologically complex products, like automobiles, airplanes or microprocessors. The manufacturing of more labor-intensive, less technologically complex products like apparel is migrating to lower-wage countries like Bangladesh and Ethiopia.",

Cook beans and then either make Tejal's new recipe for beans and garlic toast in broth (above) or the old one that exists in her memory and prose: red beans \"cooked simply with crushed tomatoes and a mash of ginger, garlic and green chiles, with a glug of cream added somewhere near the far end of cooking and a pile of chopped cilantro on top.\"\n\nPut that on rice and leave me alone. That's my Saturday night right there. Me and Dua Lipa: \"New Rules.\"\n\nThough maybe we'll get some grill time going this weekend as well, first of the season for us in New York: chicken wings bathed in oak or apple smoke, maybe a spice-rubbed fillet of salmon as well, alongside grilled broccoli, a couple of grilled leeks. Maybe not, but it'd be nice to think that spring is really coming and not just here on the calendar, a seasonal shift that will move us toward shorts and flip-flops and dinner before dusk.

                "body": "The party is unnecessarily nervous, he argues. \"If you look at Chinese history, none can replace the Communist Party. Most of the elite is in the party. The party shouldn't worry about being challenged. If I was running the propaganda department, I would say: 'Those mistakes were made in the past, not now, and we need to learn from our mistakes.' \"\n\nThe party frets so much that Mr. Shen -- who possesses a blue-ribbon political pedigree -- cannot get access even to documents deemed accessible under a law passed in 1996 that said archives would be open to the public after 30 years. The law has never been followed.\n\nHence, China's version of Nixon's visit in 1972 and its accounts of the precursor trips by Henry Kissinger remain largely unknown. What went on between Mao and the North Korean leader Kim Il-sung during the Korean War is only sketchily understood from China's point of view.\n\nWith Xia Yafeng of Long Island University, Mr. Shen is the author of the seminal work on China's relations with North Korea, \"A Misunderstood Friendship: Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung and Sino-North Korean relations 1949-1976,\" which will be published in English later this year. The book relies heavily on the archives in Moscow and Central Europe that tumbled open after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut he made some lucky finds in libraries in northeastern China, too, while also extracting papers from reluctant librarians at China's major archives. And through his connections with top party officials, he secured access to a memorandum of conversations between Mao and the North Korean leader, a trove that had never before been made public.\n\nIn the book, Mr. Shen demolishes the myth that China and North Korea were tightly allied, \"as close as lips to teeth,\" as China's propagandists insisted. He shows that even before the start of the Korean War in 1950, relations between the two newly installed Communist parties were tense. Mr. Kim, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, invaded South Korea without notifying Mao. The Chinese were informed three days after the fact.\n\nDespite his current pursuits, Mr. Shen is hardly the scholarly sort who has spent his life buried in the stacks. He started out as a crack Navy pilot, but that ended when he was falsely accused of murder by a jailhouse snitch. Mr. Shen was freed after the informer recanted, but was jailed again in the early 1980s on an accusation of spying for the United States.\n\nMr. Shen says the spying charge stemmed from his giving some articles and documents on Chinese agrarian reform to an American student who, unbeknown to him, was suspected by the authorities of having links to the C.I.A.\n\nDuring his two years in prison, he invented a way to write by fashioning an empty toothpaste tube into a pen. He asked for books on Mao, Marx and Lenin (\"The prison authorities didn't dare deny that\"), and wrote notes for his first work -- on Soviet agriculture -- in the margins of the Soviet Union's \"New Economic Policy,\" using an upturned washbowl balanced on his knees as a desk.\n\nWhen he got out of jail the second time, he had weathered enough to know that his personal diary -- a foot-high stack of notebooks going back to high school -- was a time bomb, one that the authorities could use for blackmail.\n\nSo in 1985, before heading to southern China to begin a career in business, he burned the diaries, tossing them page by page into a coal furnace, an odd act for someone who would later campaign for the preservation of records. \"Very bittersweet,\" he said. \"I didn't want to leave anything in writing which might cause me further trouble.\"\n\nIt was the period of China's economic reforms, and Mr. Shen became a successful gold trader, eventually earning enough to quit the business and devote himself full-time to his historical research.\n\nMr. Shen grew up in Beijing, the son of a successful Communist Party bureaucrat who rose to become the second in command of China's prison system. Despite Mr. Shen's run-ins with the communist system, he holds an almost perfect Communist Party pedigree: his father had joined Mao at his army base in Yan'an during the civil war and his father-in-law was a good friend of the father of the current president, Mr. Xi.\n\nHe appreciates that delving into the Communist Party's past requires functioning like a guerrilla historian, not a starchy academic, so he has taken his drive for transparency beyond China's borders.\n\nHis government-funded Research Institute for Asian Neighborhood Studies in Shanghai allows Mr. Shen and his students to travel to one-party states in Asia and Eastern Europe to collect documents that are then copied and cataloged at the institute.\n\nNorth Korea would seem a natural hunting ground. On a visit to Beijing, a senior North Korean official invited Mr. Shen to Pyongyang to look at the archives, airfare and lodging paid, but he declined. \"I was worried if I went, I wouldn't be allowed out.\"\n\nDuring his travels around China, he is not shy about offering his opinions on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula. He caused a stir last year when he told a closed-door seminar that China would be better off allying with South Korea than the North. (The lecture later circulated on the internet.)\n\n\"You can see how much attention and admiration he commands when he speaks at forums in China,\" said Charles Kraus, a historian who specializes in China at the Wilson Center in Washington, where Mr. Shen is a senior fellow. \"In Changchun in 2015 I remember there were even Shen Zhihua fanboys waiting in the hotel lobby hoping to catch a glimpse of him and get him to autograph books.\"\n\nMr. Shen will never give up the chase for China's historical secrets. But he wonders if the really important documents even exist at this point.\n\nWhen they left office, many senior officials ransacked the files. Zhou Enlai's wife is rumored to have taken archives and shredded them. Mao's wife is believed to have destroyed documents, too.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party kept far fewer records than the party in the Soviet Union, where the unleashing of the archives led to a whole new industry of Cold War history.\n\n\"Russia has a tradition of keeping records,\" he said. \"The Chinese Communist Party grew out of an underground operation, was very secretive and didn't record many things. Of the 1950s Politburo meetings there are few records. They never wrote things down.\"\n\nHe is thankful his political connections have helped him to at least get in the door of important Chinese archives. But being inside is often not enough.\n\nA friend in the bureaucracy once explained the problem, he said: \" 'You know about the 1996 law,' \" the friend told him, \" 'But you don't know about the 10 no's. There's no looking up religion, diplomacy, personal affairs of state leaders.' I said, 'What can I look up?' The person said, 'Basically nothing.' \"",

                "title": "Getting Real: When War Films Went to the Trenches",
                "body": "An ensemble film that unfolds as a series of vignettes during the war's last stages, \"Westfront\" focuses on four German infantrymen in Occupied France. The French are not the enemy; the enemy is war. At one point the Germans are trapped in the trenches that are being shelled by their own army. Those at home are preoccupied with their own shortages and privation. One of the soldiers gets a brief leave, returning to find his wife in bed with the butcher's assistant (who supplements her rations and has himself just been drafted). Hopelessly demoralized, the soldier returns to his comrades on the front and volunteers for a hazardous mission.\n\nFor an early talkie (and Pabst's first), \"Westfront\" is notably fluid. The camera is highly mobile and the director makes skillful use of long takes -- although portions of the brilliantly extended, existential battle sequences are filmed with a fixed camera. \"Westfront\" is also notable for its creative sound editing, expanding space through offscreen sound, creating sound bridges using artillery fire that extends from one shot to another and even devising audio match cuts, between cries and whizzing shells.\n\nMuch of \"Westfront\" is played out in the scarred and denuded buffer zone between the trenches -- filmed by Pabst in highly defined sharp focus. A meeting between two German soldiers in this cratered deathscape has been singled out as the essence of Germany's fatalistic mood, trapped between one war and another that is yet to come. Nobody in the film really gets out alive. The most gung-ho character goes mad, screaming all the way to the field hospital that has been set up in a bombed-out church.\n\nThe powerful final image has a blinded French soldier reaching out to grab the hand of the German lying next to him without realizing that he has sought comfort from a corpse. In his next film, \"Kameradschaft\" (1931), also newly out from Criterion, Pabst made an even more impassioned plea for solidarity -- having German rescue teams aid the trapped French miners when a coal mine collapses on the border between the two countries.\n\nThe Korean War film \"Cease Fire\" (1953), recently released on disc from Kino, strove for another kind of battlefield authenticity being a sort of neorealist experiment in 3-D.\n\nMade by the documentary filmmaker Owen Crump with the cooperation of the United States Department of Defense, \"Cease Fire\" was shot in Korea, during the final months of the war, while the armistice was being negotiated. It was released four months after the cease-fire began. American servicemen play themselves, recreating an engagement in which they participated. Their resigned body language is more eloquent than their stiffly delivered lines.\n\nAfter establishing its 3-D bona fides by firing a howitzer into the spectator's face, the movie settles down to standard patrol stuff. Unlike \"Westfront,\" however, \"Cease Fire\" is wholly uncritical. The enemy is cruel and implacable; the Americans are stalwart and patriotic, slogging through a minefield as Dimitri Tiomkin's tiresome \"Brothers in Arms\" exhorts them \"onward and onward.\"\n\nThe 3-D is most effective where the terrain is most rugged, as in a battle waged around some deep ravines. But there are moments when even the climactic spectacle, with American bombers pounding the mountainsides, are upstaged by the sight of the wind moving in the leaves. The least compelling scenes, reportedly added by the producer Hal Wallis, are the interpolated ones of cynical correspondents waiting out the cease-fire negotiations in the town of Panmunjom, just north of the de facto border.\n\nWriting in The Times, Bosley Crowther found the 3-D \"superfluous and annoying\" but praised \"Cease Fire\" as \"a robust, hair-raising realization of the ruggedness of the foot soldiers war in the ugly hills of Korea.\" He ended his enthusiastic review by noting that the moral enforcers of the Motion Picture Production Code removed three \"hells\" and a \"damn\" -- too much realism, it would seem.\n\nCHANCES Two brothers, both in the British Army, and the woman they love, struggle through World War I. Reviewing the movie, now available on DVD, in The Times, Mordaunt Hall had strong praise for the director Allan Dwan and his female star Rose Hobart whose \"artistry,\" he wrote, prompted pleasurable anticipation of her subsequent work. (Warner Archive)\n\nNOCTURAMA Bertrand Bonello's suavely choreographed provocation has a band of French terrorists blowing up Paris monuments and then seeking refuge in a capacious department store. \"Part 1 is fast-moving and suspenseful, Part 2 languorous and luxuriant,\" A. O. Scott wrote in his Times review in August 2017. \"The young terrorists are brisk and businesslike until the plastic explosives detonate. Then they act out a parody of jaded consumerist hedonism, browsing among the brand names.\" On Blu-ray and DVD. (Grasshopper Films)\n\nSILENCE AND CRY A defeated revolutionary soldier takes refuge with a peasant family in this tense cat-and-mouse game set in 1919, on the great Hungarian plain during the aftermath of the nation's short-lived existence as a Soviet republic and directed by the great Hungarian filmmaker Miklos Jancso. Balletic in its stylization, the movie never had an American run; the restored Blu-ray and DVD have been put out by a British company. (Second Run)\n\nVIVA L'ITALIA Commissioned to make a movie for Italy's centenary celebrating the patriot and revolutionary hero Giuseppe Garibaldi, Roberto Rossellini directed these panoramic costumed battles as though filming a documentary. However lavish, this 1961 film is a prelude the austere historical dramas Rossellini would begin making later in the decade. Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video. (Arrow Academy)\n\nUNDERGROUND Emir Kusturica won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1995 and reaped a whirlwind of criticism for this phantasmagorical account of black marketing among the Yugoslav partisans during World War II. Reviewing the movie in The Times when it was shown at the New York Film Festival, Janet Maslin called it \"a feverish, whimsical allegory elevated by moments of brilliant clarity.\" Blu-ray and DVD.

                "title": "Review: In 'Barry,' This Actor Slays Them, Offstage",
                "body": "He's no good at it. What he excels at is shooting people, a skill he sharpened as a Marine in Afghanistan, and Fuches urges him to stay in his lane. \"Acting is a very face-forward kind of job,\" he says. \"You could take up painting! Hitler painted! John Wayne Gacy painted! It's a good, solid hobby.\"\n\nThe series, created by Mr. Hader and Alec Berg (\"Silicon Valley\"), ingeniously mixes wetwork and dry irony. (The relationship between Barry and Fuches, as it develops, is very much that of a frustrated actor and a money-minded agent.)\n\nBut it would be a cold satire without the transformation of Mr. Hader, best known for playing outlandish characters like Stefon on \"Saturday Night Live.\" His Barry is wound so tight he hums -- he's like a slightly zanier Michael Shannon character -- but Mr. Hader also shows you the light flicking on inside him for the first time.\n\nThe criminal going straight, or pretending to, is a mini genre unto itself (\"Banshee,\" \"Lilyhammer\"). There are a couple ways you might expect a hit-man-in-Hollywood story to go: The killer teaches a few lessons to the showbiz phonies, or he discovers that crime has given him unique insights into human nature.\n\nNot so in \"Barry.\" Murder is a soul-numbing day job for Barry that's done no good for him except pay the bills. It's a messier, better remunerated version of slinging coffee.\n\nThere's a recurring theme in cable dramas that criminality is, if not admirable, at least more authentic and exhilarating than the overcivilized straight life. Walter White in \"Breaking Bad\" says that crime made him feel \"alive.\" Tony Soprano, monster though he may be, is continually contrasted with pathetic and envious civilian schnooks like Artie Bucco.\n\nHere, Barry's the schnook. He's not animated by his work but drained by it. For someone who kills for a living, he's awfully passive, having let his hit-man career happen to him more than having pursued it.\n\nWhen Barry tries to win Sally over by buying her an outlandishly expensive gift, she's put off by the \"weird-ass Tony Soprano move.\" When she calls him out on his \"toxic masculinity\" -- having no idea how toxic it really is -- Barry actually takes it to heart, even if he has a hard time applying the lesson.\n\nBecause of Sally's role as a foil in what is indeed a very male show, I wish her character were better fleshed out. \"Barry\" is well-cast top to bottom, though, from Henry Winkler as Gene, the acting class's passionate but fatuous instructor, to a scene-stealing Anthony Carrigan as NoHo Hank, an incongruously polite Chechen lieutenant.\n\nThe spatter comedy is not for the squeamish, but \"Barry\" plays cleverly with the contrast between Barry's two worlds. His mob clients have their own Hollywood-inspired sense of theatrics, as when Hank needlessly complicates a hit by insisting on express-mailing the target a bullet, because it will be cooler.\n\nThis all might come across glib if \"Barry\" weren't also willing to go dark when necessary, and if Mr. Hader were less effective at finding the drama in his comic character. The season's last half finds another gear, as the guilt-racked Barry has a harder and harder time compartmentalizing his vocation from his avocation.\n\nBy pushing its story to an extreme, \"Barry\" hits on a universal conflict. Like many of us who are not trained assassins, Barry wants to believe he can make moral compromises while telling himself, \"This is not who I am.\" (He sees himself in the character of Macbeth, but in his reading, Shakespeare's murderous Scot was \"just following orders.\")\n\nBut there comes a point -- Barry crosses that point, and then some -- where that's a crock. What you do is who you are. Barry's targets, were they still alive, would testify that the guy who killed them was plenty real.\n\nIt's a tricky game \"Barry\" is playing, cultivating our empathy for its protagonist, then confronting us with this recognition. And the season finale does raise the question of how long the series can string out its double-life premise.\n\nBut mostly, \"Barry\" pulls off the feat, developing into something more profound than its high-concept premise suggests. You don't expect this comedy to find its target in the way it does. And as Barry could tell you, that element of surprise is the mark of a professional.",

                "body": "But on his way back to the airport, he has a yearning to visit his hometown, Knoxville. And soon he's walking -- very slowly, with Lil reluctantly by his side -- down memory lane.\n\n\"I heard he wouldn't do it unless I did it, and that sort of swung me to the project,\" Mr. Reynolds said of receiving Mr. Rifkin's offer, which he agreed to almost immediately. \"But I liked it. It was very different than anything I'd done. There weren't any cars or things jumping other cars or girls and stuff. It was a fun picture, and he was a nice man.\"\n\nVisiting New York from Valhalla, his estate in Jupiter, Fla., Mr. Reynolds, 82, arrived at The New York Times with an entourage before heading to a career retrospective at the Metrograph in downtown Manhattan. His body ravaged from stunt work, he made his way with help from a fancy cane. But he fired off a barrage of jokes, and that storied charisma was still there. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nHow much did Adam Rifkin get right about you in his script?\n\nWell, I don't know. I mean, I've been acting for 60 years now. I don't know who the hell I am. But I think he did a real good job. We wanted the guy to be an Everyman who thinks he's a movie star, but it's over. There are these ups and downs where he realizes he's not a movie star anymore. So he just sort of wanders into the ghettos and streets and makes friends with a lot of down-and-outers, which is what he is. He's a real sweet man, when you get to know him, I hope.\n\nSweet but something of a rascal.\n\nI think you have to be a little bit of a rascal, because people would be disappointed if I didn't do that. [Chuckles] We're only here for a little while, and you've got to have some fun, right? I don't take myself seriously, and I think the ones that do, there's some sickness with people like that. That's why I live in Florida.\n\nVic butt heads with Ariel Winter's Lil. What was she like to work with?\n\nShe started out trying to be tough. Her language was atrocious. I didn't like it. So I took her around behind the wagon and said: \"Ariel, I don't know if you heard Anne Bancroft talk like that or who, but I can tell you Sally [Field] doesn't. And you don't have to. It doesn't mean anything. But not only that, it throws me. I think I'm doing a scene with this girl, and you say the F-word and we don't need it. And please try it a couple of days without it.\" Well, she didn't do it anymore, and I was so proud of her.\n\nWhat's the difference being a movie star now and at the height of your career?\n\nIn the '70s, [people in the industry] protected you a little more. \"Where are you going tonight?\" \"Well, I'm going to dinner with my lady.\" \"Where?\" \"I don't want to tell you where.\" But I'd end up telling them where, and they'd end up being there, two tables away. Now you're not protected, but if you learn how to laugh and have fun with it ...\n\nIf I was as tough as I'm made out to be in movies, I wouldn't have to worry. But I can't beat my way out of a paper bag now. I'm too beat up. I haven't had two hours of no pain for, gosh, I don't know, honey, 20 years. Because it was always this macho crap that you're full of, and I always thought, \"Well hell, I could do that [stunt].\" And I could, except sometimes I didn't quite make it.\n\nIs there anyone now who reminds you of yourself back then?\n\nGeorge Clooney. He's got a sparkle. And he just seems like a good guy, welcoming you to the set, which I always do. \"We're going to make a movie, and I don't know if it's going to be any good, but let's have fun.\"\n\nI had the strangest thing happen. I said [to an actress], \"We'll have a good time.\" And she said: \"Hold it. We're not going to have a good time. I'm not one of your girls.\" And I said: \"What are you talking about? I've had an affair [on the set] with two women in 50 years. Sally Field and my ex-wife [Loni Anderson].\" Should have married the first one and not the second one.\n\nYou've said many times that Sally is the one who got away. Did you ever try getting her back?\n\nI'd be afraid to ask her out because I think she'd laugh and hang up. Joanne Woodward got me my first agent, and we're really close friends, and she said: \"What in the hell's the matter with you? Why don't you go up to her house, get on your knees and ask her if you can't be friends?\" And I said: \"I can't do that. What if she closes the door on me?\" And she said, \"Well, I closed the door on Paul [Newman, her husband] twice, and he came back.\" But I couldn't. All you've got left at that point is your pride. And I didn't want to bash that in too much.\n\nThe film inserts your character into scenes from your own movies, like \"Deliverance\" and \"Smokey and the Bandit.\" It even nods to your days as a sex symbol with your Cosmo centerfold. What's it like looking at that bearskin rug now?\n\nYou do stupid things. I wish I hadn't done it, but I did it. And I rose above it, I guess. Or I didn't, I don't know. But I'm still here. [Sings a line from \"I'm Still Here.\"]\n\nElaine Stritch, boy, could she sing that song. I went out with her one night. It was just for fun, but we had the best time, laughing and giggling. And I'm saying good night to her, and I said, \"Elaine?\" And she said, \"Yes?\" as she was walking away. And I said, \"I'm still here.\" And she said, \"So am I, hon.\"\n\nNow you teach a Friday night acting class in Florida.\n\nIt's hysterical. [The age range] goes from 18 to 80, and the lady that's 80 was a Follies girl, and she must have been a knockout because she's still very sexy. I have more fun with her.\n\nI'm going to graduate next year from Florida State in education. I go to classes. At first it was a little shaky. But now it's fun. [The students] all wave. It's good for me, and it's good for the school, I think.\n\nYou still act in a handful of films each year. Why not slow down?\n\nI don't know why I think this, but maybe I've got my best work ahead. Maybe I'll be putting my teeth in the glass, and maybe it will be a very different kind of role, but I want to do something where I'm not driving a car or a truck, where it's real. Something that people wouldn't expect me to do. Probably a man in search of himself. But we're always searching for ourselves anyway.\n\nAnd now you're the subject of retrospectives. Do you enjoy basking in the adoration?\n\nSometimes it's fun. But sometimes people surprise me with their anger. It's almost like you want to say, \"Well, if you think it's that easy, why don't you come do it, and I can sit where you're sitting and ask you questions -- dumb ones, but questions.\"\n\nYou famously turned down blockbuster roles like James Bond and Han Solo to continue making action movies, some of which fizzled. Why?\n\nI was good at it, for one thing. I felt good when I did a stunt, and if it was really dangerous -- like if I got out on a horse or a bull that was rank, or jumped out of this building on a bag -- I felt great.\n\nIs there a role you regret not taking?\n\nYeah, I turned down so many films that Jack [Nicholson] did, and he was brilliant and I couldn't have been as good. But the one I wish I'd done was \"Terms of Endearment.\"\n\nI've read that James L. Brooks wrote the role of Garrett Breedlove with you in mind.\n\nSupposedly. I don't know if that's true or not. I would have done it had I known, but they didn't tell me that.\n\nWhich movie are you proudest of?\n\nI'm proud of \"Deliverance,\" because it was a very dangerous film to make, and they all said it couldn't be done, and we did it. And Jon Voight and I are now like brothers.\n\nAnd yet you've apparently never fully watched Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Boogie Nights,\" which was supposed to be your big comeback and earned you an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win.\n\nI don't like it. It was hard because it was a subject matter [the porn industry] that I find so disgusting. I was only in maybe the first 15 minutes. And I thought, \"If I can pull this off, I'll have done something that most people can't do, and the actors that I respect and love will be proud of me.\" And I think I did. The picture was a big hit, but my folks couldn't see it, and it was tough.\n\nYou didn't like Mr. Anderson.\n\nI liked him, I guess, but I don't know, I, uh -- [chuckles] nah, I didn't really like him.\n\nAre you still waiting for that Oscar?\n\nGod no, but something that the industry recognizes as good work. You know, I've had the strangest career. I'm an old man, and for crying out loud, I'm still thinking, it's just around the corner. There are certain actors, like Voight, who I love, and [now deceased] Brian Keith and Charlie Durning, God I loved him so much. It seems like I lose one a week now. So I want to do something, some work, that we can celebrate together.\n\nYou've still not met your own standard?\n\nI just know that that's not the one. I'll know. And I'll call you.\n\nSo you're determined to have your Hollywood ending. What does it look like?\n\nThere's a wonderful shot that Norman Jewison did [in \"Best Friends\"], a picture I did with Goldie Hawn, where we're coming out of a studio, and we look off and there is this magnificent sunset. And I put my arm around her, and she bites me on the ear. And then I said, \"Look.\" And the whole set moves away, and it was a drawing. [Pauses] That's Hollywood.",

                "body": "My life changed -- and I do not say that with even a touch of hyperbole -- when I got the Dyson DC44 Animal. I love this vacuum. In fact, I love this vacuum so much that I would marry it, in the event that any grammar school-aged children are reading this and are considering an attempt at nailing me with that old chestnut of a comeback. Amazon tells me that I purchased my Animal on Nov. 11, 2013 and, while I don't use Smalls (that's his name) every day, every day that do I use him, I feel happy. He makes my life better by being a part of it, truly.\n\nWhen Smalls first came into my life, I had dark, Rapunzel-length hair that wanted nothing more than to free itself from my scalp and transmogrify into tumbleweed-like clumps that drifted all around my home. Post-Smalls, that hair no longer has the option of assembling militia-style, because I run my little vacuum as soon as I see a strand beginning its forward march.\n\nAnd here's where the beauty of this thing comes in: I can vacuum as much as I want, because Smalls makes it so easy for me to do so. He resides in a wall-mounted holster, which means I don't have to dig him out of a closet. He's cordless, which means I don't have to fool with plugging him in. He's super lightweight, so I can grab him, zip around my apartment picking up hair or stray Golden Grahams (late night cereal habits are no joke) and hang him back up without exerting any effort at all. I have gone Full Oprah -- arms outstretched as I bellow to anyone who will listen, \"I loooooove thiiiiiiis vacuuuuuuuuum!!!\" -- when talking about this machine, that is how strongly I feel about it.\n\nCleana Gershon the Mopping Robot\n\nVacuuming alone isn't enough to keep my floors clean of New York City grime, and while my preferred method is to wash the floor on my hands and knees, which in my tiny kitchen only takes 7 minutes (I timed it!), the iRobot Braava jet Mopping Robot gets a lot of use -- especially in the bathroom. Unlike the Roomba, iRobot's popular robotic vacuum that is, frankly, far more vacuum than most small homes require, the Braava is tiny, measuring 7\" by 3.3\" and weighing 2.7 pounds. Her name is Cleana Gershon, and she is a love. (I'm a big Gina Gershon fan.) Here's a neat feature: The machine can switch between wet, damp and dry cleaning, and can be fitted with disposable or launderable, reusable cleaning pads.\n\nOther Pint-size Tools\n\nCleana Gershon the Braava resides in my bathroom, in the space that was freed up when I swapped a full-sized garment steamer and iron for the Reliable Dash Portable Garment Steamer, which features an ironing soleplate that can be used for pressing when steaming alone isn't enough. Though I held onto my full-sized ironing board, which hangs out of the way from a wall-mounted iron caddy, portable ironing blankets are a good option for homes that are short on space.\n\nIt's harder than it should be to find small trash cans, but after years of looking up, down and sideways for the perfect bin in which to stash a day or two's worth of recycling, I finally found the perfect thing to fit in the tiny unused nook between my kitchen cabinets and front door. The Small Clear Rectangular Trash Can from The Container Store measures 6\" x 9-1/4\" x 11-3/4\" and is deep enough to hold the stash of plastic grocery bags I use as liners to catch drips from bottles and cans, along with the bottles and cans themselves.\n\nWhile all of my toys have made my life and my home better, there are two upgrades I still dream of making: I would love to create a hand crank washing machine and wall-mounted telescoping drying rack setup, so I can cut back on the number of trips I make to the laundromat each week. I've yet to identify the right spot for this fantasy laundry center.\n\nBut you can bet your bottom dollar that come fall, that Tetra will be mine. Now I just need to think of a name.",

                "title": "'The Americans' Goes Dark(er), With Help from a Painter",
                "body": "As fans of \"The Americans\" know, Elizabeth keeps her emotions closer to her chest than any spyware. In this final season, the showrunners wanted to explore what would happen if Erica's art \"breaks through Elizabeth's exterior and provokes her,\" Mr. Weisberg said. As Elizabeth sees art as a bourgeois frivolity, the paintings had to work on her unconsciously, like sleeper agents, suggesting the kinds of intense emotions that she will never let herself feel. They had to be realistic, but not too realistic, passionate, but not over the top. They had to look as though they could have been painted in the 1980s. And they had to be, as Mr. Fields said, \"really good art.\"\n\nMr. Fields and Mr. Weisberg called their friend, the gallerist Jim Kempner, with a request: Find a painter who ticks every box. Mr. Kempner returned with a shortlist. Ms. Monks's name was near the top. As soon as the showrunners saw her canvases, they wanted them.\n\nA painting of a woman slumped on a hotel bed looked like Elizabeth after a honey trap. A screaming face seemed to embody the pain she repressed.\n\n\"Some of the work seemed like it could literally be a representation of Elizabeth's psyche,\" Mr. Weisberg said. So they proposed what Mr. Fields called, \"this weird creative partnership where we wanted to appropriate her real, beautiful art for our fictional character.\" Ms. Monks agreed.\n\nI first met Ms. Monks in the late fall, in the Williamsburg studio that is also her apartment. She was wearing her uniform: boots, jeans, dark top, so much liner it looked like her eyes had fallen down twin holes.\n\nBorn in New Jersey, she earned an M.F.A. from the New York Academy of Art. She is an admired painter who worked in a more or less realistic style until the 2012 death of her mother pushed her into a more abstract form that emphasized imperfection and chaos.\n\nIn her home, the open-plan living room had been completely given over to painting. Drawings and paintings in various stages of completion covered the walls. Tubes, palettes, charcoal sticks and flammable solvents were arranged across carts and tables.\n\nMs. Monks has lent her painting out before -- an album cover here, a movie there -- but the idea of an ongoing collaboration that would bring a character to life, \"that was exciting, attractive,\" she said. The compensation worked out to about what she'd make on the sale of a large painting, the kind of canvas that takes months to create.\n\nShe pointed out some of the paintings \"The Americans\" had requested. \"They were drawn to the more dramatic pieces,\" she said, \"because not all my work is this intense, right?\"\n\nShe led me to a small one of a smudged face, a larger one of a woman shrieking behind a shower door, an even larger portrait of her mother, painted after her death, where the face seems to recede into a dark background. (That one made an FX publicist cry.) Though the images are more or less legible, they are often distressed -- with solvents, with impasto, with various techniques that worry the painting. \"Anything that makes the surface complex,\" Ms. Monks said.\n\nSome collectors wouldn't part with pieces the show wanted, so she had been working 14-hour days recreating them. As she painted, she often played episodes of \"The Americans.\" \"I'm learning a little Russian,\" she said.\n\nShe could have tried it out an evening a few days later when she went to \"The Americans\" soundstage to help a team of set decorators with Erica's bedroom. The room itself unsettled her. The hospital bed reminded her of her mother's final illness. \"This is very evocative,\" she said, \"very surreal.\" While hammers struck a syncopated beat, she spread some drawings on the bed and arranged paintings across three of the walls. \"That one on the bottom is upside-down,\" she said gently to a crew member.\n\nFinally, the crew stood back to admire the work. \"I think we were able to get a good range,\" Ms. Monks said approvingly. \"They're not all screaming faces.\"\n\nA few days after that, she was on the set again. The first two episodes were shooting, and Ms. Monks had been tapped to provide Erica's sketch of a sleeping Elizabeth. One producer had tried to stash her in an unused quadrant of the stage -- the set of a safe house -- but Ms. Monks felt lonely in there, so she arranged her materials near a bank of monitors. She was worried she wouldn't have enough time for a decent sketch. \"My grad-school teachers will be so mad if she doesn't have feet!\" she said.\n\nStill, she knew she shouldn't make the drawing too perfect. She was drawing as Erica, after all. \"There will have to be some jagged moments where she's seizing with pain,\" Ms. Monks reasoned. \"I imagine the charcoal would break.\"\n\nOnce she'd taken a photo of a sleeping Ms. Russell, Ms. Monks went back to her table, covering the paper with charcoal, then using an eraser to pull out lines and shadows and shapes. \"Bloody hell, that's fast,\" the director Chris Long said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Shor, dressed as the dying Erica, sat up in bed, brandishing the charcoal fiercely for the camera and trying to make use of what Ms. Monks had taught her during a recent lesson. \"It changed how I look at art; it changed how I thought about myself drawing,\" she said. Ms. Monks is a good teacher. In the first episodes, it's Ms. Shor's hands you'll see moving over the paper, not Ms. Monks's, though both were shot.\n\nThe sketches and the paintings are the most obvious evidence of Ms. Monks's collaboration with \"The Americans,\" but her influence is felt throughout the season. She's had an impact on the design, arguing against some bold blue-and-gold wallpaper as an overly busy background for the paintings and substituting rubber bands for store-bought clasps on Erica's drawing board. She has given notes on the scripts, too, nixing a moment when Erica's husband covers up a sleeping Elizabeth while Erica is in mid-portrait. \"Alyssa said, 'He's been married to her all these years,'\" Mr. Fields recalled. \"'If there's one thing you know, it's don't screw with the model.'\"\n\nAnd while Ms. Monks hasn't altered elements like who lives, who dies or who wears which wig, she has indirectly suggested new scenes and stories. \"These paintings started almost infiltrating the imaginations of the writers and also the characters, something started to grow,\" Mr. Weisberg said by telephone as the season finished shooting.\n\nDuring a chat in January at the Forum Gallery, the Upper East Side space that represents her work, Ms. Monks said she didn't know if the show would change her life or her sales. But it has given her renewed faith in her work. Before she'd joined up with \"The Americans,\" she'd felt afraid of the direction she was taking -- \"darker, more abstract, more emotionally evocative, a little riskier.\" Her time on the show, she said, has \"given me permission to go deep into it and find that there's a lot of beauty there.\"\n\nI passed this tribute on to the showrunners. \"That's just the sort of backhanded compliment that we here at 'The Americans' like to get,\" Mr. Fields said. \"Here was an artist who was wondering whether or not things were too dark. Then she spent some time with us and realized she could go darker.\"",

                "title": "Bolton Was Early Beneficiary of Cambridge Analytica's Facebook Data",
                "body": "To do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work.\n\n\"The data and modeling Bolton's PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,\" said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica. \"We definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, which rose to prominence through its work with Mr. Trump's 2016 election campaign, has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.\n\nCambridge's so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016, setting off a furious -- and still unsettled -- debate about whether the firm's technology worked. The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr. Bolton's super PAC.\n\n\"The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues,\" Mr. Wylie said.\n\n\"That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview,\" he added. \"That's what they said they wanted, anyway.\"\n\nUsing the psychographic models, Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr. Bolton's PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, according to Mr. Wylie and another former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge.\n\nOne advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness, and were thought to respect hard work and experience. It emphasized Mr. Bolton's time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr. Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president.\n\nBeyond their conservative politics, Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron -- the Mercer family of Long Island, whose patriarch, Robert L. Mercer, made a fortune at the helm of a top-yielding hedge fund.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which grew out of the London-based SCL Group, was founded in 2014 with a $15 million investment from Mr. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm's board of directors. Stephen K. Bannon was also a co-founder.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Mercer was financially supporting Mr. Bolton's PAC, donating $5 million between April 2014 and September 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers also backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election.\n\nThe Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer.\n\nThe reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe company also suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.\n\nBut it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge, and Mr. Bolton's experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns, including Mr. Trump's.\n\nThe firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data. Staff from SCL's elections division, which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge, discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC, according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times.\n\nThe profiles would be used to \"identify the personality traits of individuals\" in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC, said the agenda, which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff. \"Individuals can be targeted with the right message,\" it said.\n\nThe agenda also included a line, in boldfaced text, that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton's campaign to direct people \"toward the FB app.\" Cambridge, working through an outside researcher, used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network's profiles.\n\nMonths later, the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr. Bolton. In an email dated Oct. 1, 2014, Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr. Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC.\n\n\"It's not just about how much you spend. It's also about how smart you spend,\" the email advised Mr. Bolton to say.\n\n\"One way we're doing that is by enlisting an outside firm\" -- Cambridge Analytica -- \"to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters,\" it continued. \"We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile. So if you're a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about, our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her.\"\n\nThe subject line of the email: \"Did Bannon come back to you on this?\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump threatened on Friday to veto a $1.3 trillion spending package just hours before the government was set to shut down for lack of funds, lashing out over its failure to fund his long-promised border wall.\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" Mr. Trump posted on Twitter in a message that imperiled a sweeping bipartisan agreement brokered by congressional leaders over his objections.\n\nHe was referring partly to the fact that he failed to reach a deal with Democrats to include provisions in the spending measure that would preserve Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program he rescinded last fall that allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's failure to secure an agreement on that issue was hardly the only one on which lawmakers defied him in approving the bill. The measure itself deals a broad rebuke to the president's vision for reordering the size and scope of government, rebuffing his efforts to gut many domestic programs even as it provided the sizable military spending increase Mr. Trump wanted.",

                "title": "Polish Women Protest Proposed Abortion Ban (Again)",
                "body": "The government dropped the earlier bill after it triggered nationwide protests in 2016. In the new version, lawmakers have revised the proposed legislation to make it less harsh, including dropping criminal penalties for women who have abortions, but it has once again stirred women in Poland to take to the streets, with rallies planned across the country on Friday.\n\n\"We are coming for you,\" says the protesters' slogan, a warning for the conservative politicians supporting the bill.\n\nSome 200 nongovernmental organizations joined in writing a public appeal to Polish lawmakers, saying the bill would \"place women's health and lives at risk and violate Poland's international human rights obligations.\" The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also condemned the proposed law.\n\nThe previous effort to ban abortion was thwarted when Polish women mobilized on a scale unseen in the country's history -- more than 150,000 rallied in 143 cities, towns and villages in October, 2016. Their fight helped spark a general strike by women in dozens of countries around the world, coinciding with International Women's Day on March 8, 2017, and known in the United States as \"A Day Without a Woman.\"\n\nThe earlier Polish bill would have prohibited all abortions, and even threatened legal action against women who went outside the country to terminate pregnancies and doctors who helped them. The law would also have limited access to prenatal care and contraception, in a country where birth control is increasingly difficult for women to obtain.\n\nTwo days after the 2016 rallies, the bill was pulled.\n\nPoland's increasingly autocratic government has alienated its international allies by curbing the independence of the courts and restricting speech about the Holocaust. But even a ruling party that was willing defy critics abroad backed off at the sight of so many empowered women on the streets at home, said Krystyna Kacpura, the executive director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning.\n\nSince then, anti-abortion campaigners have been working \"step by step\" to curtail women's reproductive rights, she said.\n\nTheir latest effort is a bill that supporters say is only about protecting unborn babies with disabilities.\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of the Law and Justice Party, has argued that it does not matter if a baby's life is short, saying in 2016 that it was his goal to \"strive to make cases of even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is doomed to die because it is severely deformed, finish with birth, so that the child can be baptized, buried, given a name.\"\n\nJacek Januszewski, a member of Life and Family Foundation, an organization dedicated to ending abortion, said, \"People who are healthy enjoy a full set of human rights from the moment they are conceived, whereas the disabled are discriminated against at this prenatal stage.\"\n\nMr. Januszewski, whose group drafted the proposed legislation, said that of 1,100 abortions performed in Poland in 2016, 1,042 were related to the health of the fetus.\n\n\"It's 95 percent of all abortions and that's what we want to ban,\" he said. \"Almost 40 percent are the abortions of children suffering from Down syndrome. This illness is a genetic condition but many of the people with it enjoy a normal life and are aware of this discrimination. We regularly receive thank-you cards from many of them.\"\n\nThe politics of abortion are almost always divisive, and in Poland, the issue is further complicated by history.\n\nUnder Communist rule, abortion was legalized in 1956 and for years, Poland had among the most liberal abortion laws in Europe. It became so common that it is estimated that at least one in four Polish women have had an abortion.\n\nThe church played a key role in the fight against Communism, and the collapse of the Soviet bloc led to an embrace of Catholic identity that had been suppressed. With the church pushing hard for an total ban, lawmakers in 1993 made abortion illegal, with exceptions for serious threats to the health of the mother or the fetus, and for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.\n\nFor years, the laws were not widely enforced but they did create a two-tier system, allowing women with money to go to private doctors to get abortions, while forcing poorer women to seek out less reliable options.\n\nNo major party in Poland supports liberalizing abortion laws, but the election of Law and Justice in 2015 brought a push to enforce existing laws and further limit women's reproductive choices.\n\nThe \"morning after\" pill had been sold over the counter, but a senior official from the ruling party called it \"a death pill,\" and the government made it available only by prescription.\n\nUnder a legal \"conscience clause,\" Polish doctors can refuse to prescribe any birth control, and pharmacists often refuse to dispense it, making it hard -- sometimes impossible -- to obtain prescription contraceptives.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has been encouraging Poles to \"breed like rabbits,\" in a Health Ministry ad.\n\n\"If you want to become a parent one day, look at the rabbits,\" encourages the narrator, himself a bunny. \"I know what I'm talking about, my father had 63 of us!\"\n\nSuch efforts, however, have only emboldened some women to protest. On Thursday, the front-page headline of the largest daily newspapers, Gazeta Wyborcza, blared: \"Enough is enough! We are taking to the streets.\"\n\n\"I feel like I have been protesting since I was born,\" said Matylda Szempruch, a 22-year-old philosophy major at Warsaw University.\n\nStanding outside the university gates, where students strung coat hangers to symbolize the dangers of illegal abortions, she was trying to persuade people that they had to demonstrate once again.\n\n\"It's a lot harder now,\" she said. \"People are tired. And many people are saying that it doesn't matter what we do. The government will do what they want.\"\n\nOn an array of issues, the governing party has been able to wear down public resistance -- it introduces a controversial bill, weathers protests, retreats temporarily, proposes a new bill, and ultimately enacts a version of the law it wanted, with less outcry.\n\nMr. Januszewski, the anti-abortion activist, noted that two years ago there were thousands of people in the streets but until Friday there had only been hundreds.\n\nJustyna Wydrzynska, an activist with the Polish nonprofit organization Kobiety w Sieci (Women on Web), offers help to women seeking information on sex, contraception and abortion, but fears that the new law would make much of her work illegal.\n\n\"I would probably have to leave the country as we could be prosecuted for our activities,\" she said. \"Or maybe I would stay and let them put me in prison. Maybe the world would pay more attention then.\"",

                "body": "Q. How do you do picture-in-picture video with Safari on a Mac?\n\nA. In macOS Sierra and later, you can use the Picture in Picture mode to pop out a floating video-player window on the screen while you have other pages and programs open on the desktop. The feature works in the Safari browser for videos on sites that use the HTML 5 standard for playback, like Vimeo and YouTube. Videos from Apple's iTunes Store support the Picture in Picture view, as do some other apps.\n\nTo use the Picture in Picture mode, open a compatible video and, in the tool bar of playback controls, click the icon on the right that looks like two rectangles. The video should pop out in a small, separate window that you can resize by dragging its corner with the cursor. To reposition the video window, drag it to your preferred side of the screen. If you do not want to anchor the window in a screen corner, hold down the Mac's Command key while you drag the window to your preferred position on the desktop.\n\nWhen you hover the cursor over the video window, you get controls to pause or play the clip, or to exit the Picture in Picture mode. (You can also click the X in the upper-left corner of the video window to close it.) To fast-forward or rewind through the clip, however, you need to use the playback controls on the video's page in the main Safari window.\n\nSome videos may not display the Picture in Picture icon on the playback tool bar. In this case, hold down the Mac's Control key and double-click the video window. When the shortcut menu appears, look for an \"Enter Picture in Picture\" option. Some videos may not have even that, but for those video apps that do not work with the Mac's Picture in Picture mode, a Safari extension called PiPifier might coax the clips into their separate windows.",

There is not enough being done statewide. The governor should really be stepping up and doing things to prevent this terrible tragedy.\n\nQ. How do you feel about the high-speed train proposed for Los Angeles to San Francisco?\n\nA. I hope we can find a way to do it. But I can't commit to doing it if we don't find a revenue stream. It really is saying we'll build a big expensive thing when we can't afford to give kids health care, we can't afford to educate kids. There are things that are more important than high-speed rail.

                "title": "Review: In 'Midnight Sun,' the Dawn of Romance Can Be Fatal",
                "body": "In \"Midnight Sun,\" a life-threatening illness inspires a gilded fairy tale. This tour of high school heartbreak follows Katie (Bella Thorne), a wide-eyed teenager who has xeroderma pigmentosum, a condition that renders her dangerously sensitive to ultraviolet light. Although xeroderma pigmentosum is actually a disease, \"Midnight Sun\" forgoes realism, exaggerating the risks of Katie's illness to portray even the slightest exposure to sunlight as a cause of fatal neurodegeneration.\n\nBecause of her condition, Katie is isolated from her peers, spending most of her time with her adoring father (Rob Riggle), who tries to keep his daughter's confinement cozy. Though neither Katie nor \"Midnight Sun\" seems disturbed by the paternalism of her circumstances, most fairy tales revolve around a prince, not a parent, and, accordingly, both Katie and the film idealize romance.\n\nSo, from the safety of her ultraviolet-light-resistant bedroom window, Katie daydreams about puppy love as if she were a princess in a tower. Every day, she waits for the same boy, Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold), to roll by on his skateboard. When this saint of the Seattle suburbs stumbles upon Katie busking near the local train station one evening, he falls in love at first sight. They begin to see each other only at night, and Katie conceals her illness, despite her father's warnings. Like the sun, the potential for disaster inevitably rises.\n\nUnder the limp direction of Scott Speer, \"Midnight Sun\" suffocates its sentimental script, portraying passion without wonder, sacrifice without ecstasy. Charlie professes his devotion with a plastered smile and dead eyes. Katie writes love songs that are forgotten the moment she stops singing. Lacking both the romantic chemistry and the directorial panache that might justify its life-or-death stakes, \"Midnight Sun\" is a medical melodrama in need of resuscitation.",

                "body": "Republicans vs. democracy. The biggest problem in American politics is the extremism of the Republican Party.\n\nThe Democrats certainly have their problems, but they pale by comparison. Large numbers of Republican voters hold beliefs that are simply false (climate change is a hoax, Barack Obama is a Kenyan, Robert Mueller is Democratic partisan). Trump, meanwhile, flouts the rule of law, while Republican leaders in Congress try to pass major legislation largely in secret.\n\nI've argued that conservatives aghast at these developments should vote against their party in order to reclaim it. Republican leaders won't abandon their extremism if they keep winning. In a mini-essay on Twitter, Noah Smith of Bloomberg View takes on the same issue but from a different angle: He says that the answer is expanding voting rights so that more Americans have the opportunity to vote against Republican extremism.\n\n\"The #1 policy priority for Democrats at both the state and federal levels should not be universal health care, gun control, climate change, etc.,\" Smith wrote. \"It should be democracy.\"\n\nBy democracy he means laws that remove obstacles to voting: making registration automatic, for example, and expanding the hours -- and the ways -- that people can vote. Several states are already taking steps in this direction, but there is much more to do, as Wendy Weiser and her colleagues at the Brennan Center explain.\n\nSmith argues that voting restrictions have been crucial to the Republican Party's extremist success. \"Since the 90s, as Hispanics (and Asians) grew as a % of the U.S. population, one faction of the GOP wanted to court them. A second faction wanted to keep the party a white ethnic party. The second faction, sadly, won,\" he writes.\n\n\"Instead of toning down white identity politics to court Hispanics and Asians, the GOP decided to: 1) turn up the identity politics; 2) deport as many nonwhite immigrants as possible; 3) use voting restrictions and gerrymandering to win with a minority of votes.\"\n\nBut this strategy won't continue to work if larger numbers of minorities begin voting. To Smith's good points, I'd add that laws aren't the only problem. Voter turnout among Latinos and Asian-Americans is low for a complicated mix of reasons, some of which are unrelated to Republican malfeasance.\n\nWhatever the cause of the current situation, though, a rise in minority turnout could transform politics. In that case, \"the GOP will be forced to reboot itself with a new ethos and a new message that appeals to Hispanic and Asian voters (black voters probably being out of reach for them no matter what),\" Smith writes. \"Ultimately, the reason to focus on democracy is to help the Republicans go sane again.\"\n\nProgramming note.
