                "body": "An 11-year-old girl honored young African-American girls who were victims of gun violence and wow'ed the crowd during her speech on Saturday at the March For Our Lives Rally in Washington D.C.\n\nNaomi Wadler, who is from Alexandria, Virginia, was one of the speakers at the March For Our Lives Rally, where students from across the U.S. came to protest alongside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students from Parkland, Florida in an effort to protest gun violence in schools.\n\n\"I am here today to acknowledge and represent the African-American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper,\" Wadler said.\n\nRecommended Slideshows39North Korea Up Close: From the Bright Lights of Pyongyang to the Impoverished Countryside15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nWadler, a fifth-grader said she was one of the student organizers who led her fellow classmates in a walkout on March 14 for 17 minutes. She said the students added an extra minute to remember and honor Courtlin Arrington, an African American girl who was shot and killed a day after 17 people died in Parkland, Florida on March 14.\n\nOver shouts of the crowd, she said she is representing the African-American women who have become victims of gun violence.\n\n\"I represent the African-American women who are victims of gun violence, who are simply statistics instead of vibrant beautiful girls full of potential.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nWadler told WUSA9 earlier this month why she and the rest of the students at Alexandria's George Mason Elementary School and other participating schools were getting involved in the walkout.\n\n\"I think it's completely unacceptable that we are not exercising our rights to be safe at school,\" she said.\n\nSome staff members from the local schools said they did not feel comfortable with the walkout because they did not believe it was safe for students to be on the front lawn, AlexandriaNews.org reported. Wadler challenged that idea, wondering if she and her fellow classmates were safe inside their schools.\n\n\"How we be will be safe in our own classrooms in the world we live in now,\" she asked, \"when it's OK for someone to walk into a store with an expired ID and buy an assault rifle?\"",

                "title": "'Overwatch' PTR Patch Notes try to fix gameplay sabotage.",
                "body": "Blizzard just unveiled the patch notes with changes headed to the Overwatch PTR. In an attempt to fight in-game toxicity, the hero-shooter is testing a few new additions to its report systems. You can choose to opt out of playing alongside up to two players, meaning you won't get the same feeder or griefer in all of your games. \"Poor Teamwork\" has been removed from the report drop down menu and \"Griefing\" has been renamed to \"Gameplay Sabotage.\"\n\nThere are also nerfs to D.Va's missiles, Zenyatta's orbs and Moira's transparency. Reaper and Mei made it out alive: both are getting slightly more damage to their weapons. Read the full March 24 Overwatch PTR patch notes from the Blizzard website.\n\nMAP UPDATES\n\nBlizzard World\n\nMoved the first payload checkpoint (Pylon Terrace) back 10 meters\n\nRecommended Slideshows39North Korea Up Close: From the Bright Lights of Pyongyang to the Impoverished Countryside15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nDeveloper Comments: We moved the checkpoint back for two reasons. The original location swung the map's balance too far in one direction (favoring the defenders). Also, once the payload reached the checkpoint, defenders returning from spawn could get pinned in this area, usually resulting in their death.\n\nGENERAL UPDATES\n\nGeneral\n\nPlayers can choose to \"Avoid as Teammate\" with a drop down menu in the Career Profile\n\nDeveloper Comments: The addition of the \"Avoid as Teammate\" option gives players the ability to craft their online gameplay experience. Up to two players can be selected with this feature. If you use the \"Avoid as Teammate\" option on a player, the matchmaker will no longer place you on a team with the avoided player for one week. To learn more about this feature, click here.\n\nReport Menu\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe \"Poor Teamwork\" dropdown menu option has been removed\n\nThe \"Griefing\" dropdown menu option has been renamed \"Gameplay Sabotage\"\n\nDeveloper Comments: Due to player confusion about the most appropriate category to report players for poor or toxic gameplay, we are removing the Poor Teamwork option from the reporting system. Players should instead use the Gameplay Sabotage option when players actively harass or disrupt their own team with game mechanics or their actions. Players should not be reported simply for performing poorly, since everyone occasionally has a bad game.\n\nHeroes\n\nSombra's \"Enemies Hacked\" end-of-round card now also displays her offensive assists\n\nBrigitte's Golden Weapon variant will now also give her a golden shield\n\nChanged Mercy's Valkyrie voice line\n\nUI\n\nSimplified Hero Select tips for roles\n\nHERO UPDATES\n\nD.Va\n\nMicro Missiles\n\nExplosive damage reduced from 6 to 4\n\nDeveloper Comments: D.Va's burst potential is a bit too high, and her Micro Missiles are a major part of that. Currently each missile deals 3 impact damage and 6 explosive damage. We're reducing explosive damage from 6 to 4 but leaving the impact damage the same, the net result being 22% damage reduction.\n\nMei\n\nEndothermic Blaster\n\nNow pierces through enemies\n\nDeveloper Comments: This change helps Mei combat multiple targets that are clumped up and also makes it easier to keep her freezing a specific target if another enemy gets in the way. In addition, this change helps her ultimate more consistently be able to freeze more targets, especially if they are near each other. Note: While her shots now pierce enemies, they still do not pierce barriers such as Reinhardt's shield.\n\nReaper\n\nDeath Blossom\n\nReloads Hellfire Shotguns after use\n\nWraith Form\n\nMove speed bonus increased from 25% to 50%\n\nYou can now cancel the ability by pressing the Shift or Primary Fire hotkey\n\nDeveloper Comments: These changes help Reaper use Wraith Form more consistently as an escape, but they also open up new options, such as chasing down key targets.\n\nMoira\n\nBiotic Grasp\n\nTransparency increased the closer you are to a target\n\nCoalescence\n\nNow becomes more transparent the closer its visual effects are to a player's camera\n\nFade\n\nTransparency increased the closer you are to a target\n\nDeveloper Comments: Due to issues with visibility, we have made most of Moira's visual effects fade away the closer they are to the camera. We have also made modifications to Coalescence to greatly increase the ability for foes and allies alike to see through it when facing it.\n\nZenyatta\n\nOrb of Destruction\n\nSecondary fire rate of fire reduced by 15%\n\nDeveloper Comments: Zenyatta is meant to be able to deal a lot of damage, especially for a support, but his alternate fire burst damage was a bit too high. This change keeps the overall damage the same but lowers the DPS slightly and makes it harder to hit multiple shots at very long ranges.\n\nUSER INTERFACE UPDATES\n\nGeneral\n\nHeroes can now be selected by double-clicking the hero icon during Hero Select\n\nAdded leaderboard information to the competitive information screen. This can be accessed by right-clicking the menu on the competitive card\n\nGAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES UPDATES\n\nGeneral\n\nLockout Elimination cards in the Arcade are now just referred to as Elimination\n\nBUG FIXES\n\nHeroes\n\nFixed a bug that prevented Bastion from firing projectiles immediately after going into Tank configuration\n\nFixed a bug that prevented Bastion from being knocked back while transforming during Configuration: Tank\n\nFixed a bug that prevented Brigitte's impact effects from playing when hitting the environment\n\nFixed a bug that caused Brigitte's aim to be slightly offset after using Shield Bash\n\nFixed a bug that caused a player's camera to jitter when spectating Doomfist during his Meteor Strike\n\nFixed a bug that prevented Doomfist's Meteor Strike from landing where it was telegraphed when standing close to a ledge\n\nFixed a bug that allowed Doomfist's Meteor Strike to access unintended locations\n\nFixed a bug that caused Doomfist's Meteor Strike to penetrate angled surfaces as he descended\n\nFixed a bug that prevented Doomfist's Rocket Punch from impacting enemies or\n\nFixed a bug that prevented Junkrat from being knocked back while piloting his RIP-Tire\n\nFixed a bug that allowed Orisa's Halt! to sometimes affect enemy targets behind walls\n\nFixed a bug that caused McCree's Peacekeeper to grow substantially during the hero select screen when certain skins were equipped\n\nFixed a bug that allowed Moira's Biotic Orb to pass through Mei's Ice Wall\n\nFixed a bug that caused Tracer's Recall to activate differently based on the player's latency",

                "body": "The corporation behind the Verruckt water slide in Kansas City and a former operations director who is being charged with manslaughter for the death of a 10-year-old boy did not have any proper training to design water slides, according to the indictment.\n\nThe 47-page indictment, as reported by the Kansas City Star, states that Schlitterbahn and its two top executives were pursuing to build the world's tallest water slide to impress TV executives despite their lack of training to build water slides.\n\nCo-owner Jeff Henry and Verruckt designer John Schooley admitted in the indictment they did not have the technical experience to design the ride for safety, the indictment states.\n\n\"If we actually knew how to do this, and it could be done that easily, it wouldn't be that spectacular,\" Schooley said as quoted in the indictment.\n\nRecommended Slideshows39North Korea Up Close: From the Bright Lights of Pyongyang to the Impoverished Countryside15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nTheir negligence resulted in the death of Caleb Schwab on August 7, 2016, when he was going down the water slide and the raft went airborne. Schwab, who was the son of Kansas State Rep. Scott Schwab, was decapitated by a metal hoop that was supported by a net on top of the water slide. Two other passengers riding with Schwab also suffered serious injuries.\n\nCaleb Schwab died on the Verruckt water slide at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas City, Kan., in August 2016. A Schlitterbahn executive has been arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter. Keith Myers/Kansas City Star/TNS via Getty Images\n\n\"This child's death and the rapidly growing list of injuries were foreseeable and expected outcomes,\" the indictment said. \"Verruckt's designers and operators knew that Verruckt posed a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death or severe bodily harm.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nHenry also knew the danger of the slide and admitted in the indictment that his only reason for creating the Verruckt was for the attention.\n\n\"I've seen what this one has done to the crash dummies and to the boats flying in the prototype too. It's complex, it's fast, it's mean. If we mess up, it could be the end. I could die going down this ride,\" Henry said, as quoted by the indictment.\n\nThere have been a total of 14 reported injuries from the ride since 2014, with riders experiencing different types of injuries such as concussions, neck pain, whiplash, bruising, lacerations, fractures, and injuries to spinal discs. The last reported injury is Schwab, listed as decapitation.\n\nThe company manager and local director of operations for Schlitterbahn Vacation Village, Tyler Austin Miles, was also listed in the indictment as intercepting, destroying, and changing incident reports from people who had experienced severe injuries from the ride.\n\nIn 2016, Norris \"JJ\" Grove reported the raft his family was on went airborne, causing them to crash. Grove suffered severe swelling to his right eye and wrote an incident report, but Miles, 29, destroyed witness statements and deleted any information about an injury occurring.\n\n\"In response to Grove's incident, Miles intercepted the incident reports which the lifeguards had written. Miles destroyed these written witness statements. Miles then forced the lifeguards to write coached statements which omitted any detail of how the injury occurred. Miles then ordered the medical staff to alter their medical reports,\" the indictment reads.\n\nOn Friday, Miles was indicted and surrendered to police. He is now released on bond.",

Sibling marches are additionally scheduled to occur in various cities across the United States.\n\nThe protest is being held in an effort to spread awareness to gun violence and push for stricter gun laws while honoring the 17 people killed in the Parkland shooting. As Americans nationwide are rallying to take part in this movement, the signs made by attendees prove to be an eye-grabbing aspect to an event of this caliber.\n\nTo ready people for Saturday's march, many city-led March For Our Lives demonstrations held sign-making events. Many of the signs feature bold statements and statistics, among other relevant aspects. For those who couldn't attend Saturday's demonstration or are interested in seeing signs made for marches being held in other U.S. cities, take a look at some of the best sign to surface from the protest below:\n\nDear @GOP, see you at Midterms. #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/6HIHxVrBI8\n\nRecommended Slideshows39North Korea Up Close: From the Bright Lights of Pyongyang to the Impoverished Countryside15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World -- Aia (@aiadriano) March 24, 2018\n\nDon't have a sign for tomorrow?

Because SMGs continue to be WWII's most-used weapon class, it makes sense for Sledgehammer to constantly refine that meta for optimized balance. These particular buffs are barely perceptible in gameplay, but you might feel them in close firefights.\n\nDom XL, on the other hand, is a mode tweak based solely on Scorestreaks. As its name implies, Domination XL is a super-sized version of the traditional Domination Mode. That means all kills are worth 100 points instead of 50. Higher scores means greater access to Scorestreaks and more eventful matches. For those who prefer to play Domination the old way, the standard Dom playlist is still present in the game.\n\nDomination XL doubles the points for kills in 'Call Of Duty WWII's latest playlist update. Sledgehammer Games/Activision\n\nThis Call Of Duty: WWII update is a fairly small one, but it makes interesting adjustments to the game in the midst of its Shamrock & Awe event. While players are racking up kills, finding zombie leprechauns and opening themed Supply Drops, the WWII multiplayer experience should feel tighter than ever.\n\nCall Of Duty: WWII is available now on PS4, Xbox One and PC.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this recent playlist update for Call Of Duty: WWII?

                "body": "A Way Out is a narrative-focused game with multiple endings, and there's currently some debate about just how many endings there are. In this short guide, we'll tell you everything we know about the dual-branched story of Leo and Vincent.\n\nSince we are talking about endings, it goes without saying that SPOILERS for the story of A Way Out are ahead. Those who don't want to know the final outcome should turn back now.\n\nUNLOCK ALL ENDINGS IN 'A WAY OUT'\n\nThe ending you unlock in A Way Out essentially depends on how you finish the game's very last chapter, titled \"Conflict.\" After a moment of betrayal, the two cooperative partners, and friendly players, turn on each other. In the final moments of a heated altercation, Vincent and Leo spot a gun. The ending tied to the character that shoots the final bullet is the one you'll see.\n\nIf Vincent survives, you'll hold hands with Leo one last time and break the news of his death to Linda and Alex. If Leo survives, he'll leave Vincent's note on Carol's doorstep for her to read. Both endings are structured in a very similar way, but you'll see slightly different lore bits in each cutscene. You can watch both versions of the conclusion in the clip below.\n\nRecommended Slideshows39North Korea Up Close: From the Bright Lights of Pyongyang to the Impoverished Countryside15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nLuckily, because both endings only rely on what happens in the game's final moments, it's easy to go back and reload your save to see both without having to play through the entire game multiple times.\n\nIS THERE A THIRD ENDING IN 'A WAY OUT?'\n\nWhile we're still scouring every last inch of A Way Out ourselves, we don't see evidence of a third ending or an ending in which both Vincent and Leo survive. Based on our chat with game Director Josef Fares late last year, this makes a lot of sense. At the time Fares did not see A Way Out as a product with tons of replay value and many branching paths.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe ending you get in 'A Way Out' depends on a twist in the game's final moments. Hazelight Studios/EA\n\nHe expressed a desire to make sure the entire story builds to the proper emotional cues. An ending in which both Vincent and Leo live could potentially change the story up just enough that it wouldn't conclude with the same kind of emotional weight. It also wouldn't make much sense given the scale of the betrayal that occurs.\n\nThat being said, there might still be a third ending that hasn't been discovered yet. As of now, however, the two endings are all that seem to be available.\n\nA Way Out is available now on PS4, Xbox One and PC. If you're just starting your playthrough, read our guide for using the game's free Friend Pass feature.\n\nWhat do you think of A Way Out 's endings? Is there a third ending we missed?

Cahana of Congregation Beth Israel in Oregon, told Newsweek. \"What I feel is unfair is releasing of personal information by a person of power.\"\n\nPastor W. J. Mark Knutson of Augustana Lutheran Church, whose information was also posted, shares the same sentiment. \"Let us not use tactics that are just wrong,\" he told Newsweek. \"We're adults, we need to help model that.\"\n\nKnutson adds that while the local lawmaker has the right to \"speak his mind,\" one has to question his motive.\n\nRecommended Slideshows39North Korea Up Close: From the Bright Lights of Pyongyang to the Impoverished Countryside15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nAccording to The Oregonian, Republican Representative Bill Post asked a Facebook group to contact Rabbi Michael Cahana, the Rev. Alcena Boozer of St. Philip the Deacon Episcopal Church and Pastor W. J. Mark of Augustana Lutheran Church.\n\nThey are petitioners of an initiative launched last week to a proposal which the Oregon lawmaker has labeled as a \"gun confiscation ballot measure\" to The Oregonian.\n\nTheir new gun proposal would outlaw any sale or possession of assault weapons and large capacity magazines in Oregon starting in 2019.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nWhile Cahana adds that the calls have been \"polite\" and non-threatening, some emails and Facebook messages attacked him. For example, an email that was shared to Newsweek called for Cahana to withdraw the assault rifle ban. One such line read: \"You are a Rabbi; you know what is happening to Jews in France, England, and Germany, and everywhere else Jews are unable to defend themselves.\"\n\nAfter the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 students and staff members, the movement for gun control has intensified since Feb 14. Portland's own religious leaders have said the tragedy impacted them to step up efforts.\n\n\"Our plan was to move this through the legislature through time and really its the young people since the Parkland shooting who have inspired us to pick up the pace,\" Cahana said. \"We're following their lead.\"\n\nThe religious leaders are working to gather more than 88,000 signatures by July, which they expect to exceed that mark, in order for the petition to be included on the ballot for November's general election.\n\n\"2nd Amendment yes, weapons of war, no\" Knutson said. \"Children studying, hiding underneath desks, no. Teachers free to teach, yes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Oregon became the first state to enact tougher firearm regulations in the aftermath of Parkland. Introduced in January, it was pushed forward after the tragedy, and now banned anyone with a domestic violence conviction to own a firearm. It closed up a loophole of an existing law, which only termed married partners with a domestic violence of stalking conviction from owning a firearm.",

That's exactly what a team of NASA scientists did at one of the agency's clean rooms, which they use to study meteorites and moon rock samples.\n\nThe results, which the team presented at the 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference this week, could have important implications for how scientists look for alien life on other planets.\n\nThe \"clean room\" they checked, which is used to analyze meteorites collected in Antarctica, is certainly cleaner than any home or office. But the scientists still found a handful of tiny denizens when they swabbed the floor, table and the bench where meteorite analysis actually takes place. For the samples collected at that bench, they also identified what organisms they found.\n\nRead more: Life in the Solar System Likely Exists and is More Common Than We Think\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"It feels like using those cleansing pore strips and really looking into it to find out what dirty stuff are pulled out from my nose!,\" Queenie Chan, a planetary scientist at Open University in the U.K., told Newsweek in an email. Chan wasn't associated with this project, but her research also relies on chemically analyzing meteorites in clean room conditions.\n\nChan said she isn't surprised by the findings: \"That's actually what I would expect them to find.\" Contamination is pretty inevitable even under strict protocols. This particular lab adheres to what's called ISO Class 6 standards, which sets limits on how many particles of certain sizes can be found in the air (Class 1 is the cleanest).\n\nHow much of a problem terrestrial contamination is depends on the size of the extraterrestrial sample scientists are trying to analyze. The smaller the sample, the greater the risk that contamination blocks out the chemicals scientists want to identify.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nThe clean room survey found a particularly large number of fungi, of the same general group of species as the mold that inspired the drug penicillin. In certain conditions, those fungi can produce a few flavors of amino acids -- the building blocks of proteins -- that are quite rare on Earth and are therefore often assumed to be extraterrestrial. The team is now checking their samples for those particular molecules.\n\nFortunately, scientists also have a few tricks for weeding out terrestrial contamination that should help them analyze new samples, Chan said. Those techniques could include identifying the precise chemical fingerprint of the elements that make up each compound.\n\nMeteorite samples arriving from Antarctica at NASA's meteorite lab in Texas. NASA/James Blair\n\nWhile the lab used in this research deals with samples that were delivered to Earth, NASA is preparing for a wave of new samples fetched directly back from elsewhere in the solar system, eventually including Mars and a comet.\n\nMore immediately, the spacecraft OSIRIS-REx is due to arrive at an asteroid in August and bring a piece home to a new clean room being designed now at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"This piece of information is vital,\" Chan said of the new research in terms of that facility. \"We need to control the contamination level.\"",

That question is forcing an examination of policies dictating when and how police identify themselves while encountering suspects.\n\nTwo Sacramento police officers, responding to a report of someone shattering car windows, killed Stephon Alonzo Clark, 22, on Sunday in a hail of bullets.\n\nStephon Clark was in his own backyard armed with nothing more than a cellphone when Sacramento police officers shot and killed the 22-year-old on Sunday. Black Lives Matter Sacramento\n\nPolice video has shown the officers chasing Clark around the side of his grandparents' house, yelling \"Show me your hands\" and \"Gun\" before firing.

They then blocked a road, causing long tailbacks and surrounded the Golden 1 Centre, where the Sacramento Kings were scheduled to play the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nClark's family, through their attorney Benjamin Crump, disputed the police account that Clark was breaking windows.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nMany protesters have said police did not appear to have identified themselves when they confronted Clark on that dark night as he stood in his grandparents' backyard. On the video, the officers cannot be heard saying they are police.\n\n\"He (Clark) didn't make any threats against the police, there is no evidence he committed a crime, there was no warning from the police, there was no identification from the police,\" Crump said.\n\nCrump represented the family of black teenager Michael Brown, whose shooting death in Ferguson, Missouri, by police in 2014 sparked nationwide protests.\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said this week that city officials would examine police protocol for how they identify themselves in such cases.\n\n\"I have a 21-year-old son and I never had to teach him the importance of holding his hands high if he is ever stopped by a police officer,\" Steinberg said Friday on Facebook. \"No words can describe how it must feel for an African-American family who has to teach that lesson as a reality of growing up black.\"\n\nSacramento police guidelines posted on the department's website do not specify that officers must identify themselves when encountering suspects. Sacramento police spokeswoman Linda Matthew said she did not believe such a policy existed.\n\nJim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said that policies for departments vary across the country, but it would be impractical under such circumstances to expect officers to identify themselves.\n\n\"If you're in a chase and everybody's running, there isn't a lot of talking back and forth going on,\" he said.\n\nThe Sacramento shooting could lead some police departments to change their rules, but such policies can be difficult to follow in the heat of the moment, said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\n\n\"It won't surprise me if some departments add some other specific rule after this, but the cops are already weighed down with rules,\" he said.\n\nSacramento police spokeswoman Matthew said Clark could have assumed police were in the area because a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter was circling overhead.\n\n\"The officers were in full uniform and the suspect fled from them,\" she said.\n\nInvestigators are looking into whether the officers, who were searching the neighborhood for several minutes for a suspect, announced to Clark that they were police, Matthew said.\n\n\"With this incident and with every incident we have, we always look for ways in which we can improve,\" Matthew said. \"However, this was very rapidly evolving.\"",

You are our people!\"\n\nIndeed, the veteran parodist did everything he could to warn casual admirers away from his stripped down current tour.\n\nHe cheekily dubbed it the \"Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour.\" He vowed that the setlist would emphasize original songs -- deep cuts like \"My Baby's in Love with Eddie Vedder\" and \"Midnight Star\" instead of the beloved parodies that made him a household name. He left his usual high-concept stage show -- including video screens and song-specific costumes -- at home, relying on nothing more than his songs (and his backing band) to entertain. And he openly acknowledged in interviews that \"some people will probably walk out in disgust because they didn't hear their favorite hit parody.\"\n\nIf anyone left the Apollo disgusted, they kept it quiet. Yankovic did not perform 1988's \"Fat\" or 1981's \"Another One Rides the Bus,\" but he enthusiastically delivered the mix of goofy irreverence and indefatigable genre-hopping that has been his lifeblood for more than 30 years. And the comedian seemed to relish the intimate bond with hardcore fans that the current tour provides.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nOffbeat selections like \"The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota\" drew cheers rather than jeers. It helped that throughout the Apollo, the seats of the historic Harlem music hall were well occupied by Weird Al lifers -- the sort of people who can rattle off UHF trivia and know all the words to \"Albuquerque\" by heart.\n\n'Weird Al' Yankovic performs on September 28, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by ) Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nIf every nerd who came of age in the late 20th century went through a Weird Al phase at some point -- probably between the ages of 11 and 14 -- then this tour seems divinely ordained for the ones who never grew out of it.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nIt was a little like Vh1 Storytellers: Weird Al. Yankovic played a loose, unpredictable set that was largely different than the night before. And in between songs, instead of changing costumes, he shared entertaining stories and offered little nuggets of insight into his creative process. Before playing the brilliant Bob Dylan send-up \"Bob,\" Yankovic mentioned that he wrote the track in 2002 -- a palindromic year -- which gave him the idea to write a song whose lyrics consist of nothing but palindromes. While introducing 1984's tabloid-themed \"Midnight Star,\" he mentioned that he wanted the song to be the first single from In 3-D but his label insisted a Michael Jackson parody would be more commercially viable for the era. In retrospect, the singer admitted, they were right; \"Eat It\" became one of his biggest hits.\n\nAnd he dug deep into his history, playing 1983's disturbing \"Mr. Frump in the Iron Lung,\" in which he uses the air release valve of his accordion to simulate the wheezy sound of an iron lung. (Yankovic noted that he wrote the song when he was 17, and he isn't exactly proud of it: \"I'm including it here for historic purposes.\")\n\nMany of these selections are parodies, though not in the \"Eat It\" sense. Yankovic's originals frequently satirize the stylistic tropes of specific artists, genres or pop culture fads. \"Bob\" incorporates a Dylan-esque harmonica solo. \"I'll Sue Ya\" -- which made Yankovic probably the first performer in Apollo history to start headbanging while perched on a stool in a Hawaiian shirt -- is a dead ringer for scorched-earth Rage Against the Machine bangers. And the break-up-inspired \"One More Minute\" -- which prompted Yankovic to share some rare insight into his romantic past -- is a parody of 1950s doo-wop balladry.\n\nThe originals are not always as funny or fresh as \"Amish Paradise\" (Yankovic returns too frequently to overused themes like food or television), but they do demonstrate levels of his songcraft beyond what casual listeners might know of his oeuvre. And, parody or not, they require Yankovic's long-loyal backing band to toggle between genres with ease, transitioning from the doo-wop schmaltz of \"One More Minute\" to the Police-inspired new wave of \"Velvet Elvis.\"\n\nAt the Apollo, it felt joyful just to bask in the scope and richness of Yankovic's back catalog. The parodist has lampooned dozens of pop fads while outliving them all. And because Yankovic was untethered to his usual greatest-hits selections, he was free to revisit weird little corners of his discography -- like the time he wrote a bombastic, \"We Are the World\"-style charity anthem about music piracy (\"Don't Download This Song\").\n\nToward the end of the night, Yankovic allowed some exceptions to the originals-only format. He played a surreal medley of parody classics in new form, including a lounge-lizard version of \"Amish Paradise\" and a slow, melodramatic \"Like a Surgeon.\" It was meta as hell: Yankovic delivering parodies of his parodies. And then, for the encore, he sent us off with \"The Saga Begins,\" his Star Wars-themed \"American Pie\" parody.\n\nRelated: A conversation with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic\n\nIt has become something of a cliché to remark upon Yankovic's incredible cultural longevity. Still, it's unreal: The guy has been puncturing pop's self-importance since Jimmy Carter was in the White House (his self-titled debut turns 35 next month). None of this was prophesied by the industry suits. \"It was difficult for me to get signed to a record deal back in the early '80s,\" Yankovic recalled in 2006, \"because all the executives were saying, 'Oh, you do that... novelty music. You're gonna have maybe one hit if you're lucky and then [...] you know, nobody'll ever hear from you again.'\"\n\nThat Yankovic hasn't just survived the cratering of the recording industry but seems to be enjoying a late-career renaissance feels like some delightful historic glitch. His 2014 album Mandatory Fun topped the Billboard charts, and, as he noted between songs, his recent \"Hamilton Polka\" recently became the first-ever polka to appear on the digital sales chart. (A constant trickster, Yankovic pretended he was about to bust out the Hamilton medley, then played something completely different.)\n\nYankovic's longevity became something of a running joke at the Apollo. Comedian Emo Philips, who appeared in Al's 1989 cult classic UHF and opened the evening with a set of oddball stand-up, jokingly imagined asking someone in 1988 which of the following things would be thriving in the year 2018: newspapers, the recording industry, the Soviet Union -- or \"Weird Al\" Yankovic.\n\n\"With the right odds,\" Philips said, \"you could own this theater.\"",

During a GDC talk Friday afternoon, PUBG creator and Director Brendan Greene dropped a few hints for eager fans and tweeted them a few hours later.\n\nICYMI at my @Official_GDC talk, here's an early WIP preview of our 4x4km map, coming soon to the new @PUBATTLEGROUNDS Experimental Test Servers!#ThisIsBattleRoyale pic.twitter.com/JGRv57A7ST -- PLAYERUNKNOWN (@PLAYERUNKNOWN)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nThe Island map is roughly half the size of a standard PUBG arena, but scope isn't the only difference apparent in these screenshots. In contrast to the darker, grittier environments of its predecessors, this one is full of bright colors and rolling hills with a soothing river snaking throughout. With regard to cover, tight firefights will likely take place in quaint village huts. Out in the open, tall grass provides perfect concealment for snipers. Even though the map's purpose seems fairly solidified, Greene cautioned the new PUBG island map is still early in development.\n\nIts lush green landscape offers a different perspective from the original gritty map.

Provided the listed dates are still accurate, it's due to arrive on Test Servers in April and is one of two PUBG maps set to debut this year. The second one is another 8x8 map with no defined release window.\n\nWhile footage of Greene's GDC talk is not yet available, it mainly focused on his history as a photographer and gamer and how those roots inspired him to create one of the most popular games in the world. In Greene's real life, he became obsessed with trying to capture candid \"watercooler moments.\" With that idea in mind, he built a game with the tools to create shocking set pieces in organic ways. Having not been a gamer for most of his life, he was fortuitously positioned to design something unique that capitalized on true human emotion outside a virtual space.\n\nThese villages seem like the perfect location for firefights. PUBG Corporation\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAs far as this Island map is concerned, though, it offers yet another example of PUBG drawing inspiration from its heated competition with Epic Games' Fortnite. While Fortnite borrows the basic foundation that made PUBG so appealing in the first place, it's found immense success focusing on shorter, faster match cycles. It would seem PUBG Corp hopes to replicate Fortnite's more claustrophobic feel with its own smaller environment.\n\nPUBG is currently experimenting with a new Event Modes feature on its public servers as well. The concept of rotating match types that occur over short periods of time was also popularized by Fortnite. PUBG's limited large-squad mode is active through March 25 at 10 p.m. EDT.\n\nPlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is available now on PC, Xbox One and mobile devices. The Island map only has a release target on PC at this time.\n\nWhat do you think of PUBG's Island map after seeing these screenshots? Will it make the game faster?

                "body": "This article originally appeared on the History News Network.\n\nFlying in the post September 11th world is often a maddening gauntlet of petty and seemingly arbitrary rules and procedures at the cold, probing hands of the TSA. But the current security measures are only additions built upon the foundations of the reaction to a wave of hijackings of airplanes in the 1960s and 70s. For a time air piracy almost became the new normal, the subject of comedy routines and the basis for the coining of the word skyjacking. Of the many hijackers of the era the most famous was D.B. Cooper, who jumped out of an airliner with a bag of ransom money never to be heard from again, but the worst of the air pirates was a man who became more dangerous after he was caught and imprisoned.\n\nFew people noticed the 34-year-old man with a cast on his left arm in LAX boarding TWA flight No. 2 nonstop overnight to New York on January 28, 1972. Garrett Brock Trapnell had already traveled an unlikely path from his family background that represented the best in aviation history.\n\nHis cousin Admiral Frederick Trapnell was a pioneer in naval aviation. In 1943 Trapnell took the controls of the Bell XP-59A Airecomet, becoming the first Navy pilot to fly a jet aircraft. In Trapnell's long career he led the Navy test pilot program, helped engineer the redesign of the Corsair to match the performance of the Japanese Zero, flew almost every kind of aircraft including dirigibles and for a time in the 1930s was a member of the Navy's \"Three Flying Fish\" aerobatic team, the predecessor of the Blue Angels.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nGarrett Trapnell's uncle General Thomas Trapnell had an equally distinguished career in the Army. Trapnell was a survivor of the Bataan Death March, served in Korea and as an advisor to the French during the Indochina War and strongly advised President Kennedy against U.S. involvement in Vietnam.\n\nGarrett Trapnell's immediate family was rooted in the same tradition. His father, Walter Scott Trapnell, was a graduate of Annapolis and his mother attended Radcliffe. His parent's marriage ended when he was four and his father's career took a dark turn. Young Garrett was forced to live with his mother, who increasing sank into alcoholism. At eleven Garrett joined his father in Panama, where he allegedly managed a brothel. Garrett began his criminal career at 15, dropping out of school. By age 17 he enlisted in the Army. By chance he found himself stationed at Ft. Hood where his uncle was the commanding officer, who openly ridiculed his nephew's lowly rank.\n\nGarrett Trapnell was more successful as a criminal. He graduated to bank robberies and jewel theft, using the proceeds to finance a flashy lifestyle. The Batista government in Cuba accused him of running guns to Castro.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nTrapnell had a perverse talent for manipulation, a kind of minor league Charles Manson, leaving wives and children across the U.S. and Canada. He undertook an intensive study of psychiatry in order to master the rarely attempted and even less rarely successful insanity defense. He began a pattern of committing crimes and blaming his alter ego \"Gregg Ross.\"\n\nGarrett was a pilot and with the help of a partner flew about once a month to Canada to rob banks. On another occasion he used credit cards stolen from a dancer in Las Vegas to rent a plane which he flew to the Bahamas. After robbing a jewelry store of $100,000 he ditched the plane in Florida, made a getaway in a rented car and left his driver's license on the seat.\n\nBy the time he boarded the flight at LAX in 1972 he had been arrested more than 20 times but had only served two years in prison. Usually he was confined to mental hospitals for short stays or simply walked out when he wanted. After one stint in a Florida hospital in July, 1971, Trapnell read of a 57 foot yacht for sale. He claimed he paid $306,800 in $100 bills to James Fahey to buy the ship. Fahey disappeared after the alleged sale. Trapnell sued to gain title to the yacht but lost in court.\n\nAs he sat on the TWA flight to New York Garrett Trapnell had one last ironic footnote to his life. Five months before a cousin, Joseph Trapnell, a pilot for Eastern Airlines, had overpowered a hijacker bound for Cuba. Now Garrett would enter aviation history on his own terms.\n\nTrapnell handed flight attendant Constance Tokarski a note and pulled a handgun from under his cast. The plane landed at JFK and the 93 passengers were released. Trapnell demanded the payment of $306,800, the release of imprisoned black militant Angela Davis and his friend Jorge Padilla, and to talk to Richard Nixon. During the next eight hours Trapnell held the crew at gunpoint and at one point forced the pilot to take off and circle the airport as he threatened to crash the plane into the terminal. Trapnell agreed to let a new crew replace his hostages. An FBI agent disguised as a ground crew member shot Trapnell in the arm.\n\nAt his trial for air piracy Trapnell mounted his usual defense, claiming \"Gregg Ross\" was responsible. He focused his attention on juror Gertrude Hass, a middle aged social worker. As he correctly predicted in an interview before the trial began, Hass held out for acquittal against the other eleven members of the jury. According to a report in the New York Times the judge made highly irregular comments about Hass calling her someone who thinks \"there is no such thing as a crime, there are only a lot of sick people until you get your own purse snatched,\" and the U.S. attorney reacted by threatening to investigate her for misconduct.\n\nThe Nixon administration was also upset at the mistrial, fearing that others would try the insanity defense. Government officials proposed new laws revamping the insanity defense and in January, 1973 introduced the first airport security measures including metal detectors to finally do something to end the hijackings. At his retrial the government introduced evidence from Jorge Padilla on Trapnell's instructions on beating the charges with a phony insanity defense. Trapnell was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nTrapnell was sent to the federal prison in Marion, Illinois, the unofficial replacement for Alcatraz and the predecessor of the current supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. Tapping into the Anglo-American quirk of romanticizing criminals (for example Robin Hood, Bonnie and Clyde, and Tony Soprano) Trapnell turned his charm on the women writing him in prison. Many women attracted to prisoners fit the stereotype of living in homes on wheels and had missing teeth, but Barbara Ann Oswald did not. After a rough start in life she achieved middle class respectability in the solid St. Louis suburb of Richmond Heights and was working on a master's degree from a local college when she fell in love with Trapnell.\n\nAfter a stream of letters and prison visits Oswald was ready to do anything to free her lover. On the morning of May 24, 1978 Oswald visited Trapnell and returned to St. Louis. In the early evening she hired Alan Barklage, the chief pilot of Fustaire Helicopters, to fly her south to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to look at investment property. During the flight she pulled out a .44 caliber handgun and ordered Barklage to fly east to the prison in Marion. Trapnell was waiting in the exercise yard along with Martin McNally, who unsuccessfully tried to hijack a TWA flight at Lambert airport in St. Louis, and Kenny Johnson, a bank robber.\n\nAs Barklage, a veteran of two tours in Vietnam, flew the Bell Jetranger II closer to almost certain death from the heavily armed guards in the prison towers he saw his only chance. About three miles from the prison Oswald switched the gun to her other hand and Barklage let go of the controls and lunged at her. They struggled for the gun as the helicopter tumbled out of control. Barklage grabbed the gun and held it on Oswald as he tried to land. Oswald reached for another weapon in the back seat and Barklage fired, hitting Oswald point blank in the head. Barklage landed the helicopter just outside of the main entrance as armed guards swarmed on him.\n\nTrapnell and the others were charged with attempting to escape and air piracy. Investigators found that Trapnell had considered sending Oswald to helicopter flight school but abandoned the idea. He had made arrangement with his ex-wife in Canada to have a car, clothes and guns waiting for him and the others near the prison and had planned to head to New Orleans for a robbery spree. \"Escaping is as American as apple pie,\" Trapnell told ABC News in an interview. \"If I had made it in that helicopter the American public would have loved it.\"\n\nIn December Trapnell and McNally stood trial in the federal district court in nearby Benton, Illinois. One of Trapnell's witnesses was Robin Oswald, the 17-year-old daughter of Barbara Ann Oswald. Robin, a cheerleader at the elite Clayton High School, was so distraught at her mother's death she dropped out of school. On December 21, 1978, the final day of the trial just before the jury began its deliberations Robin Oswald boarded a TWA flight from Louisville to Kansas City during a stopover in St. Louis. She revealed a dynamite bomb and detonator strapped to her chest and demanded the plane fly to the small airport at Marion. There she threatened to blow up the plane with most of the passengers still on board unless Trapnell was freed.\n\nThe FBI opened ten hours of negotiations, bringing her sisters and a brother to the airport to talk to her. Robin Oswald remained calm asking a flight attendant \"Aren't I the nicest hijacker?\" Finally Robin agreed to surrender. The bomb was actually three railroad flares and parts of a doorbell. Just as she was taken into juvenile custody the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts against Trapnell. Trapnell returned to Marion with another life sentence and restrictions on his contact with the outside, leaving frivolous litigation and occasional campaigns for president as his main source of amusement in the coming years.\n\nIn Marion Trapnell was held in the most secure part of the most secure prison in America. The K Unit is a small underground prison within the prison. More dormitory than dungeon, K Unit has a few rooms more like bedrooms than cells and by prison standards lavishly furnished. During a press visit in 1990 by the present writer, convicted spies John Walker and Jonathan Pollard occupied two cells, along with arms dealer Edwin Wilson and a white supremacist with a long history of murders and the suspicion that he shot publisher Larry Flynt. In a fifth cell was Garrett Trapnell, grayer and older than in old newspapers but with eyes that were burning with a calculation, trying to work the situation to his advantage, every bit as dangerous as ever. Trapnell did finally leave the unit when he was transferred to the federal prison medical center in Springfield, Missouri, where he died of emphysema in 1993.\n\nGreg Bailey is the author of the not so quite forthcoming \"The Herrin Massacre.\"",

The state has the second highest rate of opioid prescribing in the country, behind Alabama. More prescriptions are filled in Arkansas each year than there are people.\n\nThe suit claims that opioid makers and prescribers purposely mislead Arkansans about the risks of long-term drug use and make deceptive statements to advertise the drugs.\n\nRobyn Walters, a resident of Northwest Arkansas, lost two loved ones to Opioid overdose and supports the lawsuit. It doesn't make sense to punish the addicted, she told KFSM-TV. Instead she wants to see the companies making and distributing the drugs punished. \"They're basically legal drug dealers and they need to be held accountable for what they are doing and I would love to see the money from this lawsuit go towards prevention and maybe also for those who are addicted to get them some help,\" she said.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\"It's very clear that these companies were at least willing to profit on the carnage that has taken place as a result in Arkansas,\" Jerome Tapley, who is representing Arkansas on behalf of Cory Watson Attorneys, told Newsweek.\n\nThe Association of Arkansas Counties, the Arkansas Municipal League and the State of Arkansas brought the suit in the Crittenden County Circuit Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on the heels of President Trump's opioid plan rollout, which focused heavily on punishing drug dealers and stopping drugs from entering the US illegally. At a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire Monday the president said he was also considering bringing a lawsuit against pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\"Our Department of Justice is looking very seriously at bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies,\" he said. \"We'll bring it at a federal level. Some states are already bringing it, but we're thinking about bringing it at a very high federal level and we'll do a job.\"\n\nArkansas counties and cities filed a joint lawsuit against opioid drug manufacturers Wednesday. Stoneward\n\nShares of opioid-producing companies dropped after the speech: Endo International and Depomed shares dropped nearly 4 percent and Mallinckrodt fell 5.5 percent.\n\nPharmaceutical companies named in the case told Newsweek that while they deny the allegations, they recognize that opioids have been misused in the past and are taking steps to prevent that.\n\nHealthcare Distribution Alliance, a national trade association representing wholesale distributors of opioids, told Newsweek that \"[T]the idea that distributors are responsible for the number of opioid prescriptions written defies common sense and lacks understanding of how the pharmaceutical supply chain actually works and is regulated.\"\n\n\"Those bringing lawsuits would be better served addressing the root causes, rather than trying to redirect blame through litigation,\" the alliance said.\n\nLast month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would create a task force \"to examine existing state and local government lawsuits against opioid manufacturers to determine if we can be of assistance.\"\n\nBut Arkansas officials are worried that the Federal government's lawsuit won't properly allocate money at a local level.\n\n\"We applaud the Federal government for weighing in, but recognize the brunt of this is at the local level,\" said Tapley. \"This is a problem for county and city personal. We welcome any help that might come from the Justice Department in the form of aid, but this is really primarily our problem.\"\n\nThe lawsuit asks specially for \"past damages and restitution for monies spent by state, counties and city for those extraordinary and additional services provided which they would not have otherwise incurred but as a result of the Arkansas Opioid Epidemic and their past efforts to abate it.\" It also asks for funding for Naloxone kits, the creation of mental health and Opioid abuse treatment clinics, and overdose response teams.\n\n\"We want funding to create programs to restore Arkansas and that means drug treatment and prevention. We don't just want money that would go into the county or city treasury,\" said Tapley.\n\nStates like Iowa and North Carolina has expressed interest in copying Arkansas's method into similar suits, Chris Villines, Executive Director of the Association of Arkansas Counties, told Newsweek.",

The largest one, in terms of how much it spends, is the National Rifle Association of America. Originally formed in 1871, this NRA branch claims to have about 5 million members, although some investigative reporters question that assertion.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nIt has operated as a social welfare organization since 1944.\n\nLike public charities, these groups, are exempt from taxation on the money they take in. Also known as 501(c)(4), based on language in the tax code, they differ from public charities in a few ways.\n\nFirst, donors to social welfare organizations can't deduct their gifts from their taxable income. Second, these organizations may support and oppose political candidates. Third, social welfare organizations can engage in unlimited lobbying, as long as that effort to sway lawmakers and policymakers is related to their core mission.\n\nLike charities, social welfare groups must spend all their revenue on work tied to their mission or shoring up their endowments. They can't, in other words, distribute any profits left over after paying their bills to their leaders, their funders or anyone else.\n\nThe NRA has five main missions: protecting the Second Amendment, promoting public safety, training for marksmanship and gun safety, promoting competitive shooting and improving hunter safety. Among other things, it publishes the American Rifleman, American Hunter, America's 1st Freedom and Shooting Illustrated magazines and produces NRATV programs. It also has a lobbying arm, created in 1975, called the Institute for Legislative Action.\n\nIn 2016 this social welfare group raised almost US$337 million in revenue, with about half coming from membership dues. The rest largely came from its media operations, donations and grants. It draws a growing share of its income, reportedly, from gunmakers rather than gunowners.\n\nPoliticking and lobbying\n\nThe NRA also runs a political action committee, the NRA Political Victory Fund, through which it backs electoral candidates.\n\nThe NRA's political spending more than doubled between the 2012 and 2016 electoral cycles, rising to $54.4 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks the money reported to the government in federal elections. About $31 million of that sum supported Trump's candidacy.\n\nThe gun group's lobbying arm, which is technically a division of its social welfare group, spent more than $5 million in 2017, actively seeking to influence politicians or public officials regarding specific policies or pieces of legislation. It roughly tripled those expenditures in the last decade.\n\nCharities\n\nThe NRA also runs four affiliated charities: the NRA Foundation, Inc., the NRA Civil Rights Defense Fund, the NRA Freedom Action Foundation and the NRA Special Contribution Fund.\n\nLike thousands of churches, universities, museums and advocacy groups of other stripes, these are 501(c)(3) groups. That means they are excused from paying taxes on most of their income. In addition, their donors may get tax breaks when they deduct the value of their gifts to charities from their taxable income. To maintain that coveted incentive, these nonprofits can't endorse or oppose political candidates. They also can't do more than minimal amounts of lobbying.\n\nWhat do the NRA's charities do?\n\nThe NRA Foundation does public outreach to promote marksmanship and gun safety through grants to shooting programs run by everyone from the Boy Scouts to local police departments. It also advocates for protecting the constitutional right to bear arms, as does the NRA Freedom Action Foundation.\n\nThe NRA Civil Rights Defense Fund provides legal and financial aid to people and groups dealing with lawsuits related to the NRA's goals, and backs legal research on federal and state constitutional provisions that have to with guns.\n\nThe NRA Special Contribution Fund, focuses on marksmanship and firearm safety, and operates the Whittington Center in New Mexico, a vast shooting range.\n\nCommon but with a caveat\n\nThis multilayered structure isn't unique. For instance, the Sierra Club, a social welfare organization that advocates for environmental protection, is affiliated with the Sierra Club Foundation, a charity. The American Civil Liberties Union, a civil rights group partners with the ACLU Foundation and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a charity that runs reproductive health care clinics, is affiliated with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, a social welfare group that lobbies.\n\nThis arrangement helps charities preserve donors' tax breaks without sacrificing the ability of their affiliated membership groups to engage on the day's issues. Taken to its logical extreme, however, this dynamic can flout restrictions on what the government defines as legitimate charitable gifts.\n\nWithout such limits, what's to stop me or anyone else from getting tax breaks for donations that will pay for lobbying? I could give it to the charity of my choice, which in turn could hand my dollars to its related social welfare organization. I'd get my tax deduction, and the group that supports my policy preferences could use the money I donated for lobbying.\n\nThe IRS prohibits these financial switcheroos. While charities may contribute to their affiliated social welfare organization, both parties must keep records that prove the charitable gifts don't fund lobbying or political candidacies.\n\nThe NRA Foundation made a nearly $20 million grant to the National Rifle Association of America, in 2016. But that did not necessarily flout any tax laws.\n\nStill, the NRA may sometimes let donations flow too freely between its affiliates, as Yahoo News has reported, in ways that violate federal electoral laws.\n\nRunning so many different kinds of organizations, each subject to different rules, is an immense and difficult undertaking. It's worth keeping an eye on the NRA to ensure that it manages to stay within the lines the law has painted.\n\nSamuel Brunson, Professor of Law, Loyola University Chicago",

Nelson rallied people on social media and crowdfunded pizza for the students who were handed punishments while participating in the walkouts.\n\nNelson said she became involved with Eighteen X '18 because she thinks \"this generation needed to be heard from and deserved a voice.\" She went on to draw parallels between the rise of student activism now to that seen during the Vietnam War, calling both a \"fight for their lives.\"\n\n\"I think it's about time,\" Tinneny's mother, Heather McCarron told Newsweek about the surge of political activism among American teens. \"These school shootings have been happening for a long time.

                "title": "Here's why Chinese satellite Tiangong-1 is falling uncontrollably, and why Earth's atmosphere can't stop it",
                "body": "Let's clear something up right away: Although the Chinese space station Tiangong-1 is indeed falling to Earth completely out of control, there is no need to panic. The chances of it harming anyone as it lands are astronomically tiny.\n\nThat's because humans are so scattered across Earth's surface that there's plenty of room for a satellite to crash with no ill effects. But the only reason there's any chance of parts of Tiangong-1 reaching the surface is because of its large size. Hundreds of satellites fall out of orbit each year and are completely destroyed before they hit the ground, thanks to the thick blanket of atmosphere enveloping Earth.\n\n\"In outer space, it's a vacuum -- except that it's not,\" Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts who tracks launching and re-entering satellites on Twitter, told Newsweek. \"The Earth's atmosphere dribbles out, very slowly, very thinly.\" It's a very, very good vacuum, but not quite a perfect one.\n\nThat means that even at the highest levels of orbits around the planet, where the atmosphere is thinnest, any satellite will bump into particles of atmosphere now and again. Because a satellite is orbiting at a speed of about 17,000 miles per hour, hitting even an occasional tiny particle can slow it down just a smidge -- the space equivalent of the drag a swimmer faces in water.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nRead more: Tiangong-1: How Long Was Chinese Space Station in Orbit Before It Started Falling To Earth?\n\nHere's where things get a little mind-bending. If a satellite slows down just a smidge, it falls just a smidge as well, orbiting closer to Earth. But that makes it orbit faster -- picture the tip of a shorter pendulum compared to a longer one, then imagine completing the circle. \"The net thing is that you spiral in,\" McDowell said. \"Each orbit is a little smaller than the last orbit.\"\n\n(Satellites meant to stay in orbit for a long time carry miniature rockets they use to nudge themselves back up to a steady orbit, and Tiangong-1 received more than a dozen of these little nudges between its 2011 launch and 2016.)\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nThe lower the orbit gets, the thicker the atmosphere around the satellite and the stronger the drag, which means the spiraling effect speeds up. Eventually, the collisions with all the particles in the atmosphere causes the satellite to burn up and fall out of orbit down to Earth.\n\nThe same basic principle holds with any atmosphere, which is why NASA disposed of its Cassini spacecraft by steering it into the atmosphere around Saturn when its mission was over, and why Juno will meet the same fate at Jupiter. It also holds true of Earth's atmosphere with natural intruders, like meteorites.\n\nThe whole process is made a little bit less predictable because the amount of drag a satellite faces depends on how much of its surface is facing into the atmosphere -- consider a parachute as compared to a missile.\n\nTiangong-1 launched in 2011. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nThe materials a satellite is made of also affect re-entry. Many satellites contain lots of aluminum, which tends to burn up pretty thoroughly at the end of this spiraling process. But denser parts of a spacecraft don't always burn up all the way. \"You get lumps of metal falling through the sky and hitting the surface of the Earth,\" McDowell says. Most hit unpopulated and undeveloped parts of Earth's surface.\n\nThese days, scientists steer most dying satellites with onboard rockets, controlling the re-entry area to a known broad swath of uninhabited surface, like the southern Pacific Ocean. This is exactly what was supposed to happen to Tiangong-1, which like most larger modern satellites was equipped with thrusters to give scientists control over where it re-entered.\n\nBut the Chinese were worried the space station's successor, Tiangong-2, wouldn't be able to launch smoothly, and they wanted to be sure they had something up there to keep their space program growing, no matter what. During that extra time in space, Tiangong-1's control mechanisms broke -- which is why the atmosphere is in control of things now. \"They made a bet that they shouldn't have made,\" McDowell said.\n\n\"It's gonna come down just fine,\" he continued. \"But it's not best practice.\"",

But when it comes to happiness, a general consensus seems to have emerged.\n\nDepending on the scope and purpose of the research, happiness is often measured using objective indicators (data on crime, income, civic engagement and health) and subjective methods, such as asking people how frequently they experience positive and negative emotions.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nWhy might Danes evaluate their lives more positively? As a psychologist and native of Denmark, I've looked into this question.\n\nYes, Danes have a stable government, low levels of public corruption, and access to high-quality education and health care. The country does have the the highest taxes in the world, but the vast majority of Danes happily pay: They believe higher taxes can create a better society.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, however, they value a cultural construct called \"hygge\" (pronounced hʊɡə).\n\nThe Oxford dictionary added the word in June 2017, and it refers to high-quality social interactions. Hygge can be used as a noun, adjective or verb (to hygge oneself), and events and places can also be hyggelige (hygge-like).\n\nHygge is sometimes translated as \"cozy,\" but a better definition of hygge is \"intentional intimacy,\" which can happen when you have safe, balanced and harmonious shared experiences. A cup of coffee with a friend in front of a fireplace might qualify, as could a summer picnic in the park.\n\nA family might have a hygge evening that entails board games and treats, or friends might get together for a casual dinner with dimmed lighting, good food and easygoing fun. Spaces can also be described as hyggelige (\"Your new house is so hyggeligt\") and a common way of telling a host thank you after a dinner is to say that it was hyggeligt (meaning, we had a good time). Most Danish social events are expected to be hyggelige, so it would be a harsh critique to say that a party or dinner wasn't hyggelige.\n\nResearch on hygge has found that in Denmark, it's integral to people's sense of well-being. It acts as a buffer against stress, while also creating a space to build camaraderie. In a highly individualized country like Denmark, hygge can promote egalitarianism and strengthen trust.\n\nIt would be fair to say that hygge is fully integrated into the Danish cultural psyche and culture. But it has also become a bit of a global phenomenon -- Amazon now sells more than 900 books on hygge, and Instagram has over 3 million posts with the hashtag #hygge. Google trends data show a big jump in searches for hygge beginning in October 2016.\n\nNor is Denmark the only country that has a word for a concept similar to hygge -- the Norwegians have koselig, the Swedes mysig, the Dutch gezenlligheid and the Germans gemütlichkeit.\n\nIn the U.S. -- which also places a high value on individualism -- there's no real cultural equivalent of hygge. Income is generally associated with happiness; yet even though the country's GDP has been rising and its unemployment rates have been declining, levels of happiness in the U.S. have been steadily decreasing.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nIncome inequality continues to be an issue. But there's also been a marked decrease in interpersonal trust and trust toward institutions like the government as well as the media. In the end, more disposable income doesn't hold a candle to having someone to rely on in a time of need (something that 95 percent of Danes believe they have).\n\nAt its core, hygge is about building intimacy and trust with others.\n\nAmericans could probably use a little more of it in their lives.\n\nMarie Helweg-Larsen, Professor of Psychology, Dickinson College.",

A Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nIt added that the secretaries of defense and homeland security \"may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nThe White House said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had found that individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria presented a risk to military effectiveness.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards ... equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" it said.\n\nIn a memo cited by CNN, the Pentagon said that Trump's order would exclude those \"stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession,\" servicemembers who \"do not require a change of gender\" and troops who started serving under the Obama administration's removal of restrictions on transgender recruits.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe Democratic National Committee criticized the move as an insult to transgender service members. In a strongly-worded statement, U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the policy would harm the nation.\n\n\"This latest memorandum is the same cowardly, disgusting ban the President announced last summer,\" she said. \"The President's hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor and dignity.\"\n\nTrump's decision is less restrictive than his initial comments in a July Twitter message saying he would prohibit transgender people from military service. That blanket ban reversed former President Barack Obama's policy.\n\nAt the time, Trump said on Twitter, the military \"cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\"\n\nHowever, a number of federal judges have already issued rulings blocking Trump's ban, saying it would probably violate the right, under the U.S. Constitution, to equal protection under the law.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon reaffirmed that it would continue to comply with federal law.\n\n\"(The Pentagon) will continue to assess and retain transgender service members,\" Pentagon spokesman Major David Eastburn said.\n\nIn a February memorandum to the White House, made public on Friday, Mattis said transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria were disqualified from military service.\n\nBut he added that those currently serving could continue to serve if they had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since Obama's policy took effect.\n\nMattis also recommended that transgender individuals who require or have undergone gender transition be disqualified from military service.\n\n\"In my professional judgment, these policies will place the Department of Defense in the strongest position to protect the American people, to fight and win America's wars, and to ensure the survival and success of our service members around the world,\" Mattis wrote.\n\nA court filing by the Trump administration said 8,980 service members reportedly identify as transgender, but only 937 active duty service members were diagnosed with gender dysphoria since June 30, 2016.\n\nAt least one openly transgender recruit has already signed a contract to join the U.S. military since a federal court ruled late last year that the military would have to accept transgender individuals.\n\nThe Department of Justice said it would continue to defend the defense department's authority to create and implement personnel policies.\n\n\"Consistent with this new policy, we are asking the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions in order to ensure the safety and security of the American people and the best fighting force in the world,\" it said in a statement.\n\nAdvocates have said they believe dozens, if not hundreds, of transgender people will seek to join those already serving.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group, condemned the Trump policy.\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" Chad Griffin, its president, said in a statement.\n\nSenior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Joshua Block said, \"What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy. This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence. It is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out President Trump's reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.\"",

Now, without the threat of a government shutdown and a trillion-dollar budget proposal to motivate Republicans and Democrats to bargain in good faith on immigration, lawmakers are back at square one and more frustrated than ever at having to resolve a problem many say Trump created himself.\n\n\"The president has rejected at least six or seven bipartisan solutions that have been presented to him,\" Congressional Hispanic Caucus whip Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) told Newsweek on Friday. \"We need to be clear: Democrats and Republicans are scrambling to clean up a mess created by the administration's anti-immigrant agenda.\"\n\nTrump rescinded DACA suddenly in September, giving lawmakers on Capitol Hill until March 5 to come up with legislation that would give Dreamers a path forward and accommodate his own immigration policy demands. Since then, legislators have struggled to reach a compromise that will satisfy the majority of their parties on Trump's timeline. The Supreme Court's decision to stay out of DACA disputes didn't help move things along either, effectively relieving pressure on members of Congress to come up with a solution for the program's recipients.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nAmid calls for bipartisanship, the president has continued to blame Democrats for the impasse on DACA.\n\n\"DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by Democrats,\" Trump said during a press conference Friday afternoon, after threatening to veto the omnibus bill on Twitter earlier that morning. \"We wanted to include DACA and include them in this bill...[but] the Democrats would not do it.\"\n\nTrump and some Republicans, meanwhile, complained that the bill neither adequately funded the wall nor defunded so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nSee my full statement announcing my intention to vote against the disastrous omnibus spending bill here -- &gt; https://t.co/j369TXex7o pic.twitter.com/okprJQD9Qc&mdash; Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\n.@realDonaldTrump I stand with you, Mr. President. Veto this #omnibus and let&#39;s fund the wall and get a better deal for the American people.&mdash; Ted Budd (@RepTedBudd)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nLawmakers like Aguilar say the president risks pushing members of Congress further back into their respective corners by stoking the flames of partisan politics.\n\n\"If anyone thinks the president is going to play a positive role in the conversation on Dreamers they're making a huge mistake,\" Representative Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) told Newsweek. \"Part of the strategy has to be to ignore him.\"\n\nGrijalva and Aguilar plan to do just that.\n\nBoth congressmen have proposed creative solutions to bring a clean, standalone Dream Act to a vote, like invoking the \"Queen of the Hill\" rule, which would allow members of Congress to debate every DACA bill that's been proposed so far. That would include Aguilar's own bipartisan legislation, which he co-sponsored with Texas Republican Will Hurd in January. The bill would give DACA recipients a path to citizenship and give the Department of Homeland Security \"operational control\" of the southern border by the end of 2020 through \"physical barriers\" and other means.\n\nPolitical strategists say resolving DACA is crucial for members of both parties, especially as midterm elections draw near.\n\n\"Democrats and any interested Republicans should be working hard to put legislation together so they can tell voters, 'Hey, we're trying to work on this,'\" Matt Barreto, the co-founder of research firm Latino Decisions, told Newsweek. Barreto says if there's still no solution by November, Republicans may be the ones to pay the price, because it's Democrats, he says, who have the \"winning card\" when it comes time to debate immigration issues.\n\nStill, some Democrats have already expressed worry that a disillusioned Latino electorate could cost them the key seats they need to win to flip at least one chamber of Congress. But in the immediate aftermath of another failed DACA deal, Grivalja and Aguilar worry most about the everyday lives of the families in their district, who make up the more than 700,000 DACA recipients across the country.\n\n\"Maybe some people on either side of the aisle would rather not have any action on this and would rather focus on the November elections,\" Aguilar said. \"But we owe it to our communities to get a permanent solution for this issue, and I think we can. There's always plenty of time for politics.\"",

But now there may be a solution: human stem cells.\n\nIn a new study, scientists bred rats to become extremely heavy drinkers who preferred alcohol over water. They drank the human equivalent of more than one bottle of vodka every day for more than four months, Yedy Israel, study co-author and researcher at the University of Chile, Santiago, told ResearchGate.\n\nRelated: Women in Sri Lanka still can't legally buy alcohol. Here's why\n\nAfter the four-month period of being able to choose between alcohol or water was up, the rats were then deprived of alcohol for two weeks, according to the findings published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nSome of the rodents were then injected with a single dose of stem cells collected from human fat tissue.

Their habits at that point closely resembled those of a social drinker, rather than an alcoholic.\n\nAlthough the research has yet to be applied to humans, Israel and his colleagues are looking for partners to carry out human clinical studies.\n\nFinding new ways to get people to stop drinking is crucial, considering about 16 million people in the United States suffer from alcohol use disorder, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. If that number isn't alarming enough, new data from early March revealed binge-drinking Americans consume more than 17 billion alcoholic beverages each year.",

He was once described by Rolling Stone as \"underground hip-hop's major tastemaker.\"\n\nBut on Friday, Grandmaison found himself denying allegations of rape and assault, which he claims are \"absurd.\"\n\n\"A girl I dated for a few months 10 years ago is coming out saying that I raped and assaulted her,\" Grandmaison wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. \"The claims are new. She has no evidence. I have plenty of emails from her that make it clear how absurd these claims are. You'll probably get to read them all in time.\"\n\n\"I've done plenty of stupid shit in my life,\" Grandmaison continued. \"But I've never raped or hit a woman.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nIn an email to Newsweek, Grandmaison said these new accusations were posted by his former girlfriend on her private Facebook account.\n\nThis isn't the first time Grandmaison has defended himself against rape allegations.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nIn July 2017, he tweeted, \"There's an account saying that I fucked a 16-year-old 10 years ago when I was 23 but actually she was 19 don't listen to it.\"\n\nGrandmaison was referring in that tweet to a separate accusation made by a different person than the one that prompted Friday's statement, the podcaster told Newsweek.\n\nThat accusation dates back to 2005, according to archived blog posts that Grandmaison confirmed were written by him.\n\nIn one post, which has since been deleted, Grandmaison described meeting a girl from Canada online and engaging in a sexually explicit phone call before he knew she was 16 years old.\n\n\"If statutory rape was wrong then I didn't wanna be right,\" Grandmaison wrote in the post.\n\nWhen questioned about that blog entry, Grandmaison sent the following statement:\n\ni wrote the post in question over 10 years ago and deleted it within 6 months of writing it but people saved archived versions of the post and have been sending it around trying to imply that i had sex with her when she was 16 when in reality i was making light of the bad luck i experienced (i met her online but she didn't tell me that she was 16 until we first spoke on the phone - although to be fair it would have been legal via canadian law so she didn't even realize why i had to stop talking to her until after i explained that the age of consent in America is 18.\n\nFriday's statement also comes months after the podcast host was included in an October 2017 BuzzFeed piece on Breitbart and the far right.\n\nBuzzFeed reported that Grandmaison reached out to former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who Grandmaison interviewed on No Jumper in July 2016. According to BuzzFeed, Grandmaison contacted Yiannopoulos to suggest he look into a journalist who had accused her former boyfriend of abuse. The email reportedly began, \"first off i absolutely do not want credit for tipping you off to this.\"\n\nGrandmaison admitted to BuzzFeed that he contacted the editor, but claimed \"he didn't intend for [Yiannopoulos] to write about it.\"\n\nIn a video statement posted to Twitter in response to the BuzzFeed story, Grandmaison said he regretted interviewing the editor for his show. \"I was pretty fuckin' naive. I didn't even really realize how evil Breitbart's intentions for the world was.\"\n\nAdam22 in a Twitter video from 2017. Twitter/Adam22\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone's 2017 profile of Grandmaison, he was arrested as a teenager for fighting and graffiti. He also engaged in credit card fraud after dropping out of the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\n\"I learned that from a kid from the Czech Republic,\" he said. \"We went to some mall, and he bought me fucking fettuccine Alfredo on somebody else's credit card. I was like, 'All right, fuck school.' I just went crazy after that.\"",

                "body": "North Korea has suspended activity at its main nuclear site, according to recent satellite imagery and expert analysis that appeared to support Pyongyang's offers to solve the crisis on the Korean Peninsula diplomatically.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to accept an unprecedented invitation to meet North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un came after South Korean officials assured the Republican leader that Kim was willing to denuclearize in exchange for peace. As suspicions arose as to what North Korea's true intentions were, leading analysts Frank V. Pabian, Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. and Jack Liu found a major slowdown at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site in a report posted Friday to 38 North, a project of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nRelated: What Does North Korea's Kim Jong Un Want From Trump? Three Steps the U.S. Can Take to Solve Nuclear Crisis\n\n\"Imagery from early March had shown signs of continued tunneling excavations at the West Portal, including mining carts and significant amounts of new spoil deposits. Large groups of personnel were also noted in the open support areas serving the nuclear test site's Command Center. However, imagery from March 17 showed no evidence of tunneling operations or the presence of any personnel or vehicles at any of the support areas including those near the Command Center,\" the report read.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"This is an important development given efforts to establish high-level meetings between the United States, South Korea and North Korea. However, whether this is just a temporary development or whether it will continue over time is unclear,\" it added.\n\nImagery from March 2 shows a small group of personnel in the upper courtyard of the main administration area. By March 17, all sign of life and vehicles are gone, only three crates potentially related to the nearby greenhouse, which is used to grow food for staff. 38 North/DigitalGlobe\n\nThe Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site has been the venue of all six North Korean nuclear tests dating back to 2006. Located in the country's remote northeast, experts have used satellite imagery to carefully follow developments at the top-secret site, which most recently hosted a powerful hydrogen bomb test last September.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nIn the same New Year's speech that Kim indicated a willingness to restart dialogue with U.S.-backed South Korea, the young leader vowed to continue developing nuclear weapons and launching ballistic missiles, which were now capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Neither Kim nor his various state-run media outlets have announced a change in this policy, but North Korea has long maintained its weapons were only necessary for self-defense.\n\nSets of photographs taken at three main areas on March 2 and March 17 showed substantial signs that Kim may actually be pausing his nuclear ambitions to pursue diplomacy with his sworn enemies. At the West and North Portals, drainage was significantly reduced and tunnel excavation appeared to have come to a halt. Personnel vanished entirely from the main administrative area and command center.\n\nSatellite imagery from March 2 shows water drainage near the North Portal and signs of ongoing tunnel work near the West Portal. DigitalGlobe/38 North\n\nBy March 17, water drainage had been reduced near the North Portal and work appeared to have ceased by West Portal. DigitalGlobe/38 North\n\nThese close-ups of imagery from March 2 show two large groupings of security forces personnel in open areas associated with the command center, located about 3.7 miles from the tunnels. DigitalGlobe/38 North\n\nBy March 17, all people and vehicles were gone, but a lack of snowfall made it difficult to tell if there were tracks left behind. DigitalGlobe/38 North\n\nAfter meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, South Korean National Security Director Chung Eui-yong and his delegation flew to Washington on March 8 to meet his U.S. counterpart -- whose recent dismissal has experts concerned -- and deliver a personal invitation from the North Korean leader to Trump. Standing in front of the White House, Chung said Trump had accepted to become the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korea supreme leader.\n\nWhile last year saw a series of milestone military breakthroughs for North Korea, the early months of 2018 have brought diplomatic firsts instead. The U.S. has yet to formally play a role in the ongoing inter-Korean dialogue, however, and neither Washington nor Pyongyang have announced any concessions. Upcoming joint U.S.-South Korea military drills would also be a test for Kim, who has considered the exercises a threat to his own security in the past.",

Others said the women's former profession would give South Korean children the wrong impression, and perhaps influence them to also work in the adult industry too, AllKPop.com wrote.\n\nBut not everyone hated on them.

Leveraging the Sunburn perk, you can easily vaporize targets with explosive rounds. It's a great PvE gun with super-satisfying ammo. Considering Hand Cannon buffs are coming in May, we'd suggest making the investment now.Lion Rampant Titan Leg Armor [23 Light Shards]: The Jump Jets perk allows Titans to hover indefinitely. The added maneuverability allows you to put distance between yourself and enemies during raids or PvP. It's the closest we might ever get to the original Destiny's Twilight Garrison armor. Orpheus Rig Hunter Leg Armor [23 Light Shards]: Hunters have been asking for it for weeks, and now it's finally here. Orpheus Rig features the Uncanny Arrows perk, which offers Ability Energy for each enemy tethered by Shadowshot anchors. Simply put, this might be the best tether-based Exotic in all of Destiny 2. It sets up a practically endless string of Supers. Karnstein Armlets Warlock Gauntlets [23 Light Shards]: Its Vampire's Caress perk buffs melee attack resilience and mobility while highlighting injured enemies. Melee kills also restore health. This Exotic is only meaningful for a very specific type of Warlock, so we'd generally suggest passing on it unless you're trying to collect everything. Three Of Coins [31 Light Shards]: It equates to a 50 percent increase in the chance of Exotic drops after completing an activity. Without knowing the exact base chance, though, it's hard to know if this limited buff worth it. If you don't have one of the above Exotics, buy those instead.Fated Engram [97 Light Shards]: This Engram automatically generates an Exotic you don't already have. It's limited to one purchase per account per week.\n\nThose are all the Exotics Xur has this week. He'll be active through the Weekly Reset on Tuesday at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nDestiny 2 is available now on PS4, Xbox One and PC.

The supply list for the trip included 12 bales of hay, 10 watermelons, a bushel of apples, a case of honeydew melons and much more.\n\nThe elephant's trip started around 12:30 p.m. EDT Thursday and after about 20 hours on the road, Spike arrived at his new home and backed out of his crate fairly quickly, Bryan Amaral, senior curator at the Smithsonian, told Newsweek.\n\nSpike the elephant at his new home Smithsonian's National Zoo, he arrived Friday morning March 23, 2018.

Elephants are transported in crates that have to be lifted onto the bed of a truck using a crane, Amaral said.\n\nThat truck is operated by a driver who specializes in animal transport, in Spike's case the driver had more than 30 years of experience and specialized in elephant transport. It helps that the crate isn't a totally new environment for the animal, \"The elephant is, over time, trained to go in the crate be comfortable in the crate,\" Amaral said.\n\nThe crate is stocked with food and water usually, and for Spike's transport, a camera that streamed live video during his trip. The stream went to professionals following him in what's called a \"chase car.\" A chase team for an animal transport like this one is usually made up of spare drivers, animal care staff and a veterinarian, just in case one is needed.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThey follow the truck carrying the elephant and monitor the animal the entire time from afar and through welfare checks conducted during stops for human and elephant snack and water breaks alike.\n\nWhile a trip like this wouldn't be harmful, it can sometimes stress the animal, so making decisions about when to stop and when to keep driving is key. \"You want to limit the amount of time that the animal is in the crate and on the road,\" Amaral said.\n\n\"There's space where it can take a step or two forward, or a step or two backward, but it's limited in space because that's safer,\" Amaral said, adding that the size of the crate varies depending on the size of the elephant. \"Almost like your dog in your kennel at home, you want to have an appropriately sized kennel.\"\n\nSpike was moved from Busch Gardens Tampa Bay to the Smithsonian's National Zoo. He arrived March 23, 2018. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay\n\nUnloading the elephant Friday morning was similar to the loading process that happened 20 hours prior but in reverse. The crate we removed from the truck and secured at the new location. \"Once the crate is secured to our load chute we then open the doors and the elephant typically backs out,\" Amaral said.\n\nSpike is doing well so far; he's eating and drinking and even has a professional with him from his old home to help him acclimate.\n\nHe's there to breed with another elephant living at the zoo named Maharani who is nine years his junior. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan approved the two for breeding to keep the population of elephants diverse and self-sustaining, according to Smithsonian's news release.\n\nVisitors to the zoo who want to see Spike will have to wait a few weeks. Spike's currently being quarantined to ensure his health, and that of the other elephants at the zoo, remains good. His quarantine could last up to 30 days but once he's given a sustained clean bill of health, he'll be roaming and hanging out with the other elephants at the zoo.",

They were approved by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).\n\nIn a world with a booming population that is consuming ever more resources -- from food to water -- the exploitation of the natural world has become normalized in order to meet demand. But the new research indicates that no region is faring well as a result.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nAerial view of deforestation in the Western Amazon region of Brazil on September 22, 2017.

CARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAcross the world, habitats are being destroyed, the oceans are being polluted, water sources are running dry and many animal species are dwindling. And in the coming years, climate change will only put more pressure on the world's biodiversity, scientists noted in the reports.\n\nAmong many findings, the research found that in the Americas there has been a 50 percent decrease in renewable freshwater per person since the 1960s. In Europe, 42 percent of terrestrial animal and plant species with known trends have declined in population size in the last decade.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nIf current trends continue, the report predicts that the Americas will lose 15 percent of their plants and animals by 2050 and the Asia-Pacific region will run out of fish stocks for commercial fishing by 2048. Meanwhile, Africa may lose half of some mammal and bird species by 2100.\n\n\"Biodiversity and nature's contributions to people sound, to many people, academic and far removed from our daily lives,\" Robert Watson, chair of the IPBES said in a statement.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth -- they are the bedrock of our food, clean water and energy,\" Watson said. \"They are at the heart not only of our survival, but of our cultures, identities and enjoyment of life. We must act to halt and reverse the unsustainable use of nature -- or risk not only the future we want, but even the lives we currently lead.\"",

While the original game was difficult enough to beat, the developer has recently updated it to add even more rooms, secret passages, and weapons, as well as a higher difficulty mode. If you're just getting started in the game and haven't managed to beat it or aren't even sure what the steps are to escape, we've put together a complete guide of tips and strategies for completing each part of the game and beating Granny.

The object of the game is to escape the house alive. This can be tricky because the crazy Granny that lives in the house listens to every sound. If she hears you, she'll hunt you down and attack you. You get five chances or days to escape the house before Granny finally puts an end to you. To escape the house, you have to complete a series of tasks -- the main one being to deactivate the door alarm and unlock all the security items that bar it. We've listed all the objects you'll need and steps for beating the game below.\n\nControls: How Do I Move And Interact With Objects?\n\nThe controls are kind of primitive in this game and so they can sometimes be difficult to figure out. Here are a few basics you need to know.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nHow To Move - On the left-hand side of the screen you have a white circle that is your joystick/controller. Use it to move.\n\nHow To Look Around - If you want to look around the room swipe around the screen in the direction you want to look.\n\nHow To Pick Up Objects Or Interact With Stuff - In the middle of your game screen, you'll notice a small white dot. If you want to open a drawer, grab an item, climb under a bed or interact with objects in some other way, you will have to move your joystick until the white dot is centered on the object of interest. If the object is something you can pick up, open or close, a hand will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Tap it to do the action. Sometimes a different icon will appear in that corner showing how you can interact with the object. Simply tap the interactive icon to complete the action or else navigate elsewhere.\n\nHow To Drop Objects - anytime you have an object in your hand, you can drop it by tapping the word \"Drop\" at the bottom of the game screen.\n\nCrouching and Standing - you can change from crouching to standing in the game by tapping the icon of a person in the left-hand corner of the game screen\n\n'Granny' Horror Game Guide: Tips, Steps & Strategy For Beating The Game\n\nAs mentioned above, to beat the game, you'll have to unbolt the front door and deactivate the main alarm. While this task might sound simple, there are several steps you have to complete to do it. Here are the objects you'll need to find and steps for using them.\n\nItems Needed\n\nThe Cutting pliers are one of seven tools or keys you'll need to find to beat the Granny Game. Player.One\n\nThere are seven main objects and keys you'll need to complete the game, four of which are keys. You can only hold one item at a time and some items will have to be used before others. I've listed them in the order I used them. Some of them may be used in any order though.\n\nCutting Pliers - you will use these twice. First, use these the door alarm to make both lights turn green. Then use them to cut wires in the circuit box found on the basement wall.\n\nPadlock Key (Blue) - use this key on the padlock on the front door. It will make the top bar blocking in fall down.\n\nHammer - used to break the wood barring the bottom of the front door. You'll have to break the wood on both ends to get it completely off the door.\n\nAlarm Code - this is a piece of yellow paper with the word \"code\" on it. You'll use it on the top lock of the door.\n\nSafe Key (Gold) - find this to unlock the safe found in the basement. The master key will be found in here.\n\nMaster Key (Red) - the Master Key is the final key you'll use to unlock the main door handle and escape\n\nWeapons Key (Wooden) - unlocks the weapons locker found in the secret passageway (guide for finding weapons room is here.) If you unlock it, you can grab a tranquilizer gun to shoot at Granny that puts her out for a while.\n\nWhere To Find Tools and Keys Tools and Keys in the Granny game can be found in many places including cabinents, toilets, dresser drawers and more. Player.One\n\nThe only object that has a specific location in the Granny game is the Master Key, which is found in the in the basement. Every other item can be found in a variety of places and the locations of the objects change every time you start a new day. To find objects, you need to search any cabinet or piece of furniture with a drawer or door can potentially hold an item you need. This includes things like kitchen cabinets (upper and lower), the microwave, dressers, china cabinets, and so forth. Various household items and furniture will sometimes hold objects too. For example, toilets, sinks, chairs, and benches. The door code can be one of the trickier objects to find because it is a note that can be stickied to a door or wall as well. If you are looking for an object, move quickly through the room scanning possible object locations. Open any doors and drawers you see, but do it carefully or granny will hear. If she's coming for you, move elsewhere and return to that place later.\n\nWhat If I Have To Drop Something? Will It Be Where I Left It?\n\nSometimes you'll find an object before you need it and you have the option to either pick it up or leave it. If you drop it, it'll remain where you've left it till you die or come back. Just keep in mind, if you choose to grab the item, at some point you'll have to drop it, which will cause noises that Granny can hear. It most cases it's best to leave an object behind if you don't need it yet and just remember where it's stored.",

                "body": "The Trump administration indicted members of an Iranian hacker network on Friday, claiming that the group was responsible for \"one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns\" the U.S. has prosecuted.\n\nOfficials said the hackers allegedly targeted dozens of U.S. universities, companies and government agencies -- as well as the United Nations -- and stole around 31 terabytes of data and intellectual property from entities worldwide.\n\nThe group was allegedly hired by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a small division of Iran's military tasked with defending the country's Islamic Revolution. The IRGC is controlled by Tehran's most hardline religious leaders, and often collects information on foreign entities. Nine of the 10 people named in the indictment were connected to the Mabna Institute, an Iranian tech firm that allegedly hacks on behalf of the IRGC.\n\nIranian hackers have often been viewed as less skilled and less tenacious than hackers from countries like China and Russia. But Friday's indictment, together with recent research, suggests that this is changing quickly.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"They're more sophisticated than the other players,\" Robert Katz, executive director of the Cyber Science Institute, told Newsweek.\n\n\"They had a major coordinated attack that did damage to our financial institutions on Wall Street. That was 2012, that was before we saw Russia being organized. Shortly after that, they had a physical attack against Saudi Aramco. They destroyed computers and turned them into paperweights,\" Katz described.\n\n\"All of those are very sophisticated compared to all of the unsophisticated stuff we've seen from North Korea and the outright silly stuff we've seen from Russia. The Russia stuff was just a basic phishing attack,\" Katz continued. Iranian hackers also attacked a U.S. dam in 2016, an attack officials at the time called \"a frightening new frontier of cybercrime.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nA Department of Justice employee put up a poster of the seven indicted hackers prior to a news conference for announcing a law enforcement action on March 24, 2016, in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nChina, North Korea, Iran and Russia are among the world's biggest state sponsors of cyber attacks. But experts say that only Chinese hackers steal more intellectual property than Iranian hackers. Russian hackers, meanwhile, are often easy to track.\n\nReports suggest that Iran, however, has developed a sophisticated network of hackers who are skilled and trained in cyberespionage, and who often go undetected.\n\nA report released in January by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace claimed that cyber incidents involving Iran have been among the most sophisticated and costly in the history of the Internet.\n\n\"Offensive cyber operations have become a core tool of Iranian statecraft, providing Tehran less risky opportunities to gather information and retaliate against perceived enemies at home and abroad,\" the report stated, adding that the hackers often work on behalf of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence or the IRGC.\n\n\"Though Iran is generally perceived as a third-tier cyber power -- lacking the capabilities of China, Russia, and the United States -- it has effectively exploited the lack of preparedness of targets inside and outside Iran,\" the report continued.\n\nRussian hackers have garnered a lot of attention over the past year, especially in the wake of the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee by hackers believed to be affiliated with the Russian government. But this has drawn attention away from Iranian hackers. Some cybersecurity experts say the decision to target Iranian hackers demonstrates that the U.S. government is starting to take the threat seriously.\n\n\"A country such as Iran can gain through intellectual property cyber theft what it could never develop through its own investments, years of development, and human knowledge and expertise. The country can gain the cyber espionage expertise through an ecosystem of 'hackers for hire' willing to steal on Iran's behalf for a fee,\" Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm McAfee, told Newsweek\n\n\"At its most basic level, the theft of intellectual property is a theft of the future. It's a theft of future national security, future business for companies, future wealth for a nation's communities, future high paying jobs and future standards of living for a nation's citizens,\" Grobman continued.\n\nThis isn't the first time the U.S. government has indicted foreigners in response to cyber attacks. Special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian operatives and three entitites -- including the notorious Internet Research Agency -- for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and the Obama administration indicted members of China's military in response to attacks on U.S. companies by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. The U.S. also indicted seven Iranian hackers in 2016 for cyber attacks on a dam and several banks.",

                "body": "Craigslist's personals section shut down today in response to the passage of H.R. 1865, also called the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) bill, the company announced Friday.\n\n\"U.S. Congress just passed HR 1865, 'FOSTA', seeking to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully,\" Craigslist said in a statement. \"Any tool or service can be misused. We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline.\"\n\nCraigslist's personals section featured several categories including \"strictly platonic,\" \"women seeking women,\" \"women seeking men,\" \"men seeking women,\" \"men seeking men,\" \"misc romance\" and \"casual encounters.\" When a user clicks on any personals link now, they are directed to Craigslist's statement about the section shutting down.\n\nThe FOSTA bill easily passed the Senate with a 97-2 vote this week. Congress put some of the blame for the ongoing sex trafficking problem directly on websites like Craigslist.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230; commonly known as the 'Communications Decency Act of 1996') was never intended to provide legal protection to websites that unlawfully promote and facilitate prostitution and websites that facilitate traffickers in advertising the sale of unlawful sex acts with sex trafficking victims,\" the bill said. \"(2) websites that promote and facilitate prostitution have been reckless in allowing the sale of sex trafficking victims and have done nothing to prevent the trafficking of children and victims of force, fraud, and coercion; and (3) clarification of such section is warranted to ensure that such section does not provide such protection to such websites.\"\n\nWhile the decision was lauded by politicians across the aisle, not everyone is happy about the passage of FOSTA. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said FOSTA is \"a bill that silences online speech by forcing internet platforms to censor their users.\"\n\nThe EFF, a nonprofit that defends civil liberties online, said the amendment to Section 230 is particularly worrying because it's \"the most important law protecting free speech online. Section 230 protects online platforms from liability for some types of speech by their users. Without Section 230, the Internet would look very different.\"\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nSome Craigslist personals users quickly moved to other sections of the online classifieds website to rant about the section closing down while others started using other verticals for postings normally found on personals. In the rants & raves section of Craigslist NY there are several listings Friday that would, in theory, appear in the personals section including \"Young Sexy Dark Black Girl Needed,\" \"lets have fun,\" \"sexy dress up and roleplay\" and much more.\n\n\"WOW, looks like CL has closed down personal ad areas. Now where do we go if we want to find sex or whatever indulgence it is you were looking for? We need a free, easy to use, private way of connecting. Help! Let's pass the word and find a new gathering place,\" one user wrote.\n\nCraigslist said while the personals section is shutting down, it may not be gone forever.\n\n\"Hopefully we can bring them back someday. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through Craigslist, we wish you every happiness,\" the company said.\n\nAs pointed out by USA Today, Reddit also took steps after the bill passed. Reddit said users may not use the platform to \"solicit or facilitate any transaction\" that involves firearms, drugs, \"paid services involving physical sexual contact,\" stolen goods and personal information.\n\n\"When considering a gift or transaction of goods or services not prohibited by this policy, keep in mind that Reddit is not intended to be used as a marketplace and takes no responsibility for any transactions individual users might decide to undertake in spite of this,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe FOSTA bill now awaits approval from President Donald Trump.",

Getty Images\n\nThere are teams that find unfortunate ways to concede a goal and then there are teams that concede a goal without even realizing they have done so.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the Carolina Hurricanes belong to the latter category. On Thursday night, with just over eight minutes of their game against the Arizona Coyotes played, Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward positioned himself to make a save and planted his leg entirely into his goal.\n\nHowever, play was stopped after it became apparent the puck was missing, before a linesman managed to pry it free from Ward's right skate.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nUnbeknown to the goalie, the puck had got stuck in his skate, meaning Ward scored a goal by stretching his right leg into the net.\n\n\"That first one was probably one of the weirdest goals I've ever seen,\" Ward's teammate Jeff Skinner was quoted as saying by ESPN.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nThe NHL situation room reviewed the bizarre incident and eventually awarded the goal to Coyotes defenseman Alex Gologoski, who had sent the puck around the boards before it got jammed into Ward's skate.\n\n\"Upon review of the play, the puck is caught in the goaltender's skate,\" announced referee Dan O'Rourke.\n\n\"His skate crosses the line completely. So we have a goal.\"\n\nThe incident came after the Hurricanes had gone 2-0 up thanks to goals from Skinner and Valentin Zykov and sparked a revival for the Coyotes, who tied the game with 22 seconds left in the first period thanks to Clayton Keller.\n\nJosh Archibald drew the Coyotes level after Phil Di Giuseppe had put the Hurricanes in front again, before Nick Cousins and Gologoski scored either side of a Teuvo Teravainen goal in an action-packed second period.\n\nIn the final 20 minutes, Zykov and Skinner both claimed their second personal goals of the game to give the Hurricanes a 6-5 win.",

For those who might have forgotten \"Johnny Football,\" he's the former Heisman Trophy-winner and Cleveland Brown who fell out of favor with the league amid substance abuse issues, middling on-field play and allegations of domestic violence in a case that was ultimately dismissed.\n\nSharpe pointed out Friday that despite all these issues, Manziel is seemingly getting another shot in the NFL unlike a certain quarterback who couldn't get a contract last season amid his decision to kneel in protest during the national anthem. That quarterback is, of course, Colin Kaepernick.\n\nManziel's kind-of tryout happened at the University of San Diego pro day, where he threw to wide receivers who have a chance of getting drafted late in the NFL Draft.\n\n\"It's just amazing to me that 13 teams -- now it's hard for me to believe that 13 teams would show up to see guys that are slated to go in the sixth, seventh round -- it's hard for me to believe that they showed up for just those two young men, those receivers,\" Sharpe said on the Fox Sports show Undisputed. \"Johnny Manziel gets afforded privileges that we know one quarterback that sat out of the NFL last year did not get afforded. And that's one Colin Kaepernick.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nSharpe gave Kaepernick, who had more success in the NFL than Manziel, some advice: Try to do the same thing as Manziel, floating the idea of Kaepernick throwing at a workout for a historically black college.\n\n\"For me, if I'm Kap, I'm going to find somebody that has a pro day that has some receivers that are slated to go in the later rounds because I don't want to be accused of upstaging someone's workout and I go to them,\" said Sharpe, who played in the NFL for more than a decade. \"So while [NFL teams are] there looking at those guys, they can see how I spin the football and that I'm more than capable of playing in the NFL.\"\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nSome accused the NFL of blackballing Kaepernick after his protest against the oppression of black people in America. His decision to kneel was met with praise by some and inspired many others to do the same but also drew anger from others, chiefly the commander-in-chief himself, President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Sharpe seemed to think that amid Manziel's insistence he is a reformed man and a generally well-received workout, he has upped his chances at getting back into the league.\n\n\"Prior to this I thought there was a 2-3 percent chance,\" Sharpe said on Undisputed. \"After this, it's reported 13 teams showed up, I think there's somewhere around a 10-15 percent chance.\"",

                "body": "On Saturday, March 24, I'll be in Washington, D.C., marching with the Parkland students. But I'll also be marching for 22-year-old Stephon Clark, a father of two in Sacramento who was shot and killed in his backyard by police who said they thought his cell phone was a weapon. I'll also be marching for 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey, who died after she was shot at her Maryland high school. And I'll march for the 96 Americans who are shot and killed every day, and hundreds more who are wounded, and whose deaths and traumas receive little to no media attention.\n\nFrom California to Maryland to Parkland, there is no community in this nation that remains untouched by gun violence. And on Saturday, we must set an example for our lawmakers by rising up to meet the moment, and to finally demand they end this national crisis.\n\nFor each of us, there comes a moment when you can no longer stay quiet. Mine was the day after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 that stole the lives of 20 children and six educators. As a mom of five, I couldn't accept an America in which first graders and teachers are gunned down in the sanctity of a classroom. But for so many Americans, they don't have a choice on when enough was enough. For countless families, and particularly black families -- black children are 10 times more likely to be victims of gun homicide than white children -- this is a crisis that has felt urgent for decades.\n\nActivists rallied at the Florida State Capitol to call for action on gun control. Getty Images\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nI'm ashamed that it took me until Sandy Hook to open my eyes to how many Americans are affected by gun violence every single day in this country.\n\nSince I founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America five years ago, we've made enormous strides. With a chapter in every state, and millions of supporters and volunteers who go toe-to-toe with the gun lobby every day, we outsmart the NRA and we win. Our volunteers have helped pass laws requiring a background check on every gun sale in eight states, passed life-saving legislation to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers in 25 states, and helped pass Red Flag Laws that allow family and police to procure temporary gun restraining orders in five states. It's been an exhausting and exhilarating five years.\n\nBut here's the thing about growing a movement -- it takes time. It can take years to build a solid ground game -- but then the movement surges forward rapidly. Since the Parkland shooting, we've seen a surge like never before. More than 140,000 people have reached out to us wanting to volunteer, including thousands of students who became the first members of Students Demand Action, a new, student-led initiative fighting gun violence in communities across the country. More than 1.7 million people have joined us as online supporters. And across the country, students are rising up -- from elementary school to college-aged Americans -- demanding change.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nIt's inspiring to see so many new leaders in this movement spring up all at once -- inspiring all of us to be bolder, louder and even more fearless as we demand our safety. It's too late for the 17 people who were killed on February 14 in Parkland, and for the hundreds of thousands of Americans shot and killed or wounded by gun violence as lawmakers failed to act, but make no mistake -- gun violence is preventable. Stronger gun laws work, and the research proves it.\n\nJoin us in Washington, D.C., or find your local march to let your lawmakers know our lives are worth more than NRA dollars. Lawmakers will no longer get away with sending their \"thoughts and prayers\" without the promise of action. We demand they act to prevent gun violence, or we will throw them out of office.\n\nTogether, we can change America's gun violence crisis and ensure that future generations can live without fear of gun violence.\n\nShannon Watts is the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a grassroots movement to prevent gun violence, and a board member for Emerge America, an organization that trains progressive women to run for office.",

They would also be capable of learning how best to deliver packages based on human interaction.\n\n\"In some examples, when in the learning context, a human operator may interact with the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) in order to 'teach' the UAV how to react given certain gestures, circumstances, and the like,\" the patent reads.\n\nOne of the images attached to the patent shows a man shouting and waving his hands at a drone outside a house. Another picture shows that drones would launch from nearby delivery trucks instead of directly from the factory. Amazon has been awarded a patent that allows its delivery drones to learn and understand human interactions. United States Patent and Trademark Office\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAmazon delivered its first package by drone in December, 2016 under the name Amazon Air. It shipped an Amazon Fire TV and some popcorn to Cambridge, England, in just 13 minutes.\n\nAmazon is no stranger to ambitious ideas. Earlier this year, the company was granted a patent for a smart mirror that could show you how you would look in clothing purchases. Using a combination of cameras and projectors, the mirror can theoretically map your body and let you \"try on\" the clothes.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, Amazon was even awarded a patent for drone 'bee-hive' towers that would become the base of completely independent delivery UAVs. Instead of returning to a truck, like in the most recent patent, these drones would operate without human assistance. Amazon describes the tower concept as a \"multilevel fulfillment center for unmanned aerial vehicles.\"",

The stop concludes the soon-to-be-married couple's paired visits to the United Kingdom's four nations.\n\nUnlike the couple's previous joint ventures, their trek to Northern Ireland was not made public ahead of time. The region prohibits royal visits from being announced due to security reasons, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nThe pair, who are expected to tie the knot May 19, had a long list of activities to tend to during their visit. But their day started at an event held at the Eikon Centre that honored the second year of Amazing the Space, which is a youth-led peace-building initiative.

Prince Harry and Markle then watched performances put on by local schools that aimed to recognize the arts' ability to unite a variety of communities. The couple also listened to the school-aged children's thoughts on the reconciliation work occurring across Northern Ireland.\n\nThe next stop on the engaged couple's itinerary was a visit to the Crown Liquor Saloon, one of Belfast's oldest buildings. In doing so, Prince Harry and Markle learned about its history from National Trust staffers. The duo was later spotted greeting fans on Great Victoria Street and visiting Catalyst Inc's Belfast campus to speak with entrepreneurs.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle made an unannounced trip to Northern Ireland.

In a new Instagram video posted on Thursday, Cardi asked Uncle Sam directly, \"What ya doing with my fucking money?\"\n\nCardi had an incredibly successful 2017 that included her multi-platinum hit \"Bodak Yellow,\" four other chart-toppers on Billboard's Hot 100, two Grammy nominations and an iHeartRadio Music Award for Best New Hip-Hop Artist.\n\nOf course, all those accomplishments equated to an influx of income for Cardi. But she wasn't too thrilled with the massive cut the government took, especially since she doesn't have proof the money is going to where the IRS claims. \"When you donate to a kid from a foreign country, they give you updates on what they're doing with your donation,\" Cardi said.\n\n\"I want to know what you're doing with my tax money because I'm from New York and the streets is always dirty. We was voted the dirtiest city in America.

The tests were conducted by British military chemical weapons scientists.\n\nSergei Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were found collapsed on a bench in the southern U.K. city of Salisbury on March 4. They are believed to have been poisoned by the Soviet-engineered Novichok nerve agent.

Skripal and his daughter are being treated \"on the basis they would wish to be kept alive,\" the doctor said.\n\nThough both Skripals are currently stable, Williams said: \"It is not inconceivable that their condition could rapidly deteriorate.\" A British policeman who found the Skripals was also hospitalized after being exposed to the toxin, but was released on Thursday after two weeks of treatment.\n\nThe only other person known to have been exposed to Novichok is Soviet chemical weapons scientist Andrei Zheleznyakov. In 1987, a malfunctioning chemical protection suit exposed him to the agent while he was working in the lab. Though he was treated by Soviet doctors, Zheleznyakov never recovered. After weeks in a coma and months unable to walk, he suffered several years of deteriorating health and died from a seizure in 1993.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nBy the time he died, the nerve agent destroyed Zheleznyakov's nervous system and left him battling cirrhosis, toxic hepatitis, nerve damage and epilepsy. Another scientist that worked on the Novichok program, Vladimir Uglev, has claimed that there is no antidote to the nerve agent, and that Skripals will die if they are taken off life support.\n\nA still image from CCTV footage recorded on February 27, 2018 shows Sergei Skripal buying groceries at a convenience store in Salisbury, U.K. AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe British government has said it is \"highly likely\" that the attack was a Russian effort to assassinate Skripal, a former Soviet and Russian double agent who settled in the U.K. after being released from a Russian jail in a 2010 prisoner exchange. Russia has denied any involvement in what is believed to be the first offensive use of such a weapon in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\n\nIn response to the poisoning, Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the country. The move was mirrored by Russia days later. A war of words has developed between the two countries, with other European states voicing their support for the U.K., raising the possibility of more EU sanctions for Moscow.\n\nJudge Williams said an unidentified analyst from Porton Down had given evidence that blood samples taken from the Skripals indicated exposure to a nerve agent. \"The samples tested positive for the presence of a Novichok class nerve agent or closely related agent,\" his ruling said.",

The launch also punched a temporary hole in the Earth's atmosphere, according to a new study.\n\nMost rockets follow a curved trajectory after lift off to deliver their payload into orbit -- usually at an altitude of around 120 miles high -- which creates a V-shaped shock wave.\n\nHowever, when the Falcon 9 took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, it was able to take an almost directly vertical path towards its final destination because its payload -- a Taiwanese Earth observation satellite known as FORMOSAT‐5 -- was unusually light.\n\nThis created an extremely rare, perfectly circular shock wave, the first such event recorded after a rocket launch. It was the largest rocket shock wave the team had ever seen, researchers from the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan said in the study, which was published in the journal Space Weather.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nIn this handout provided by NASA, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches from pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 3, 2017 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

They also examined how expressive writing affects the harmful effects of stress, adding to the growing body of research suggesting that journal writing improves mental health.\n\nRelated: People who are stressed say 'really' and 'incredibly' a lot\n\n\"We've been taught for years that focusing on the positive could lead us to success,\" Brynne DiMenichi, a psychology doctoral candidate at Rutgers University-Newark, told Newsweek via email. \"Our results suggest that thinking critically about a past failure could actually lead to better outcomes.

One group was asked to write about the plot of a movie they recently watched. The other group was assigned to a more personal task, in which they wrote about a difficult time in their life that ended up in failure. To understand the participants' levels of stress, their salivary cortisol levels were assessed. Both groups had comparable levels at the start of the study.\n\nRelated: Show me how you really feel: Hugging to the left or right reveals your true emotions, says study\n\nHowever, upon completing a commonly used procedure called the Trier Social Stress Test, the group that wrote about personal failures had lower cortisol levels than the group assigned to writing about a movie. But the writing itself didn't affect stress levels, which surprised DiMenichi.\n\n\"Instead, we found that, in terms of preparation for stress, writing about a past failure didn't accept baseline stress levels but instead actually better physiologically prepared individuals for a new stressor, and subsequently, better improved performance while under stress,\" she explained.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nBut applying these findings to real-world environments is difficult because many other factors are at play during stressful situations. In the future, the team hopes to get a better glimpse into what there specifically is about writing that may help improve performance. To do so, they plan to examine how writing about failures affects actual brain processing when completing a new task.",

                "title": "Here's why United Airlines paid a savvy woman $10,000 for a plane seat",
                "body": "A United Airlines passenger was paid $10,000 in travel credit to give up her seat on an overbooked flight at Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C on Thursday. Allison Preiss, who live-tweeted her experience with the embattled airline, left many on social media wondering: will they be getting a pricey voucher next time their seat is bumped?\n\nSadly, not likely. While a United Airlines representative told Newsweek that the voucher is per the company's policy, it is the highest voucher available and is only issued in extreme circumstances. The voucher limit creation came amid yet another crisis period for the 92-year-old airline.\n\nThe $10,000 limit was implemented in April 2017, when United Airlines took a dip in stock after a bloodied passenger was violently dragged off a plane in viral video. At the time, United rolled out a slew of other changes and said it was boosting its offering to ensure that such an incident \"never happened again.\"\n\nOf course, it was also to be competitive: Delta Airlines had quickly capitalized on its rival's PR nightmare, raising its policy to include remissions of up to $9,950 shortly after the video went viral.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nUnited Airlines declined to comment on what made Thursday's case particularly extreme, but it does come after a string of new public relations disasters for the embattled airline. Earlier this month, a dog died on one of its flights after a flight attendant ordered it into an overhead bin. A few days later, the airline accidently shipped a dog to the wrong destination. The airline's treatment of animals was condemned across social media and even prompted new animal welfare legislation to be brought forth in Congress.\n\nClearly, the company didn't need another disaster, and Preiss, who works as a public relations professional, had thousands of followers listening to her frustrations with the company.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nJames Schummer, an economics professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, told Newsweek that the PR disasters likely influenced the airline's decision to hit the maximum payout.\n\n\"I'm sure United is compensating more generously right now due to their recent bad press,\" he said. \"Most people will not get a payout as big as this one. If United had offered a $5,000 voucher from the start, someone else would have stepped forward.\"\n\nPreiss, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment, also had the savvy to negotiate. When the airline offered her $1,000 in travel vouchers, she demanded cash. It was only then that the $10,000 offer came up. That was a wise move, according to Schummer.\n\n\"When you are forcibly bumped from a flight, the law entitles you to cash compensation for anything more than a one hour delay,\" Schummer said. \"In that case, a good negotiation strategy is to start off by insisting on cash compensation, because the airline would rather offer you a larger amount in travel vouchers than in cash. It sounds like this passenger did exactly that.\"\n\nSo, if you are ever on an overbooked flight, remember that you're most likely in a bargaining position. And, keep in mind, it could always be worse. Much worse.",

Bush, would replace military general H.R. McMaster.

                "body": "Started playing the Granny Horror Game but having trouble finding rooms and items you need? Check out our complete walkthrough of Granny's new, larger house along with tips for finding objects you need in it, here.\n\nThe Granny horror game has become somewhat of a sensation since its December release on the Apple App and Google Play store and has continued to grow in popularity every time the developer launches a new update. The most recent update not only added new weapons and a more difficult gameplay mode, it also brought expansions to the size of the house, making it even creepier and more difficult to manage. If you are new to the Granny horror game, you may be having a little difficulty figuring out where everything is and how to complete the required tasks for breaking free before Granny finds and brains you. For those hoping to get a better handle on the house's new layout, we've provided a complete walkthrough or cheat list for each level of the house from the ground floor to second level, basement, and hidden passageways. Check it all out below, along with a few tips for find objects you'll throughout the game. Additionally, if you are looking for a strategy guide with tips for beating the Granny, you can check out write up, here.\n\nGranny Game Walkthrough: Cheat List Of Every Room and Object In The House Of Horrors\n\nThe ground floor stairs to Granny's house are found just outside the room you start in. Player.One\n\nThe Granny horror house is made of three distinct floors - ground floor, upstairs and basement. There are a number of different stairways in the house (some of them hidden) that will get you to the various rooms. The main thing to keep in mind when moving around Granny's house is that all the levels wind around. This means rooms are laid out in a circular fashion and you can usually get to every room through a connected outer hallway or through doorways inside of the rooms. Each time you start a new game or day, you'll begin in an upstairs room, outside of which, are the stairs to the first or ground floor. Here is a detailed walkthrough of each room by Floor Level. You can also check out a video walkthrough at the bottom of the post.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the WorldGround/First Floor\n\nThe kitchen is one of several rooms on the first floor of the Granny horror house. Player.One\n\nYou can get to the ground floor from the basement or the second story of the house. If you are coming out of the room you started in, you'll see the stairs ahead on the left. Once down the stairs, these are the rooms you'll see.\n\nFoyer with Barred Front Door - once down the stairs you'll be in the Foyer. The contains the main door you are trying to escape through, but it has been barred up and has an electric alarm on it. There are doors to the right and left of this room that wind around to each other room on the ground floor.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nLiving & Dining Rooms - The door to the left of the barred door will take you to a set of living spaces conjoined rooms that wind around. The first room has an armchair and lamp. The second, more living room furniture and a bookcase/cabinet. This room then leads into dining room area with table and chairs and another cabinet. These like dresser drawers, these cabinets can be opened will sometimes have a tool you need in it.\n\nKitchen - Off that room is a kitchen with a large table, counters, and sink. Over and under the counter are cabinets that can be open. There is also a microwave on the counter. If you go through the final doorway, you'll be taken back out to the hall with the barred door.\n\nStaircases - In the foyer with the barred door, you'll see two staircases. Once goes upstairs (you begin the game in the first room up there) and one leads to the basement.\n\n2nd Floor (Upstairs)\n\nThe bathroom on the second floor will sometimes hold objects you need. Player.One\n\nAs with the base floor, the upstairs portion of the house winds around a connected landing. You can get to each room of the upstairs by just continuing down the hallway/landing. Here's each room found upstairs.\n\nBedroom 1: You start out the game each time in what appears to be a bedroom. Here are the items in the room and how you can use them. You can also use similar items in other rooms, the same way\n\nBed - this looks like a low table because it has no bedding on it but you can climb under it to hide from Granny if you hear her coming.\n\nTable with Vase - I'm not sure if the vase is useful in this game. You can pick it up, but I'd advise staying away from the table altogether as it's easily knocked over, alerting Granny of your location.\n\nLong Table - this table doesn't serve any real purpose. The number of days you have or chances remaining to get out of the house is carved into the wood.\n\nDresser - top drawers can be searched and will sometimes contain a hidden item you need. Any dressers, cabinets or other items with doors in Granny's house can hold objects (ex: keys, hammer, wire cutters)\n\nWardrobe - you can open this and climb in to hide from Granny -- just shut the door behind you!\n\nBathroom - to the left of the main room is the bathroom. There is a toilet, tub, and sink. The toilet will sometimes have a key hiding in it.\n\nBedrooms 2 & 3 - Down the hall, to the left of the starting room, you'll find a large pair of rooms joined by a walkthrough closet. Here's what's in each of those.\n\nFirst Room - bed, dresser, lamp\n\nWalkthrough Closet/Hidden Room - when you enter this room from the first one, on the left you'll see a tall stack of what looks like boxes or cushions. Walk/ push through it and you 'll reveal a hidden location in the house. I'll go into detail on those further down the list.\n\nSecond Room - as you continue through the walkthrough closet you'll get to the adjoined room. This room has a bed, table, chair, and dresser.\n\nIn the walkthrough closet, there is a stack of boxes blocking a hidden passage to the basement of Granny's house. Player.One\n\nHidden Closet Rooms & Basement Stairs - if you return to the walkthrough closet, against one of the walls you'll see what looks like a bookshelf, but if you look around all sides you'll see an entrance to a hidden portion of the house. Walking through the hidden space,, you'll enter a small room with a table in the corner. There is a vase or some other object on top. To the back of this room, you'll see some stairs that go down. Here are the rooms located down the stairs:\n\nHidden Stair Set 1 - once down the first set of stairs you'll enter a small landing that has a dresser in it. In the far corner is the second set of stairs.\n\nHidden Stair Set 2 - down the second set of stairs you'll enter another small landing. There is a door to the left. To the right, another set of stairs\n\nHidden Stair Set 3 - go down the third set of stairs and you'll see a dark room in front of you. Walk through it to get to the basement.\n\nAttic - at the very end of the upstairs landing, you'll see a narrow door. If you go through it, you'll see yet another set of stairs. Go up these to an attic room that looks like a sewing room. It has a mannequin, dresser, and closet in it. Off to one side of the room, you'll see a doorway that has a jail cell in it.\n\nBasement\n\nOn the basement wall hangs the breaker box conneted to the front door alarm. Player.One\n\nThe basement is a large a creepy area of the house. You can get to the basement from the ground floor foyer or through the secret passageway described above. There are a few specific spaces to be aware of in the basement.\n\nBreaker Room - When you enter the basement you'll see a breaker box on the wall. Inside are the wires you'll have to snip to deactivate the front door alarm.\n\nStairway Passage - Wind around the corner from the breaker room and you'll see a room with another set of stairs. These stairs take you up through the secret passageway. Beside the stairs is a bench that will sometimes have an important tool on it and some barrels and crates strewn around. To the far right end of the room will be another passageway. If you follow it, it will wind around and bring you to the other side of the stairs going up to the main ground floor.",

You'll have to use your imagination to fully grasp the champion's silhouette, buther hair, torso and face seem to pop out after closer inspection.\n\nThe comments section of the Reddit post are full of shocked players still in disbelief. \"Some people just have a ridiculous eye for stuff like this,\" user Vejvad posted. \"I have no idea how anyone would ever notice. I could barely see it even after looking at your drawing.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nOne piece of evidence rains on this parade. In response to this thread, Riot Game Designer DanielZKlein shared a Wikipedia article about Pareidolia, a phenomenon where people see a pattern that isn't really there. This could be a trick to distract players from the truth, but the fan base is so desperate for any information they'll turn smoke into a beautiful woman.\n\nThis isn't even the first time someone's claimed to have found the Akali silhouette in that picture. A month ago, reddit user L33tobix showed off their version of what's hidden in the smoke. Slightly different than Vejvads, but still seemingly accurate, this post didn't see much traction at the time.\n\nAll of this discussion in the subreddit is in no way a confirmation of what Akali will look like, but it would be kind of cool if the ninja who hides in a smoke cloud has actually been doing that all along. I'm still a skeptic about this image, but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for the hype. Riot Games has hidden details about champion releases before. For instance, in Battlecast Viktor's Splash Art, we can see a very distinct Vel'koz chilling in the background,months before he was revealed. It's that extra attention to detail that makes Riot Games a top-tier studio; it's remarkable that they'd be willing to leak one of the most-anticipated VGUs in recent memory as an Easter egg.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Riot Games for comment regarding the Akali rework and will update the story with any new information.",

If passed, it would make New York City the first American city to ban private employers from demanding workers be on call after they have clocked off.\n\n\"I think that because of technology, the lines have been blurred on when the work day begins and when the work day ends, and there are employers who take advantage of that fact,\" Espinal told the city's Observer news website.\n\nHe said he hopes the law would be a \"win-win\" for both parties, as it would allow works to \"decompress, reduce anxiety and be able to perform better when they get to the work the next day.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nA New York City councillor hopes to pass the Right to Disconnect bill. Olu Eletu/Unsplash\n\nEspinal added that New Yorkers are excited about the law, while some employers have expressed concern about how it would be put into practice.\n\nUnder the proposal, it would be unlawful for businesses with ten or more staff members to require employees to check and respond to emails and other electronic communications outside of contracted hours. Businesses that breach the rule would be fined $250.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nFirms that retaliate against employees who comply with the law will be required to compensate the wages and benefits lost by their staff, and pay a $500 fine. The penalty rises to $2,500 in the case of an employee being fired.\n\nThe proposal is the latest to bid by lawmakers to help employees strike a work-life balance, as technology risks turning the home into an extension of the office.\n\nIn 2016, France passed a law requiring companies with more than 50 workers to each draw up a charter of good conduct outlining when workers are not expected to respond to emails.\n\n\"All the studies show there is far more work-related stress today than there used to be, and that the stress is constant,\" Socialist MP Benoit Hamon told BBC News at the time.\n\n\"Employees physically leave the office, but they do not leave their work. They remain attached by a kind of electronic leash - like a dog.

Ambitious employees will not want to appear uncommitted to the business by claiming the right to disconnect and some managers will regard those who do as lacking drive and ambition to progress. In some organizational cultures disconnecting may lead to 'career death'.\"\n\nIt is rather the responsibility of those in senior positions to set the tone when it comes to a work-life balance, said Bevan.\n\n\"We need more employers to recognize that the high-intensity and long-hours working which can result from technology is not sustainable, and can ultimately damage employee health, motivation and productivity,\" he said.",

                "body": "Today marks a major release for Electronic Arts. Among the biggest game publishers in the world, EA is a monolith unto itself with a library of games spanning everything from professional sports to high-profile franchises like Star Wars: Battlefront. So what could excite a company that made more than $4 billion in 2017?\n\nA Way Out, a co-op only indie title that, at best, will make EA exactly $0.\n\nWhy does this title matter so much to EA? Because it is only the second release in the fledgling EA Originals program, a goodwill effort to foster the best in creative thinking in the industry and the brainchild of EA's Executive Vice President in charge of Worldwide Studios Patrick Soderlund. Before he was an executive, Soderlund began his career as the kind of small-scale developer EA Originals is designed to assist.\n\nA Way Out is a tale of two friends, best experienced by two friends. Hazelight Studios\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"I just remember the pains I went through,\" he told Newsweek. \"You need to not only convince people that you have a great idea, you also need to convince people that you can make the game.\"\n\nThe EA Originals program seeks to identify unique, innovative game developers and provide them with financial support that has very few strings attached. The hallmark of the program is the profit-sharing between EA and the studios enrolled in EA Originals: there is none. Once a game covers its costs, 100 percent of the profits will go directly to the studio, not to EA.\n\n\"We understand that we are a creative industry. We are a creative company, an entertainment company. If you look at our portfolio of products we deserve to have something like A Way Out in our portfolio. And if that means some of the other games are going to have to pave the way to pay for that, we're fine with it,\" he said.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nWhat makes A Way Out so special? It's a co-op only game, something that's become almost unheard of in the gaming world. There are plenty of multiplayer games, like Overwatch or PUBG, but A Way Out is about two people working together, not against each other.\n\nThe story follows two men who bond after a prison break and, in the course of their escape, must solve problems together. This is done with a litany of different mechanics, from familiar video game stuff like shootouts with police to tense quick-time events like passing escape tools between prison cells. Beyond its outside-the-box concepts, the game also benefits from a cinematic aesthetic that makes it as interesting to watch as it is to play.\n\nThe company behind A Way Out, Hazelight Studios, is helmed by Josef Fares. Soderlund recognized in him a passion and a vision that stood out among the dozens of other pitches presented to the EA Originals program.\n\n\"We have to think about the world in a different way. And when we meet with someone that's as strong as a creative as Josef is, he articulated his visions, basically, on a napkin to me. I said 'yeah let's do it,'\" he said.\n\nJosef Fares doing motion capture work for A Way Out. Hazelight Studios\n\nThe value for EA Originals isn't measured by dollar signs. It's measured in talent. Soderlund believes it's essential for a company as large and as prolific as EA to cultivate talent from as many avenues as possible. This program is a two-way street providing insight into trends and development strategies far different from what EA's existing studios might be doing.\n\n\"Building these large-scale, blockbuster type games, how do you stay fresh? How do you innovate? How do you make sure they're seen as market-leading and people want to go back and play them with the best of intent?\" he said. \"There's a lot of games out there that are too formulaic, that don't have enough innovation.\"\n\nWhat Soderlund is looking for are games that do something different, that push the boundaries of what people expect from interactive entertainment. He casts a wide net. To date roughly 200 pitches have come through to EA Partners, the internal team tasked with finding the best of the best. Funneling the best ideas up to Soderlund provides a chance to make connections across the industry.\n\n\"We designed the program to be a program where we got access to great developers and to talent that we wouldn't normally touch,\" he said. \"If we do our job well, and they do their job well, then maybe there's a longer-term relationship there that I think is important.\"\n\nHe certainly believes Hazelight and EA have a bright future ahead of them. He's hopeful his company will work with Fares again on another project, maybe something \"a lot bigger, that's less niche, where we give them more funding.\"\n\nHis expectations for EA Originals don't hinge on review scores, either. Given the choice he would rather see a title polarize an audience and garner scores that are all tens and zeroes then fall in the middle and receive fives across the board. (He's confident A Way Out will receive strong scores, and early reviews suggest he's right.)\n\nThe cinematic feel of A Way Out supports the story for people playing, and for people watching. Hazelight Studios\n\nDespite Soderlund's best intentions, there's no denying EA has a popularity problem among gamers. It's won dubious awards like \"Worst Company in America\" and recently found itself mired in controversy over microtransactions in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Of course Soderlund believes his company and, more importantly, his people are severely misunderstood.\n\n\"Oh we're 'Evil EA,' I've heard it all,\" he said. \"What people will find if they start interacting with EA is that this is a company with a lot of developers and creators that care, profoundly, about what they make. They don't see themselves as a monolith or an evil corporation, there's none of that.\"\n\nHe argues that, ultimately, games are made by people and people aren't perfect.\n\n\"Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we get it wrong,\" he said.\n\nEA Originals is an attempt to get it right from the very beginning. And if Soderlund gets it exactly right, he's got $0 to look forward to.",

Upon retiring in February 2016, Danielson told ESPN he had suffered at least 10 documented concussions during his 16-year career and had even experienced post-concussion seizures \"that I hid for a long time.\"\n\nBut three top neurological doctors, and WWE's own medical director Dr. Joseph Maroon, have given the veteran grappler the all-clear.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nDaniel Bryan will return to the ring. WWE\n\nWWE said in a statement Tuesday that Danielson, 36, underwent \"extensive evaluations\" during his two years of retirement. \"[Danielson] underwent a full review of his medical history and received comprehensive neurological and physical evaluations independent of WWE.\"\n\nOne of the doctors that greenlit Danielson for an in-ring return is no stranger to dealing with athletes. Neurosurgeon Dr. Robert Cantu is a leading expert in concussions who consults with teams across the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL). He also has his own concussion treatment center at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nCantu tells Newsweek that upon evaluation of Danielson's medical records in February, he found no sign of concussion-related injuries precluding the wrestler from returning to the ring.\n\n\"I evaluated Bryan for a neurological opinion on return to WWE on February 26, 2018. Included in his medical records were multiple evaluations by renowned concussion clinicians,\" says Cantu by email.\n\n\"I determined that Bryan is currently asymptomatic, has a normal detailed neurological and cognitive neuropsychological examination, normal EEG, and an MRI that showed no definite evidence of a prior brain injury. It is my medical opinion that there is no absolute contraindication to his return to in-ring action in WWE.\"\n\nCantu is also one of the foremost experts in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease that has been found in athletes and army veterans who are at risk of repeat head trauma. Currently, the most definitive diagnosis of CTE is during an autopsy of the brain after death. However, symptoms of CTE can be diagnosed in the living, including depression, aggressive behavior and dementia.\n\nIn 2007, Cantu was one of three neurological experts who diagnosed what is said to be the first case of CTE in professional wrestling in Chris Benoit.",

His words potentially raised the possibility of a second government shutdown in two months.\n\nThe Senate passed the $1.3 trillion bill just after midnight Friday, less than a day after the House, pushed the threat of another shutdown until just before this year's midterm elections. The bill covers the government's budget until September 30, following months of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. The last shutdown occurred from January 20 to January 22.\n\nThe chances of a shutdown appear slim. Most members of Congress have already left Washington for regular work in their states. The House is currently out of session and will not return until April 10, while the Senate will start a state work period Monday through April 6.\n\nHowever, U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tennessee) was still in town and encouraged Trump to veto the bill, describing part of it as \"grotesque.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nTrump accused Democrats of abandoning Dreamers, immigrants brought to the country by their parents at young ages and currently partially protected by the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, and claimed there were not enough funds for a U.S.-Mexico border wall needed for \"our National Defense.\"\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" Trump said.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nTrump, who campaigned and promised a massive wall, did receive roughly $1.6 billion in funding for additional barriers along the border.\n\nThe president had expressed displeasure with the bill earlier this week.

Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever.

The 43-year-old actress walked the red carpet for her Netflix series in a flowing red dress, a chunky bracelet, dangling earrings -- and a hand-painted picket sign that read \"I [heart] Jake Gyllenhaal.\"\n\nBarrymore wanted to set the record straight, because the day before she had been forced by late-night host James Corden to choose her least talented co-star, between Hugh Grant (Music and Lyrics), Adam Sandler (The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, Blended) or Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko). Barrymore chose Gyllenhaal -- but only because she would have been forced to eat turkey testicle if she hadn't. \"When I run into him next time, I'll be like, 'Dude, it was like selling you down the river or eating turkey's balls,'\" Barrymore told Corden jokingly. \"And by the way, I don't even care if he hates me. I literally am doing this because I just won't make it.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Barrymore -- and as is the point of Corden's \"Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts\" game -- this prompted several variations of the \"Drew Barrymore Calls Jake Gyllenhaal Her Least Talented Co-Star\" headline. So the actor took advantages of the cameras on her at the red carpet to clear up the confusion.\n\nWhen asked by the Associated Press at the premiere what the deal with the Gyllenhaal sign was, Barrymore explained the whole Corden-nearly-forced-her-turkey-testicles situation. \"I woke up to headlines everywhere that I think he's the least talented person I've ever worked with, and I'm like, first of all, in this day and age, this is an interesting headline, really?

In addition to standard couch co-op, the Friend Pass lets duos play the entire game online as well. This guide shows you how to use Friend Pass across PS4, Xbox One and PC.\n\nWhen one player has purchased the full version of A Way Out, they can invite players to join a session by selecting \"Play Online\" and pressing the designated button to invite a friend.Select the friend you'd like to play with and the invite will be sent.If the player does not have A Way Out already, the invite will instruct them to download the free trial version of the game. If that does not happen, you can manually download it at these links: PS4, Xbox One, PC [Origin]. On PS4 download the demo, on Xbox One select \"try for free\" and choose \"Play with Friend Pass\" on Origin.Once the download has finished, the host player can launch a lobby again, send an invite and the friend can join from their system interface.Accepting the invite will boot into the lobby and the story will begin.\n\nWe're still trying to work through the kinks ourselves, but it appears at least one person in each duo must have Xbox Live Gold or PlayStation Plus to use this feature. Just like in couch co-op, duos can save their progress and resume at a later date using the lobby process described above. Both players must use the same platform as well. We'll tweak this guide as necessary, but the implementation appears pretty seamless across all platforms.\n\nWith Friend Pass, duos can easily enjoy 'A Way Out' together. Hazelight Studios/EA\n\nA Way Out is the latest game from the creators behind indie darling Brothers - A Tale Of Two Sons. However, unlike its predecessor, A Way Out is not a single-player adventure with two separate characters. This time, Hazelight has flipped the script in an attempt to bring two human beings closer together. Players take control of Leo and Vincent, two very different personalities brought together in prison. The friends plot an escape and soon learn just how much the outside world has changed since they left. This is a cinematic game with highly variable gameplay elements. From shooting to playing arcade games, there's a little something for everyone in this very unique package.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nA Way Out is available now on PS4, Xbox One and PC.

The gay rights charity brought the case forward following the arrest of two men who were accused of having sex in Kenya, where homosexuality is illegal, and subjected to anal examinations and HIV tests.\n\n\"The NGLHRC has long argued that the tests are a violation of rights to privacy and dignity and amount to torture,\" the organization said in a statement following the ruling.\n\nThe NGLHRC described the examinations as violating and included \"being made to lie with legs up in a humiliating position and having instruments forced into your rectum, are widely accepted to have no medical merit.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nA High Court in Monbassa previously ruled in 2016 that the tests were constitutional and within the boundaries of acceptability by authorities.

Until the ruling on 22 March, it was one of eight countries which allowed forced anal examinations. Examinations are still allowed in Cameroon, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda and Zambia, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nAccording to official figures from the Kenyan government, there were 595 people who were prosecuted under the \"unnatural offenses\" law between 2010 and 2014\n\nHowever, according to Gitari, most of these cases included bestiality and rape -- crimes seen as comparable to consensual gay sex in Kenya and listed together in the legislation.\n\nGitari told Vice News in 2016 that there has only been one person convicted of homosexual activity since 2011.",

                "body": "Thousands of people are expected to take part in protests across Poland opposing the so-called \"Stop Abortion\" bill currently under debate in a parliamentary commission.\n\nPolish women fought and won against government plans to limit access to legal and safe abortion in October 2016, launching the \"black protest\" movement that mobilized about 30,000 people in the capital city of Warsaw and thousand more in cities across the country and the world. They're planning on doing so again with the \"black Friday\" protest scheduled for this afternoon.\n\nThe \"Stop Abortion\" bill was introduced following a so-called citizen initiative led by the anti-abortion-rights group Life and Family Foundation that gathered more than 800,000 signatures, allowing it to be proposed to the parliament in January, Agence France-Presse reported. A competing citizen initiative which proposed to liberalize abortion laws was instead rejected by the legislative assembly, where the right-wing Law and Justice party controls a majority of the seats.\n\nAbortion activists have been protesting against the bill for months, but Friday's protest is particularly urgent because lawmakers have expressed support for the law. If passed, it would prohibit abortions in cases of severe or fatal fetal anomaly, which account for 96 percent of procedures in the country, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nPeople protest a proposed near-total abortion ban in Poland in front of European Union institutions in Brussels on October 3, 2016. Protests against a new bill limiting access to abortion were planned across Poland and in other nations on March 23. Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe bill proposes to further limit access to legal and safe abortions in a country that already has some of the most restrictive laws in the European Union. About 1,000 legal abortions are performed every year in Poland, while the number of procedures performed illegally or abroad is estimated to be between 80,000 and 150,000.\n\nUnder current Polish law, a pregnancy can be terminated only in case of rape, incest, a threat to life or severe fetus anomaly. In a statement last week, the country's influential Roman Catholic Church urged lawmakers to go further and impose a total ban on abortion, the Associated Press reported.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nCritics of the \"Stop Abortion\" bill worry that forcing women to carry out these pregnancies presents a potentially fatal risk to their health. \"This proposal, if enacted, would place women's health and lives at risk. Parliament must listen to women in Poland who are saying loud and clear that they will fight against this attack on their bodies and their health,\" Draginja Nadazdin, director of Amnesty International Poland, said in a statement emailed to Newsweek.\n\n\"Women in Poland are strong and determined and we will defeat this threat. But we should not have to fight our own members of parliament to get our basic rights,\" she added.\n\nWomen hold up coat hangers as they demonstrate in front of the seat of the Warsaw archdiocese on March 18 in a protest against what they call the Catholic Church's intrusion into politics by supporting a new measure to tighten the already restrictive law on abortion. Janek Skarzynski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Facebook event page set up to promote Friday's protest in Warsaw featured more than 33,000 people attending. Other protests were being organized across Poland, and solidarity events are taking place in European cities such as London, Paris, Dublin, Spain's Barcelona and Oslo, Norway.\n\n\"We need your support and we need it now! We need solidarity and sisterhood. It's been two years since the ruling party in Poland with backing of the Catholic Church has been trying to turn our lives into hell,\" Natalia Greniewska of the Strajk Kobiet (Women's Strike) movement said in a statement to human rights group Amnesty International.\n\nSome protests are already underway.

Now, it seems the groundwork is being laid to bring Hogan back into the WWE fold.\n\nAccording to PWInsider, conversations between Hogan (real name Terry Bollea) and the WWE about his possible return to the company have been ongoing for several weeks. The capacity in which Hogan could rejoin the WWE remains unclear, but PWInsider theorizes he could become an ambassador for the company, making periodic appearances at shows like he did before he was fired.\n\nThe WWE responded to PWInsider's inquiries with the following statement.\n\n\"We have had discussions with Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan) about how he can help others learn from his mistakes, however, he is not under any contract with WWE.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nHogan was let go from the WWE in July 2015 after a tape of the former Superstar using racially insensitive language was leaked. The tape, recorded in 2006, was first published by The National Enquirer and included an angry rant from Hogan about his daughter Brooke's then-boyfriend, who was African-American. The tape was secretly filmed by Hogan's former friend, radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge, whose then-wife Hogan was sleeping with. The sextape would be published online by Gawker making the incident a national story.\n\nHogan asked the site to take the video down and when his request was denied, sued Gawker. The racially insensitive rant would be leaked in the middle of Hogan's civil suit against the site, coming at a time where the transcript of the tape was sealed from the public. Hogan sued the outlet a second time after his firing from the company, alleging the outlet was trying to ruin his wrestling career. In 2016, a judge awarded Hogan an amount of $115 million against Gawker. The judgment bankrupted the outlet, which would later come to a settlement of $31 million with Hogan.\n\nWhat do you think of the WWE trying to bring back Hulk Hogan?

                "body": "Imagine it's 1984. You're 14 years old and you live in New York's gritty Queensbridge projects during the height of the crack epidemic. Because your mother is struggling with alcoholism and has mentally checked out long ago, you have the responsibility of raising your three little sisters.\n\nThen, suddenly, you're thrust into the spotlight. A song you playfully recorded in a friend's apartment has taken off and is getting maximum airplay. Everyone wants to see you perform and get your autograph. Yet in the midst of your skyrocking fame, you still have family and life's misfortunes weighing you down.\n\nCould you handle the pressures of keeping it all together? Hip-hop's first female MC certainly did.\n\nRoxanne Shanté -- born Lolita Shanté Gooden -- burst into the music industry when rap was just starting to be considered a musical art form. Her first single, \"Roxanne's Revenge,\" was a response to UTFO's hit \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" and it transformed Shanté from a teen battle rapper in the 'hood to becoming the first leading lady of hip-hop.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nShanté's rise to the top wasn't easy -- for every milestone she achieved, there was a harrowing instance of adversity waiting around the corner -- but she prevailed. And her story is now the focus of Netflix's newest original movie, Roxanne Roxanne, premiering Friday.\n\nChanté Adams makes her film debut as Roxanne Shanté, and she spoke with Newsweek about her breakout role as hip-hop's first female star and shared what she believed everyone could learn from Shanté's story.\n\nChanté Adams in new Netflix movie \"Roxanne Roxanne\" premiering on March 23, 2018. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nHow familiar were you with Roxanne Shanté's music before taking this role?\n\nI wasn't born until 10 years after the time period the movie takes place, so I wasn't familiar with her music. I knew the song \"Roxanne Roxanne\" just because my older siblings, who are die-hard hip-hop fans, used to play it, but I didn't know her story. I had no idea that she had this interesting life until I read the script and met with her.\n\nWas she around during filming or did you meet her beforehand?\n\nI was cast eight days before we started shooting, so it was kind of late in the process and I didn't have a lot of time. We met for about 30 minutes before we started shooting. Having her there -- which I fully appreciated -- it was just nerve-wracking because you want to make sure that you get it right and that the person watching you is proud of your work. But I was so happy that she was there. Anytime I had questions or anything, if I was unsure about something, I could always ask her because I had the source right there.\n\nWhat was most interesting to you about her story?\n\nI think it's that all of this stuff happened to her: from having a mother who ended up becoming an alcoholic, having to raise her younger siblings to later getting involved with a man who was physically abusive. Those are all things that many women can relate to. But the fact that she was going through all of this while only 14, 15 years old -- she was such a young teenager. And that was what was so interesting about her story to me, especially playing her and trying to balance these adult roles she's taken on with the experience of a child.\n\nConsidering her age, that she was so young when she got her first taste of fame, and all the other things happening in her life, do you think viewers will have a sense of empathy and understanding of Roxanne Shanté that maybe wasn't there before?\n\nYea, absolutely. I think with every part of this story, at least one person is going to be able to relate to her or know someone who has been through at least one of [Shanté's] situations because she goes through so much at one time. I definitely think audiences will be empathetic towards her and towards her character. She was just a woman -- a girl -- out here trying to do her best, trying to help the people she loved and she was doing it the best way she knew how.\n\nThis is your first role, and trying out for it was your first audition. It's not everyday someone books their first job on the very first try.\n\nIt was crazy. I had just graduated from Carnegie Mellon University. Three weeks later I moved to New York, and maybe two weeks after that I got an email from the casting director asking me to come in and audition. I just wanted to do a good job, that was my main goal. I practiced really hard, researched the internet for anything I could find on Shanté and practiced her voice and did my best. I was really proud of myself after I came out of the audition. And then I let it go. I didn't think anything of it until I got the email to come back for a second time, and I was like, \"Oh, I got my first call back. Well that's cool, too. I'll do it.\" And I was proud of myself for getting the callback. But again, I never thought about possibly getting the role. When it did happen it was just crazy. I was on set six weeks after I graduated college.\n\nChanté Adams and Mahershala Ali in new Netflix movie, \"Roxanne Roxanne,\" premiering on March 23, 2017. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nIt's your first movie and you're working with Oscar winner Mahershala Ali and Nia Long, who has been in the industry since the early '90s. Were you overwhelmed to be working alongside such big stars?\n\nIt was nerve-wracking at first, but then I got to know them as people and they're just such great human beings. I really could not ask for better co-stars. I grew up watching Nia and she was definitely one of my idols. I freaked out when I found out she was going to play my mother. \"Me? Nia Long is gonna work with me?\" She's like my big sister now. She's my mentor in the industry. She just took me under her wing and I appreciated that. Nia would stay behind after she was done just to help me out.\n\nI went to theater school and have a degree in acting, so film was a little foreign to me. Both Nia and Mahershala were understanding of that and were so patient with me, took baby steps with me and really just showed me the ropes. I sooo appreciate them for that. I learned so much just by watching Mahershala, watching his process before shooting a scene, watching how he interacted with the director. What I saw him do I took with me for the next project I worked on.\n\nChanté Adams and Nia Long in Netflix movie, \"Roxanne Roxanne,\" premiering on March 23, 2018. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhat do you think women in hip-hop can take away from watching this movie and Roxanne's story?\n\nI think that a lot of females don't know their rap history or [Shanté's] story -- particularly this generation that's making music right now. They don't know who paved the way for them, and Roxanne has definitely been that person. I was at a screening of the movie and I met Pepa from Salt & Pepa, and she was telling me how Shanté was one of her idols. And it made me think about women in hip-hop today who say that Salt & Pepa are their idols. I think this story is important for that reason -- it offers artists the chance to learn about their idols' idols and to learn about the first commercially successful female rapper and what she was going through at that time.\n\nThe things that Shanté was facing back in the '80s, a lot of women are still going through that today. I think it's important for them to see this movie and recognize that they aren't alone and know there's a woman who's been through this and came out on top. It's important for them to see who she is today and realize that this is a woman who went through a whirlwind and she can sit here to tell her story to everyone. And she tells it proudly, too. She's one of the most proud women I've ever met. They refer to her as one of the auntie's of hip-hop, and that's what she is. She loves all the female hip-hop artists who have come after her. She embraces them and she loves her status as a hip-hop artist.\n\nDescribe the movie in three words.\n\nI. Am. Woman. I don't think a man could have endured what Shanté has endured and come out looking as good as Shanté. Women have a type of strength I think no other beings on this planet have. So, yeah: I am woman. There's just so much power behind that, and it can be interpreted a lot of different ways.",

In between chasing Doloran around the world and looking for signatories to his Declaration of Interdependence, King Evan has to build Evermore, his own kingdom.\n\nKingdom building is one of the more in-depth gameplay modes in Ni No Kuni II, maybe second only to combat. Once Evermore is established, it will be to players' advantage to check in about every half hour.\n\nKing Evan standing outside of his kingdom of Evermore. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nEvan doesn't need to be seated on his throne to manage his kingdom. Just press the triangle button anywhere in town and you'll enter the Kingdom Building interface.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the WorldYour Kingdom's Economy\n\nKingdom building works on a separate currency called Kingsguilders, or KG. Kingsguilders purchase the buildings, the upgrades and pay for the research that happens in your facilities. They accrue in your kingdom's coffers at a rate that increases as your kingdom's economy grows. It's important to check in on Evan's kingdom often, even if it's just to collect from your kingdom's coffers (once full, Evan's coffers stop filling up).\n\nYou can also get Kingsguilders by walking around and helping out your citizen's with their paltry complaints. (Why they want their king to chop wood, we will never know.)\n\nIn addition to Coffers, there are also Evermore's Stores, a menu that aggregates your share of the kingdom's material output, including crops from your farms and fish from your markets. Like Coffers, Evermore's Stores can fill up and stop producing, so make a point to collect often. There are two options: to take all items or sell all items. Selling doesn't net you much, so it's worth just keeping everything for yourself, especially because lots of those items will prove useful in crafting and improving weapons, armor and spells, or feeding Higgledies.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nLevel up fish markets, farms and lumberyards to get higher quality items. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nEvermore's Building Boom\n\nTo build, simply look around the map for build sites, meet the requirements (usually a cost in Kingsguilders) and buy the facility. It spawns immediately, but is far from useful upon construction. That will take personnel and some leveling up.\n\nOnce Evermore is well established, your decisions about research priorities and facilities to level will be more obvious, based on your current objective. But generally, to level your overall kingdom as quickly as possible, it's best to build a lot of facilities, even if you don't have a use for them yet. More important than any specific facility is improving the overall status of your kingdom by levelling up the kingdom itself. This typically requires having a certain number of citizens and building a certain number of facilities (plus a coffer-load of Kingsguilders), so keep an eye on your progress and level up Evermore and its coffers as soon as possible. This will increase the flow of Kingsguilders into the Evermore economy and offer new facilities and research options by expanding the boundaries of Evan's kingdom's walls.\n\nCoffers determine how fast money comes into your kingdom. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThe Scientific Method (Of Waiting)\n\nTo make a facility useful, add personnel. These are citizens you'll pick up while adventuring who agree to join Evan's kingdom of Evermore. Each has an IQ rating in War, Ingenuity, Spritecraft and Conjury that could make them more or less suited to a specific facility. But really it doesn't take much micromanaging; opening the Personnel menu for a facility will quickly reveal \"Suitable\" candidates for the job. More personnel and higher IQ will allow you to unlock upgrades and complete research more quickly.\n\nRead Evermore citizen profiles to see where they'd fit best into your kingdom. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThe research available at facilities is determined partly by what your personnel can unlock and partly by the facility's level. Levelling facilities can get expensive fast, so it's a good idea to only do it when there's specific research you're hoping to access.\n\nBecause research can take a long time -- 30 real-time minutes isn't uncommon -- it's always preferable to have a fully-staffed facility doing the work. If you have citizens to spare, assign them to the facility before beginning important research, even if their skills don't really match up. It's more important to fill those slots and get the work done.\n\nThe Best People\n\nWhile the usefulness of new citizens to Evermore depends mostly on their IQ and which facility best suits their skills, there are attribute requirements for certain types of research. That means you might need a very specific person to take on certain types of research. For example, using the Symphonium, a facility for listening to the Ni No Kuni II soundtrack, requires a citizen with the \"Perfect Pitch\" designation. I've only found one. Which means using the Symphonium at all requires fulfilling Nereus' conditions in Hydropolis and signing him up for Evermore.\n\nMeet my bud Nereus. He's a good singer. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nRecruiting new citizens to Evermore takes up a major chunk of the available sidequests in Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom. Return to each major city after conquering its Kingmaker and the map will be covered in little exclamation marks, each one a potential new citizen of Evermore. Once all of the low-hanging fruit have been recruited, check Leafbook, the in-game social network, or Swift Solutions.\n\nYou can take on 12 Swift Solutions quests at a time. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThere's a Swift Solutions stand in every city, where you can take on micro-quests, usually forking over a handful of items or beating a few enemies, in exchange for a special currency called Tokens of Gratitude. Those tokens can be spent scouting out new citizens, who will be added to your map.\n\nThe Best Research\n\nOptions for new research and facilities can become very overwhelming, very fast. There's way more to do in Evermore than you're likely to get to in a normal campaign playthrough. But here's some stuff worth focusing on immediately, beyond the obvious research into improved weapons, armor and Higgledies.\n\nBrisk Stroll - This is a game changer, which you can research at the Explorer's Guild. Brisk Stroll increases movement speed in overworld maps, which will not only help you get around, but will allow you to outrun pursuing enemies.\n\nBetter Construction Efficiency - Lowers building cost by 20 percent. Research this at the Institute of Innovation right away to save piles of Kingsguilders in the meantime.\n\nCook Great Higgledies for Less - This is another excellent discount if you ever hope to \"cook up\" the most powerful Higgledies. Visit the Higglery to research.\n\nSpecific Spell Dev.: Spirit Medium - Researched at the Evermore Spellworks, Spirit Medium may not sound so useful at first, but you'll run into more and more ghosts later in the game and deeper into your exploration. Talking to them is worthwhile.\n\nSpecific Spell Dev.: Spring Lock - Also researched at the Evermore Spellworks, Spring Lock unlocks all those blue treasure chests sprinkled around the world.\n\nAs Evermore expands, Evan will be able to build more powerful and stranger facilities, like the Sage's Salon, Hyper Hubble-Bubblery, Multi-Dimensional Lab and Kingmaker's Cathedral. The amount of construction, upgrading and research can feel almost endless, stretching for hours after you've beaten the main campaign. But in between all the juggling of research, Kingsguilders and new construction, it's also always worthwhile to take a walk around your kingdom to chat up and help out your citizenry. After all, you built this for them.",

But on the show, it wasn't an ending that saw the toy mecca going bankrupt. Instead, youth-hater Lindsay Naegle formed an anti-children group -- Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays Against Parasitic Parents -- and instructed the members of the organization to \"kill every child...friendly thing in town.\"\n\nRiveted by her orders, all the singles, seniors, childless couples, teens and gays in Springfield rallied up and destroyed all things related to children. Playpens were crushed, \"Kids at Play\" signs were set on fire and Moe the bartender was seen flipping forward Toys 'R' Us' famous backward \"R\" as Milford Van Houten and a mob of children with faces full of tears cry from a distance.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nPerhaps not as destructive of the actual ending for Toys 'R' Us in real life, but the event will be just as sad when the company closes its doors after 70 years of business and lays off about 31,000 workers in the U.S. When the news broke that the store was officially shutting down, swarms of people took to social media to express their grief.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nOnly adding to the sorrow, Toys 'R' Us founder Charles Lazarus died on Thursday, just a week after the company announced it would be closing for good. He was 94 years old.\n\nToys 'R' Us didn't say exactly when it would be closing down for good, but the company is expected to begin liquidation sales at its stores on Friday.",

McMaster's successor Thursday. He's considered a major proponent of U.S. wars and has called for military action against both North Korea and Iran. Bolton previously served in President George W. Bush's administration from 2005 to 2006. He is scheduled to officially take up his role April 9.\n\nTrump has alluded to potential military conflicts or strikes with North Korea, heightening fears around the globe. However, the president agreed earlier this month to meet with North leader Kim Jong Un in an attempt to denuclearize the regime.\n\nDuring his campaign, the president ran hard against the U.S.'s nuclear non-proliferation deal with Iran, formed under President Barack Obama. He had threatened to cancel the deal but has yet to do so.",

                "body": "Around the world, severe water shortages are becoming increasingly common and the situation is only expected to worsen as temperatures rise.\n\nIn light of this, MIT researchers have created a concept device which can extract moisture from the air and turn it into drinking water, even in the driest places on Earth, potentially providing a solution to the problem of water scarcity in arid climates.\n\nWhile deserts and other arid regions may seem like they are completely devoid of water, there is always some moisture in the air, which the device has been designed to capture.\n\nThe extractor, which was first proposed last year, was recently field-tested in the dry air of Tempe, Arizona. The team's work has been described in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nThe new device can function in relative humidities of as low as 10% and is powered solely by sunlight, making it ideal for desert regions. In the absence of sunlight, another heat source -- such as a fire -- could potentially be used to power the device.\n\nTo capture the water, the extractor uses porous, sponge-like materials with large surface areas known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) -- a family of relatively new and chemically diverse artificial compounds with applications in a wide range of fields, ranging from physics and engineering to biology, chemistry and medicine.\n\nThese MOFs, which can be altered to attract water, are placed between an upper black surface, which absorbs heat, and a lower surface kept at the same temperature as the outside air. Water in the air is captured by the MOFs and is then released as water vapor from the pores of the material. This then drips down to the bottom of the device as a liquid, in a process driven by the temperature difference between the higher and lower surfaces.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nResearchers at MIT have developed a new device that is able to extract moisture from very dry air. MIT\n\nMethods for harvesting potable water from air alreardy exist, but they require high humidity levels -- 100% humidity for so-called fog-harvesting methods and above 50% for dew-harvesting systems.\n\nUnlike these existing methods, the new approach can work in a much wider range of conditions, according to Sameer Rao, an MIT postdoc and co-lead author of the new study. Not only can it function at far lower humidities, it also has no moving parts and doesn't require large amounts of energy for cooling -- in contrast to the dew harvesting method, for example.\n\nFurthermore, during the field experiments for the latest study, the team tested the water produced by the device using a mass spectrometer, finding that it contained no traces of impurities and was safe to drink.\n\nThe team from MIT say the next step is to scale up the system and boost its efficiency to the point where each unit could produce enough water for an entire household.\n\n\"We hope to have a system that's able to produce liters of water,\" said Evelyn Wang, a professor of mechanical engineering and senior author of the latest paper. \"These small, initial test systems were only designed to produce a few milliliters, to prove the concept worked in real-world conditions, but we want to see water pouring out!\"",

                "body": "People say they'll never forget their freshman year of college. They'll recount memories of living in a dingy dorm, cultivating lasting friendships with roommates, having adventures and experiencing the thrill of newfound freedom that comes from living away from home. I know I'll never forget my freshman year. But it isn't for any of these reasons.\n\nMy six-year old-brother, Noah, was murdered in his classroom during the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012. His twin sister, Arielle, and older sister, Sophia, survived. That day is burned into my memory forever. Time doesn't ease any of the pain, and I miss my little brother every day. Nothing will ever compare to the grief of such a horrific loss, but the pain continues knowing over five years later we are still fighting a battle to change our nation's gun laws -- and far too many of our legislators have yet to prioritize public safety over the gun lobby.\n\nOn the day of the shooting, I was in the middle of finals. My mom called and said there had been a shooting at my siblings' school and she wasn't sure if they were safe. Soon after that my mom called again -- she had found both of my sisters, but not Noah. Finally my grandma called. Noah had been shot and killed. He was one of 20 students and six educators who were gunned down in their school that day.\n\nDanielle Vabner and Noah Pozner. Danielle Vabner\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nFrom that point forward, my life as I knew it changed forever. I went back to college a few weeks later but found it impossible to be in the same place where I first got the news of Noah's death. I finished the school year in New York and decided to transfer to the University of Texas at Austin for my sophomore year.\n\nAs my new life in Texas began to take shape, the weight of what had happened to my family never left my mind. It was hard to relate to students around me who had not experienced what I had. After secluding myself for a time, I found one of the most helpful parts of my healing process was sharing my story and getting involved in gun safety advocacy work, as I have done ever since.\n\nSo my heart broke anew when I learned of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 students and educators were killed and more than a dozen others injured. The senseless violence that happened at Sandy Hook, and continues to happen in places like Parkland and hundreds of other cities and towns across the country, has been a wake-up call for me -- and I'm not alone.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAfter Parkland, students are rising up all over the country to March for Our Lives on Saturday (March 24), because we are not willing to wait until this violence strikes again. Students and Americans around the country are bravely taking to the streets and demanding common-sense gun legislation from our nation's leaders. We're pushing corporations to boycott the NRA and shedding light on the dangerous gun lobby agenda. And we won't be ignored.\n\nPeople join together to protest against guns after a school shooting killed 17 on the steps of the Broward County Federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on February 17. Thousands of small shoes were placed on the ground in front of the Capitol building, one pair for each of the estimated 7,000 children who have died from gun violence since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, on Washington, D.C., on March 13. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThough I've been doing this work for a number of years, as have many survivors and families of those affected by gun violence, it's reaffirming to see so many joining the movement now. It's this chorus of voices that gives me hope and keeps me going. And I'll be proud to join the hundreds of thousands of people -- kids, teenagers, moms and dads, school and community leaders -- who will participate in the March For Our Lives events across the country on March 24.\n\nLending my voice to this movement allows me to honor my brother's life while doing what I can to make sure this doesn't happen to another family. Subsequently, I have interned at Everytown For Gun Safety and joined the effort to push back against campus-carry laws that threatened to come to the University of Texas.\n\nThis work against gun violence was new to me. Before Noah was killed, this was not an issue to which I paid much attention. Growing up in Connecticut, I lived a relatively care-free life -- I felt safe at school and around my community. But over the years I've been doing this, I've realized that gun violence doesn't discriminate based on your zip code. It's a crisis that plagues small towns like mine once in a century, as well as bigger cities where shots ring out daily. It's easy to think of these shootings as isolated incidents, but in truth, they're happening all the time. Every day in America, more than 96 people die and hundreds more are wounded by guns.\n\nSo on March 24, I hope you'll march with us -- not just in memory of those taken, like my brother Noah, and in the honor of the Parkland students, but in support of kids and families everywhere who deserve a safer future.\n\nDanielle Vabner is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, whose six-year-old brother, Noah Pozner, was one of 20 students and six educators shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. She is a passionate advocate for gun violence prevention and a member of the Everytown Survivor Network.",

The battle for Hilltop finally begins, and key characters are injured or killed in the process.\n\nSPOILERS follow this break. Those who don't want to know the truth about episode 13 of The Walking Dead should stop reading.\n\nThe plot of episode 13 is fairly thin as it focuses entirely on the climactic battle at Hilltop. Simon and his team of tainted warriors arrive at Maggie's doorstep, and they don't back down from the challenge. Before the bulk of the fighting begins, though, there's a moment between Tobin and Carol where Carol tells him about her commitment to avoiding conflict. She believes there will always be new threats even after the Saviors are gone, so she's not sure if she'll stay involved with the community after the war is over.\n\nMoments like this could come back to haunt Tara in episode 13.

When Tobin reanimates, he attacks the Kingdom's doctor. Several Saviors are killed as well. For the main cast, two points of interest are Rick and Tara. When Tara is knocked to the ground, Dwight approaches with an arrow and shoots her. Tara sees the act as karma for her past altercations with Dwight, and it's unclear if she survives her wound.\n\nRick, on the other hand, becomes concerned when community members start turning in the middle of the night. Knowing the Saviors weapons were tainted, he wonders if his own wounds might be infected too.\n\nThe conflict ends with a victory for the Hilltop, but Maggie laments the immense personal cost for the win. Like Carl, Michonne and Carol before her, she wonders how worth it this death and destruction truly is. Episode 13 doesn't address the cliffhanger of Negan and Jadis in episode 12, and Dwight's double-agent status remains concealed for now.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAs with all spoiler reports, these episode 13 details should be taken with a grain of salt.

                "body": "A Google artificial intelligence (AI) expert believes Facebook can be used for \"psychological control\" and says researchers who want to work for the social media giant should \"show some conscience\" and abandon the platform.\n\nFrançois Chollet, a software engineer who specializes in deep-learning algorithms, said in a series of tweets published that internet users should now strive towards technology products \"that are the anti-Facebook.\"\n\n\"The problem with Facebook is not just the loss of your privacy and the fact that it can be used as a totalitarian panopticon,\" he wrote. \"The more worrying issue ... is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector.\"\n\nHe spoke out in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which an app developer allegedly harvested the Facebook account information of 50 million users for use in targeted political campaigns. The company, which worked on the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign for Donald Trump, has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nChollet detailed some of the key issues now emerging around the subject of AI and algorithms, including the \"feedback loops\" they create. He questioned Facebook's ability to spread news -- both fake and real -- and claimed the website could potentially be used to take \"control of your political beliefs and your worldview.\"\n\nThe researcher noted that, currently, bots and trolls who spread misinformation and sow political division are simplistic. That is going to quickly change, he warned.\n\nHe wrote: \"Deep learning only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks around 2016. Facebook has invested massively in it. Who knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\"We're looking at a powerful entity that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of over two billion humans, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. It really scares me. If you work in AI, please don't help them. Don't play their game. Don't participate in their research ecosystem. Please show some conscience.\"\n\nOf course, critics quickly pointed out that Google is no angel when it comes to data collection. Last year, as reported by The Guardian, it faced legal issues after allegedly harvesting the information of \"more than five million people in the U.K.\"\n\nLike Facebook, it admitted to being exploited by a Russian troll farm in 2016 and raised widespread concern in 2014 for scanning users' Gmail inboxes. And its YouTube algorithms have consistently been embroiled in scandal over the years.\n\n\"Some say this applies to Google too,\" Chollet hit back on Thursday. \"This is the laziest kind of thinking. There's only one company where the product is an opaque algorithmic newsfeed, that has been running large-scale mood/opinion manipulation experiments, that is neck-deep in an election manipulation scandal, that has shown time and time again to have morally bankrupt leadership.\"\n\nHe meant Facebook, by the way.\n\nFacebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017.

With so many warplanes, helicopters and drones all operating in the same area, the risk of confrontation has increased dramatically.\n\nISIS' recent battlefield defeats have left it with a limited and isolated strip of desert territory straddling the Syria-Iraq border. This is a far cry from the high water mark of its self-proclaimed caliphate, when its territory encompassed some 8 million people.\n\nWhen U.S. airstrikes on ISIS began in 2014, \"there were that many ISIS fighters out there... There weren't a whole lot of places you could go where there was no ISIS presence,\" Lieutenant Joe Anderson, an F/A-18F pilot told USNI news. Although pilots are still flying as many missions as they were in 2014, they are geared towards support and defense of U.S. and coalition ground forces rather than executing pre-planned strikes, Anderson explained.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nAn F/A-18E Super Hornet launches from the flight deck of the USS George H.W.

As carrier strike group commander Rear Admiral Steve Koehler told USNI News, \"The threat picture in Syria is just crazy: how many different countries can you cram in one different place, where they all have a different little bit of an agenda? And you put a tactical pilot up there and he or she has to employ ordnance or make defensive counter-air decisions with multiple people.\"\n\nNew challenges arise with the ebb and flow of the 7-year-old war. With increased Turkish activity in the north west of the country, U.S. jets are tasked with protecting U.S. troops stationed alongside Kurdish forces who are the subject of the Turkish assault. If U.S. forces come under threat from Turkish planes, U.S. pilots may be forced to make difficult decisions; defend Americans and risk war, or stand back and risk dead Americans?\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nRussian air force pilots sit in the cockpit of a Russian Su-30SM fighter at the a base in northwest Syria, on December 16, 2015.

In June 2017, U.S. jets shot down a Syrian bomber that was attacking U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nRetired U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel David Berke told Business Insider, \"If you misinterpret what someone does, you can create a massive problem, you can start a war. I can't think of a more complex place for there to be or a greater level of risk.\"\n\nKoehler also accused enhanced Iranian presence, particularly of drones, of destabilizing the situation. He said that U.S. ships and planes are encountering Iranian drones every day, and though they do not yet seem to be armed, their presence is unsettling.\n\n\"Is flying over hostile? I certainly don't want it here if it's in a position to drop any sort of weapons. Trying to determine that is very difficult, a very hard problem,\" Koehler said.",

But the shooter appeared to have a more sinister plan.\n\nThe gunman apparently then made his way to the Super U supermarket in the southern town of Trèbes, located 60 miles southeast of Toulouse.\n\nThere, he took hostages at around 12:05 p.m. local time, shooting two people dead and leaving around a dozen injured, according to French national police. The two incidents are linked, Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union, confirmed to the Associated Press.\n\nPolice surrounded the shopping mart, announcing a security operation and warning citizens to avoid the area.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nBy 1.35 p.m. local time, the man remained holed up in the supermarket. It was unclear how many people remained inside.\n\nThe motive of the attack appeared to be of an radical Islamist nature. Mayor of Trèbes Eric Menassi said the gunman had entered the supermarket shouting \"Allahu Akbar!\" or \"God is great!\" in Arabic, before shouting \"I'll kill you all.\"\n\nThe identity of the attacker is still unclear, but local media reported that he had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). French authorities have yet to officially confirm the ISIS link.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nIt is unknown how that pledge, if any, was conveyed, but previous attackers in Europe and the U.S. have done so in phone calls with authorities, with the possession of ISIS's black flag or by merely shouting an allegiance at the scene of their attack.\n\nFrench gendarmes block the access to Trebes, where a man took hostages at a supermarket on March 23, 2018 in Trebes, southwest France.

He remains in prison and has so far refused to cooperate with French authorities after his extradition from Belgium. That demand remains unconfirmed.\n\nThe French government was treating the incident as an extremist attack, which would make it the first since the election of Emmanuel Macron in May last year, and the first since a two-year state of emergency was lifted in October. France has remained on high alert since.\n\n\"All the information we have as I speak lead us to think that this would be a terrorist act,\" French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said.\n\n\"There is an ongoing situation...in the town of Trebes, where shots have been heard and a man entrenched himself in a supermarket,\" Philippe said. \"It's a serious situation.\"\n\nMacron sent Interior Minister Gerard Collomb to the scene of the attack. The Paris prosecutor's office said that counterterrorism officers had taken over the case. It did not elaborate on why it was presiding over the case.\n\nThe incident revived memories of the January 2015 Hypercacher kosher supermarket siege in Paris, in which an ISIS sympathizer killed at least four hostages. More than a dozen managed to escape.\n\nISIS has inspired or directed more than half a dozen attacks shooting and vehicle-ramming attacks on French soil since January 2015, killing more than 240 people. The deadliest was the November 2015 shooting and suicide bomb assault on different locations in Paris by an ISIS-cell that had planned their attack in Belgium. The assault left 130 people dead.",

                "body": "After filmmaker Kevin Smith suffered a \"massive heart attack\" in February, doctors ordered him to lose 50 pounds in order to transform his health. Since then he has lost 17 pounds -- by only eating potatoes. But experts warn that subsisting solely on spuds is far from advisable.\n\nEschewing other on-trend diets like veganism and keto, Smith opted for illusionist Penn Jillette's regime. As documented in his 2016 New York Times bestseller Presto!: How I Made Over 100 Pounds Disappear, the regime sees followers eat potatoes for two weeks before phasing in vegetable stews to top up the body's nutrients.\n\n\"It's a pretty intense program, but it's been interesting,\" Smith said of the diet on his Hollywood Babble-On podcast. \"And of course necessary for my health and stuff. But once I get to a decent place, then I can think about eating again.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Jillette and Smith aren't the only ones to surviving on potatoes. In 2016, former Australian marathon kayaker Andrew Flinders Taylor made international headlines by eating only potatoes for the year, losing 50kg as a result. Taylor consulted medical professionals and studied scientific papers in order to make sure the regime was safe.\n\n\"I'm getting over 600 per cent of my daily iron retirements and over 400 per cent of vitamin c as well as heaps of fiber -- all things that so-called experts have said I'd be low in today,\" Taylor told The Independent at the time.\n\n\"The only thing of concern was calcium, potatoes have calcium but maybe not enough. To be sure I'm using a calcium fortified organic soy milk to make mashed potatoes.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nBut dietitians are far from convinced that living off potatoes is a wise lifestyle choice.\n\n\"Just eating potatoes is not a balanced intake of nutrition for the body and followed long term would leave you at risk of nutritional deficiencies,\" Priya Tew, a qualified dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association (BDA), told Newsweek.\n\nOver the course of two weeks, the diet could negatively affect a person's digestion, mood and associations with food, said BDA dietitian Aisling Piggott.\n\nRead more: What Is Pegan? Vegan, Paleo Combination Diet Could Increase Risk of Eating Disorders, Dietitian Warns\n\n\"Your body will have to adapt to change in type and volume of fiber,\" she told Newsweek. \"Boredom and fatigue of the same food will likely reduce your appetite and enjoyment of food. And as our body starts to cope with only taking in one type of food, we may start to feel sluggish and grumpy.\"\n\nShe added: \"I do love potatoes and believe they are an unsung hero of the starchy carbohydrate world. Potatoes are rich in fiber, vitamin C and micronutrients. Potatoes can be a useful contributor to a healthy balanced diet.\"\n\n\"However you will not meet your protein or vitamin and or mineral requirements through potato intake alone, which increases risk of vitamin and or mineral deficiency. As with anything there is certainly not a magic answer in terms of weight loss, and while potatoes have great nutritional value, they are not and will never be nutritionally complete.\"\n\n\"The world we live in and our relationships with food are incredibly complex and can't be summarized or recommended in a book or a 'fasting diet'.\n\n\"Examining one's own relationship with food and establishing routines around eating are the first and most important steps before even looking at food choices,\" she said.\n\nInstead of surviving on potatoes, Tew said that eating fruit and vegetables, a balance of carbohydrates and protein over the day and being more active is the way to go. \"By concentration on your health instead of your weight you are helping your body achieve its goals of being healthy,\" she said.",

                "body": "Roseanne Barr's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live Thursday quickly became combative as talk turned to politics. But the results were unintentionally hilarious.\n\nBarr, whose classic 1990s sitcom Roseanne makes its return to ABC next week, appeared on the late-night talker with co-star John Goodman. The revival will focus largely on family dissent caused by the 2016 presidential election: Barr's character Roseanne Conner voted for President Donald Trump to the dismay of her children. That story arc may as well be ripped from real life, because the real Roseanne, too, voted for Trump.\n\nKimmel prodded Barr about both her voting record and her character's -- and even questioned her about her one-time friendship with Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"I think you accused her of being a murderer, didn't you?\" asked Kimmel.\n\n\"I did not,\" fired back Barr.\n\n\"You know I'm going to find that tweet in the next 40 seconds...\" continued Kimmel.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nBarr bit back: \"I deleted it, so fuck you.\"\n\nThe unapologetic comedian continued to let rip on Clinton, saying she disagreed with the former secretary of state's foreign policy.\n\nKimmel then said: \"How about Captain Wacko we got running the country?\"\n\nKimmel expressed shock that Barr, a \"socially liberal person,\" voted for Trump.\n\nBarr responded: \"I'm still the same. You all moved. You all went so fucking far out you lost everyone. A lot of us, no matter who we voted for, we don't want to see our president fail.\"\n\nThen Barr took Kimmel to task about the alternative to Trump: Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\"You want Pence? You want Pence for the freakin' president?\" Barr goaded Kimmel. When Kimmel responded, \"No,\" Barr quipped: \"Well, then, zip that fucking lip.\"\n\nThe revival of Roseanne premieres Tuesday on ABC after a 21-year absence. The original series ran on ABC for nine seasons.",

This forecast -- which has been updated every 1-2 days since mid-March -- is \"highly variable,\" the ESA website states.\n\nA radar image depicts Tiangong-1 from a different angle, taken on February 2 2018 using the TIRA observatory in Wachtberg near Bonn in Germany.

The radar, Fraunhofer FHR reports, will determine the way Tiangong-1 rotates -- an important influence on the space station's trajectory. The institute is also regularly checking whether the space lab is still intact.\n\nAlthough nobody knows where exactly Tiangong-1 will reenter, experts have predicted it will reach the Earth's atmosphere somewhere between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south. This region spans parts of the mainland U.S., its northern boundary cutting through Oregon, Michigan and Buffalo, New York. The ESA has released a map showing the areas Tiangong-1 might reenter.\n\nRead more: Tiangong-1: Chinese Space Station Is About to Come Crashing Down to Earth, but Don't Panic\n\nMost of the space station should burn up upon re-entry, and debris that survives is incredibly unlikely to hit a human being. In fact, the chance of an individual being hit by a piece of Tiangong-1 is about a million times smaller than the odds of winning the lottery, The Aerospace Company website states. And that's if you're in one of the areas Tiangong-1 debris is most likely to fall.",

What could be better than measuring the Earth from the outside?\n\nEverything we knew about the space environment we had learned from inside the envelope of the atmosphere. The first satellite could change everything.\n\nThe IGY committee decided to add a satellite launch to the program, and the \"space race\" suddenly became real.\n\nSix nations were predicted to have the capability to launch a satellite. They were the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and Australia.\n\nThis was before NASA existed. The United Nations space treaties had not yet been written. The IGY was effectively building the first road map for using space.\n\nWaging peace in the Cold War\n\nVanguard 1 was intended to make the US the first nation in space - hence its name, meaning \"leading the way\". The term also refers to the advance troops of a military attack.\n\nSpace exploration was not just about science. It was also about winning hearts and minds. These first satellites were ideological weapons to demonstrate the technological superiority of capitalism - or communism.\n\nThe problem was that the IGY was a civilian scientific program, but the rocket programs were military.\n\nProject Vanguard was run by the US Naval Research Laboratory. Public perception was important, and they tried to give the satellite a civilian spin to present the US's intentions in space as peaceful.\n\nThis meant the launch rocket should not be a missile, but a scientific rocket, made for research purposes. Such \"sounding rockets\" were, however, part of the military programs too -- their purpose was to gather information about the little-known upper atmosphere for weapons development.\n\nKeep watching the skies!\n\nThe astronomer Fred Whipple, from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, had an idea for the IGY satellite program that would help Project Vanguard present the right image and contribute to the scientific outcomes.\n\nIt was all well and good to launch a satellite, but you also had to know where it was in space so that you could collect its data. In the 1950s, the technology to do this was still in its infancy.\n\nAnd in the words of science fiction author Douglas Adams, space is big. Really big. When something the size of a grapefruit is launched, you can predict where it should end up, but you don't know if it's there until you've seen it. Someone has to look for it.\n\nThis was the purpose of Whipple's Project Moonwatch. Volunteers -- nowadays we would call them citizen scientists -- across the globe watched for the satellite using binoculars and telescopes supplied by the Smithsonian. But their first satellite sighting was not Vanguard 1. The Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 became the first human artefact in orbit on October 4, 1957.\n\nVanguard 1's descendants\n\nSix months later, on March 17, 1958, the little polished sphere was lofted up to a minimum height of around 600km above the Earth, and there it has stayed, long after its batteries died. Technically, Vanguard 1 is space junk; but it doesn't pose a great collision risk to other satellites. It has survived so long simply because its orbit is higher than the other early satellites.\n\nThe historians Constance Green and Milton Lomask say that Vangaurd 1 is the \"the progenitor of all American space exploration today\". It wasn't just the satellite, it was the support systems too, such as the tracking network hosted by multiple nations.\n\nIt was Soviet leader Nikita Krushschev who called Vanguard 1 the \"grapefruit satellite\", and he didn't mean it as a compliment. But funnily enough, after satellites weighing thousands of kilograms and the size of double-decker buses, the current trend is back to small satellites.\n\nRather than fruit, these satellites are likened to loaves of bread or washing machines. They're cheap to build, with off-the-shelf components, and cheap to launch. They're not meant to stay in orbit for centuries. They'll do their job for a few months or years, and then self-immolate in the atmosphere.\n\nThere has been a long tradition of amateur satellites, but now space is more accessible than ever before. Students and space start-ups can get into orbit at a fraction of the cost it used to take. It's revitalising the space economy and allowing a greater number of people to participate.\n\nFor example, QB50 is an international collaboration to launch 50 cubesats to explore the lower thermosphere. So far, 36 have been launched, including three from Australia last year.\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX company is planning to launch a network of more than 7,500 small satellites over the next few years, to deliver broadband internet. (There are major concerns about how they will contribute to the space junk problem, however).\n\nWhen Vanguard 1 was launched, its only companions were Explorer 1 and Sputnik 2. Soon it may have thousands of descendants swarming around it.\n\nThe little satellite meant to represent the peaceful uses of outer space is a physical reminder of the competition to imprint space with meaning in the early years of the Space Age. Now, 60 years on, it seems we are on the cusp of a new age in space.\n\nAlice Gorman, Senior Lecturer in archaeology and space studies at Flinders University, is a panellist for two events at 2018 World Science Festival Brisbane - Space Junk: Cleaning Up After Ourselves (22 March) and Space Invaders: To Infinity and Beyond (24 March).",

                "body": "This article originally appeared on The Conversation.\n\nDespite legitimate concerns about the effects of placing school resource officers in the nation's schools, the reality is having these officers on a school's campus can literally save lives and avert tragedy.\n\nThat much became clear on March 20, when school resource officer Blaine Gaskill rushed toward a shooter who had opened fire at Great Mills High School in Maryland. He effectively stopped the shooter, who had already wounded two students.\n\nCameron Kasky Jr. (C), a student who was at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during a mass shooting, embraces the police officer Brad Griesinger in front of the school, after the police security perimeter was removed, in Parkland, Florida, U.S., February 18, 2018.

At Marjory Stoneman, 17 people, mostly students, were killed on Feb. 14.\n\nSo why do some resource officers perform so well while others don't?\n\nThe need for training and standards\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nWhat makes a school resource officer successful, though, isn't only about how they respond to emergencies. In fact, a critical part of their role is in prevention. Stopping school violence before it ever begins relies heavily on the training that school resource officers, commonly referred to as SROs, receive or don't receive.\n\nI make these observations as the director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center and as one who has co-authored a technical report on campus violence prevention and response to active shooters.\n\nIncredibly, there are no national standards -- and in many cases no state standards -- for school resource officer training. That means there is little consistency in how SROs are prepared to work in schools.\n\nWhile school resource officers have already undergone regular police training, SRO training that exists tends to focus on legal issues or school security, as opposed to other things like de-escalation techniques, bullying and cyberbullying, child development, symptoms of trauma, or educational issues, such as working with children with special needs.\n\nHow school officers could make things worse\n\nIn my opinion, this lack of training is one of the factors that is fueling the debate over the use of police officers in schools. The U.S. Department of Education has recommended that school resource officers not be involved in school discipline, as inadequately trained officers may inadvertently escalate problems or criminalize students and contribute to what has come to be known as the \"school-to-prison pipeline.\" This is a particularly sensitive issue when it comes to dealing with minority and disabled students.\n\nIn 2015, Deputy Ben Fields garnered national attention when a cellphone video emerged of him appearing to body slam and drag a female student across a classroom at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, South Carolina. Such incidents force us to question the wisdom of putting police officers, particularly officers not trained to work with children, in American high schools.\n\nTo complicate things further, one study that examined the impact of SROs found that their presence in schools was not all good or bad. For instance, while arrests for disorderly conduct increased, arrests for more serious offenses decreased.\n\nAnd yet other studies suggest how positive an influence school resource officers can be. Research on almost 2,000 students found that youth who had positive opinions about police officers reported feeling safer in schools with SROs present. In a study in which researchers interviewed dozens of SROs, officers themselves tend to emphasize the importance of informal discussions and education, instead of being overly reliant on formal discipline, whenever possible.\n\nTraining is emerging as key in helping SROs successfully increase school safety, as recognized in a U.S. Department of Education guide on improving school climate and discipline and \"A Framework for Safe and Successful Schools.\"\n\nYet despite a high level of consensus among researchers and criminal justice experts that school resource officers should undergo specialized training, few of the 19,000 SROs in the United States are in fact trained.\n\nDifferent training, different outcomes\n\nGaps in training could also explain the difference between the responses in Florida and Maryland.\n\nIn \"Campus Violence, Prevention and Response,\" a 2008 report that I co-authored, my colleagues and I recommended that campus officers should all be trained in active shooter response tactics. In an active shooter situation, as my colleagues and I argued, campus police need specialized equipment to gain forcible entry into locked buildings and classrooms. This is different from traditional training, where police may be instructed to wait outside. Their staffing levels need to be adequate for the size and layout of the school.\n\nBut our report also made recommendations about prevention. A key recommendation was that school personnel need to be trained to identify students at risk.\n\nThe Parkland school shooter clearly demonstrated many such warning signs. This is one of the reasons why police there are reviewing why all these warnings did not suggest a significant pattern to local police.\n\nElizabeth Englander, Professor of Psychology, and the Director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center (MARC), Bridgewater State University.",

                "title": "Does a state have a constitutional right to abolish marriage? | Opinion",
                "body": "This article originally appeared on the Verdict site.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges in June 2015, county clerks and other state and local officials around the country began to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but some probate judges in Alabama were uncertain of their legal obligations, given a prior state supreme court order barring the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Into the breach strode the then-Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, who issued an order barring probate judges from issuing such licenses. Although Moore cited technical procedural doctrines in his order, no one who knew the man who would someday run a scandal-filled and unsuccessful campaign for the US Senate was fooled. Moore sought to undercut the US Supreme Court and the constitutional rights of lesbian and gay Americans in Alabama.\n\nRoy Moore has returned to private life, but the sentiment that drove his Court-defying order remains very much alive in the Heart of Dixie. As reported recently on NPR, Alabama and some other states are seriously considering proposals that would avoid the obligation to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples by eliminating any requirement that couples obtain marriage licenses from the state. Although the Alabama bill's sponsor characterizes his proposal as aimed at \"getting Alabama out of the marriage business,\" that is not quite accurate. The bill would eliminate the requirement of obtaining a marriage license, but it quite clearly would leave the state-recognized status of marriage intact. A similar bill passed one house of the Oklahoma legislature in 2015.\n\nDemonstrators stand on the front steps of the federal building waving a rainbow flag in protest of Rowan County clerk Kim Davis' arrival to attend a contempt of court hearing for her refusal to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples at the United States District Court in Ashland, Kentucky, September 3. A judge in Marion County, Oregon, is also refusing to perform such marriages.

They appear to be a means by which to excuse government officials who oppose same-sex marriage on religious or other grounds from having to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, the Supreme Court will soon decide whether the owner of a bakery has a First Amendment right to refuse to sell a wedding cake to a same-sex couple, but whatever result the Court reaches in that case, government officials stand on a different footing, as the saga of Rowan County, Kentucky clerk Kim Davis illustrated. Government officials may well be constitutionally obligated to issue marriage licenses where state law requires such licenses to marry.\n\nSo long as Alabama, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and other states continue to recognize marriage -- and continue to recognize same-sex marriage on an equal footing with opposite-sex marriage -- laws that change the mechanism by which any couple establishes their marriage will likely be upheld as constitutional. But what if a state were to go further? What if a state really were to get out of the marriage business by abolishing the legal status of marriage? Would that be unconstitutional?\n\nA short but insightful essay by Stanford Law Professor Pamela Karlan in the California Law Review anticipated that question five years before the Supreme Court decided Obergefell. Professor Karlan identified two potential constitutional violations. First, abolishing marriage could be said to violate equal protection if it were adopted for the purpose of denying marriage to same-sex couples. And second, because marriage is a fundamental right, the state may be obligated to make it available to all competent adults. I shall consider these possibilities in turn.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nLeveling Down\n\nThe equal protection argument meets with an immediate objection: If the state abolishes marriage for everyone, how does it deny equality to same-sex couples, who would be treated no differently from opposite-sex couples? As a general rule, states comply with equality when they extend a previously exclusive benefit to everyone on an equal basis or when they take it away from everyone. The latter approach -- so-called \"leveling down\" -- has repeatedly been deemed permissible by the Supreme Court, including as recently as last year, when Justice Ginsburg wrote a majority opinion in a sex equality case holding that Congress would have preferred leveling down to leveling up.\n\nLeveling down appears to be an option even when it is undertaken for the obvious purpose of denying a right to a disfavored group. That's what the city of Jackson, Mississippi, did in the 1960s when it was ordered to stop operating racially segregated public swimming pools; it closed all of its public swimming pools. Observing that, despite the city's evil intentions, its actions did not result in unequal treatment, the Supreme Court rejected an equal protection challenge to the pool closings in the 1971 case of Palmer v. Thompson.\n\nProfessor Karlan writes that Palmer might not be decided the same way today, because it \"rested in substantial part on the since-eroded proposition that the motive or purpose behind a law is irrelevant to its constitutionality.\" That's true, but Palmer also rested on the proposition that the African American residents of Jackson were not materially disadvantaged by the city's closing of the pools. The post-Palmer cases that make illicit motive actionable all involve both illicit motive and some kind of disparate impact.\n\nTo be clear, Palmer was wrongly decided on its facts. As Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe explained in a 1993 article in the Supreme Court Review, white Jackson residents undoubtedly had greater access to private (racially segregated) pools than African American Jackson residents had, so, in addition to an illicit purpose, the pool closings did have a disparate racial impact.\n\nStill, the general principle of Palmer may well survive: when government levels down, even with an illicit purpose, there is no equal protection violation in the absence of a disparate impact. And if that principle survives, then a state's complete abolition of marriage would be consistent with equal protection, because it would affect all married and potentially married couples equally.\n\nAn Unusual Fundamental Right\n\nEven assuming that Palmer remains good law, however, there is an obvious distinction between shutting down public swimming pools and shutting down state recognition of marriage. There is no constitutional right to swim in a public pool, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that marriage is a fundamental constitutional right. Indeed, in Obergefell itself, Justice Kennedy's majority opinion placed chief reliance on the liberty to marry, with principles of equality entering into the analysis only secondarily.\n\nLeveling down may be a valid response to remedy a denial of equality, but where the vice of a law is its denial of liberty, taking the liberty at issue away from a larger group exacerbates rather than remedies the violation.\n\nAnd yet, a right to marry is an odd kind of fundamental right. Except in special circumstances, such as the right to free counsel for indigents in criminal cases, the US Constitution protects rights against government interference, rather than rights to government assistance or recognition. In that sense, the right to marry differs from other fundamental rights that the Court has found in the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nA right to use contraception is a right to use it without penalty by the government. Likewise, a right to abortion is a right to an abortion without undue government interference. So too, the right of adults to consensual sexual relations regardless of the sex of their partners protects against government regulation of such relations. By contrast, the right to marry asks the government to do more than stay out of the way.\n\nDissenting in Obergefell, Justice Thomas made just that point. By failing to recognize marriage, he said, states were not restricting anyone's ability \"to enter same-sex relationships, to engage in intimate behavior, to make vows to their partners in public ceremonies, to engage in religious wedding ceremonies, to hold themselves out as married, or to raise children.\" Justice Thomas protested that \"receiving governmental recognition and benefits has nothing to do with any understanding of 'liberty' that the Framers would have recognized.\"\n\nJustice Thomas was wrong about the bottom line in Obergefell, because he failed to take seriously the equal protection argument for same-sex marriage in states that recognize opposite-sex marriage. But he had a fair point about liberty, did he not? And if so, does that mean that a state really could abolish marriage for everyone?\n\nThe Obergefell majority did not directly address this question, because it did not need to. Neither have any of the other cases involving marriage in the Supreme Court. In those other cases -- chiefly Loving v. Virginia, which involved the right to interracial marriage, and Zablocki v. Redhail, which involved the right to marry by a person under court order to pay child support -- the state generally recognized marriage but limited the right to certain people under certain circumstances. Although it is clear that these cases conceptualized marriage as an exercise of liberty, the Court has never had occasion to consider whether a state could get out of the marriage business completely.\n\nYet that fact itself is telling. Conservatives sometimes insist that the Court should only recognize constitutional rights that are deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions. On that score, marriage clearly qualifies. From colonial times through the present, American jurisdictions have had laws giving recognition to marriage. Yes, a right to government recognition differs from a right to be left alone by the government. But nowhere does the Constitution expressly rule out the possibility that by denying recognition to an institution or practice, the government could be denying an aspect of liberty.\n\nWhat about Justice Thomas's complaint in his Obergefell dissent that a right to affirmative recognition of marriage would have been unrecognizable by the Framers? Perhaps the best answer appears in a majority opinion authored by Justice Kennedy in another gay rights case. In Lawrence v. Texas, he wrote: \"Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific.\" If they had been more specific, however, constitutional law would probably be less interesting!\n\nPostscript: I dedicate this column to the memory of my dear friend Julie Hilden. I set out a few thoughts on Julie's life and work on my blog. Here I would just add that same-sex marriage was an issue of personal importance to Julie, who, out of solidarity, delayed marrying her longtime partner until there was marriage equality.\n\nMichael C.

                "body": "Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom ramps up slowly, first introducing you to melee attacks then folding in ranged and skill attacks over the first hour or so. Nothing feels too complicated at first, and it's almost like you're dealing with a Zelda-like action RPG. But complexity mounts, especially when you've unlocked the Tactic Tweaker, which looks like a sound mixing board, covered in sliders and switches. The Tactic Tweaker allows for minute adjustments to how damage is dealt and taken, in addition to the rewards you get for winning battles.\n\nUnlocking its various features allows you to fine-tune every combat encounter, such as swapping around damage boosts to match the category of monster standing in front of you. (Bear in mind, you can't make adjustments once combat has started). Each of the four sections on the Tactic Tweaker can be upgraded to Level 10 with Battle Points, which are earned every time your characters level up.\n\nSome of the boons offered by the Tactic Tweaker will be obvious, but there are also surprising and subtle strengths available. Here's a guide to the choices you can make on the Tactic Tweaker, in order from our favorite section to the least useful.\n\nMonster Affinities\n\nTweaking these setting before any tough fight can change the tide of combat. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nWhen maxxed out, Monster Affinities can grant damage boosts against three categories of enemy, or a Level 5 damage boost against two categories. This should be an early Battle Points priority. There's nothing more useful than taking on a tainted enemy with a damage boost ready to go before combat.\n\nAt maximum, you can have ten damage boost levels active on the Monster Affinities sliders, but five is a good soft cap to place on yourself until you've upgraded other areas of the Tactics Tweaker. That will let you max out your damage boost against a handpicked enemy. Sure, it's less useful in a swarm of multiple types of foe, but Ni No Kuni II will often throw enemies from across the same spectrum at you anyway. Fight a group of goos and robots and, because they are both on the same slider, you'll only be able to set up a damage boost against one of them, no matter how high you've leveled Monster Affinities.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nArts of War\n\nThe most obviously exciting portion of the Tactic Tweaker is Arts of War. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThis is probably the Tactic Tweaker section with the most obvious appeal. Each new level lets you boost one of six combat perks:\n\nDurability - Reduces damage taken while blockingUntouchability - Increases invulnerability when evadingFleet-Footedness - Decreases battle escape timeDynamism - Improves MP restorationEagle-Eyedness - Reduces charge time for ranged attacksBrutality - Increases heavy melee attack damage\n\nSome of these perks are more useful than others. Unless you're already in the habit of blocking, ignore Durability. Combat is so dynamic that Untouchability will be more worthwhile. I never once felt the need to escape a battle, making Fleet-Footedness worthless. Dynamism, Eagle-Eyedness and Brutality are all useful, depending on your preferred combat style. One note: though Brutality seems like an obvious benefit, it can cause you to over-rely on the heavy melee attack, which is slower to regenerate MP than the light attack.\n\nAll of these perks can be adjusted at will, so you're not locked into any one configuration.\n\nSpoils Settings\n\nThe Spoils Settings can be used to increase your chance of finding rare materials. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThis one is more interesting than it first looks, so it's tempting to spend your Battle Points elsewhere. The Spoils Settings give you either-or selections for how loot is dropped or experience is acquired after you've won a fight. The first choice to unlock, \"Finds Vs. Finery,\" doesn't seem all that exciting, lets you pick between increased odds of rare materials or rare equipment. But subsequent choices you unlock include EXP vs. gold, EXP vs. materials and gold vs. equipment. Early in the game, Evan and his party will want to hoover up whatever they can get their hands on, but you're likely to appreciate the refined approach later. Being to angle loot drops toward rare materials helps out when the focus turns more to crafting later in the game.\n\nElements and Ailments\n\nUse to adjust to specific status affects. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThis category is completely useless, from my experience. Similar to Monster Affinities, Elements and Ailments has sliding scales to guard against a host of combat status effects: Blaze, Befuddlement, Puddle, Poisoning, Bedazzlement, Blackness, Scirocco and Sleep. In nearly 40 hours of playtime, I encountered status effects and ailments only a handful of times. Guarding against the right one in advance of combat would have been completely hopeless, especially since the mix of enemies aren't obvious before going into most battles. Maybe worth investing a few points in, but only after you've lost to a tough boss with a very specific attack type.\n\nShould you be dissatisfied with how you spent your Battle Points and unlocked Tactic Tweaker options, it's always possible to spend Kingsguilders to return your Battle Points to you for reallocation, though it's an expensive option.",

(AMI), the company which owns the National Enquirer tabloid, effectively freeing her from a non-discolure agreement.\n\nThe lawsuit claims she was paid $150,000 by the National Enquirer for the exclusive rights detailing her alleged affair with Trump, but the story never ran.\n\nThe fee was allegedly paid to McDougal as 'hush money' to protect Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. AMI deny the claim and say the story was dropped as they didn't find her account of the alleged affair credible.\n\nElsewhere, McDougal described Trump as a \"very kind and caring\" man who was always respectful to her, but added she didn't know he was also allegedly having affairs with other women at the same time, including with porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nShe told CNN that Daniels' claims that she slept with Trump at the July 2006 American Century Championship in Nevada took her by surprise.\n\n\"My first thought was, 'How could she have been with him, when I was with him?' The only time we weren't together on that particular trip was when he was on the golf course golfing.\"\n\nDaniels -- real name Stephanie Clifford -- is also scheduled to reveal details about her alleged affair with Trump in an interview with Cooper on CBS's 60 Minutes on Sunday, March 25.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a Greek Independence Day celebration in the East Room of the White House, March 22, 2018.

I thought I was the only one.\"\n\nShe added: \"When I got with him, there was a real relationship there. There were real feelings between the two of us. He would call me baby or he would call me beautiful Karen.\"\n\nMcDougal also apologized to First Lady Melania Trump for the affair. \"What can you say except, I'm sorry? I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me.\"\n\nThe White House has said Trump denies having an affair with McDougal.",

The whales were first discovered by a local fisherman early on Friday morning.\n\nRescuers were rushing to save 15 survivors, with local volunteers and vets attempting to keep them alive while they waited for a suitable time to help them back out to sea.

Right now, we are focused on fixing the issue.\n\n\"The explanation is simple, we don't know the extent. I would ask that people assume you may be included if personal data has been breached. We don't know if it's information related to just our employees or if it's more extensive than that. Because we don't know, I think it would be appropriate for the public to be vigilant checking their accounts and making sure credit agencies can also be notified.\"\n\nSecurity experts and law enforcement officials do not typically recommend paying the ransom demands of digital crooks -- but acknowledge it's a complex scenario.\n\nIn a major 2016 advisory on the subject, the FBI said: \"Paying a ransom does not guarantee the victim will regain access to their data; in fact, some individuals or organizations are never provided with decryption keys after paying a ransom.\n\n\"Paying a ransom emboldens the adversary to target other victims for profit and could provide incentive for other criminals to engage in similar illicit activities for financial gain,\" it continued. \"While the FBI does not support paying a ransom, it recognizes executives, when faced with inoperability issues, will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers.\"\n\nLuckily, there are some cross-industry initiatives including No More Ransom which can help victims recover from some strains of ransomware attack. In 2016, a U.S. hospital in Los Angeles paid $17,000 for its files to be restored after infection.\n\nRansomware caused a global alert last year after a variant dubbed WannaCry quickly spread to hundreds of thousands of computers across the world.",

There's nothing more annoying than needing to use a skill, only to discover out of resources.\n\nRanged attacks also use MP, so it's important that you fill that meter up by using your melee attacks.\n\nZing effects give your skills an added bonus, like a devastating final blow after a sword slash or added damage on your fireballs. After slapping enemies with your melee attacks, the meter on the left side of the screen for all weapons will rise. Once it reaches 100 percent, you'll add a Zing effect on your next skill. After you use the skill, the meter on one weapon goes down to zero.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, try to equip at least two weapons at all times, though one is always going to be stronger than the other. Keeping one at 100 percent Zing is useful, but not always necessary. Your bar fills up fairly quickly, about 7 to 10 percent per melee attack.\n\nOnce you get your kingmaker, he'll throw out a golden ball. Picking it up will initiate an awakening, which will allow you to absorb Higgledy power and deal more damage. A meter will appear where your MP bar once was and will drain quickly. Your spells cost zero Mana in this mode.\n\nKnow Your Opponent: Enemy Basics\n\nMonsters that are weaker than your current level have grey or blue names on the overworld map. Stronger ones have their names displayed in orange and red, while beasts at your same level are white.\n\nMonsters you encounter in dungeons or forests will immediately fight you if you get close enough and will create a barrier around the battlefield to seal you in. While on the overworld minimap, where all your characters turn chibi, monsters will only approach you if they are stronger and can see you. An exclamation mark will appear around their head, but if they lose interest you'll see a floating question mark.\n\nOverworld monsters can be much stronger than you, so make sure to avoid unnecessary fights.\n\nSome of the stronger monsters have charge-up attacks that can potentially kill you in one hit. When you see a bright orange glow around anything larger than you, hit him with everything you got and then run away as fast as possible. If you manage to knock the beast over, its concentration will break, preventing it from unleashing a super attack.\n\nPurple monsters hang out all over the world map and killing them nets you rewards like Angel's Tears (which resurrect your fallen allies) or Soreaways (which heal for a small amount). Don't be alarmed if they are 10 or so levels higher than you, that's where the challenge lies. Just don't waste all your items to kill a beast when there's a boss fight right around the corner.\n\nHiggledy stew! Bandai-Namco\n\nLearn To Love Higgledys\n\nHiggledys are a new addition in Ni No Kuni II. These nature sprites aid you in battle with extra artillery, heals or enemy debuffs. Collecting them is a pain, but the added bonus of an extra helper in a tense fight can't be overstated.\n\nEvery Higgledy has two basic parameters: Feistiness (attack) and Hardiness (defense).\n\nEach Higgledy has four skills, two are white (basic) and two are green (special). A white circle will appear on the ground in battle when they are ready to attack, heal or help out.\n\nPutting certain sets of Higgledys together will net you bonuses.\n\nCertain elemental Higgledies can enhance your skills by holding down R2 near one of them. You'll need a few of them to improve a spell. You can find out how many are needed in the Equipment and Skills menu.\n\nHiggledies can be cooked once you have a town at the Higglery or found in rocks around the map. They are often hidden in caves and need some sort of item offering to be coaxed out of their shell.\n\nThere are 100 Higgledys to collect in total, each with their own unique personalities and abilities. If you want to see a full list or read a small biography on your nymph friend, open the Higgledy Almanac in the Library menu.\n\nYou won't be able to level up Higgledys or cook new ones until you earn your kingdom, so equip the ones that fit your playstyle. Some heal your partners while others throw out massive waves of energy. The elements are fairly irrelevant, except for boosting your skills.",

                "body": "Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom isn't a punishing game. There's no permadeath or grueling segments without save points. But there were still a handful of mistakes I wish I hadn't made while playing. Dodging these gameplay mistakes should help you out with some of those campaign annoyances.\n\nNot Manually Saving\n\nNever forget to save! Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nNi No Kuni II is good about autosaving, with one major exception: overworld environments. Anywhere you're running around chibi-sized is a good place to keep manual saves in mind, because there's nothing more frustrating than grinding out a couple levels, then dying and losing that progress.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the WorldNeglecting Kingdom Building and Skirmish Armies\n\nYou'll need a certain number of citizens and buildings built before the end of the \"Ni No Kuni II\" campaign. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nThough the kingdom building and the Skirmish small-unit combat modes feel like fun distractions from grinding levels or pushing the campaign forward, they turn out not to be very optional. By the end of the campaign, you'll need to have Evan's kingdom at a certain stage of development to continue. Leave all that work for the moment it's needed, and you'll suffer a frustrating break in the narrative, running around gathering citizens to Evan's under-construction kingdom and waiting for money to accrue in your coffers. Picking up new citizens for Evermore is one of the more fun things to do in Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom, but its a slog busting out a bunch in row.\n\nTaking on a Skirmish every once in a while will put you in a good shape for later story points in the \"Ni No Kuni II\" campaign. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nSkirmishes -- the battles accessible from campaign flags, with military units separate from your party characters -- don't have the same clear threshold during the course of the campaign, but it's important to level those units up anyway. There's no need to churn through campaign missions for hours, but entirely ignoring Skirmishes will leave you at a frustrating disadvantage late in the story campaign.\n\nFocusing on Upgrades and Research Before Coffers\n\nAlways update your coffers first. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nKingdom building operates on a separate currency called Kingsguilders. There's an overwhelming amount of stuff to spend Kingsguilders on: new construction, upgrading existing facilities and conducting research. But there should be one obvious priority, whenever the option is available: upgrade your Coffers. Your kingdom's coffers accrue money over time, which you can then take out and put in a separate pool for spending. If you don't check in on your kingdom often, your coffers will max out and stop generating revenue. That's bad. But while expanding the ability to store money is important, the bigger benefit to upgrading your kingdom's coffers is that money will come in at an increased rate. That's good. Level up your coffers and you'll have way more money to spend, so make it your first purchase as soon as you've hit all the requirements.\n\nSelling Items\n\nSure, you don't need all these guns, but there's not much point in selling anything in \"Ni No Kuni II.\" Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nEven if you're typically conservative with your RPG inventories, it's worth being even more judicious than usual while playing Ni No Kuni II. The constant flow of stuff, from combat drops to the glittering gold dross littering the ground, makes Revenant Kingdom feel abundant. But ignore the temptation to sell off your surplus, because having the right items can save you untold hours of side quest hustle. It's very common to come across recruitable characters in Ni No Kuni II who make a specific item or items the precondition to them joining King Evan's kingdom. Sure, you could run around looking for 10 bonsai coral for an hour, but it's so much more satisfying to have the stuff already at hand.\n\nSell nothing and you'll be surprised how often you'll have the inventory necessary to complete a side quest within moments of accepting it. There are other reasons too, especially if you get into levelling Higgledies, improving spells and the other upgrades that unlock as you build out your kingdom's facilities. Many of these optional upgrades are fuelled by unexpected items.\n\nThe only semi-exception is armor and weapons, which can often be safely dumped for a few hundred extra gilders in your pocket. But even these bigger ticket items will, occasionally, be the object of a side quest.\n\nBonus tip: If you do plan on selling, there's a button for highlighting multiple objects. Maybe obvious, but if I can save you 20 hours of selling long inventory lists one item at a time, then my work here is done.\n\nIgnoring My Battle Points\n\nLook at all those unspent Battle Points in the top-right corner. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nLevelling is mostly automatic in Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom, with character stats improving on their own. But this hands-off approach to levelling makes it easy to miss out on the one area players can change their stats: Battle Points. Battle Points can be used in the Tactic Tweaker to unlock new settings. It took until late in the game to reach a point where I was making constant adjustments to the Tweaker between battles. Most of the time, it was set to the battle perks I liked and otherwise ignored. But this set-it-and-forget-it attitude makes it easy to miss out on all the Battle Points streaming in. On one hand, it's fun to open up the Tactic Tweaker for the first time in a few hours and have a ton of points to spend, but it sure seems like a waste.\n\nPretending to Care About Characters\n\nEveryone can stay, except Leander. That guy sucks. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nOnce your party has more characters than the maximum of three active on the battlefield, some are destined to be neglected. It could be you just don't like their stats. Or it might be personal -- I can't stand that pompous nerd, Leander, who's always pushing his glasses up his nose and exclaiming, \"Well!\" You might feel, as is the case in other RPGs, that you should practice player rotation, ensuring that less-used characters get in their combat time and chance to level. Ni No Kuni II even warns you that active characters get more EXP from combat. Maybe that's true, but the difference is negligible. By the time I'd reached the end of the campaign, characters I hadn't used for over 20 hours of game time had only fallen behind by two levels. You don't need 'em in play, and maintenance is essentially unnecessary, so let them rot.\n\nAvoiding Red Enemies\n\nEnemies above your level, like this Incineraptor, are marked with red font. Bandai Namco Entertainment / Level-5\n\nNi No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is too easy, so it's important to find your own challenges. Early in the game, just outside of Hideaway Hollow, you're likely to bump into some high-level characters highlighted with red font. I tried to fight a dragon-like Windwyrm, got stomped and then started taking that red font very seriously.\n\nBut don't take it too seriously. There's a sweet spot. Take on an enemy 20 levels higher and your attacks are effectively useless. Even with perfect dodges and blocks, you're wasting your time. But it's often possible to take on enemies 10 or fewer levels higher. A big monster eight levels higher than my characters came to be a desirable find when out in the field grinding. The challenge is about right and at most you're staking a handful of Soreaways.",

                "body": "This article originally appeared on The Daily Signal.\n\nOver the last decade, short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, HomeAway, and VRBO have expanded and provided an economic boom to many communities.\n\nYet several localities are pursuing onerous zoning rules and other regulations that would restrict short-term rental activity.\n\nAirbnb\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nFor many homeowners, short-term rental provides a critical source of additional income to help them pay their mortgages and to meet other financial obligations. States can protect their residents from overzealous, local bureaucrats with state pre-emption.\n\nShort-term rental helps local communities by growing the number of tourists that visit the area. A recent study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that out of all Airbnb reservations, 42 to 63 percent would not have resulted in a hotel stay.\n\nDespite the benefits to communities, short-term rental has come under increased scrutiny from state and local officials as it has expanded in both size and scope. Hotels and other legacy industries that see short-term rental as a threat to their market power have lobbied powerful legislators to impose strict requirements on platforms and their hosts.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nOne proposal, currently being considered in the Maryland Legislature, would empower localities to impose arbitrary regulations on short-term rentals while requiring platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway/VRBO to enforce them. In the process, the state would impose onerous information collection requirements on hosts and platforms, undermining the privacy of hosts and their guests.\n\nSB 1081 and the companion bill, HB 1604, are currently moving through both the Maryland House and Senate.\n\nThe hotel lobby is the primary driver behind this legislative push. Emerging home-sharing platforms like Airbnb pose a threat to the traditional hotel business model.\n\nHome sharing also limits the ability of hotels to price gouge their customers during peak times, as it provides customers alternative lodging options when they are needed most.\n\nAccording to the study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, without Airbnb, hotels would have gained $412 million in revenue -- a 1.5 percent increase for 2014. This bill represents an anti-competitive measure to stifle innovation and entrepreneurship to protect the special interest of hotels.\n\nMaryland lawmakers have enjoyed an especially cozy relationship with one major hotel. Marriott just received $62 million in state and county subsidies to build its new headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThis agreement is the second taxpayer-funded incentive package the hotel giant has received from Maryland and Montgomery County in less than two decades. Marriott is also behind the push to introduce new rules to squash its short-term rental competition.\n\nThe bill before the Maryland Legislature would enlist platforms to enforce local zoning rules and other regulatory violations. Airbnb and similar platforms would be required to remove hosts who had come under fire with their local government for any possible violation, or risk monetary fines. Overzealous local bureaucrats would have a field day.\n\nMoreover, the proposal would require the collection and retention of personal information of hosts and guests and empower state employees to demand that information on a whim.\n\nChicago put in place similar regulations that required home sharers to collect addresses and other personal information of guests. The Goldwater Institute sued the city over these and other rules.\n\nLos Angeles also proposed fining home-sharing platforms if hosts violated local zoning ordinances and platforms failed to remove the hosts. This misplaces the responsibility of who is required to follow local ordinances. The online platforms are an advertising vehicle, not owners or managers of the properties listed on their sites.\n\nState governments can protect their citizens' property rights, economic opportunity, and privacy rights by pre-empting localities from passing excessive land use and zoning regulations that result in a regulatory violation of individual property rights.\n\nIn 2015, Arizona pre-empted localities from imposing harmful regulations by passing legislation that required all short-term rental regulations to be directly related to health and safety. This effectively prohibited arbitrary regulations relating to occupancy, use, and classification.\n\nThe Arizona legislation was largely drawn from the Goldwater Institute's Property Ownership Fairness Act. The model legislation included a compensation requirement if local governments wished to impose regulations that were not directly related to public health and safety. This effectively protects a property owner's right to short-term rent their property and use it in many other ways.\n\nArizona's policy also includes a provision that allows home-sharing platforms to collect and remit taxes to the state on behalf of their platform hosts. This helps state revenue collection while ensuring that the hosts will not be double-taxed.\n\nThe tax collection process should be as straight forward as possible, so hosts can easily pay the taxes they owe without onerous registration and remittance burdens.\n\nRather than catering to powerful and entrenched special interests, states should embrace the diverse and flourishing short-term rental market, protect residents' property and privacy rights, and allow consumers to choose where they'd prefer to stay during their visit. Such an approach will most benefit their residents and businesses.\n\nRomina Boccia focuses on federal spending and the national debt as the deputy director of Thomas A.

It was a wild violation of academic research ethics. The story is still developing, but a college researcher has now acknowledged that he harvested Facebook users' data and gave it to another company.\n\nA scholar and his company failed to protect sensitive research data. A university did not do enough to stop him. Regulating Facebook won't solve these problems.\n\nWhat Kogan did wrong\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nI am a professor of media and information policy at the Quello Center at Michigan State University, and I was one of the first academics to study the internet. The quality and integrity of digital research is of great concern to me.\n\nI think the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook incident is a total disaster. I just don't think it's a government regulatory failure.\n\nHere's the story, at least what the media has confirmed so far.\n\nAleksandr Kogan is a Cambridge University data scientist and psychology department lecturer. Outside of the university, Kogan also collected and analyzed Facebook user data -- presumably with the knowledge of Facebook -- for his company Global Science Research.\n\nThrough online surveys, he was reportedly able to gather sensitive personal information on tens of millions of American Facebook users, including demographic data, private messages, information about their friends and possibly even information about the friends of their friends.\n\nKogan then provided this data to a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. According to the New York Times, the company analyzed that information, aiming to help shape the 2016 Trump campaign's messages and identify potential Trump voters.\n\nThat was never his intent, Kogan said in a March 21 BBC radio interview. He reports being \"stunned\" that his \"perfectly legal\" research on the happiness and well-being of Facebook users was deployed as a political tool.\n\nWhat Facebook did wrong\n\nSo did Facebook do something wrong, then? In my opinion, not really.\n\nFacebook already has strict guidelines outlining what can and can't be done with user data, which the researcher appears to have violated by passing the personal data he collected to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it quickly became a goldmine for social researchers. Suddenly, studies that previously relied only on survey data to gather information about individuals could directly observe how people connected to one another, what they liked, and what bound groups together.\n\nIn the early years, the company took an open and experimental attitude toward this kind of data mining, even teaming up with researchers to study how tweaking certain features of individual's Facebook pages affected voter turnout, say, or impacted their moods.\n\nThose studies, conducted without the informed consent of its participants -- Facebook users -- were widely criticized by social science researchers. In 2014, Facebook strengthened its existing guidelines on how user data can be gathered, analyzed and used.\n\nToday, the company requires an extensive internal review of every request to extract personal data from users for research purposes.\n\nIn other words, Facebook self-regulated.\n\nIt may have been lax in enforcing its guidelines, though. The company says that once it learned that Cambridge Analytica had used Kogan's data set for unauthorized purposes, it insisted that the data be deleted.\n\nAccording to current press reports, Cambridge Analytica did not comply. For a while, it seems, Facebook did nothing to punish the company.\n\nI believe this fallout from this scandal -- including a Federal Trade Commission investigation -- will push Facebook to take enforcement much more seriously.\n\nAfter all, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a March 21 Facebook post, the company \"made mistakes\" and it \"has a responsibility to protect\" its users.\n\nCambridge Analytica's Facebook account has now been suspended. And under both U.S. and U.K. law, individuals or firms accused of unauthorized disclosure of personal information can face prosecution.\n\nFor the first time in nearly a decade, less than half of all teenagers in the United States will visit Facebook at least once this month. DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat academia does wrong\n\nFor me, what the Cambridge Analytica fiasco exposes is that university ethical review processes are not yet equipped for the digital age.\n\nUniversity researchers are bound by strict ethical guidelines. Across the world -- particularly in the U.K., with its strong social research traditions -- academics who want to study the attitudes or behavior of private individuals must first pass a stringent review process. They must also obtain explicit, informed consent from those who participate in their research.\n\nIt is impossible for me to imagine that an ethics board at the University of Cambridge would have ever approved of Kogan sharing his data with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nUniversities around the globe actually encourage faculty to develop entrepreneurial companies, as Kogan did. That helps their research reach beyond campus to foster innovation in business, industry and government.\n\nBut the norms and rules that protect participants in academic research -- such as not sharing identifiable personal data -- do not stop at the door of the university.\n\nKogan's exploits show that professors' outside jobs may raise conflicts of interest and may have escaped the reach of institutional review. This is an area of academic work-for-hire that universities need to review with an eye toward updating how they enforce research ethics.\n\nI've briefed institutional review boards at a number of universities, and I can attest that members often don't understand how the internet has been transforming the way data is created, gathered, analyzed and shared on the internet and social media networks.\n\nFrequently, the authorities who grant professors and students permission to conduct their studies are anchored in the standards of medical research, not modern social science.\n\nMany schools also generally fail to understand how cutting-edge some academic fields have become. Big data and computational analytics is one of the most innovative scientific fields today.\n\nLegitimate, company-approved access to social media user data allows researchers to study some of the most urgent issues of the 21st century, including fake news, political echo chambers and technological trends. So it is not surprising that political campaigns would want to appropriate these research practices.\n\nUntil they come up with new rules, I fear universities' lack of digital savvy will remain a threat to online privacy.\n\nWilliam H.

                "body": "With one lawyer gone from President Donald Trump's legal team and another joining it, legal analysts speculated that the group defending the president from the special counsel investigation will now take a more hardline approach.\n\nOn Thursday, John Dowd resigned from the team, three days after it was announced that Trump had hired Joseph diGenova. DiGenova, a former United States attorney, is a regular fixture on television, where he has spoken often about \"a brazen plot\" to \"frame\" Trump.\n\nUntil recently, Trump's lawyers had said publicly that they were cooperating with the Mueller probe.\n\n\"The president understands we have a great deal of respect for Mueller, and the president has been determined to handle this in a transparent, collaborative way with the special counsel,\" Ty Cobb, one of the lawyers, told Newsweek in December. Indeed, Cobb and Mueller used to get lunch together when they were prosecutors more than three decades ago.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nBut that messaging appeared to shift substantially last week when Dowd told The Daily Beast that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should \"bring an end\" to the Mueller investigation. Dowd had initially informed the outlet that he was speaking on behalf of Trump, before later claiming that he was speaking only for himself in a personal capacity.\n\nThe same day that story published, Trump addressed Mueller by name for the first time on Twitter. \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\" he tweeted.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMarch 18, 2018\n\nWith Dowd out and DiGenova in, Trump could be looking for his lawyers to move forward with a different strategy, according to Patrick Cotter, an officer at the law firm Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale and a former federal prosecutor. \"As a case progresses, a client begins to feel that the strategy that one or more lawyers was pursuing isn't working out for them, and they look around for a new champion,\" Cotter said. That tends to happen during what Cotter called \"tipping points\" in a case.\n\nFor Trump, that \"tipping point\" could be the issue of whether he will sit for an interview with Mueller's team.\n\nTrump could also be looking for a new strategy. Certainly, the one emphasizing cooperation has failed to bring about a speedy end to the probe, as his lawyers had publicly anticipated.\n\n\"DiGenova's being brought in in such a public way and with Dowd leaving at the same time suggests to me that DiGenova intends to take a more aggressive, and quite possibly more public-oriented, defensive posture,\" Cotter said.\n\nDon Goldberg, who worked in the White House Counsel's Office during the Bill Clinton administration, agreed. \"DiGenova is just a flamethrower,\" he said, \"It's going to be confrontational.\" The new effort could involve \"trying to put up a wall, procedurally,\" he added.\n\nJohn Dowd, pictured here in 2011, has resigned from President Donald Trump's legal team. Legal analysts speculate that the team will take a new approach towards Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Yana Paskova/Getty\n\nDiGenova's comments on television could end up leading the defense strategy, according to Amy Sabrin, a retired white-collar criminal defense attorney who worked at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and defended Clinton in the Paula Jones case in the 1990s. \"Maybe they're going to make arguments in court that the president doesn't have to comply with any subpoenas because this is some kind of an ill-founded, conspiratorial witch hunt,\" she said.\n\nBy email on Thursday, Ty Cobb said he expects no changes for his team, but he was clear to separate his operation, which is part of the White House, from the one involving diGenova and Jay Sekulow. \"This has no impact on my team, which is me and my staff, all government employees, working at the WH,\" he wrote. \"Dowd, who I will miss, was among the president's personal counsel. He partnered with Jay Sekulow who is still onboard and working diligently.\"\n\nDiGenova did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Sekulow, a religious liberties lawyer who frequently critiques the Department of Justice and FBI on his radio show, said through a spokesman on Thursday, \"John Dowd is a friend and has been a valuable member of our legal team. We will continue our ongoing representation of the president and our cooperation with the office of special counsel.\"\n\nTrump's longtime personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz initially led the team and it's possible that he will regain a more prominent role in the legal effort, the Times reported Thursday.\n\nTrump has approached other lawyers to join, too. One of them, Theodore Olson, declined to join Trump, a partner at his firm tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nSuch a staffing shakeup among a president's lawyers, according to Goldberg, contrasts sharply with the approach of the Clinton White House. \"Most people at that level, when they have a solid legal team, they stick with them,\" he said.\n\nDespite his involvement in thousands of lawsuits over several decades, Trump has conveyed a disdain for lawyers. In his 1987 book Trump: The Art of the Deal, he wrote that when he first met legendary lawyer Roy Cohn, with whom he would later become close, he told Cohn: \"I don't like lawyers. I think all they do is delay deals, instead of making deals, and every answer they give you is no, and they are always looking to settle instead of fight.\"\n\nMore recently, in January 2016, Trump said during a campaign rally, ''Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?... I'm, like, a Ph.D. in litigation.''",

                "body": "The Legendary update for Injustice 2 adds a ton of new content and goodies for players, but it seems it has also deleted shaders from some.\n\nAccording to player reports on the Injustice 2 subreddit, the latest 1.17 update has locked shaders from being equipped from their inventory. NetherRealm Studios Community Manager Tyler Lansdown has commented on the Reddit thread, confirming the issue and promising to relay the message to the team. Hopefully, this means a fix is in the works to restore shaders in Injustice 2.\n\nWe have reached out to NetherRealm for official comment on the issue and will update as soon as we learn more.\n\nShaders are color options that can be found and purchased in the Customize Character section in the game. Those affected by the bug say their previously unlocked colors for characters have become unavailable. These cosmetic options are normally bought with in-game currency or pulled from Mother Boxes, Injustice 2 's rewards system.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't the first time something like this has happened in Injustice 2 . In September 2017, the version 1.10 update deleted gear for some players after downloading the patch. NetherRealm Studios took note of this bug and sent out word it was working on a fix.\n\nNetherRealm released another update immediately following version 1.17, but the Injustice 2 1.18 update only seems to include some general bug fixes.\n\nHave you lost your shader in the new Injustice 2 update?

                "body": "Congress is again rushing to pass a spending bill before the government runs out of money. And once again, Congress has used a must-pass bill as a vehicle for last-minute riders that protect secret political spending from public scrutiny.\n\nBut despite the anti-transparency rules in the omnibus spending bill released Wednesday night, good government activists say some of the worst campaign finance measures proposed in House and Senate versions didn't make it into the final legislation.\n\n\"We dodged a bullet,\" Stephen Spaulding of Common Cause, a left-leaning government watchdog group, told Newsweek.\n\nOne of the campaign finance riders in the House version that was dropped during negotiations between the two chambers would have repealed part of the Johnson Amendment, which bars tax-exempt churches from engaging in political activity. Experts said another rider, originally included in the Senate version of the bill, would have allowed candidates and their parties to use the same advertising and public relations vendors. Current campaign finance rules prevent that.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nBut three riders remain in the final bill, and prevent government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from implementing policies that would shine light on the anonymity of some types of political contributions dubbed \"dark money.\" These bans have been included in several iterations of spending bills dating back to 2014, but have never been codified into law through standalone legislation. The final bill is expected to pass both chambers of Congress before a Friday deadline.\n\nSome experts question why the party that controls the legislative and executive branch is using spending bill riders, instead of legislation or agency rulemaking, to advance their goals.\n\n\"Part of the reason they do it this way is these policies are so unpopular,\" Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, told Newsweek. \"There's no question Republicans want fewer finance limits and Democrats want more.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nUnlike bills, riders do not require names of individual lawmakers attached to them, meaning voters can't hold the elected officials that champion them accountable. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll from late last year showed 65 percent of Americans blame money in politics for dysfunction of the U.S. political system.\n\nOne of the riders prevents the SEC from making a rule that would require publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending to shareholders. The Obama administration had signaled support for such a disclosure rule, but it was never implemented after Obama's SEC chairwoman Mary Jo White refused to advance it.\n\nA second measure prevents the government from creating any rule that would require federal contractors to disclose their political spending. Proponents of the measure have argued that allowing federal contractors to spend \"dark money\" prevents discrimination against companies by bureaucrats who don't agree with the company's political activities. Critics argue disclosure would ensure that companies wouldn't receive federal contracts in exchange for political donations.\n\nAnother provision, first implemented in a 2014 spending bill, prevents the IRS from issuing guidance or changing rules related to how the agency decides whether a non-profit group spending money on politics is a \"social welfare\" 501(c)(4) group under the U.S. tax code. 501(c)(4) groups are not required to disclose their donors and are allowed to engage in political activities so long as politics is not its \"primary activity,\" a murky standard that the IRS tried to clarify before it was prevented from doing so by spending bill riders.\n\nIn recent years these 501(c)(4) groups have increasingly been known as \"dark money\" groups that spend all or most of their money on political campaigns with few consequences. This is due in large part to the riders in spending bills, which were a response to the 2013 uproar over how the IRS tried to handle a sudden increase in these types of groups. President Obama called the IRS's actions \"inexcusable\" and the acting IRS director resigned.\n\nTogether, these riders protect the disclosure of anonymous political spending, which is usually funneled through not only 501(c)(4) groups but trade associations, which often receive money from large corporations whose anonymity is protected by the SEC and federal contracting riders.\n\nAnonymous political spending accounted for just $5 million dollars in the 2006 election cycle before reaching a high of $312 million in the 2012 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Dark money spending in the current cycle is outpacing the 2014 cycle, the last non-presidential campaign cycle, but behind the 2016 cycle.",

The government has declared a \"national disaster\" and authorities have pushed a strict water rationing-system that offers a daily ration of 25 liters a day, per person at 200 collection stations.\n\nLooming over Cape Town's 4 million residents is the ominous \"Day Zero\" scenario, where the city's water would shut off as a conservation measure. Day Zero was originally scheduled for April.\n\n\"Every day feels just like World Water Day because of the stress we are currently in and the high risk and possibility of running out of water,\" Dr. Kevin Winter of the University of Cape Town's Future Water Research Institute, told Newsweek.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nPeople collect drinking water from pipes fed by an underground spring, in St. James, about 25km from the city centre, on January 19, 2018, in Cape Town. Cape Town will next month slash its individual daily water consumption limit by 40 percent to 50 litres, the mayor said on January 18, as the city battles its worst drought in a century. RODGER BOSCH/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe said his city hasn't had substantial rain for months now and dams have sat empty, nearing only 21 or 22 percent capacity.\n\n\"There's a real fear that we're going into something that can be very, very serious,\" Winter said. \"We don't know when our winter rains are arriving.\" Normally rain would arrive in April or May and continue into August and September. Those timetables are more reflective of patterns from 20 to 30 years ago.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nToday, sporadic rains come later and storms are \"events\" that last from one week to 10 days with very little rainfall in between. Those patterns have resulted in Cape Town seeing below average rainfall, which has not fallen in the right places. Dams have been starved, as a result.\n\nWhile the city's leaders have been trying to offset the crisis by creating a daily allowance for residents, its residents have had to live in a \"crisis\" mode, Winter said.\n\nAt one point, Mayor Patricia de Lille accused 60 percent of residents of \"callously\" consuming more than 87 liters amid repeated warnings of the dire consequences.\n\n\"It is quite unbelievable that a majority of people do not seem to care and are sending all of us headlong towards Day Zero,\" the mayor said in January. \"We have reached a point of no return.\"\n\nDay Zero may have been a \"blunt instrument,\" the mayor continued, but it proved incredibly effective. The day created a strict tracking system that enabled Capetonians to be more aware of water usage, allowing for residents to beat the originally scheduled Day Zero.\n\nEarlier this month, Cape Town officials announced the delay of Day Zero until at least till 2019, though restrictions will stay intact as the city pushes to try and keep its water consumption to 118 million gallons a day. Even so, reports have emerged that Cape Town's collective water consumption has gone back up recently. While usage will be monitored, the city still needs to make sure consumption stays adequate so that water can last.\n\n\"Day Zero can come back and it may need to be introduced again,\" Winter warned.",

Attached was a photo of bullets, a firearm and a Make America Great Again hat.\n\nThe account had earlier received a ban notice, which was later reversed by YouTube after discovering that it was a \"mistake,\" the company said.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether YouTube will be successful in moderating and enforcing its new community guidelines. A Thursday search revealed that there are still scores of videos that teach viewers how to modify their guns, including videos that give step-by-step instructions on how to convert weapons to have \"automatic or simulated automatic firing capabilities,\" which YouTube said it prohibits. Videos that included instructions on how to install bump stocks, banned from the site following the Las Vegas shooting, were also live on Thursday -- some with thousands of views.\n\nAnd, aside from gun content, videos that showed audiences how to make meth, chloroform, Molotov cocktails, and other illicit substances or dangerous products were also readily available on YouTube.",

Although it will be discouraged, firewood can still move between Wisconsin counties after March 30. But the statewide quarantine puts limits on moving certain wood products across state lines.\n\nEmerald ash borers originated in Asia but spread to the United States when they hitched a ride on wood, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Since it arrived, the invasive beetle has spread to 30 states and ruined millions of ash trees. They can expand their territory and destroy even more trees if they are transported to new areas on wood and wood products.\n\nThe beetles are small -- measuring close to half an inch -- and, as their name suggests, are emerald in color, with a purple or red abdomen. They are most prominent during June and July but are around from spring through early fall.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nTheir young \"bore into the ash tree and feed under the bark, leaving tracks visible underneath,\" according to the Arbor Day Foundation. \"The feeding disrupts the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients, resulting in dieback and bark splitting.\"\n\nAn ash tree has the tracks and D-shaped holes that are the hallmark of an emerald ash borer's work. U.S. Forest Service/public domain\n\nAn example of one of the new restrictions stemming from a statewide quarantine could be that if a business wanted to move ash logs that still have bark on them from Wisconsin to Minnesota, they may have to move the wood in the winter, \"when the insects are inactive,\" Wisconsin agriculture department spokesperson Donna Gilson explained to Newsweek.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nBusinesses will have to work with the USDA to work out the details of moving wood on an interstate basis.\n\nThat's compared to the county-by-county system in which businesses had to sign agreements that covered strategies for preventing the spread of the invasive beetles, Gilson said.\n\nLeading up to the statewide quarantine, \"all but two Wisconsin counties are either under quarantine or adjacent to a quarantined county in the state or a neighboring state,\" according to the state department's announcement.\n\nBecause the majority of Wisconsin counties have been found to harbor emerald ash borers, officials are moving from imposing quarantines on a county basis to a full-scale quarantine.\n\n\"The county-by-county quarantines have helped slow the spread of EAB over the past decade,\" DATCP Plant Industry Bureau Director Brian Kuhn said in the announcement. \"We don't want to speed the spread of EAB or any other pests and diseases through the movement of firewood. ... Firewood can carry pests and diseases such as oak wilt to new areas -- or even new pests and diseases that we're not even aware of yet.\"\n\nFor people who go camping, the department is recommending that they acquire firewood in the area where they plan to burn it or buy firewood that has been treated.\n\nWood that has been targeted by the emerald ash borer will contain exit holes in the shape of the letter \"D\" and have wilted foliage, among other signs, according to the USDA.\n\nThe emerald ash borer is an invasive and destructive beetle that kills ash trees.

                "body": "Kirby games are often overlooked. Perhaps it's the character's cute, kid-friendly look or the stigma that Kirby games are just not challenging enough for \"serious\" gamers. Despite all of that, recent entries in the series have been some of Nintendo's best, and Kirby Star Allies is no exception.\n\nKirby Star Allies is the character's first outing on the Nintendo Switch and brings the best of what the franchise has to offer while adding new characters, abilities and ways to play with friends. There's a reason \"Allies\" is in the title: you'll want to play with friends and that is, frankly, the best way to play.\n\nSTORY\n\nKirby games aren't known for their long, complicated narratives but Star Allies manages to make our favorite pink puffball's adventure feel epic. Dark energy, shaped like hearts, have fallen on Kirby's homeworld of Popstar. The sinister force has taken over the inhabitants of the world, including some of Kirby's most memorable friends and foes. Of course, it's up to Kirby to stop them, and he discovers an alien threat has come to take over Popstar.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nWithout spoiling anything, Kirby's travels aren't confined to Popstar. You'll travel the universe finding out what the villains are up to, fighting your way through hordes of enemies and bosses until the final battle culminates with some amazing, innovative gameplay unlike any previous Kirby game.\n\nNintendo\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nKirby Star Allies serves up the classic platforming action fans of the franchise have come to expect, complete with dashes, jumps, inhaling enemies and Kirby's signature float, but co-op is the key to beating the game. Players will need to use Kirby and his ability to transform enemies into friends to defeat baddies and solve puzzles throughout every stage.\n\nUp to four players can join in the action and it's the ideal way to play Kirby Star Allies. Having your friends around makes exploring every nook and cranny of each stage a blast as you use your combined powers to discover all sorts of secrets. New abilities like the Staff and Spider (my personal favorite) abilities are welcome additions to the ever-growing list of Kirby powers and are a lot of fun to master, but it's combining abilities that really makes this game a cooperative effort.\n\nKirby games let you blend powers before, but Star Allies gives it a new feel. While you can still combine powers to unleash one massive attack, now you can also merge the fire and sword abilities to have Kirby wield a flaming sword throughout the stage.\n\nCombining fire and the sword abilities makes the Sizzle Sword! Nintendo\n\nIt's a lot of fun trying to mix and match abilities to find strategies to defeat a boss or solve a puzzle. The game does a good job of suggesting which abilities work best in a given scenario without being too overbearing, but experienced players will understand the situation without them.\n\nPlaying Star Allies is one of the most fun, relaxed co-op experiences you'll have, but that's only true if you're actually playing with someone else. If you're going solo in Star Allies , you'll get a bit frustrated with the AI along the way. Your AI friends will know when to use their abilities, but, like a lot of games, will wait for Kirby to make the first move. There's something missing when you're going through Star Allies alone. You can't explore as freely and you definitely can't fight as well, which is most evident when trying to combine powers.\n\nCombining abilities in Star Allies is a simple press of the up button. Anyone on the team can do it, but if you're the only player, you have to press up to start a combination. For example, if Kirby has the Sword ability but you want your teammates who have the Hammer and Ice to combine, the AI default to having Ice combine with your Sword (even if you didn't want it) before it goes on to combine with the Hammer ability. Not only does this waste time, it makes handling a wave of villains or a boss battle consistently frustrating. One of my favorite partner skills is the Paint ability, which can conjure up a fridge with food to heal the team. However, if Kirby isn't holding the Paint ability, you'll need to hold the up button until the AI recognizes that's what you want it to do. This isn't a problem when you're playing co-op, which is the biggest reason (outside of having fun with friends) to try and beat Star Allies in a group.\n\nYou'll need to team up to unleash powerful attacks. Nintendo\n\nOnce the main story is complete, mini games are unlocked for even more co-op fun. You'll also be able to play through the story again as one of the ability partners instead of Kirby, and you can challenge your friends in time trials. There's also some replayability in the story, as you can go into levels to try to find missing puzzle pieces you may have missed.\n\nThe difficulty level of Kirby Star Allies is on par with past games, so if you're looking for something really challenging you won't find it here. That said, the the end-game bosses are tougher than they look, especially if you're not playing co-op.\n\nVERDICT\n\nDespite its shortcomings, Kirby Star Allies is exactly what the franchise needs to start its life on the Nintendo Switch. Fans of the franchise will enjoy the classic platforming and appreciate the new abilities while new players will get a taste of all the Kirby games have to offer.\n\nThe difficulty level is a bit on the easy side, especially when playing with friends, but it's the perfect game to play with kids or anyone who doesn't fancy themselves a gamer. It's charming, easy on the eyes and loads of fun with friends.\n\n8.5/10",

The West has criticized these developments, accusing Putin of interfering in the sovereignty of other countries, including an alleged conspiracy to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nAs tensions mounted between the U.S. and Russia, however, Trump reportedly broke with his administration's advice to call Putin on Tuesday and congratulate him on his election.

The pilot filmed his normal performance of intermediate aerobatic stunts. However, the angle of the plane's ascension into the sky made it so that the engine was unable to draw enough fuel from the plane's 7-gallon tank in order to maintain combustion. As a result, the engine stopped.\n\nThe pilot had never experienced such an event and was in \"a state of disbelief\" as it happened, according to CNET. However, he recovered quickly and was able to restart the plane's engine and steer away from the ground.\n\nThe engine in the stunt plane, similar to these pictured above, suddenly stopped working.

Sometimes, when the plane rolls or flips in the air, the fuel in the tank can float. This cuts off the supply of fuel to the engine, Air and Space Smithsonian reported. When this happens, the engine can suddenly cut off.\n\nRelated: Flight attendant orgy denied by airline despite being caught on camera\n\nEngineers addressed this problem, in this plane's case, by designing a flop tube, a flexible hose with a weight that is designed to keep a steady flow of fuel going from the fuel tank to the engine. According to Air and Space, the flop tube is meant to ensure that, regardless of the aircraft's altitude, the fuel and flop tube always end up in the same place, not obstructing fuel flow. However, Barber explained that a malfunction with the fuel flop tube caused it to not be able to draw enough fuel from the engine.\n\nThe entire event lasted seconds. Barber was able to regain control of his plane and survive the experience with not only his life but also a killer story to tell.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows",

                "body": "Having traces of cocaine or heroin on your fingertips isn't unusual, even if you've never used either drug, at least for the subjects of a new study.\n\nAmid the opioid epidemic -- which is impacting countries across the globe -- researchers from the University of Surrey in England explored how fingerprints can shed light on who is using illicit drugs and who has merely been exposed to them.\n\nRelated: FDA Approves Injectable Opioid To Help Fight America's Drug Crisis\n\nIn a small study, published in the journal Clinical Chemistry, a team of forensic scientists analyzed sweat drawn from fingerprint samples. Their data included fingerprints from 50 individuals who said they'd never done drugs and 15 others who admitted to using either cocaine or heroin in the past day. Despite never having used drugs, about 13 percent of the fingerprints from non-drug users revealed small amounts of cocaine and one percent of fingerprints revealed heroin.\n\nIt's possible the traces of cocaine came from touching money, considering a number of studies have shown that a majority of bills are contaminated with the drug.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"Believe it or not, cocaine is a very common environmental contaminant - it is well known that it is present on many bank notes,\" Melanie Bailey, an analytical and forensic science lecturer at the University of Surrey, who co-authored the study, said in a statement.\n\nDespite knowing this, Bailey and her team were still surprised at how high the levels of cocaine and heroin were on drug user's fingerprints, even after they washed their hands, she told Newsweek via email.\n\nA saliva drug test (pictured above) is a common method to detect illicit drugs in a person's system. But, a new, less-invasive method involving fingerprints could one day replace it. Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nIn order to tell apart who had actually used drugs and who came into contact with them via money or some other environmental contaminant, Bailey and her colleagues set a \"cut-off\", or decision level to determine what a \"normal\" amount of drug residue is. Cut-off levels are used in hair analysis -- another form of drug detection -- but not for fingerprint testing, \"probably because fingerprint testing is far less mature,\" the authors explain in their paper. Even after the volunteers washed their hands, the cut-off levels were still useful for distinguishing between drug and non-drug users.\n\nRelated: Viral Heroin Overdose Photo of Mother Unconscious in Car Helped Her Get Sober\n\nThe team plans to further explore how to use the tests to aid people in prison.\n\n\"We have plans to work with the prison service to see if the test can be applied to the new drugs that people are taking,\" Bailey said. \"We are also exploring the possibility of using a fingerprint to confirm if a patient has taken their medication because we think this might be of interest in clinical trials.\"\n\nThe research was partially funded by Intelligent Fingerprinting, a U.K.-based company which claims to have developed the world's first fingerprint-based drug testing method.",

The Deviljho is pegged by Capcom as one of the more terrifying beasts hunters will encounter in all of Monster Hunter World, so you know it means business.\n\nHowever, like other monsters, you'll need to track and find the Deviljho within the game's expansive map before you can try and take it down. You'll need to know its weaknesses and strengths before heading into battle. Here's everything you need to know about the Deviljho.\n\nWHERE TO FIND DEVILJHO\n\nTo encounter the Deviljho in Monster Hunter World, you need to complete the second main Zora Magdaros quest to unlock the Elder Recess. When you gain access to this area, go on an Expedition to the Elder Recess to start your search for the Deviljho. The Deviljho can be found in areas 5 and 6 and you can search for its tracks. Follow them until you find the Deviljho.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nThe map of the Elder Recess Capcom\n\nOnce you've encountered the Deviljho (you don't have to necessarily kill it) speak to the Jovial Scholar in the market to unlock Special Assignments. The Special Assignment \"The Food Chain Dominator\" will be posted on the boards and you can take on the Deviljho over and over.\n\nHOW TO BEAT DEVILJHO\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe Deviljho is weakest against Dragon and Thunder elemental weapons, so go into battle with those in mind. Ice elemental weapons should NOT be used because the Deviljho is strong against them. If inflicting status effects is your thing, the Deviljho is moderately susceptible.\n\nWhen confronting the Deviljho, the main tactic is to not face it head-on, as it utilizes a variety of bite attacks. It can sometimes perform three to five bites at once. The Deviljho also has an attack where it smashes its head into the ground and scrapes the ground upwards, so be sure to not only avoid the initial smash but the follow-up.\n\nThe Deviljho's weak spots are its head and chest, so it'll take skill to avoid the monster's attacks and strike at the same time.\n\nWhat do you think of the Deviljho in Monster Hunter World ?

A stream of card reveals is set for March 26, but until then we'll have to settle for this new Hearthside Chat video.

Originally called Murder on the Gilnean Express it featured a whodunit mystery, with cards to either help or hinder the investigation. Terms like Investigate, where you'd build a minion with Discover mechanics, or Mysteries, where you would Discover a minion and,if your opponent guesses what you picked they'll get one too, were tested but never approved. The only mechanic that managed to feel fun and powerful was Echo, so the Hearthstone team ran with the idea when they switched to The Witchwood .\n\nWe also got to see two new cards:\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nWarpath Blizzard Face Collector Blizzard\n\nWarpath (Warrior) 2-mana Spell: Echo, deal one damage to all minions.\n\nFace Collector (Rogue) 3-mana 2/2 Legendary minion: Echo, Add a random Legendary minion to your hand.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nBoth cards are extremely powerful, allowing you to play them in the early game for tempo or unleash a massive wave of damage later in the game.

                "title": "Elected on Trump's coattails, one offbeat official now faces a county desperate to get her out  ",
                "body": "Karen Spranger was known for showing up to public meetings wearing an outfit that looked like it was made of aluminum foil, to protest \"smart\" utility meters. She claimed that in a past life, she was an aide to Egyptian queens. And when authorities went to inspect her apparent residence, they could barely get inside because of all the trash that had piled up. It's unclear where Spranger actually lived, or if she had a home at all.\n\nThen in 2016, she ran as the Republican candidate for clerk and register of deeds in Macomb County, Michigan, a swing area that in previous elections had gone to Al Gore, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. A Democratic clerk had held the seat for 24 years, and when that person stepped aside, it seemed another Democrat would succeed her. But when Donald Trump won in the county, Spranger did too -- by just 0.2 percentage points.\n\nWhen voters went to the polls to support a candidate such as Trump, they also boosted people like Spranger. Like Trump, she was largely a political novice who billed herself as anti-establishment. But, as with Trump, victorious candidates in the mold of Spranger now have critics exploring legal avenues to remove them from office as soon as possible.\n\nIn Macomb County, Democrats who lost in 2016 believe the GOP candidates rode Trump's coattails to victory, thanks to people who voted for Republicans across the ballot. This is particularly easy to do in Spranger's county, where residents can choose to vote for a straight-party ticket, an option in only a handful of states, automatically selecting every candidate from one party. Records show that of the 188,394 people who voted for Spranger, around half, or 93,430, voted on a straight-party ticket.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"I do feel it was a very down-ballot race,\" said Fred Miller, her Democratic opponent. \"People don't really think about what the county clerk does, let alone who is the county clerk, so I don't think people were driven to the polls to vote down Fred Miller or vote up Karen Spranger.\" He added, \"I take full responsibility for my race...but I do feel a lot of the races, including the Macomb County clerk's race, could be considered collateral damage for people coming out and voting their anger, voting for Trump.\"\n\nBruce Miller (no relation to Fred Miller), a Michigan lawyer who represents a county employees' union that has taken legal action against Spranger, suggested that Trump's presence on the ballot led to an unqualified candidate taking office. \"The Democrat who was running was supposed to have been a sure thing,\" he said. \"She picked up on the Trump wave....and she has as much idea of how to run that [office] as I do of how to fly.\"\n\nSpranger was one of the most unexpected victors in her area on election night. And, in no time at all, she was widely considered unfit for the job. Yet despite this case of buyer's remorse, the citizens of Macomb County still face an uphill battle to displace her.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nSpranger was unavailable for an interview before deadline. But in a statement through one of her lawyers, Vincent Lorelli, she said, \"I have been targeted for unfair and defamatory treatment by the other elected members of the government of Macomb County.\" She continued, \"These other elected officials, to no one's surprise, belong to the other political party. These officials have been doing everything possible to discredit me, harass me and remove me from my office from the very time that I was first elected.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Macomb County, Michigan, on November 6, 2016. Local officials are now trying to remove the Republican county clerk there who likely won because of Trump voters. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty\n\nBefore she was elected, Spranger had a reputation among local officials in Macomb County for her regular appearances at public meetings. But it was not until after the election that she gained wider notoriety. And it did not take long for the problems to start, according to her critics.\n\n\"She took office and it was just pandemonium,\" said John Schapka, the Macomb County corporation counsel who is a colleague of Spranger's and has filed a motion seeking to remove her from office. After the election, even before taking her post, Spranger fired staffers in violation of union agreements, according to Schapka. Later, Schapka added, she refused to fill open positions, resulting in backlogs, including for 4,800 court filings.\n\n\"She has triggered more grievances in 15 months than every other department in the county in 10 years,\" Schapka said. The county ethics board reportedly fined her at least once, for letting non-county employees access her county computer.\n\nSpranger's troubles do not end there. Last March, just two months after Spranger took office, two former clerk's office employees filed a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit against her. They argued in their complaint that Spranger fired them because they had reported to county officials and the public \"that the clerk was unfit to serve in this vital role and that citizens dependent on the services of the clerk's office were being harmed by the mismanagement of that office.\"\n\nSpranger has denied the allegations, and a settlement conference is scheduled for April. Her lawyer in that case, Peter Peacock, said by email, \"It is my practice not to comment on pending litigation.\"\n\nThen in November, county officials called on Spranger to respond to questions under oath. If she hadn't have shown up, her critics would have had their wish and the county board of commissioners could have voted on her removal from office, the Detroit Free Press reported. Narrowly avoiding that fate, Spranger appeared for the two-hour hearing. Days later, a judge ruled that she had violated an order by retaliating against a union employee, though the judge did not impose a penalty.\n\nOusting Macomb County clerk Spranger from plum job rests on: Did she lie? https://t.co/lGq8fSkU15&mdash; Detroit Free Press (@freep)\n\nMarch 19, 2018\n\nBacked into a corner, Spranger went on the offensive, filing her own lawsuit in January. She claimed that county officials, a local union president, a judge and reporters were coordinating against her and preventing her from doing her work. The case is ongoing and she is representing herself.\n\n\"I think everybody would like her out,\" said Bruce Miller, the union lawyer. \"The question is how do you go about getting rid of an elected official?\"\n\nThat's what Spranger's opponents hope to answer with another ongoing legal effort. Schapka, the county corporation counsel, filed a motion for a judge to remove her from office for lying about her residence when ran for clerk, arguing that she must have lied about living there given its squalid condition.\n\nAccording to Schapka, when authorities went to investigate the bungalow, they found \"wall-to-wall, four-feet-deep loose garbage...dead animals, feces.... The search team had to put on hazmat suits to get in there. They had to force their way in there because the garbage was blockading all the doors.\"\n\nBut Spranger has claimed that the property is in fact her legal residence. Her attorney in the matter, Frank Cusumano Jr., did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLorelli, the lawyer representing Spranger in a lawsuit filed last June alleging that Spranger and others eavesdropped on and recorded a private conversation involving the plaintiff, said about the general criticisms of his client, \"As her lawyer, I would disagree with those assertions. I think there has been a concerted effort through all of this litigation to overturn the election results, plain and simple.\" (A settlement conference in the alleged eavesdropping case is scheduled for June.)\n\nA hearing for the residence motion took place on Monday. As of Thursday, St. Clair County Circuit Judge Daniel Kelly had not yet issued a ruling.\n\n\"Despite constant lawsuits and harassment, they have not prevailed,\" Spranger said in a defiant statement on Thursday, about her opponents. \"They will not prevail. The truth will prevail, and I will prevail, because the truth is on my side.\"",

The arms were allegedly taken from pro-Russian separatists who operate in the eastern part of Ukraine known as the Donbass. Savchenko was arrested after lawmakers voted to remove her parliamentary immunity on Thursday.\n\nSavchenko has not denied the accusations against her.

During her time in Russia, she participated in a hunger strike and showed a judge the middle finger on live television.\n\nShe was eventually returned to Ukraine in a prisoner swap in 2016, and Savchenko immediately became involved in politics.\n\n\"This is a very sad situation. She is a genuine hero of Ukraine, what she did during the war was incredible, the way she withstood deprivation and torture for years,\" John Herbst, who served as the U.S. ambassador for Ukraine from 2003 to 2006, told Newsweek.\n\n\"She's quirky and not sophisticated, and she has strong opinions that make sense to her but which are not the most sophisticated or useful,\" Herbst noted, adding that he has met Savchenko personally. \"I don't think she has a real political future in Ukraine because she isn't a good politician. But she was and in a sense still is a hero of Ukraine, even if that doesn't justify calls for revolution.\"",

The so-called \"Focused Passage\" drill would take place between April 16 and 20, after the U.S. and South Korea launched the \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Key Resolve\" combat exercises on April 1.\n\nRelated: What Does North Korea's Kim Jong Un Want From Trump?

The latest and youngest to lead his family's ruling dynasty, Kim has expanded on his grandfather and father's platform of developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles to guard against a potential U.S. invasion, but -- like his predecessors -- his weapons program has drawn intense international sanctions, especially from the U.S.\n\nNorth Korea and its various government-controlled media outlets have so far remained silent about both the upcoming military exercises and the planned meeting between Kim and Trump. A number of articles condemned the moves of unspecified \"imperialists,\" but only occasionally referenced the U.S. by name, with much criticism being reserved for conservative forces in South Korea and Japan.\n\nOn Tuesday, one commentary published by the official Korean Central News Agency said a \"dramatic atmosphere for reconciliation has been created in relations between the north and the south of Korea and there has been a sign of change also in the DPRK-U.S. relations,\" using an acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.",

                "body": "Prominent Israeli Rabbi Yuval Cherlow says meat from a cloned pig would be considered kosher under Jewish dietary laws. Cherlow, who is a leading scholar on modern interpretations of Kashrut, is advocating for rabbinic approval of cloned meats in order to reduce animal suffering, decrease meat industry pollution and stamp out starvation.\n\nIn an interview published Wednesday by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, Rabbi Cherlow makes the case that transgenic or cloned meat would not be subject to the same Kashrut dietary laws that guide what is kosher, or \"fit,\" for consumption by Jews. Cherlow argues that under the halachic system, \"when a pig's cell is used and food is produced from the genetic material, the cell actually loses its original identity, and therefore it can not be defined as a prohibited food, nor can it be eaten as milk.\"\n\nCherlow says that because meat grown from cells in a lab would have lost its \"identity,\" observant Jews would also be able to eat it alongside dairy products. Non-cloned, traditional pigs are forbidden under Jewish dietary laws because they fail to meet the requirements for an animal to be kosher, or \"fit to eat\" for Jews. According to certain verses in Deuteronomy, animals must chew their cud and have split hooves. While pigs do have split hooves, they do not chew their cud, so pigs and their derivative meats are forbidden.\n\nCherlow walks through how the meat industry became more cruel throughout the 20th century and how the religious public has dealt with animals not being properly slaughtered or designated as \"prey.\" Cherlow argues that allowing genetically engineered meat from a pig would serve a two-fold purpose of reducing starvation and reducing reliance on a worldwide meat industry he sees as unclean and causing pollution.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"This new invention is of strategic significance to the world because of the fact that food resources are diminishing, while the population is growing rapidly,\" Cherlow told Yedioth Ahronoth Wednesday. \"[T]he Halachic line of reasoning must examine the need of all humanity - not only my own need. [People] will die of starvation, this [can be done] in order to prevent pollution and to prevent the suffering of animals.\"\n\nCherlow heads the ethics department of the Tzohar Rabbinic Council and is a member of the Israeli Ministry of Health's ethics committee, which decides the government's budget for new pharmaceuticals in the country. Cherlow acknowledged that advocating the consumption of meat from a cloned pig will create controversy. But Cherlow compares the rabbinic decision to allow for genetically engineered meat to the caveat decision allowing for consumption of gelatin mixed with the bones of \"forbidden\" or \"unclean\" animals.\n\n\"The leading halakhic authorities permitted eating gelatin from animal origin, claiming that in the process of production it loses its flavor, is not edible, and therefore is no longer considered edible, and there is no halachic prohibition against eating it,\" he said.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAccording to The Times of Israel, Rabbi Menachem Genack, CEO of the Orthodox Union's kosher division, allowed for meat from a lab-grown hamburger to be eaten and used in tandem with dairy products in 2013.",

A new study has sequenced the DNA of roaches, revealing exactly what makes them so resilient and perhaps giving insight into how they can be killed.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Communications, specifically looked at the genome of the Periplaneta americana, also known as the American cockroach. The analysis revealed that cockroach DNA is even more fascinating than scientists previously knew.\n\nThe American cockroach has a fascinating genome. Yves Herman/Reuters\n\nFor example, cockroaches are known for their ability to find food in even the most difficult environments. This is part of the reason they are able to thrive so well in urban areas, Smithsonian magazine reported. The report revealed that this ability to thrive in extreme environments may be due to the roaches' high number of genes that code for chemical receptors. The bugs have over 1,000 of these genes, including 154 genes dedicated to smelling and 522 dedicated to tasting. This may explain their ability to get around and find food in even the most difficult environments, the study suggests.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the WorldRelated: Termites now considered cockroaches in new classification\n\nIn addition, the study revealed how cockroaches are able to survive in extremely unsanitary and pathogen-filled environments. While most of us would succumb to disease and death, the cockroaches have evolved cells specifically designed to respond to bacteria and fungi. These cells secrete their own antimicrobial compounds that protect the cockroaches, NBC News reported.\n\nRelated: Best pet for children: Why Madagascar hissing cockroaches are ideal\n\nWhile the initial results are exciting, the team hopes to use this DNA analysis to uncover even more about the cockroach. For example, young roaches are able to regenerate legs. Better understanding these genes may enable us to mimic these traits. In addition, researchers hope to find the bug's Achilles' heel hidden deep in their genome.\n\n\"Our study may shed light on both controlling and making use of this insect,\" the study says.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows",

Details in the post said the changes will come in a few forms.\n\nFirst, the company plans to introduce a \"New Posts\" button to the app. This will allow users to decide when they want to refresh their stream and when they don't.

This change should help prevent that from happening.\n\nWhile the app won't fully return to an algorithm for chronological news feeds, Instagram said these new changes will give users more control in the app and make posts visible in a more timely manner.\n\n\"With these changes, your feed will feel more fresh, and you won't miss the moments you care about,\" the blog post said.\n\nAdditionally, there are more \"improvements\" to the feed to come, according to the post, though it did not go into detail about what those involved.\n\n\"Our goal is to be the best place to share and connect with the people and interests that matter most to you,\" the post said.\n\nThe vice president of product for Instagram, Kevin Weil, tweeted that the company hopes to share more about changes to the app with users and to work to keep their feedback in mind when making those changes.\n\nInstagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Newsweek.\n\nInstagram announced Thursday that changes to the news feed would be introduced to show newer posts first.

She is also transgender. Each day she gleefully waves goodbye to me as she walks into school with her gaggle of first grade friends. For her, school is a place where she's found love and support from friends, teachers, and community.\n\nUnlike others in her situation, Ellie gets to enjoy the full protection of living in Boston, in one of the few states that have explicitly affirmed the rights of transgender students. Ellie doesn't have to worry about which bathroom she can use, or whether a staff member will call her an old name. Thousands of students like her don't have that luxury. For many, their identity is used to define and separate them in school buildings or public spaces -- creating an environment rich for bullying by staff and students alike.\n\nGLSEN's National Student Climate Survey shows the adverse outcomes for students who feel stuck in those situations. Conversely, when students are affirmed at home and school, we've seen positive results -- students flourishing. Because of this, our family has shared our story to all who would listen. No student or parent should live in fear that their child will experience harassment, discrimination or worse. We advocate that all children deserve to have a safe school where they are valued as part of their community.\n\nVanessa Ford and her family.

Our family joined thousands across the nation protesting this political move that would jeopardize trans youth.\n\nShortly afterwards, our family was provided the opportunity, through GLSEN, Equality Michigan and The National Center for Transgender Equality, to have a small meeting absent of press with Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, urging her to take action to protect vulnerable transgender students from discrimination.\n\nUntil now, I've kept most details of this meeting close to my chest, instead focusing on policies, not DeVos as a leader. However, her actions and the actions of the department under her leadership have compelled me to speak out again -- about this meeting and the danger she poses as the head of the Department of Education.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nOn March 8, 2017, my family, along with two others, entered the Department of Education meeting space; a long table separated the families from the education secretary and her team. Ellie sat at the end of the table, drawing her comic characters, giggling when she tried out new fist-bumps with those in the room. As any kindergartner would be in such a situation, she was disinterested in those in the room and focused on her task at hand -- perfecting her Sonic the Hedgehog drawing. She answered the secretary's questions and in doing so, led DeVos to draw parallels between Ellie and her own 6-year-old granddaughter.\n\nAs my husband and I looked Secretary DeVos in the eye and told our daughter's story, we tried to be a voice for families who could not be in that room. Those families who do not have the same kind of support and safety that our community had provided us with. We pressed her about the importance of safe schools for all children and the damage -- the lives that would be lost -- if her department didn't make a statement in support of trans youth, or at least publicly share the Department of Education Model District Policy.\n\nEach family took turns telling their stories as DeVos sat quietly, speaking very little in return.\n\nAs the meeting concluded and we thanked the secretary for her time, she asked Ellie for a hug. Ellie told her no, but said that she'd give her a fist-bump -- to which Ellie pulled a favorite prank -- changing the fist to a 'squirrel' and running it up the arm of the surprised secretary. In that moment, as a mother, an educator, and an eternal optimist, I hoped that this meeting would create the human connection that would move the secretary to reconsider her actions. I hoped that putting a face -- our family's face -- to the issue would be the catalyst she needed to stand and do what was best for trans youth.\n\nTime would tell.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos make \"U\" symbols with their hands while posing with the Utah Skiing team as they greet members of Championship NCAA teams at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 17, 2017. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nWell, we've given it time and what the last year has demonstrated is that not only didn't DeVos hear us, she took direct actions to further marginalize my child and thousands like her. Her actions have actively placed thousands of transgender students like my daughter at a greater risk of discrimination while she refuses to enforce the law and investigate Title IX complaints.\n\nAs a career educator who spent 15 years teaching in D.C. public schools, I know what it means to build a school culture where all students can thrive. I also know that this country is filled with brilliant educators doing the same each day. Based on DeVos's actions and policies, it is clear her definition of education for all students doesn't actually mean all students. Her policies and actions have shown a blatant disregard for the safety and value of transgender students, students with disabilities, and students of color.\n\nThe Department of Education under the leadership of DeVos has made a conscious decision to abandon their legal and ethical obligation to protect our daughter and directly puts all marginalized students at risk. Due to the actions of the department under DeVos's leadership, many are confused and unclear about what they should do to support transgender students. Without guidance, and the power of the education department's Office for Civil Rights stripped away, what are families, teachers, and school leaders to do to protect our nation's most vulnerable? Who are we supposed to look to for help?\n\nAs Ellie enters her eighth year, we will continue to be by her side, ensuring she gets to focus on what matters to her -- playdates, swim practice, and drawing Sonic the Hedgehog characters. I'm encouraged, and inspired, by the number of young people across the country demanding our nation's leaders make school safety a top priority, including making those spaces safe for those most vulnerable. Our family will continue to stand with them all. I have no intention of keeping quiet, and will continue advocating for her and all marginalized students trapped under this department's unethical actions.\n\nVanessa Ford is an educator, advocate and mother to two children, one of whom is transgender.

                "body": "Looking for some free Fortnite or PUBG Battle Royale alternatives? Surviv.io, ZombsRoyale.io or Bruh.io are worth a look. Check out our review and tips for each, here.\n\nBattle royales are currently the most popular trend in gaming. Like hero shooters (and MOBAs before that), everyone is in a rush to develop their own Fortnite or PUBG success story. Browser-based IO BR games that don't require a console or powerful computer have popped up for players who want to fight their friends in lower resolution matches. It might sound like they are the bootleg version of their 3D rendered counterparts, but they have some real heart and real explosions. We dived into the BR stratosphere (without a parachute) and played some of the most popular Fortnite spinoffs. Here's what we found.\n\nBest Battle Royale .IO Games: Browser Based Alternatives To Fortnite and PUBG\n\nSurviv.io wants you to survive, I guess? Surviv.io\n\nSurviv.io\n\nThis is the most popular browser battle royale, and it is also the simplest. You log into a game, either by yourself, duo or with three other friends, and start exploring. There's no parachuting onto a map and no beneficial strategy behind planning your starting point. Being in the middle of the action immediately is exhilarating, you scramble to start checking houses, punching rocks and looting crates in the hopes there's a good weapon inside. There's no wait time after losing a match either, if you die you just queue up again and start the process over.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nIt's an incredibly fun battle royale. I caught myself dodging bullets and drinking sodas in absolutely no time. My biggest gripe is a small one: ammo are these colored blocks and for my first few games I didn't know that I should pick them up. I thought they were part of the scenery and not integral to success in the battle royale.\n\nSurviv.io Tips:\n\n4x scopes are broken, being able to hit enemies before they even know you exist with a machine gun is dirty.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nBullets bounce, so use terrain and walls to your advantage.\n\nDon't punch the barrels, they will explode and kill you.\n\nDo punch the rocks and trees, there can be weapons and armor hidden inside.\n\nZombsRoyale.io\n\nZombsroyale.io combines Fortnite with a browser! Zombsroyale.io\n\nZombsRoyale.io is closer to other battle royale games in terms of its play style. You start in a lobby, drop from an airplane and parachute down to pilfer chests and kill enemies. The map is huge, allowing you to hide in places until the red circle of death closes in to try and kill you. Like Surviv.io, this browser game uses circles with fists as your avatar, picking up guns that spray bullets. The UI is a lot cleaner than most IOs but I found it more difficult to use. Being able to click items on the side of the screen would be a helpful addition. Overall, if you are looking for a shameless Fortnite clone with cruddier graphics and emotes, this is the game for you. It literally has the same Tactical Shotgun and RPG as Fortnite , they aren't trying to hide what they are.\n\nTips\n\nEach weapon has a rarity, ranging from a white common to a red mythic. Always equip the better color weapons from your inventory.\n\nBarrels with a hammer and sickle flag have the best items, I'm guessing this game was designed in Russia.\n\nWait until the edge of the map to jump out of the plane, I found better weapons and less players on the other side of the world.\n\nBruh.io\n\nBruh.io is a messy game. Bruh.io\n\nThe most unique of the bunch, Bruh.io is closer to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds than Fortnite. You are no longer a sexless circle, but rather a pixelated man, woman or Ugandan Knuckles with a handgun. Ping on the server is lackluster at best; my first few games were full of people lagging out (and giving me easy kills.) The map is also much harder to read than the other iO battle royales and the environment is a muddy pixelated mess. It wouldn't look out of place in Stardew Valley, but in a game where visibility is everything, it just doesn't mesh.\n\nGame queues take longer and you have to wait until the last match finishes before you jump into a new one. That's kind of discouraging since one of the major appeals of Fortnite is the ability to jump into another game immediately. It's that need to prove yourself after a hard-fought loss that keeps these games popular, but that might not even matter to Bruh.io's fan base.\n\nTips\n\nGrab a gun besides the pistol as soon as possible, that thing is trash.\n\nIf you log into an account, you'll be able to use other avatar skins, like the dead meme Ugandan Knuckles.\n\nShotguns have incredibly short range and are inferior to the assault rifle in nearly every way.",

But that's exactly what Andrew J. Feustel admitted in a video NASA has released revealing five facts about the astronaut that people may not be aware of.\n\n\"I actually have a mild fear of heights but apparently that doesn't affect me 250 miles above the planet in a space suit,\" Feustel said in the video. \"But it is there.\"\n\nOfficial portrait image of NASA astronaut Andrew Feustel. .

In total he has spent 29 days in space, completing 42 hours of spacewalks over the course of two missions.\n\nFeustel's third and current mission will see him live onboard the ISS for nearly six months where he will eventually take over as commander in June later this year. The trip to the space station took around 50 hours aboard the Soyuz MS-08 spacecraft. He was accompanied by NASA flight engineer Ricky Arnold and Soyuz commander Oleg Artemyev.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nFeustel also revealed in the video that he grew up having two dreams in his life, one of which he ended up achieving. The first was to be a Formula One driver and the second was to become an astronaut. He also mentioned he was skilled at an unusual sport known as barefoot waterskiing -- essentially waterskiing without skis.\n\n\"I taught myself to barefoot water ski at the age of 14, and I can tell you I've swallowed a lot of lake water as a result of that special skill,\" he joked.\n\nFeustel, 52, is from Lake Orion, Michigan. He earned a master's degree in Geophysics from Purdue University in 1991 before embarking on a doctorate in geological sciences, which he completed in 1995.\n\nAfter applying to NASA, Feustel was selected for astronaut training in July 2000. In May 2009 he finally got the chance to go on his first space mission, known as STS-125 -- the fifth and final space shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.",

However, the city's mayor, Jenny Durkan, said at a press conference on Wednesday that it could enact civil and criminal penalties for firearms that are not stored safely. An individual could face penalties if he or she fails to report a lost or stolen gun, among several measures.\n\n\"We now have students becoming the mass shooting generation, and that is wrong,\" Durkan said at the press conference. \"Their message to us as leaders has been clear. We have failed them, and we must act.\"\n\n\"Responsible gun owners lock up their guns,\" Durkan said.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nGun tragedies are largely preventable, the mayor continued.

Lawmakers have also suggested expanding background checks for potential gun buyers.\n\nCurrently, a task force created to collect guns from abusers is underway for Seattle and King County law enforcement.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, about 200 guns have already been taken from individuals with domestic violence or risk-protection orders.",

Rachel Murray/Getty Images for WGN America\n\nIt's very common for women to not take their husband's surname, especially in the entertainment industry. Beyoncé Knowles, Jessica Alba and Sarah Jessica Parker kept their last names upon tying the knot. Conversely, celebrities like Jessica Biel (Jessica Timberlake), Amal Clooney, Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian West took their husband's last names.\n\nThere are anomalies like Zoe Saldana, however. The Guardians of the Galaxy star's husband, artist Marco Perego, shares her last name. \"I felt proud that my husband decided to take my last name as his own...and I his,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"I shared my hesitation with him when he told me about his decision, not only did he say, 'I don't give a shhheeeetttt!!'

Or at least, he has no plans \"for now\" to return to the franchise after that film.\n\n\"You want to get off the train before they push you off,\" he said.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War, which is coming to theaters this April, marks Evans's sixth Marvel film -- which technically is the number of films the 36-year-old actor initially signed on for. Last year, Evans agreed to extend that contract to include one more appearance in the fourth Avengers film.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"I had six films in my Marvel contract, so I could have said after the third Avengers I was done, but they wanted to make the third and fourth Avengers films as a two-parter,\" the star told Telegraph last June. \"They said they had so many other characters to fit in-Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man-and couldn't get them all into one movie.\"\n\nCap fans always suspected this day might come. Evans departure doesn't necessarily mean the death of Steve Rogers -- except yeah, it probably does. The reason? He dies in the comics. Though 2016's Captain America: Civil War managed to sidestep Steve's tragically canon fate in the original Civil War storyline, the film still set up the potential for Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) to one day step behind the iconic stars-and-stripes shield. We're guessing Stan is looking at a similar promotion after Evans jumps ship.\n\nCaptain America's death in \"Civil War\" the comic storyline.

I hate to say it, but I don't know what I'm gonna do when he's not Cap anymore.\"\n\nDon't despair just yet. Maybe Cap just gets sent to a farm to live out his retirement on.",

                "body": "On Thursday the United Nations Word Meteorological Organization (WMO) released its annual report on the global climate -- and it doesn't make for comforting reading.\n\nAccording to 25th edition of the Statement on the State of the Global Climate, 2017 was the costliest year ever for extreme weather and climate events, while the past three years have been confirmed as the hottest on record.\n\nIn addition, global sea levels continue to rise, ocean warming and acidification are on the increase and the extent of polar sea ice was well below the 1981-2010 average throughout 2017.\n\nAmong last year's damaging extreme weather events were the particularly active North Atlantic hurricane season, major monsoon floods in India and continuing severe drought in Africa, which contributed to total natural disaster-related losses of $320 billion -- a record figure after adjustment for inflation -- according to estimates from German reinsurer Munich Re quoted in the report.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nThe United States was severely affected with the 2017 North Atlantic hurricane season ranking as the costliest ever for the nation. Total damages and losses from Harvey, Irma and Maria combined were estimated to amount to a staggering $265 billion by the National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nThese kinds of weather events have the potential to cause massive disruption to communities. In 2016, for example, weather-related disasters displaced around 23.5 million people around the world, the report notes, the majority of whom were forced to move as a result of floods in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe Statement confirmed 2017 as the hottest year on record that was not influenced by an El Niño weather event -- which tends to raise global temperatures temporarily -- and 2016 as the warmest year overall. In fact, the world's nine warmest years have all occurred since 2005, while the five-year temperature average between 2013 and 2017 is also a new high. Global mean temperatures in 2017 were 1.1 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, the WMO noted.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAs a result, the overall risk of heat-related illness or death is higher than ever, with 30% of the world's population now living in climatic conditions where potentially deadly temperatures occur on at least 20 days of the year, according to World Health Organization figures quoted in the Statement.\n\nPeople are rescued from a flooded neighborhood after it was inundated with rain water, remnants of Hurricane Harvey, on August 28, 2017 in Houston, Texas. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nFurthermore, sea level rise has increased in recent years, with the melting of polar ice sheets -- mostly in Greenland, and to a lesser extent Antarctica -- largely to blame. The maximum extent of winter sea ice in the Arctic was also at a record low in 2017, while in the Antarctic, sea ice extent was at, or near, record lows for most of the year.\n\nWhile global sea surface temperatures were only ranked as the third warmest on record in 2017, a measure of the heat in the oceans from the upper layers down to 2,000 meters reached new highs.\n\nThe twin effects of warming sea temperatures and ocean acidification -- a process caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the seas -- is having a devastating impact on the marine environment, which millions of people around the world rely on. Significant coral bleaching events in the Great Barrier Reef over the past two years have only served to highlight this problem.\n\nThe report states that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now exceed 400 parts per million. This figure is far greater than natural variation in the past 800,000 years, lending weight to the view held by the majority of scientists that this recent warming trend is primarily being driven by greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.\n\nAtmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide \"will remain above that level for generations to come, committing our planet to a warmer future, with more weather, climate and water extremes,\" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.\n\nAnd from the initial signs, 2018 is not shaping up to be much of an improvement.\n\n\"The start of 2018 has continued where 2017 left off -- with extreme weather claiming lives and destroying livelihoods,\" Taalas added. \"The Arctic experienced unusually high temperatures, whilst densely populated areas in the northern hemisphere were gripped by bitter cold and damaging winter storms. Australia and Argentina suffered extreme heatwaves, whilst drought continued in Kenya and Somalia, and the South African city of Cape Town struggled with acute water shortages.\"",

Measuring about 620,000 miles², the island of rubbish is twice the size of Texas.\n\nResearcher Laurent Lebreton from The Ocean Cleanup and colleagues quantified the glut of debris in a study published Thursday in Scientific Reports. They discovered not only did the patch contain much more plastic than previously believed, but it is rapidly accumulating more and more microplastics.\n\nRead more: Microplastics: Bottled Water May Contain Thousands of Pieces of Plastic Waste\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a huge hoard of persistent ocean plastic, chemical sludge and other debris. Buoyant, hard-to-decompose trash becomes trapped over decades in the currents of a massive ocean vortex -- in this case, the Northern Pacific Gyre. This patch floats in subtropical waters between California and Hawaii.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nPlastic trash is pictured strewn across a beach at Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean. Thomas Watkins/AFP/Getty\n\nBottles, Fishing Nets, Ropes\n\nThe team used aerial images as well as data from 652 net tows to give them a more accurate picture of the trash than previously described. They found that plastics made up 99.9 percent of the debris: 46 percent was made up of fishing nets and more than 75 percent of the plastic pieces measured more than 5cm.\n\nResearchers identified individual pieces of plastic: containers, lids, ropes and bottles. They even spotted production dates ranging from the 1970s to the present decade. One from 1977, 7 from the 1980s, 17 from the 1990s, 24 from the 2000s and 1 from 2010.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\n99 Percent of Microplastic in the Ocean Is Missing -- scientists Just Worked Out How to Find It\n\nMicroplastics measuring 0.02 to 0.2 inches made up 8 percent of the total plastic. That might not seem like a lot, but it equates to 94 percent of the 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic floating in the patch. The volume of microplastic in the Great Pacific Garbage patch, they discovered, has increased dramatically since the 1970s.\n\n\"We knew most pieces are comprised of microplastics; however, when you look at the total available mass of plastic, most material is contained in large debris that may degrade into harmful microplastics over time,\" Lebreton told Gizmodo.\n\nGrowth in Plastic Pollution\n\nA growth in the volume of plastic pieces -- big and small -- has likely fuelled the team's results. The authors suggest an increasing level of ocean plastic pollution could well be behind the results, particularly after the 2011 Tohoku tsunami.\n\nMore research is needed, they said, to work out exactly where all this plastic trash is coming from, and how long it can linger in the vortex.",

When he failed to turn the children over to their mother, Coltharp was arrested and the compound where he and Shaffer lived was raided on December 4.\n\nAuthorities found Coltharp's sons but could not locate his daughters.

He claimed he was not in his right mind when he entered his guilty plea. Shaffer also maintained that he is innocent of the crimes he is accused of.\n\nThe Iron County Court judge ruled against the request on Wednesday and said Shaffer knew what he was doing when he pleaded guilty. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 8.\n\nShaffer continues to face charges, including sodomy of a child and conspiracy child bigamy, in Sanpete County Court, Daniels confirmed to Newsweek.\n\n\"These two guys, at their core, are pedophiles,\" Daniels told Newsweek.

However, over the course of two weeks it changed color to blue and began pulsating, according to a report of his case published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. It eventually became so painful, that he went to the emergency room.\n\nRelated: 'Blister' Turns Out to Be a Snail Living Under Boy's Skin\n\nIn addition to the odd lump, he also told medical staff that he recently lost 26 pounds and was dealing with a number of other health issues: 6-week history of fevers, decreased appetite and night sweats.\n\nAfter a physical examination, his doctors revealed the bump was an aneurysm, which happens when a blood vessel wall becomes weakened and starts to bulge. Although aneurysms are fairly common, in this patient's case, it helped reveal a more rare diagnosis: subacute bacterial endocarditis.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nIn this photograph, surgeons -- who are not involved in the case report described in this article -- are performing heart surgery in a French hospital. Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEndocarditis happens when bacteria or other germs enter the blood and infect the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Those with the infection usually have flu-like symptoms; however, it affects people very differently and can cause problems in areas other than the heart.\n\nRelated: Mysterious, Rare Illness Linked To Smoking Weed Causes Severe Screaming and Vomiting\n\nAlthough the patient's doctors are uncertain exactly how he contracted the infection, they believe it could be due to poor oral hygiene habits and a recent visit to the dentist for an unspecified procedure.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nHe underwent a heart procedure to replace his damaged aortic-valve, which is the valve located between the organ's left ventricle and aorta. In addition, he had surgery to repair the aneurysm on his hand. After two days of taking a 6-week-long antibiotic, his fevers and night sweats went away.\n\nWhile this case was unusual, it wasn't the first time something similar had occured. In 2001, a similar case report was published regarding a 26-year-old man who had an aneurysm on his hand, which turned out to be associated with endocarditis.",

When asked about this statement, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov later conceded that this was in fact not an advantage to Russia, given what foreign nuclear powers have at their disposal.\n\n\"The other side also has arms against which Russia cannot defend itself,\" he said at a press briefing earlier this month, the RBC news channel reported. \"In this we have parity.

On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump stated that he would sign a version of the bill.\n\nThe bill states that the Federal Government \"shall not take any discriminatory action against a person, wholly or partially on the basis that such person speaks, or acts, in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as a union of one man and one woman, or two individuals as recognized under Federal law, or that sexual relations outside marriage are improper.\"\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nThe US Conference Of Catholic Bishops has given its backing to the First Amendment Defense Act. Donald and Melania Trump are pictured meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2017.

The USCCB has been vocal in support of the legislation since its inception,\" the statement said.\n\n\"FADA is a modest and important measure that protects the rights of faith-based organizations and people of all faiths and of no faith who believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nRead more: Trump sends anti-trans pro-lifer to UN women's meeting\n\n\"For example, in a pluralistic society, faith-based charitable agencies and schools should not be excluded from participation in public life by loss of licenses, accreditation, or tax-exempt status because they hold reasonable views on marriage that differ from the federal government's view.\"\n\nIt added: \"The leadership of the Catholic Church will continue to promote and protect the natural truth of marriage as foundational to the common good. The Church will also continue to stand for the ability of all to exercise their religious beliefs and moral convictions in public life without fear of government discrimination.\"\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of LGBT rights group GLAAD, said in a statement at the time the bill was released: \"America was founded on the freedom of religion and this shared value continues to be critical to our nation's success, but it does not give people the right to impose their beliefs on others, to harm others, or to discriminate.\"\n\n\"While President Trump and the Senate Republicans behind this bill are pushing for discriminatory legislation, the LGBTQ community will not be silent and continue to protect the hardworking LGBTQ American families who would be placed in direct harm by this unjust bill.\"\n\nThe advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, meanwhile, warned that the bill \"seeks to permit discrimination by individuals, many businesses, and non-profit organizations against same-sex couples, single parents and unmarried couples.\"\n\nDavid Stacy, the Human Rights Campaign government affairs director said in a statement: \"The First Amendment Defense Act is harmful legislation that would legalize state-sanctioned discrimination and undermine key civil rights protections for LGBTQ people.\n\n\"Supporters of this legislation are using religious liberty as a sword to hurt LGBTQ families rather than staying true to our long tradition of it serving as a shield to protect religious expression from government overreach.\"\n\nThe bill comes after research by the non-profit Public Religion Research Institute showed that 61% of Americans oppose allowing small business owners to refuse products or services to gay or lesbian people on the grounds of their religious beliefs.",

He also says it's not unusual to see teachers questioning their levels of security at schools.\n\nAlthough there is a jump in fear of school safety, Dorn says schools are much safer than they were if an active shooter were to attack in the 1970s.\n\n\"If a person or student and wanted to shoot people back then, they would almost always be successful,\" said Dorn. \"In every attack, we see between a dozen or two dozen attacks are successfully averted for every attack that occurs.\"\n\nTo keep schools from having another tragedy like Parkland, Dorn said better concepts are needed than some of the methods that are being introduced in schools.\n\n\"You can have an array of concepts that school districts are spending a great deal of money on. We need to slow down and build quality approaches to stop having attacks happen in schools,\" said Dorn.",

We are living through rare times, though, and the Oscar-nominated actor just lent his considerable celebrity to a significant cause: the Parkland students' ongoing fight to stop gun violence.\n\nIn a new op-ed written for NBC News (as told to editor Megan Carpentier), Murray praised the student activists of Stoneman Douglas High School, who have become outspoken activists since the February 14 shooting there. They remind him of the Vietnam War protesters of his youth.\n\nWith historical parallels in mind, Murray was optimistic about what the young activists can achieve in the present day.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"[I]t really was the students that began the end of the Vietnam War,\" the actor wrote. \"It was the students who made all the news, and that noise started, and then the movement wouldn't stop.

                "body": "With the conflict in Ukraine, allegations of election tampering, the war in Syria and renewed claims of international espionage, relations between Cold War enemies Russia and the West are at rock bottom in 2018.\n\nIn the midst of this mutual distrust, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has announced a slew of futuristic and, at times, alarming new weapons. At its heart is Putin's ambition to return Russia to its superpower status, or at least give it the appearance of one.\n\nBut how much of this is feasible for only the twelfth largest economy in the world, a country reeling from several years of international sanctions? Is Russia re-emerging as a global power, or just pretending to?\n\nAt his annual state of the nation address on March 1, Putin announced that Russia possessed hypersonic intercontinental and short-range ballistic missiles, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and nuclear-powered underwater drones. He boasted that the sophistication of the new technology meant some weapons were \"invulnerable\" to U.S. defenses.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attends his New Year address to Russians in central Moscow on December 31, 2017. ALEXEY NIKOLSKY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe admitted that these weapons had been developed from 2001, after George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty signed with the Soviet Union. \"You didn't listen to our country then,\" Putin said. \"Listen to us now.\"\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia struggled amid economic turmoil as it attempted to privatize its state-owned industries. From this chaos rose a new class of Russian oligarchs, who amassed fortunes by buying up state assets. Under a tacit agreement with Putin -- who has ruled either directly or indirectly since 2000 -- he allowed them to protect and increase their wealth as long as they supported his autocratic rule. Corruption was not just tolerated, it became the essential oil for the gears of state.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAs the second largest producer of natural gas and the third largest producer of oil in the world, Russia is heavily dependent on its natural resources. The 2014 collapse in crude oil prices hit the Russian economy particularly hard, driving the value of the ruble down by around 50 percent.\n\nDisappearing oil export revenue combined with international sanctions -- related to the annexation of Crimea and involvement in violence in eastern Ukraine -- combined to throw Russia into a two-year recession. Maintaining high military spending is challenging for any nation. For a struggling Russian economy riddled with corruption and inequality, it is especially so.\n\nA woman walks past a board listing foreign currency rates against the Russian ruble outside an exchange office in central Moscow on December 12, 2014. KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe heavy burden of military spending\n\nSiemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and an expert in military expenditure, explained that Putin's announcement was intended to underline Russia's status as a nuclear superpower, \"even if not all the weapons announced are operational or even close to operational.\"\n\nThe announcement came around two weeks before Russia's presidential election. Wezeman noted that Putin was hoping to demonstrate that Russia's \"heavy burden of military spending is actually resulting in something.\" Though Putin comfortably won the election as expected, he would have wanted a strong turnout to give him a real, or at least perceived, mandate to rule the Russian people.\n\nRussia has increased its real military expenditure by 402 percent since 1999. Only China, at 589 percent, has gone further. Over the same period, American military spending has increased by 52 percent.\n\nHowever, Russian real spending is still pocket change compared to mammoth American and Chinese budgets. In 2016, Russia's $70 billion in military spending was equivalent to 5.3 percent of its GDP. Other countries are spending a lower share of their GDP but higher real amounts. For example, the $611 billion spent on the American military in 2016 accounted for 3.3 percent of its GDP.\n\nRussia is playing economic catch up, and it is losing.\n\nRussian soldiers stand outside a Ukrainian military base on March 12, 2014 in Simferopol, Ukraine. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe conventional approach\n\nRussia's military ambition goes beyond nuclear weapons. The country has announced cutting edge tank and fighter jet technology intended to challenge U.S. dominance in conventional arms. Two particularly high-profile projects are the futuristic T-14 Armata tank and the Su-57 fifth generation stealth fighter jet. For all the excitement surrounding them, both programs have suffered delays and ever-inflating costs.\n\nMost non-nuclear projects look likely to be delayed, scaled-down or flat out canceled. Delivery of the Su-57s should already be underway but still looks to be several years off. Russia originally planned to deploy 2,400 T-14 tanks by 2020, but production has only just started. Wezeman estimated that fewer than 200 will be deployed on schedule, while navy plans for new aircraft carriers and amphibious ships \"remain dreams.\"\n\nWith regards to the T-14, Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said, \"My favorite line about the Armata T-14 is that it is a tank so powerful it can destroy an entire defense budget.\"\n\nA T-14 Armata tank rides through Red Square during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow on May 9, 2017. NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTwo Su-57 jets were recently spotted landing at Russia's Khmeimim air base in Syria, but their arrival may not have been for purely military reasons. India part-funded the Su-57 development program, but the delays in its deployment have raised doubts over the feasibility of the project. There have even been unofficial suggestions of purchasing Western alternatives. Showing the Su-57 as at least semi-operational would be one way of convincing India that progress is being made and to retain the country's involvement.\n\nSuch challenges for Russia's conventional arsenal might go some way to explaining Putin's bombastic speech. It is the conventional not nuclear weapons of its rivals that truly scare Russia. Oliker suggested that Putin's recent emphasis on big-ticket nuclear options might suggest \"Russia doesn't have faith in the conventional capabilities that it is working so hard to build.\"\n\nWhile the Russians are fielding new and advanced systems, they are not doing so in large numbers. Both Wezeman and Oliker pointed to Syria, where most Russian forces are still using so-called \"dumb\" munitions rather than more advanced systems. The high-tech weapons that Russia has used have been deployed on a demonstrative rather than regular basis.\n\nRussian Su-57s perform at an annual air show near Moscow on July 20, 2017. The development of the fifth generation jet has been consistently delayed. MAXIM ZMEYEV/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Russia is trying to keep up,\" Wezeman said. While headline-grabbing military technology sounds good, the reality is that the country still lags behind its rivals in almost all fields.\n\nRussia simply cannot afford superpower status. \"It is at best a small medium power with a GDP similar to that of Spain, barely one third of Germany and just over 10 percent of China,\" Wezeman explained. This translates into a gulf in basic technology between Russia and its great power competitors, which is only likely to widen as time goes on.\n\nHowever, Oliker cautioned against writing off the Russian military. \"It's not a paper tiger; it's a capable force. If everybody put everything into it, I guess NATO would win. But we'd all die,\" she said.",

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was called to give testimony in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 22, amid questions over America's ageing nuclear arsenal.\n\nPlutonium cores, also known as pits, sit inside nuclear weapons and trigger the explosion, but they degrade over time or can be destroyed during evaluation. Although the Pentagon has not confirmed the effective lifespan of the cores, most of the current stock were produced between 1978 and 1989.\n\nThough President Donald Trump's administration has been bullish in its promises to revamp America's nuclear might, the supply of the triggers needed to make the bombs work is far from secure.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\nCommander of the U.S. Strategic Command Air Force General John Hyten said he was \"very nervous\" about being able to replenish U.S. plutonium triggers.

Joe Raedle/Newsmakers\n\nOn March 20, Air Force General and head of Strategic Command John Hyten, told the Senate he is concerned about the supply of plutonium triggers, and that he is \"very nervous\" about meeting Strategic Command's requirements.\n\nLike many government departments, the NNSA went unstaffed throughout the first year of Trump's presidency, and did not even have a director until February this year. This means that the new director, Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, is already behind schedule.\n\nTrump's Nuclear Posture Review has called for a slew of new nuclear weapons, including low-yield options that the Pentagon believes are needed to deter the Russian doctrine of \"escalate to de-escalate,\" in which limited nuclear strikes may be used to deter further escalation.\n\nWith Russia and China challenging U.S. influence worldwide, Hyten said it was a mistake for the U.S. to assume it could allow its nuclear weapons to age into obsolescence. \"It is now clear that the United States must have sufficient research, design, development, and production capacity to support the sustainment and replacement of its nuclear forces,\" he explained.\n\nA Russian Topol intercontinental ballistic missile launcher pictured during Victory Day parade at the Red Square in Moscow, on May 9, 2012.

Two of the women made their case in front of parliament's Ethics Commission on Wednesday, which threw their case out in one sitting. Instead, Slutsky's colleagues cast suspicion on the allegations, asking why the women had come forward around the same time and in two cases, several years after the alleged incidents.\n\nRelated: In Russia, Parliament Has Thrown Out Sexual Harassment Allegations from Multiple Women Against Lawmaker\n\nThe decision has now spurred 19 outlets to suspend work with the lower house in some form or another, including top liberal news radio Echo of Moscow, the country's most esteemed investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta and a triumvirate of independent business publications RBC, Vedomosti and Kommersant.\n\nRecommended Slideshows15In Pictures: The 15 Worst Presidents in U.S. History117The 2018 World Press Photo of the Year contest: And the nominees are...51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World\n\n\"If the rights of citizens are protected selectively, if the members of parliament are allowed to neglect the dignity and security of people counting on the corporate solidarity of the lower house, then the rights of everyone -- not just journalists -- are under threat,\" the statement from the Vedomosti daily newspaper read.\n\nThe RTVI channel also joined the boycott and underlined that it will remain out of the lower house for as long as Slutsky remains in office.

Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe accusations follow a broadly similar pattern and two of the alleged incidents took place in Slutsky's office. The BBC Russian Service's Farida Rustamova accused Slutsky of segueing their interview last year from the topic of the French elections into offers for her to work for him, leave her partner and become his mistress. Then, she accused him of groping her.\n\nRTVI's deputy editor Ekaterina Kotrikadze claimed she went to Slutsky's office seven years ago when he allegedly pinned her against a wall in order to kiss her. TV channel Dozhd's producer Daria Zhuk accused Slutsky of trying \"rudely and persistently\" to kiss her while he visited her studio as a guest in 2014, after she had ignored his emailed offer to go for a meal with him.\n\nThe country's larger, state-owned media outlets have shied away from the debate and, in the case of Russia's Channel One, abstained from reporting on Thursday's verdict entirely, the Meduza news site reported.\n\nReaction in the country's parliament, full almost entirely of Kremlin loyalists, has been strongly in Slutsky's favor and house speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said on Thursday all outlets who have joined the boycott will be stripped of their accreditation anyway, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nVolodin famously warned journalists when the allegations against his colleague came to light that if they find their work in parliament unpleasant, they should \"change jobs.\"\n\nFollowing the announcements of the boycott on Thursday, a female member of the Ethics Commission Raisa Karmazina defended the verdict, accusing the press of \"making a mountain out of a molehill.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever harassed me,\" Karmazina told The Insider news website, which noted that the lawmaker repeatedly mispronounced the word. \"I was three hundred times more beautiful than them and I was not any stupider either.\n\n\"I have been working for 50 years.

In eleventh grade, he dropped out of Los Angeles Baptist High School to pursue a career in acting to the disappointment of his parents, who argued: \"No Hammer man has even dropped out of college without getting an MBA or a Ph.D.\"\n\nHe nabbed guest starring roles on television shows like Veronica Mars and Gossip Girl, before landing his breakout role in 2010's The Social Network, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield.\n\nHe's since starred in films like The Lone Ranger, The Birth of a Nation and Nocturnal Animals.",
