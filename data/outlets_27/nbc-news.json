                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Hundreds of thousands of students gathered in cities and towns across the country to participate in numerous March For Our Lives rallies on Saturday.\n\nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, organized the event after a former classmate opened fire and killed 17 students and staff on Feb. 14. They are hosting the main event in Washington, where they will lead a march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.\n\nSince the shooting, student survivors have worked together to speak out against gun violence and demand that President Donald Trump and Congress pursue gun legislation that would make it more difficult to acquire firearms, which they believe would stem \"the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,\" according to their mission statement.\n\n\"To anybody who thinks their voice doesn't matter, it does,\" Samantha Goldberg, a 17-year-old student at Stoneman Douglas, said as she was walking to the rally Saturday. \"Every single voice comes together and makes a huge impact. This is just the beginning. This march is the first step in a long process, but ultimately there's going to be a huge change. I mean, there's not half a million people here for nothing.\"\n\nAnd what Goldberg demands of her politicians reflects exactly what the greater March for Our Lives movement has called for.\n\n\"I want stricter background checks,\" Goldberg said. \"I want no assault rifles. No one should have access to an AR-15. It doesn't make sense. An 18-year-old boy shouldn't have been able to go to the store and buy a gun and come shoot up my school.\"\n\nAcross the country, there are more than two dozen marches occurring in numerous cities, including New York, Miami, Houston, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh. Rallies were also planned in other nations such as Israel, New Zealand, Australia, the U.K., Japan, Belgium, India, France and Chile.\n\nEmma Gonzalez, one of the main organizers from Stoneman Douglas, said on MSNBC that there were more than 800 marches occurring in total.\n\n\"And that's wonderful,\" she said. \"We're so psyched, this is the coolest thing that could've happened and even Antarctica is going to have a march.\"\n\nMichelle Lo Brutto traveled to the march in Manhattan on Saturday with her family and her cousins from their home in Old Bridge, New Jersey. Around her neck she wore a sign demanding gun control in memory of her sister, Christina.\n\nIn 2012, a gunman, armed with an AK-47, opened fire inside the supermarket where he worked with Christina Lo Brutto. Christina, 18, and her colleague Bryan Breen, 24, were both shot and killed. The gunman later killed himself.\n\n\"He had severe mental health issues and was hospitalized three times and he was still able to buy [a gun] legally,\" Michelle Lo Brutto said. \"I think everyone has just had enough, they're just tired of seeing people they love get hurt or killed and they just don't want to be the next one.\"\n\nIn Washington, the main rally will host 20 student speakers who have all survived mass shootings. The Stoneman Douglas Drama Club will perform the song \"Shine,\" which they wrote, with the student choir.",

                "body": "\"They don't solve the biggest problem with our background check system which is that we don't require background checks on all gun sales,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you have better information in the system. If somebody can still go to a gun show or go to a classified ad and buy a firearm from someone without going through a background check...I think it's not nearly enough.\"\n\nA version of the STOP School Violence Act was also included in the bill, a measure designed to provide more training, more local law enforcement and security measures aimed at improving school safety -- though it's unclear, say experts, how much of an impact those approaches might have.\n\n\"Our research finds evidence that improvements to [the national background check system] might reduce suicides and homicides. We have not studied programs like STOP, but it all looks reasonable,\" said Andrew Morral, senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, where he leads an initiative to understand the effects of gun policies.\n\nOther provisions in the bill appear to simply provide annual funding for existing programs.\n\nRepublicans have said the spending bill includes more than $2 billion for school safety and violence prevention -- but Democrats have argued that the $2 billion figure is Republican spin because that total includes the standard funding for programs already in effect. Specifically, the bill makes available $75 million for state grants to develop and update school safety plans. It also includes $1.1 billion for grants that support mental health services for students as well as bullying and harassment prevention.\n\nMeanwhile, the provision addressing the gun research freeze actually provides no funding -- and, say experts, won't necessarily open the door to any new gun research, either.\n\nThat's because it simply states the obvious: technically, there has never been an outright ban on gun violence research.\n\nNot only that, the 2,232-page bill itself doesn't even include the language that Democrats championed. Instead, the wording is tucked inside an explainer accompanying the legislation.\n\n\"While appropriations language prohibits the CDC and other agencies from using appropriated funding to advocate or promote gun control,\" it says, \"the Secretary of Health and Human Services has stated the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence.\"\n\nOf course, just because there was never an outright ban doesn't mean there hasn't been an effective one.",

                "title": "A timeline of Facebook's privacy issues  --  and its responses",
                "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook's recent crisis is just one of many privacy issues that company has had to deal with in its relatively short existence.\n\nBarely two years old in 2006, the company faced user outrage when it introduced its News Feed. A year later it had to apologize for telling people what their friends had bought. Years after that, the Federal Trade Commission stepped in -- and is now looking at the company again. Facebook has a history of running afoul of regulators and weathering user anger, all the while collecting record profits and racking up more than 2 billion users.\n\nThose privacy issues are now front and center. Facebook's loose handling of how its data was acquired by app developers has plunged the company into the biggest crisis of its 14-year existence. The revelation that a data analytics company used by Donald Trump's presidential campaign was able to surreptitiously collect data on 50 million people through a seemingly innocuous quiz app has forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to issue a public apology -- and promise changes.\n\nTaking a step back to look at Facebook's pattern of privacy issues provides an important perspective on just how many times the company has faced serious criticism. What follows is a rundown of the biggest privacy issues Facebook has faced to date:\n\nFacebook was only two years old when it introduced News Feed on Sept. 5, 2006. The curated feed was intended as a central destination so users didn't have to browse through friends' profiles to see what they had changed.\n\nFacebook had about 8 million users at the time, and not all of them were happy about every move of their personal life being blasted into a daily feed for their friends.\n\nAn estimated 1 million users joined \"Facebook News Feed protest groups,\" arguing the feature was too intrusive. But Facebook stayed the course.\n\n\"One of the things I'm most proud of about Facebook is that we believe things can always be better, and we're willing to make big bets if we think it will help our community over the long term,\" Zuckerberg said in a post reflecting on the 10th anniversary of News Feed.\n\nThe outrage died down, and News Feed became a major part of Facebook's success.\n\nFacebook's response: Zuckerberg apologizes, gives users choice to opt out\n\nThere was once a time when companies could track purchases by Facebook users and then notify their Facebook friends of what had been bought -- many times without any user consent.\n\nIn an apology on Dec. 6, 2007, Zuckerberg explained his thought process behind the program, called Beacon, and announced that users would be given the option to opt out of it.\n\n\"We were excited about Beacon because we believe a lot of information people want to share isn't on Facebook, and if we found the right balance, Beacon would give people an easy and controlled way to share more of that information with their friends,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, Facebook was also talking to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about online privacy and advertising.\n\nFacebook's response: Facebook agrees to undergo an independent privacy evaluation every other year for the next 20 years.\n\nFacebook settled with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 over charges that it didn't keep its privacy promise to users by allowing private information to be made public without warning.\n\nRegulators said Facebook falsely claimed that third-party apps were able to access only the data they needed to operate. In fact, the apps could access nearly all of a user's personal data. Facebook users that never authenticated a third-party app could even have private posts collected if their friends used apps. Facebook was also charged with sharing user information with advertisers, despite a promise they wouldn't.\n\n\"Facebook is obligated to keep the promises about privacy that it makes to its hundreds of millions of users,\" Jon Leibowitz, then chairman of the FTC, said at the time. \"Facebook's innovation does not have to come at the expense of consumer privacy. The FTC action will ensure it will not.\"\n\nAs part of the agreement in 2011, Facebook remains liable for a $16,000-per-day penalty for violating each count of the settlement.\n\nFacebook's response: Facebook fixes bug, notifies people whose info may have been exposed.\n\nA bug exposed the email addresses and phone numbers of 6 million Facebook users to anyone who had some connection to the person or knew at least one piece of their contact information.\n\nThe bug was discovered by a White Hat hacker -- someone who hacks with the intention of helping companies find bugs and build better security practices.\n\nWhen people joined Facebook and uploaded their contact lists, Facebook explained it would match that data to other people on Facebook in order to create friend recommendations.\n\n\"For example, we don't want to recommend that people invite contacts to join Facebook if those contacts are already on Facebook; instead, we want to recommend that they invite those contacts to be their friends on Facebook,\" Facebook's team explained in a June 2013 message.\n\nThat information was \"inadvertently stored in association with people's contact information,\" Facebook said. That meant that when a Facebook user chose to download their information through Facebook's DYI tool, they were provided with a list of additional contact information for people they knew or with whom they may have had some association.\n\nFacebook said it pulled the tool offline and fixed it. The company also said it had notified regulators and pledged to tell affected users.\n\nFacebook's mood-manipulation experiment in 2014 included more than half a million randomly selected users. Facebook altered their news feeds to show more positive or negative posts. The purpose of the study was to show how emotions could spread on social media. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, kicking off a firestorm of backlash over whether the study was ethical.\n\nAdam D.I. Kramer, the Facebook data scientist who led the experiment, ultimately posted an apology on Facebook. Four years later, the experiment no longer appears to be online.\n\n\"I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my co-authors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused,\" he wrote, according to The New York Times.\n\nIf Person A downloads an app, that app shouldn't be able to suck data from Person B just because they're friends, right? In 2014, Facebook cited privacy concerns and promised it would limit access to developers. But by the time the policy took effect the next year, Facebook had one big issue: It still couldn't keep track of how many developers were using previously downloaded data, according to current and former employees who spoke with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhen Paul Grewal, Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel announced Cambridge Analytica's ban from Facebook last week, he said Facebook has a policy of doing ongoing manual and automated checks to ensure apps are complying with Facebook policies.\n\n\"These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps,\" he said.\n\nFacebook has also began preparing for the start of a strict European data protection law that takes effect in May. Called the General Data Protection Regulation, the law governs how companies store user information and requires them to disclose a breach within 72 hours.\n\nIn January, Facebook released a set of privacy principles explaining how users can take more control of their data.\n\nOne particularly notable principle many will be watching to see if Facebook upholds is accountability.\n\n\"In addition to comprehensive privacy reviews, we put products through rigorous data security testing. We also meet with regulators, legislators and privacy experts around the world to get input on our data practices and policies,\" Facebook's team said in January.\n\nWhen: February 2018\n\nWhat: Belgian court tells Facebook to stop tracking people across the entire internet\n\nFacebook's response: Appeal the court's ruling\n\nIn February, Facebook was ordered to stop collecting private information about Belgian users on third-party sites through the use of cookies. Facebook was also ordered to delete all data it collected illegally from Belgians, including those who aren't Facebook users but may have still landed on a Facebook page, or risk being fined up to 100 million euros.\n\nFacebook said it has complied with European data protection laws and gives people the choice to opt out of data collection on third-party websites and applications. The company said it would appeal the ruling.\n\nWhen: March 2018\n\nWhat: Revealed that Facebook knew about massive data theft and did nothing\n\nFacebook's response: An apology tour and policy changes\n\nThe world finally got the answer to the question \"Where's Zuck?\" on Wednesday when the Facebook CEO and co-founder broke his silence on the data harvesting allegations. In a statement posted on his Facebook wall, Zuckerberg avoided the word \"sorry\" but did express partial blame for Facebook's role in not doing enough to protect user privacy.\n\nHe laid out three steps Facebook will take now, including investigating all apps that were able to access user data before 2014, when the company began changing its permissions for developers. Facebook will put restrictions on the data apps can access, limiting them to a person's name, photo and email. Finally, Zuckerberg said Facebook will make an easy tool that lets everyone see which apps have access to their data and allow them to revoke access.\n\n\"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" he wrote. \"The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\"",

                "body": "'I'm bulletproof': Joe Arpaio ready for fight against Democrats in bid for U.S. Senate\n\n\"It was Republicans (in 2016) who decided that they had enough of Joe Arpaio, and while he'd excite a certain part of the electorate, he'd turn off a larger portion (in the general election),\" said Barrett Marson, an Arizona GOP consultant who is not involved in the Senate contest. \"Everybody knows who he is, and it'll be hard for him to define himself as anything different.\"\n\nArpaio, who as sheriff had made a tradition of riding atop a tank in Phoenix's annual Christmas parade, made a similarly blunt entrance by jumping into the Senate race in January, just four months after Trump pardoned him.\n\nThe president hailed Arpaio as \"a patriot\" who is \"very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration.\" But Trump has yet to endorse his Senate candidacy.\n\nRepublicans had anticipated a two-candidate contest for the nomination to replace Flake: Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force fighter pilot, and Kelli Ward, a former family physician and state senator who challenged Sen. John McCain in the 2016 Senate primary (she lost by 12 points but drew national headlines with her suggestion that McCain was too old to serve effectively).\n\nBut then Arpaio added a jolt of uncertainty to the now three-way contest.\n\nArpaio told NBC News his candidacy is serious. But he has yet to hold a campaign event, acquire campaign signs or buttons, or hire any staff outside of his longtime political consultant.\n\nHe said he didn't know how much he money he had raised for the campaign thus far. (Campaign finance reports have yet to be filed so the information is not publicly available.)\n\nAnd he shows little understanding of policy. Pressed for his views on health care, trade and tax reform, Arpaio batted them away as \"technical questions.\"\n\n\"When you're asking me now, don't forget: I just made a decision to run,\" he said in an interview in late January. \"Instead of looking at the sports page, I've got to start looking at the newspaper. I don't have the luxury of being in Washington, having all these bills, talking to my colleagues. I'm just the outside guy.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the issues, Arpaio said: \"The president is always right. I'm going to support the president's agenda.\"\n\nImmigration, the issue that catapulted Arpaio to national prominence, remains the topic that animates him most.\n\nAs sheriff, Arpaio prided himself on housing inmates, including many Hispanics, in \"Tent City,\" a makeshift jail where thousands were packed into Korean War-era tents for misdemeanor crimes like driving under the influence. There they were forced to endure the swings in the desert climate -- often freezing at night, triple digits by day -- wearing black-and-white striped jumpsuits and pink underwear.",

                "title": "Opinion | Generation Parkland: Mass shootings are stealing American childhoods",
                "body": "America's kids deserve better than living under this constant threat of mass shootings.Jun Cen / for NBC News\n\nLast fall, during a particularly loud thunderstorm, one of our six-year-old sons ran under the coffee table and curled up in what looked like the yogic \"child's pose.\" When asked what he was doing, he replied: \"I'm doing turtle time, mom. At school, they tell me to do this and stay quiet if I hear scary noises.\"\n\nAfter the Parkland mass shooting, one of our 11-year-old nephews was having a conversation about what this latest tragedy meant to him. Very matter of factly, he said, \"If somebody has a gun at school, everyone should run in different directions so that the fewest number of kids will die.\"\n\nA friend's teenager told us that he \"always looks for the closest exit\" when he enters a crowded building. The child of a physician says that he regularly thinks about whether he would be brave enough to run at an assailant in order to save his friends. A teacher told us that she worries about which kids are too slow or too loud, and whether these traits -- normal in young children -- would get them all killed. Another child struggles with severe anxiety years after a mass shooting at her school.\n\nThese worries should not be a normal part of childhood. In protest, students from around the country will be participating in this weekend's \"March for Our Lives,\" a large demonstration against gun violence. This generation of children has grown up with turtle-time, lockdown drills, ALICE maneuvers and the very real threat that a classmate will bring a gun to school.\n\nAlthough, statistically, American youth are more likely to be exposed to gun homicide or suicide than to a mass shooting, no one knows whether or how the increasing frequency of mass shootings will affect our kids and our society. By day, we work as an emergency physician and violence prevention researcher and a clinical psychologist with a focus on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. But we are also parents. Our combined experience and expertise make us particularly concerned about these events' psychological effects on American kids.\n\nResearch shows that exposure to terrorism leads to spikes in anxiety and post-traumatic stress among both children and parents. These spikes may last for months or years. Sixmonths after the Boston Marathon bombing, for instance, kids who had been at the marathon exhibited six times higher rates of PTSD than Boston youth who had not been physically present. Youth who watched more coverage of the Boston marathon bombing (and subsequent manhunt) were also more likely to have PTSD symptoms. Children who are exposed to war, even in a high-income country, have higher rates of substance abuse, post-traumatic stress symptoms and numbers of fights.\n\nMass shootings have many of the same characteristics as terrorism attacks. They are unpredictable. They are uncontrollable. And once they start, there is little that a kid (or a parent) can do to change the trajectory of violence. The survivors of such events are likely to see carnage first hand, and to know some of the victims who died. Indeed, one of the only studies looking at psychological health among youth after a mass shooting comes from Norway. In 2011, a single gunman attacked the youth and adults on a summer island camp. The youth who had been on the island during the shooting had six times the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms, compared with other Norwegian youth who had not been on the island. Youth who had seen someone killed had even higher rates of symptoms.\n\nBut while there are similarities, there is also reason to suspect that mass shootings in the U.S. are different from other types of terrorism. The perpetrator is often a classmate or someone known to the youth, which is likely to disturb their sense of safety. The children exposed to mass shootings are often younger than those exposed to other forms of gun violence. The growing frequency of mass shootings, and their rapid dissemination and re-dissemination via the media, increases the \"dose\" of terror to which a youth is exposed. Thanks to Twitter, Snapchat and 24-hour news channels, it's possible for youth and their parents who are far-removed from an incident to feel like they're experiencing the trauma first-hand.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFor the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, channeling their grief and anger into lasting advocacy is something they're learning on the fly.\n\nBut if and when they do need advice or assistance, there are survivors of previous mass shootings and more established groups willing to assist with that education. Many see the Parkland teenagers as a major new force in the gun control debate, ever since the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 14 of their classmates and three of their teachers.\n\n\"These are the students that we were waiting for,\" gun control organizer Sarah Clements, 22, told NBC News. She volunteered for the cause after her mother, a former second-grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School, survived the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n\"They are the voices we all needed to make actual change happen, so I feel a tremendous responsibility,\" Clements said. \"If I can do anything to help mentor them or help them heal, then that is what I can and should do.\"\n\nJust two days after gunfire erupted at Stoneman Douglas, Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan in the 2012 Newtown shooting, flew down to Florida to console the families just starting to experience the staggering grief that she's felt for the past five years.\n\n\"I just felt a need to be there,\" Hockley said by phone after arriving in Washington ahead of Saturday's Parkland student-organized March For Our Lives. \"I wanted to be helpful. There's no playbook for what to do next as a community.\n\n\"Stopping by the hospital, seeing the grief, seeing so much media, it felt so much like the early days of Sandy Hook,\" recalled Hockley, who co-founded the non-profit Sandy Hook Promise. \"What I wasn't prepared for is how many memories came flooding back.\"\n\nIn the weeks since, after speaking to Parkland student leaders like Sam Zeif, who she met at a Feb. 21 White House audience with President Trump, however, Hockley gained a different perspective.\n\n\"I look at them like a mother and I want to protect them, and help them go forward,\" she said. \"But this is 100 percent their movement. They own this, they're not being told what to do.\"\n\nAs the Parkland teens begin gathering for Saturday's march, adult advocates have kept step. Everytown for Gun Safety, for example, launched a $2.5 million grant program to help \"sibling marches\" in other cities around the country on that day.\n\n\"These kids are super savvy, really good with social media at an age where you can be angry, passionate around issues,\" said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, the nation-wide grass-roots arm of Everytown. \"That's an incredibly powerful and moving force. I'm very hopeful that this is a generation that will run for office.\"\n\nThey have also reinvigorated other generations.\n\nSince the Feb. 14 shooting, more than 140,000 Americans have reached out to volunteer with Moms Demand Action, according to the organization, and another 1.7 million pledged support online. Because the group already has a nationwide network in place, they can put fervor into lobbying for universal background checks and bans for domestic abusers at the statehouse level.",

When the proverbial butterfly flaps its wings in Asia, the ripple immediately shows up in the price of soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade, determining whether Shaffer will be able to profitably load his beans on a container ship to China in the fall.\n\nIn a press conference announcing the tariffs, Trump spoke of how China violated U.S. intellectual property rights while raising steep tariffs against American goods. \"They're taking advantage of the United States, we're not going to let that happen,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement, combined with Facebook's privacy woes, sent the Dow Jones plunging 700 points.\n\nOn Friday, China fired back at Trump, saying it could slap retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars of American products. In particular, it's coming after the $14 billion soybean business. And, as the number one buyer of U.S. soybeans, China has leverage.\n\nAmerican shoppers likely wouldn't see the impact of any trade war in the price they pay for Wheaties. If anything, losing an export partner could cause an increase in the existing commodities surplus and theoretically bring down prices for consumers. But there are ripple effects that can affect them down the line.\n\nWhen the farmer gets hit, so does the corn seller, fertilizer seller, tractor sales office, and hardware store who depend on him for their business. It can hurt the income of the entire local community built up around them, slowing economic growth.\n\n\"There's collateral damage,\" said William Reinsch, Senior Adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the former president of the National Foreign Trade Council.\n\n\"If [a farmer] can't unload his soybeans, he loses money. Then the bank loses money if he has trouble paying his loans. The tax base in his community suffers,\" which can lead some communities to cut back on services like police, fire, and schools.\n\n\"If you look at communities in distress because of trade, there's a ripple effect,\" said Reinsch. \"The people who are prosperous run out of money, and that erodes the tax base.\"\n\nTrump says he is taking these measures to protect workers in the steel and metal industries, who workers largely voted for him.\n\nBut other voters in \"Trump country\" wonder whether the president is fulfilling the campaign promise that they want him to.\n\n\"The rural people of this country elected Trump on the basis that he would help put value back into small communities all over this country and bring a sense of pride and authenticity back to the slogan Made in America,\" Brand Whitt, a Tennessee soy farmer, told NBC News.\n\n\"Tariffs on American soybeans will be a crushing blow\" with a \"ripple-down effect sure to come in all facets,\" said Whitt, who wrote in John Kasich in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThis is exactly what China has in mind, said Wang Jiangyu, an international law associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\"This is China's strategy: Those agricultural products that China included in its new tariffs were targeted at Trump's supporters, those states and people who supported Trump. Now the farmers have to suffer. It's a direct siege on Trump's political base -- to wake him up,\" said Wang.\n\nAnd economists say that it doesn't make sense to hurt the nation's 300,000 soybean farmers to help its 150,000 steelworkers.\n\n\"If there was an epidemic of baldness, would we help hairdressers by putting a small tax on Rogaine?\" said Sharon Traiberman, an assistant professor of economics at NYU. \"We have a progressive tax system, and we should be making it more progressive and then using the proceeds to either directly compensate dislocated workers through unemployment insurance, or we can retrain them, or we can help them move to locations with better labor market prospects.\"\n\nBack in Illinois, Shaffer says he's not sure how he'll weather the economic storm on the horizon. And he's less confident than his grandfather and father before him that he'll be able to pass the farm down to the next generation. But he has hope.\n\n\"The farmer is the eternal optimist. He puts seed in the ground in spring and hopes there's product in the fall,\" he said.",

                "body": "Getting outside -- whether for a workout or some relaxation -- can relive stress and provide an important dose of vitamin D.Nastasic / Getty Images\n\nLonger days, warmer weather and fresh starts are the hallmarks of spring. It inspires many to bust open closets and cabinets to bring new life to neglected areas at home -- which is a smart move. Decluttering can work wonders for your mental clarity and focus. We all know how cathartic it is watching those bags of junk leave the house after giving a room a thorough clean out.\n\nBut why stop with your personal space? Your physical well being may need some sprucing up, too! Leading experts across America shared with NBC News BETTER their advice for dusting off your health and wellness routines just in time for spring.\n\nSpring is the perfect time to re-evaluate your habits. \"Do you consistently put yourself and yourhealth last on the daily line-up?\" asks Dr. Jannell MacAulay, a wellness educator, performance specialist, and lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force. When you're always putting other people's needs ahead of your own, your performance as a parent, professional and leader can suffer. To break this bad pattern, she offers this advice: \"Put on your own oxygen mask first!\" You don't need to overhaul your whole life to get results. \"Maybe start your day with two deep breaths, or schedule time for a quick workout or a walk with a friend. Or just take time to make yourself a healthy lunch. Taking care of yourself is a great way to increase performance and overall wellbeing,\" MacAulay says.\n\nLiz Wilkes, CEO of national wellness provider, Exubrancy, suggests taking walking meetings over virtual ones. \"I love to use the warmer spring weather as an opportunity to get out of the office for walking meetings. Walking meetings help spark creativity, build deeper connections withcolleagues and counteract the effects of sitting for extended periods of time. Plus studies show that natural light significantly increases energy and productivity,\" she explains. Wilkes also offers this pro tip: \"Map your route in advance so you don't have to interrupt your conversation with navigation decisions!\"\n\nSure, there are plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy when the weather gets warmer, but simply getting out of the house, office, apartment or wherever you've been hibernating can be beneficial, too. \"Grab a blanket and find a spot to take in nature,\" suggests celebrity trainer and self-care expert, Rosalia Chann. \"You don't need to be active 100 percent of the time,\" she adds. Chann explains that the outdoor setting can help relieve stress and can also provide an opportunity to be present and enjoy people you love -- both ways to round out your self-care routine.\n\nNutrition expert Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN, and author of Eating in Color, says that come spring, most of us are in a vitamin D deficit. \"It's smart to get a small amount of unprotected sun exposure -- say 10 minutes a day -- in order to let your body produce the vitamin (apply sunscreen after that),\" she says. \"Vitamin D is linked to helping prevent everything from osteoporosis, to heart disease and certain types of cancer. And no one can argue the fact that sunshine just makes you feel awesome.\"\n\nTake your fitness to the next level by adding in tabata interval workouts at the end of your routine. These four-minute bursts of high-intensity training can maximize your workout and your results, according to Nashville-based celebrity fitness trainer, Josh Rogers, who recommends alternating between 20 seconds of max training followed by a 10-second rest for a total of eight rounds. \"These workouts are fast-paced and fun, and burn up tons of calories,\" he says. His sample routine: Use a burpee and plank jack as your tabata exercises. Perform 20 seconds of burpees followed by a 10 second rest, then 20 seconds of plank jacks followed by another 10 second rest, and repeat for four minutes (a total of eight rounds).\n\nSpring is the time to get your seeds planted and start growing some produce. \"Even if you only have a patio or deck, you can create a pot or growing box of vegetables and produce some of your own vegetables. You can also dedicate a certain part of your lawn or flower beds to growing gorgeous vegetables,\" says Sharon Palmer, RDN, The Plant-Powered Dietitian. Growing your own garden pays off in a number of ways. \"Studies show that people who home garden are happier and eat more healthfully,\" says Palmer. She recommends starting with a tomato plant, basil, parsley, greens, carrots, zucchini or radishes, which are some of the easier veggies to grow. Kate Scarlata, RDN also recommends spring veggies, whether you garden or not. Eating a variety of seasonal produce, such as baby salad greens, carrots, fennel, asparagus and green beans, provides a wide range of fibers. Scarlata explains that certain fibers feed the good gut microbes, while others keep things moving along your digestive tract. \"A variety of veggies in the diet is shown to bolster gut health,\" she says.\n\nNutritionist Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD author of Slim Down Now: Shed Pounds and Inches With Pulses - The New Superfood, recommends giving your spice rack a thorough cleaning. \"Dried herbs and spices add flavor, aroma and antioxidants to meals, and allow you to season foods without using excess salt and sugar. They've also been shown to boost satiety and rev upmetabolism. But, they lose potency as they age,\" she explains. Sass suggests taking inventory a few times of year and replacing your older spices with fresh stock. When you buy new spices this spring, she also suggests buying smaller quantities. \"That way, you'll go through them faster and it won't lead to waste.\"",

                "body": "The sheer volume of gun-related deaths in this country is not normal: Over 3,000 people in the United States have already died from gun violence in 2018. As a result of what seems like an endless stream of mass shootings, and in the absence of any meaningful action by elected officials, Americans have had to simply adapt to this reality -- with chilling impacts on their lives.\n\nComing attractions at movie theaters now include warnings to report suspicious activity. Houses of worship have armed guards. Opaque backpacks, not firearms, are banned in schools. We're sending Kevlar-shielded children off to learn, and seriously talking about arming their teachers. Law enforcement officers, forced to operate under the assumption that anyone could be armed and dangerous, deploy lethal force at the slightest provocation regardless of how unfounded their fears of an actual threat are -- and communities of color again pay a disproportionate price.\n\nThe depth to which gun violence has pervaded the everyday lives of Americans is shocking and unacceptable. And when the right to live free from violence, discrimination and fear are superseded by others' sense of entitlement to own a practically unlimited array of deadly weapons, something is fundamentally wrong.\n\nGun violence in the United States is a human rights crisis.\n\nHuman rights are, by definition, those fundamental freedoms inherent to every person in the world. They include the freedom to move about freely, to obtain an education, to worship as one chooses and to generally participate in society without fear. When people are prevented from following these pursuits on a wide scale, and the government does nothing to stop it, that constitutes a human rights crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress offers thoughts and prayers but no significant reform to the nation's gun laws, despite the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead. And while President Trump appeared to embrace common sense reforms like universal background checks in a recent bipartisan meeting with lawmakers, his subsequent remarks endorsing arming teachers and placing more guns in schools make his commitment to saving lives and pushing back against the NRA questionable.\n\nBut it is not a political choice to reduce gun violence; it is a legal obligation under international law. From a human rights perspective, the path forward is clear: The United States needs to enact a range of measures at the federal, state and local level to stem the tide of gun violence.\n\nThis includes -- at the outset -- repealing laws that discourages research into gun violence to better inform policy development and to approach the issue from a public health and safety perspective. Limiting funding and thus research into gun violence, knowing that nearly 39,000 individuals in the U.S. died as a result of firearms in 2016, is inexcusable.\n\nAlso inexcusable is the fact that only nine states and the District of Columbia require background checks for all types of gun sales and transfers, not just licensed dealers. There is no reason why this common-sense policy shouldn't be the law in every state.\n\nIt is also common sense to bar the sale of military-style semiautomatic rifles with high-capacity magazines, commonly called \"assault rifles.\" While some take issue with that classification, whatever we call them, they are designed to rip bodies apart quickly in combat and present too much of a risk to public safety to be sold to the public.\n\nAnother thing Congress can do is to pass the Youth Promise Act to address the disproportionate impact of gun violence on communities of color and to fund violence intervention programs.\n\nThese are just a few of the steps that Congress can take immediately to show that it's serious about turning this tide of gun violence. The moment is now. No one should ever fear that their children might not make it home from school or from seeing a movie or going to the park. While government inaction on reform continues, nearly 100 people a day die at the barrel of a gun.\n\nThe U.S. government is failing in its duty to protect people's human rights. It must stop.\n\nMargaret Huang is the executive director of Amnesty International USA.",

But the hoped-for March miracle of enough precipitation to reach a normal year's rainfall looks unlikely.\n\nSome forecasters went so far as to conclude that the rainy season all but over.\n\nDespite flooding in some areas, the United States Drought Monitor still categorized most of Southern California as under moderate or severe drought.\n\nStorm totals for downtown Los Angeles, 1.02 inches of rain as of late Thursday, contributed little to the goal of a normal wet season -- 14.93 inches -- said Bonnie Bartling, a weather specialist with the National Weather Service. L.A.'s rain year -- Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 -- has so far produced 4.45 inches, and experts see little more en route as the driest months approach.\n\n\"It looks like a one-hit wonder here,\" said Dave Samuel, a senior meteorologist at private forecaster AccuWeather. \"This looks like our last big opportunity for widespread rainfall. We're looking at building heat and dry conditions across Southern California.\"\n\nThe two-day storm produced rain at nearly a half-inch per hour in parts of Santa Barbara County, where residents in the Thomas Fire burn zone were under temporary evacuation orders because authorities feared another catastrophic mudslide was possible. Parts of Ventura County saw more than 5 inches of rain. Mountains near Las Vegas saw nearly 5 inches, according to the service. A few communities near California's Bay Area office saw nearly 10 inches of precipitation this week.",

The story is getting major coverage by right-leaning news organizations, including Fox News, Breitbart, the Washington Examiner and the Daily Caller.\n\nThe Republican message is being amplified by Russian propagandists, according to independent experts.\n\n\"#Releasethememo\" is now the top trending hashtag among Russian bots and trolls on Twitter and other platforms, according to the German Marshall Fund's \"Hamilton 68\" website, which tracks Russian influence campaigns.\n\nThe president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also employed the hashtag in a tweet Friday morning.\n\n\"Americans deserve to know the contents of the memo,\" he wrote. \"Democrats & deep state govt officials are doing everything they can to protect those within the government who used their positions of influence to target those they disagree with politically. RELEASE THE MEMO! #ReleaseTheMemo\"\n\nRep. Steve King, a conservative Republican from Iowa, tweeted Thursday night: \"I have read the memo. The sickening reality has set in. I no longer hold out hope there is an innocent explanation for the information the public has seen. I have long said it is worse than Watergate. It was.\" #neverTrump & #alwaysHillary. #releasethememo\"\n\nDemocrats say the memo is the latest attempt by President Trump's allies in Congress to discredit the Russian investigation and denigrate the law enforcement professionals who are running it. They say it's a disturbing example of how the Republicans are working hand-in-glove with Russian bots and trolls to push what the Democrats see as harmful distortions.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, last night described the memo as \"a profoundly misleading set of talking points drafted by Republican staff attacking the FBI and its handling of the investigation. Rife with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read, this is meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI. This may help carry White House water, but it is a deep disservice to our law enforcement professionals.\"",

Steele had gone to the FBI in July with his findings, but he didn't perceive that the bureau was doing very much.\n\nSimpson said he was shocked and angry when FBI Director James Comey said publicly he was reopening the Clinton email investigation in October 2016, just weeks before the presidential election.\n\n\"I was sitting on this piece of knowledge, which was that, in fact, the FBI was investigating the Trump Organization for possibly having illegal dealings with the government of Russia,\" Simpson said. \"We decided that if James Corney wasn't going to tell people about this investigation that, you know, he had violated the rules, and we would only be fair if the world knew that both candidates were under FBI investigation.\"\n\nSimpson declined to discuss his dealings with the media, but at least one reporter, David Corn of Mother Jones, wrote a story before the election after meeting with Steele.\n\nSimpson also asserted that the Russian government had \"infiltrated \" the National Rifle Association, which spent more than $400 million in the 2016 election, according to public records. The NRA supports mainly Republicans.\n\n\"It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA, and there is more than one explanation for why,\" he said in the testimony. \"But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA. And so there is a Russian banker-slash-Duma member-slash-Mafia leader named Alexander Torshin who is a life member of the NRA. And we spent a lot of time investigating Mr. Torshin. And he is well known to Spanish law enforcement for money laundering activity...\"\n\nNBC News has previously reported that Torshin sought a meeting with Trump, and ended up at an NRA dinner with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nSimpson also mentioned a Russian NRA member named Maria Butina, who he says \"started hanging around the Trump transition after the election.\"\n\n\"The most absurd [thing] about this is that, you know, Vladimir Putin is not in favor of universal gun ownership for Russians,\" said Simpson. \"And so it's all a big charade, basically.\"\n\nAn NRA spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Efforts to reach Torshin and Butina were unsuccessful.\n\nIn response to Republican questioning, Simpson also defended the credibility of Steele's dossier, saying much of it has been verified. He also went further to present the committee with new information that hadn't been included in the original dossier.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything that has contradicted anything in the memos to date,\" he said in the November interview. \"\"Chris [Steele] was a reliable provider of information that turned out to be reliable. ...

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- A report released Tuesday by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security found that the majority of convictions for international terrorism brought by U.S. courts since 2001 have been against people born outside of the U.S., bolstering the Trump administration's argument for tougher immigration standards.\n\nThe report found that out of 549 convictions for international terrorism-related charges since Sept. 11, 2001, 254 were not U.S. citizens, 148 received U.S. citizenship through naturalization and 147 were U.S. citizens by birth.\n\nBut testimony from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen paints a more nuanced picture, as do several national security analysts.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Nielsen said the report included people arrested overseas and brought to the U.S. to face trial. A U.S. official estimated the number of those arrests at close to 90, further skewing the numbers toward foreign-born defendants.\n\nKaren Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at the Fordham University School of Law, said the long timeline of the report overshadows the evidence -- and the effects -- of a more recent tactic used by ISIS that has produced U.S.-born attackers. Unlike al Qaeda, which carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, the Islamic State has a decentralized power structure that relies heavily on radicalizing recruits living in Western countries and recruiting lone wolf attackers via social media.\n\n\"I think they are doing everything they can to justify the Muslim ban, and the unfortunate part of this is the backing away from the homegrown terrorist suspect ... and how to prevent it,\" Greenberg said. \"And if you are born in another country and, 20 years later, you become a terrorist, whose fault is that -- the country you were born in or the country you've lived in?\"\n\nGreenberg's research on ISIS cases in the U.S. from March 2013 through the present found that U.S.-born defendants account for 84 out of the 156 cases prosecuted, or more than half.\n\nThe new DOJ/DHS report does not account for attacks inspired by American ideologies, such as white supremacy, because those crimes are not charged as international terrorism.\n\nThe report was commissioned by one of President Donald Trump's executive orders and is being interpreted by Trump's Cabinet members as a clear indication of the need for tougher immigration policies in order to fight terrorism.\n\n\"We want to bring in individuals who love this country, who love its people, who have skills, who speak English and are committed to supporting our values and our way of life,\" said a U.S. official presenting the report on a call with reporters.\n\nThe current immigration system, \"doesn't promote the admission of individuals who are likely to succeed and are likely to assimilate,\" the official said.\n\nTrump's ban on travel to the United States from certain countries deemed to pose a threat was pinned on the argument that tougher immigration standards would prevent terrorism. But critics of the policy say that the ban was racially motivated and argue that it does not account for the many American terrorists who were radicalized while living inside U.S. borders.\n\nIn Congressional testimony in July, Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at The George Washington University, said \"the vast majority\" of so-called homegrown extremists who have been radicalized on U.S. soil are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Hughes called for a more robust program to prevent such radicalization.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Iraqi government has declared victory over ISIS, and President Donald Trump has taken credit for the Islamic caliphate's collapse.\n\n\"ISIS is now giving up, they are giving up, there are raising their hands, they are walking off. Nobody has ever seen that before,\" said the president during an October interview on WMAL's \"The Chris Plante Show.\"\n\nBut experts both in and outside the U.S. government warn that ISIS remains a lethal force, as shown by a double suicide bombing in Baghdad Monday that killed 100. As the caliphate has collapsed the number of active fighters in Syria and Iraq may have dropped below 3,000, there are many more ISIS loyalists still on the scene.\n\nHassan Hassan, coauthor of the book \"ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,\" estimates that some 7,000 ISIS-loyalists remain.\n\n\"They operate as a terrorist and insurgent organization almost purely now, versus as a conventional fighting unit,\" said Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. \"There are still so many in Syria, in the Abu Kamal and Deir al-Zour areas. A lot of them are Iraqis who fled across the border.\"\n\nHisham al-Hashimi, an adviser to the Iraqi government in its battle against ISIS, told NBC News that while the number of active fighters on the battlefield is probably in the range of 1,000 to 1,500, the actual number of ISIS-loyalists in Iraq and Syria is closer to 10,000.\n\nAt its peak, according to U.S. officials, ISIS had 45,000 fighters active in the area where the U.S. led coalition is operating.\n\nSince airstrikes in Iraq and Syria began in 2014 under the Obama administration, a territory that was once the size of Ohio has been almost entirely recaptured by coalition-backed forces.\n\nThe terror group's two biggest strongholds, Mosul in Iraq and its de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria fell in July and October respectively to coalition-backed forces.\n\nTrump has given significant leeway to the Department of Defense to carry out its mission and help local ground forces liberate the remaining territory.\n\nTrump pointed to his leadership as one of the key factors driving ISIS fighters off the battlefield.\n\n\"I totally changed rules of engagement. I totally changed our military, I totally changed the attitudes of the military and they have done a fantastic job,\" Trump said in his interview with Chris Plante.\n\nISIS has not only lost territory, but it is being denied access to revenue sources such as oil and gas and cash reserves that once amounted to more than $1 billion in 2014. ISIS had also generated some $30 million per month in Iraq from taxation and extortion in 2015, according to Iraqi and U.S. government estimates.\n\nTrump has vowed to end the \"current [U.S.] strategy of nation-building and regime change\" because he says it doesn't work. In outlining the pillars of his Afghanistan strategy last summer, Trump said the U.S. is not about nation building, but rather, \"killing terrorists.\"\n\nBut recent history has taught the U.S. some harsh lessons about withdrawing from conflicts too soon. Former President George W. Bush struck an agreement with the Iraqi government that called for a withdrawal of U.S. troops by December 2011.\n\nObama stuck to that schedule, believing that the Iraqis needed to stand on their own while the U.S. turned its attention to the domestic economy and other pressing needs at home and abroad -- what he called \"nation-building at home.\" But the rise of the Islamic State group, an offshoot of the dormant al-Qaeda in Iraq, forced American forces back to Iraq and Syria, first in the form of airstrikes and later, an advise and assist mission and the use of special forces.\n\n\"There is a big difference between defeating them militarily on the battlefield and eliminating ISIS as a terrorist organization,\" said Daniel Glasser, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for terrorist financing under former President Barack Obama.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said in December that U.S.-backed forces were in the process of \"crushing the life\" out of ISIS.\n\n\"We told you that the [ISIS] caliphate was going to go down,\" Mattis added, and \"as we sit here today at the end of 2017, the caliphate is on the run, we're breaking them.\"\n\nBut he also said the \"war is not over.\" Mattis emphasized that much work remained to prevent the emergence of what the retired four-star general called \"ISIS 2.0,\" noting that the group may attempt to return to its modest, low-budget terror roots in an effort to once again exploit sectarian rifts in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon released a National Defense Strategy that said terrorism remained \"a persistent condition ... despite the defeat of ISIS's physical caliphate.\"\n\nA day earlier, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, laying out the Trump administration's broad strategy for Syria, said a quick withdrawal from Syria would give the jihadist group an opportunity to make a comeback.\n\n\"The United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring Isil cannot re-emerge,\" he said, using an alternate acronym for the group. \"We cannot make the same mistakes that were made in 2011 when a premature departure from Iraq allowed al-Qaeda in Iraq to survive and eventually morph into Isil.\"\n\nThis week's suicide bombing in one of Baghdad's busiest public squares rattled the city's growing sense of security. And while ISIS is no longer earning millions from oil and extortion, it has reverted to raising funds from charities and wealthy donors.\n\nU.S. estimates of the terror group's remaining strength, meanwhile, are similar to those offered by outside experts. Like Hassan and al-Hashimi's figures, recent U.S. public estimates of active ISIS fighters have ranged from 3,000 to 1,000, with the number falling rapidly.\n\nOn background, U.S. officials say they estimate ISIS non-battlefield strength in Iraq and Syria at 6,000 to 8,000, in line with Hassan's figure but lower than al-Hashimi's of 10,000, which includes potential lone-wolf attackers.\n\nISIS is \"transforming into a new threat,\" said Glasser, who is now a principal at the Financial Integrity Network. \"They don't have this safe haven and it makes it harder for them to plan catastrophic attacks on us, but at the same time the threat is very much still there, and more diffuse and a little bit less predictable.\"",

                "body": "Ex-CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee suspected of spying for China\n\nThose sobering findings, sometime after the inquiry began in 2012, led the CIA to temporarily shut down human spying in China, and to overhaul the way it communicates with its assets around the world, according to former government officials familiar with the case.\n\nIt was a shocking blow to an American spy agency that prides itself on its field operations. There was also a devastating human cost: Some 20 CIA sources were executed by the Chinese government, two former officials said -- a higher number of dead than initially reported by NBC News and the New York Times. Then an unknown number of Russian assets also disappeared, sources say.\n\nEventually a top secret joint FBI-CIA task force investigation led authorities to suspect that former CIA case officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee had been spying for China. Lee, 53, was arrested this week and charged, not with espionage, but with a single count of possessing classified information.\n\nU.S. officials told NBC News they don't believe Lee ever will be charged as a spy, in part because they don't have all the proof they might need, and in part because they would not want to air the evidence they do have in a public courtroom.\n\nFBI agents began to suspect Lee after they received a tip that he had passed information to Chinese intelligence officers while working for a Japanese tobacco company in Hong Kong, sources said, a detail first reported Thursday by the New York Times. They also found it suspicious when Lee took a job at an auction house in Hong Kong that was co-owned by a senior Communist Party official, sources said. He eventually ended up working for Christie's, the international auction house.\n\nWhen agents searched Lee's hotel rooms in 2012, they found notebooks with the names of covert CIA sources, according to court documents.\n\nBut not all of the agent arrests and deaths could be linked to information possessed by Lee, who left the CIA in 2007, the former officials said.\n\n\"No single officer had access to all of them,\" one official said.\n\nInvestigators soon began to conclude that its communications system for covert communications, referred to as \"covcom,\" had been infiltrated. One theory is that Lee may have helped the Chinese do that. But two former officials said the CIA's system for exchanging messages with its agents was shockingly primitive and subject to easy penetration by the Chinese.\n\n\"All they had to do was get one agent's laptop, and they could figure it out,\" one former official said.\n\nSoon after the task force concluded the Chinese had penetrated covcom, it got an even more troubling report: That after a joint training session between Chinese and Russian intelligence officers, the Russians \"came back saying we got good info on covcom,\" as the former official put it.\n\nInvestigators began examining cases of U.S. assets in Russia who had disappeared. Officials concluded they had to change their system for agent communications.\n\nEventually, Mark Kelton, the CIA's top counterintelligence official, had to brief the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees on the damage, some of whom vented their fury behind closed doors. But few others were aware of it, even within the confines of the CIA and FBI. The New York Times reported on the case last year, including the detail that authorities suspected a former CIA officer living in an Asian country.\n\nLast week, for reasons that still are not clear, Lee flew from Hong Kong to New York, where he was met by an FBI team.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment, as did Kelton, who was the top counterintelligence official at time.\n\nEd O'Callaghan, a senior prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division, called Lee's capture \"a very important arrest.\" During an unrelated appearance at the White House earlier this week, he said that although Lee was charged with illegally retaining classified information, \"As that case proceeds through the courts, I would expect that more information about the conduct that underlies those charges and the complaint will come out.\"\n\nLee appeared briefly in a Brooklyn federal courtroom Monday after his arrest at JFK airport. As early as next week, he will be brought to a courtroom in Alexandria, Virginia, where he will be formally prosecuted, officials said.",

                "title": "Addicts who lived at sober home called 'No Drug Zone' overdosed, died",
                "body": "The \"No Drug Zone,\" a single-story house with a palm tree out front on a residential street in Boynton Beach, Florida, was supposed to be a safe space for people struggling to get clean.\n\nInstead it was one of dozens of \"sober\" homes and rehabs across South Florida that milked people addicted to opioids for insurance money, then hung them out to dry. Some, like 24-year-old Mikaya Feucht, ended up dead.\n\nIn June, an NBC News investigation revealed a pattern of widespread fraud and abuse in the drug treatment industry in South Florida, and told the stories of its victims. Feucht was one of the young out-of-staters who did not survive what has become known as the \"Florida shuffle.\" The last \"sober\" home she lived in before her fatal overdose was No Drug Zone.\n\nOn Jan. 17 the home's operator, 26-year-old Albert Jones, pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to commit healthcare fraud and maintaining a drug-involved premises -- fraud that allegedly cost insurance companies more than $2 million.\n\nTo Feucht's mother, Michelle Curran, Jones's arrest and guilty plea were a relief.\n\n\"I've been bringing his name up from day one,\" said Curran. \"I just kept saying, 'What about Albert Jones?'\"\n\nThere are many reputable rehab facilities in South Florida. Thousands have found sobriety there. But state and federal authorities say that broader insurance coverage for addiction treatment and a failure of regulation and oversight created a breeding ground for unscrupulous operators who take advantage of people in distress.\n\nAlbert Jones appears to have gotten his start in the industry in 2014 with the help of Angel's Recovery, a now-defunct treatment center in Wellington, Florida. On its website, it advertised itself as a \"5-star facility,\" complete with equine and golf therapy and a pool.\n\nLike many who run rehabs in Florida, Angel's owners learned that drug treatment could be lucrative if they had a steady stream of patients with good insurance. In federal court documents that accompanied his guilty plea, Angel's founder Alan Bostom admitted he established illegal kickback schemes to try to bring in clients. He and his daughter, co-owner Tovah Jasperson, offered operators of sober homes money in exchange for referring their residents to Angel's treatment program. According to court documents, Bostom admitted to paying one operator more than $700,000 for patient referrals.\n\nBostom also provided cash to third parties to buy or rent properties and set up new sober homes. Albert Jones, described in court documents as \"A.J.\", got money to start up two sober homes in Boynton Beach. He then ensured those who lived there attended treatment at Angel's, receiving more than $150,000 in payments in the process.\n\nTrouble at Angel's began to surface in 2015, when an investigation by the state found the medical director there was writing prescriptions on a suspended license. Dr. Kenneth Rivera-Kolb had two reprimands from the licensing board and was under investigation in the death of a patient when he became the medical director at Angel's. Despite his record, he had a valid medical license and the state Department of Children and Families permitted him to head up care at Angel's. A DCF spokesperson told NBC News in a statement that a copy of a doctor's current license must be provided with a treatment center application, and that DCF may conduct impromptu visits if it receives concerns about a doctor's license.\n\nIn February 2015, Florida's medical board suspended Rivera-Kolb's medical license as a result of the patient death investigation, in which he was found to have committed medical malpractice. But a subsequent licensing board investigation found he continued to work at Angel's until at least April, allegedly writing prescriptions for everything from the opioid-treatment drug Suboxone to valium and Xanax. According to federal court documents, Rivera-Kolb was also \"actively abusing prescription opioids and cocaine.\" He was forced to step down as medical director following the investigation in 2015. His license was eventually revoked in February 2017. But even after Rivera-Kolb left Angel's, DCF allowed the treatment center to continue operations. And continue billing patients.\n\nKatie Cruea arrived at Angel's in the summer of 2015. She was a 23-year-old mother from Ohio battling an opioid addiction. She went to Florida for help, but quickly got sucked into the shuffle. She bounced from one house to another, one treatment center to the next.\n\nCruea's mother, Sandy Hinkle, isn't sure if it was Angel's that introduced Cruea to Jones, or Jones who introduced Cruea to Angel's. In a stack of medical bills more than nine inches high, Hinkle has found dozens of bills from Angel's throughout that summer. The center routinely charged up to $1,400 for a day of outpatient group counseling; $2,700 for lab services -- most often, a simple urine screen to test for drugs. Angel's shut down sometime in late 2015 or early 2016, according to Robert Nicholson, an attorney for Angel's co-owner Bostom.\n\nBy October 2015, Cruea had moved into the Boynton Beach house known as No Drug Zone. Jones, who was barely out of his teens and had no license or treatment experience, was running at least two houses at the time. Jones's home was the last sober home Cruea lived in before falling back into addiction. She moved into a local motel in early 2016. That February, she died of an overdose of Fentanyl-laced cocaine.\n\nOne of the women who lived in Jones's homes said they were not a place to find recovery. Mercedes Smith was only a few weeks clean when Jones appointed her to manage his houses. She'd step over holes in the floor as she walked through the door, she said, and find needles strewn around No Drug Zone. More than once, she was called because someone had overdosed. But in an interview last spring, she told NBC News her main job was to go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings to look for young people with insurance to live in the homes. Jones gave her $550 a week and a car to go looking for people with suitcases, she said -- a telltale sign of new arrivals in town or those recently kicked out of another program.\n\n\"We would have to ask them, 'Do you have insurance? We have a place you can go,'\" Smith remembered.\n\nThat's how Mikaya Feucht found out about Jones's place. She and Smith lived together for a few months. When Smith moved out of No Drug Zone, Feucht took over her job trolling for new residents. For many in South Florida teetering on the edge of recovery, pulling more people into these problem-riddled \"sober\" homes became a mode of survival. It also perpetuated a system where some treatment centers focused on profit poached clients from the ethical programs trying to get them well.\n\nBy the time Mikaya was at No Drug Zone, Angel's had shut down. Jones had found another operator willing to pay for clients. He began sending his residents to Reflections, run by an operator named Kenny Chatman. The treatment center was notorious throughout South Florida. Though Chatman advertised that he could help young people find sobriety, patients were often permitted to be high at group counseling sessions, according to employees and court records -- as long as they showed up so their insurance could be billed. When they didn't, Chatman and his employees have admitted they routinely falsified records in order to ensure they were paid top dollar. It was a scheme that netted him millions. Yet it was one that drove many deeper into addiction. In addition to pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, Chatman admitted last spring that he also gave clients drugs and prostituted women in his program. He was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison.\n\nFeucht attended Reflections, followed by another treatment center Jones allegedly had a hand in helping to start. But one night at the end of July 2016, Feucht's boyfriend, who also lived at No Drug Zone, got into a dispute with Jones. Jones said the couple had to go, according to both Mikaya's boyfriend and Curran, her mother. They packed up their stuff, and Jones dropped the couple off at a broken-down motel where police have responded to at least 17 overdoses since 2010.\n\nFeucht called her mother the night she got kicked out. They were in almost constant contact the next three days as Curran, who has custody of Feucht's two sons in Ohio, tried to figure out how to help her daughter. Then Feucht stopped responding to her texts.\n\nBefore dawn on July 31, 2016, Curran got a knock at the door of her home in Ohio. The officer told her Feucht had been found dead on the floor of a Florida motel. A few days later, Curran said she messaged Jones on Facebook. She said she believed he played a role in her daughter's death.\n\n\"He called me and said sorry about Mikaya, she was a good girl but she wasn't making the right choices,\" Curran remembers. \"I said, 'Mark my words, I'm coming after you. I will do everything in my power to see you in court one day.'\"\n\nJones's sentencing is scheduled for March 2018. Curran said she plans to be there. This month, Angel's father-daughter co-owners also pleaded guilty to federal charges for their operations at Angel's Recovery. Bostom pleaded to knowingly falsifying material facts involving health care programs. Jasperson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, according to her attorney Alvin Entin.\n\n\"Unlike the Chatman case, there has been no suggestion that Angel's Recovery failed to provide quality and needed treatment to its residents,\" said Nicholson, Bostom's attorney.\n\nIn a joint call with NBC News, both Entin and Nicholson said that the kickback arrangements their clients entered into became the only way to compete in the industry. \"If you didn't pay to play, you didn't have patients,\" said Nicholson. \"That is the unfortunate reality of what happened in the industry in South Florida.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to comment for this story, citing ongoing investigations. But there's reason to believe this isn't the end of law enforcement's effort to clean up South Florida. Both Jones and Bostom have signed plea agreements that obliged them to cooperate with federal authorities.\n\nNeither Jones nor his attorney responded to NBC News' request for comment. In a brief conversation with NBC News last spring, Jones denied being involved in illegal activity. He said he had gotten out of the sober home business. He was then running a cell phone store. At the time, he indicated he hadn't been involved in anything illegal -- but knew that many were. \"There are really bad actors out there, people driving around in fancy cars and making money,\" he said. \"There is so much more to this story. I can tell you it's way bigger than you think.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Afghan military and police were involved in at least 75 gross human rights violations from 2010 to 2016, including murder, torture and child sexual assault, but the U.S. government continued funding them anyway, according to a newly declassified report.\n\nThe report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), which was first released to Congress last year but made public Tuesday, says that at least seven of the violations were child sexual assault, but also says \"the full extent of child sexual assault committed by Afghan security forces may never be known.\"\n\nIn a 2015 article, The New York Times referred to sexual abuse of young boys by Afghan security forces as \"rampant.\" The report was prepared by SIGAR after nearly 100 members of Congress, in response to the Times article, asked that the inspector general investigate the alleged sexual abuse.\n\nTwenty-two of the 75 violations in the SIGAR report were classified and could not be revealed, and 46 involved other gross violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings and torture of prisoners. The violations occurred from 2010 to August 2016.\n\nThe SIGAR investigation found that the U.S. military knew about these human rights abuses, but used a legal loophole to keep supporting the Afghan units involved.\n\nThe so-called Leahy Laws forbid the Pentagon and State Department from providing assistance to a foreign military or police unit if there is credible evidence the unit has committed a gross violation of human rights.\n\nFaced with evidence that Afghan units had committed such violations, the Pentagon invoked the \"notwithstanding clause\" in the DOD Appropriations Act, which allows it to continue most funding for these units \"notwithstanding\" human rights abuses if that funding is deemed a security necessity.\n\n\"This type of abuse, appallingly, is a common practice,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., for whom the Leahy Laws are named. \"In fact, it is a virtual certainty that it is grossly underreported. The report also revealed that DOD circumvented the [Defense] Leahy Law by using 'notwithstanding' authority without notifying Congress, even providing aid to Afghan units implicated in child abuse.

                "body": "When the FDA took steps this month to put limits on opioid cough medicine for children, it was the latest sign of an agency crackdown on a class of painkillers that has taken thousands upon thousands of American lives.\n\nA crackdown, critics say, that has been far too long coming.\n\nPharmaceutical companies, doctors and clinics, and even the DEA have come under fire in what many say is the worst public health crisis in modern U.S. history. But some experts think it was the FDA, the federal gatekeeper for prescription medication, that could have prevented it.\n\n\"I think this may be the best example in history of a regulatory agency failure leading to a public health catastrophe,\" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and a frequent FDA critic.\n\nThe FDA says it has taken \"significant steps to confront the staggering human and economic toll created by opioid abuse and addiction, including strengthening drug warnings, taking action against companies for misleading promotion and taking important measures to enhance the safe and appropriate use.\"\n\nBut from the 1995 approval of Oxycontin to belated 2013 restrictions on popular painkillers like Vicodin, Kolodny and others say the FDA has squandered one opportunity after another to curb rampant prescribing and the wave of addiction that followed.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, whose state has the highest opioid death rate in the nation, sums up the FDA's lumbering response in two words: \"Absolutely criminal.\"\n\nRead the FDA's full statement on its response to the opioid epidemic\n\nThe FDA's new commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, doesn't go that far. But he acknowledges that the agency, where he was a deputy from 2005 to 2007, did not do all it could.\n\n\"I don't know that we could have stopped it,\" said Gottlieb, who has made opioids the top priority of his seven-month tenure, in an interview with NBC News.\n\n\"I think that there were opportunities probably years ago to take steps that might have allowed us to get ahead of it more than we are now. I think a lot of people didn't do what they needed to do in the past or we wouldn't be in the situation we're in right now.\"\n\nThe stage was set in the 1990s when there was a shift by some in the medical community to view chronic pain as treatable.\n\n\"I think doctors were trained to prescribe opioids for the treatment of pain,\" said Gottlieb, who finished his internal medicine training in 1999.\n\n\"I think there was a perception that some of the newer drugs weren't as addictive as some of the older formulations,\" he added.\n\n\"In many cases we were wrong.\"\n\nWhen the FDA approved controlled-release Oxycontin, the label said \"delayed absorption as provided by OxyContin tablets is believed to reduce the abuse liability of a drug\" and that addiction to opioids used for legitimate pain management was \"very rare.\"\n\nThat approval paved the way for the manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, to aggressively market Oxycontin for moderate, chronic pain. More than a decade later, the company would pay a $600 million fine and admit that when it promoted Oxycontin as less addictive than other painkillers, it knew it wasn't true.\n\nRead Purdue's statement on opioids\n\nIt wasn't until 2001 that the FDA added stronger warnings to the Oxycontin label and narrowed the circumstances under which it should be prescribed.\n\nBy then, a growing number of Americans were hooked on Oxycontin, with some turning to heroin. At a Congressional hearing that year, law enforcement officials in the region hardest hit by \"hillbilly heroin\" -- West Virginia and surrounding states -- said they were in the grips of an epidemic.\n\nIn Kolodny's view, the FDA had a chance to reverse course the very next year when it convened a meeting of experts to discuss opioids.\n\n\"They could have changed the rules so that we wouldn't get a steady stream of new opioids hitting the market -- each one pouring fuel on a fire,\" Kolodny said.\n\nBut any hope of major reform died with the makeup of the 2002 group, Kolodny said. Eight of 10 invited guest speakers had ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\"It was very clear that we had made a mistake and we needed to change course. And we didn't. We went the opposite direction,\" Kolodny said.\n\nOver the next decade, opioid prescriptions would surge from 150 million to more than 200 million a year, the death rate would double, and the scourge would spread across the country.\n\nWhen Manchin moved from the governor's mansion to Capitol Hill in 2010, he had already seen West Virginia ravaged by pain pills like Vicodin. The prescribing patterns made it clear the drugs were being diverted from legitimate use.\n\n\"They were everywhere,\" he said. \"One little community of 300, 400 people had nine million pills coming into it.\"\n\nHe began pushing to tighten controls, urging that hydrocodone combination products like Vicodin be made Schedule II drugs, which would make them harder to get.\n\n\"I thought that would have been done in what -- three-week period, maximum?\" he said. \"I go up and testify before [the FDA] advisory committee. It was automatically approved -- boom! Should have been a slam-dunk, right?\"\n\nBut it took nearly a year for the FDA to recommend the policy change. After it finally went into effect in 2014, a billion fewer of the affected pills were prescribed in the next year. Manchin said there's no doubt lives would have been saved if it had happened sooner.\n\n\"I can use many explicit words to describe what I think was wrong, but there is no reason on earth this shouldn't have happened,\" he said.\n\nThe FDA also came under fire in 2014 after it approved a very powerful opioid called Zohydro over the objections of its advisory committee, which voted 11-2 against it. Zohydro came with strong warnings and there's no indication it's been widely abused, but to watchdogs like Kolodny and Manchin, the FDA action was evidence the agency wasn't alarmed enough.\n\n\"Why did the FDA continue to allow more and more of these opiate drugs on the market?\" Manchin said.\n\nKolodny said one answer may be that the FDA was too close to drug manufacturers. He points to a series of invitation-only meetings created by two academics that brought together FDA officials who oversaw painkillers with drug makers who paid thousands of dollars to attend meetings in swanky hotel conference rooms.\n\nThe so-called IMMPACT meetings could be interpreted as a \"pay-to-play\" operation, one government participant fretted in an email. NBC News has learned that the meetings were the subject of an Inspector General's probe. The investigative report NBC obtained says that while FDA employees did not receive any direct personal benefit, the probe found that meeting organizers may have paid travel expenses for three FDA officials. Others received free meals. Some received author's credit on research papers they had little to do with. The IG also found that the FDA did not require its officials to report that they attended the meetings -- or even served on the steering committee.\n\nKolodny claims that a revolving door that funnels former FDA employees into an industry they once regulated may have blunted the agency's response to opioid misuse. One of the key officials involved in the original approval of Oxycontin went to work for Purdue within two years of leaving the agency, and the official who oversaw Zohydro's approval now consults for firms that involved in the opioid field.\n\n\"It was certainly in their self-interest to be very friendly to the manufacturers that wanted these products on the market. And the manufacturers, at the end of the day, got what they wanted,\" Kolodny said.\n\nWhen Gottlieb was nominated by President Trump, some were worried that he was too close to the medical industry. Although he worked in a hospital early in his career, he more recently worked as a consultant and a venture capitalist for a firm that invested in medical businesses.\n\nBut some of those same skeptics say they have hope change is on the horizon.\n\n\"I didn't vote for him but I'm optimistic,\" Manchin said.\n\nSoon after Gottlieb took over, the FDA pushed the opioid Opana off the market, deeming the risk of abuse was too high. He's also beefed up efforts to find drugs being sent by mail and notified 74 drugmakers that will have to provide more training for medical professionals who write pain-control prescriptions.\n\nHe's trying to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addicts and reduce the stigma associated with addiction. Another goal: repackaging pills in smaller quantities so a trip to the dentist doesn't end with a 30-day supply of narcotics.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to be a five-year effort,\" Gottlieb told NBC News. \"But it will take us a year, maybe two to get to the optimal place here.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" he said, \"we're taking a lot of actions that I think are starting to have an impact.\"\n\nGottlieb said he is acutely aware of the FDA's history with opioids as he looks to the future.\n\n\"I look to the past to try to understand what we did wrong, to inform what we can do right going forward,\" he said. \"And that's where we are focused.\n\n\"I don't want to be looking back five years from now and say, 'I wish I had done more.'\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- A Defense Department report obtained by NBC News found that 165 defense contractors had their initial security clearances revoked last year after further investigation linked the recipients to problematic or illicit activity, including questionable financial transactions, influence by foreign governments and even felonies like pedophilia.\n\nThe report, which will be released Wednesday, shows how it is possible for people who have been compromised or who have criminal backgrounds to slip through the cracks of the preliminary background investigation and obtain access to sensitive national security-related information.\n\nThe low threshold for granting what is known as an interim security clearance should be cause for alarm inside the Trump White House, says Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. Cummings cited the report in calling on the committee's Republican chair, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, to help him investigate the \"troubling irregularities\" with the security clearances held by President Donald Trump's senior aides.\n\nThe report captured data from 200,000 applications for secret or top secret clearance by defense contractors over the past three years, many of which were not fully adjudicated until 2017. It found that 486 applicants had their clearances denied or revoked. Of those applicants, 165 had slipped through the initial round of vetting and been allowed access to sensitive information.\n\nThe most common reason for denying a security clearance, the report concluded, was related to the applicant's finances, with over 370 applicants being denied clearance for \"financial considerations.\" Felony charges were the cause for revoking 63 clearances, and evidence of foreign influence or foreign preference was found in 56 applications.\n\nIn 151 of the cases, applicants were granted an initial security clearance that was later revoked when it was discovered the applicant withheld information. In one example, a person given interim secret clearance in 2015 was discovered in 2017 to have been found guilty of raping a child prior to applying for the clearance.\n\nThe process for obtaining an interim clearance is the same for defense contractors as for senior White House aides. The FBI is responsible for reviewing the criminal history, financial records and foreign contacts of applicants for the White House, the Department of Defense and other agencies with employees that require clearance.\n\nTrump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has been operating with an interim security clearance rather than a permanent clearance for more than a year, according to two law enforcement sources. Cummings has pressed the White House to disclose information on the status of Kushner's clearance as well as the clearance of Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, who was later fired and has now pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.",

                "body": "Sessions' rank within the administration along with Comey's close proximity to the obstruction angle may indicate that Mueller is zeroing in on central characters as he enters the more advanced stages of the investigation.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russian government in the 2016 election, and his lawyers have predicted that the federal probe will soon conclude, leaving the president free of any charges of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Out of respect for the special counsel and his process,\" said White House attorney Ty Cobb about reports of Sessions being interviewed, \"and because of the privacy obligations we owe to potential or actual witnesses, the White House does not comment on witness appearances before the special counsel.\"\n\nThe New York Times was the first to report on the interviews that Mueller's team conducted with Sessions and Comey. It is unknown what Sessions was asked or how he responded.\n\nThe roles Sessions has played within the Trump campaign and the administration make him of prime interest to Mueller, who is probing not just possible collusion but also efforts by the president to obstruct the investigation. As a senior member of the Trump campaign, Sessions met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and sat in on a meeting where George Papadopoulos presented a plan to set up high-level talks with Russia.\n\nPapadopoulos, a previously little-known figure in the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in October. Testifying before Congress in November, Sessions said he did not initially recall the meeting with Papadopoulos until media reports jogged his memory. He said he pushed back on the idea of setting up a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlthough the U.S. attorney general would usually have jurisdiction over a federal probe, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after media reports emerged about his meetings with Kislyak. That recusal put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in charge, who later appointed Mueller as special counsel. That chain of events has strained the relationship between Sessions and Trump, with the president blaming his attorney general for Mueller's appointment in private and lashing out on him via Twitter.",

It was removed twice in 2016 but quickly put back into circulation, the indictment says.\n\n\"The ride was never properly or fully designed to prevent rafts from going airborne,\" the indictment said.\n\nThe waterpark and Tyler Austin Miles, 29, a former operations director at the park, were indicted Friday on involuntary manslaughter and several other charges in Caleb's death. The indictment alleges that a company co-owner and the designer of the Verruckt rushed it into use and had no technical or engineering expertise related to amusement park rides.\n\nThe charges come after a 19-month investigation into the death of Caleb, the son of Kansas Rep. Scott Schwab. The raft he was in went airborne, hitting a pole and netting designed to keep riders from being thrown from the ride.\n\nThe indictment says a video shows that Caleb was following all rider instructions when he died.\n\nThe death seemed like an isolated accident until whistleblowers from Schlitterbahn revealed that experts who examined the slide found evidence indicating that other rafts had gone airborne and crashed into the overhead hoops and netting before the fatality, according to the indictment.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAlthough \"Black Panther\" has had little competition throughout February and March, such consistency is especially rare in today's moviegoing world. Before \"Avatar,\" the last film to do it was 1999's \"The Sixth Sense.\"\n\nThat left second place to the MGM-Warner Bros. reboot of \"Tomb Raider,\" starring Alicia Vikander as the archaeologist adventurer Lara Croft. The $90 million film opened with $23.5 million, largely failing to stir much excitement among moviegoers. Critics gave it mediocre reviews (49 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), and ticket buyers responded with a \"meh,\" giving it a B CinemaScore.\n\nWith Vikander stepping in for Angelina Jolie, Roar Uthaug's \"Tomb Raider\" is an attempt to rekindle a video game-adapted franchise that faded quickly the first time around. The 2001 original opened at $47.7 million and grossed $274.7 million worldwide, but the big-budget 2003 sequel flopped, opening with $21.8 million domestically and grossing $156.5 million worldwide.\n\nJeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros., said that \"Tomb Raider\" came close to studio expectations in North America but that international ticket sales were a primary focus. \"Tomb Raider\" was No. 1 overseas, grossing $84.5 million, including $41.1 million in China.\n\n\"International was always a key part of the strategy,\" Goldstein said.\n\nThe continuing success of \"Black Panther\" also didn't help \"Tomb Raider.\" When release dates were being set a year ago, few could have foreseen \"Black Panther\" being No. 1 five weeks in. \"How could you?\" Goldstein said.\n\n\"Black Panther\" has shown considerably fewer legs in China, however. Although it has grossed $96 million in two weeks of release in China, \"Black Panther\" slid steeply in its second weekend.\n\nYet last week, \"Black Panther\" even bested Disney's own \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" Ava DuVernay's adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 novel. In its second week, \"A Wrinkle in Time\" dropped by 50 percent, with $16.6 million in ticket sales.\n\nThe surprise of the weekend was the Lionsgate-Roadside Attractions Christian drama \"I Can Only Imagine,\" which grossed $17.1 million on 1,629 screens -- fewer than half the number that \"Black Panther,\" \"Tomb Raider\" and \"A Winkle in Time\" played on. The film, which co-stars Dennis Quaid and Cloris Leachman, cost only $7 million to make. It stars J. Michael Finley as the singer behind one of the most popular Christian songs, by the band MercyMe.\n\n\"I Can Only Imagine\" doubled expectations by sticking to the typical tactic of \"faith-based\" releases with a grassroots marketing effort that focused on Southern, Southwestern and suburban moviegoers. Eighty percent of the audience was over 35.\n\nPlaying to a virtually opposite audience was 20th Century Fox's \"Love, Simon,\" the first film from a major Hollywood studio featuring a gay teen protagonist. Whereas \"I Can Only Imagine\" catered to the suburbs, \"Love, Simon\" thrived mainly in urban areas.\n\nGreg Berlanti's film, adapted from the best-selling young-adult novel \"Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,\" stars Nick Robinson as a gay 17-year-old who has yet to come out when another closeted boy from his high school begins an anonymous e-mail romance. The film garnered strong reviews (91 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences agreed, giving it an A-plus CinemaScore.\n\n\"I feel good that we released this film. I feel great that we had the kind of exit polls that we did,\" said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Fox. \"I think audiences are going to continue to find this jewel of a film that Greg Berlanti created.\"",

                "body": "We're in the thick of Girl Scout cookie season and the boxes are rolling in. Are you looking at the nutrition labels and having buyer's remorse? Well, don't panic. Girl Scout cookies are treats; they're not meant to be healthy staples in your diet.\n\n\"You're not hitting any nutritional home runs with Girl Scout cookies,\" says Samantha Cassetty, a registered dietitian in New York City. But if you're getting most of your nutrients from healthy foods like veggies, fruits, nuts, beans, whole grains and lean proteins -- and not cookies, you're in good shape.\n\nBesides, Girl Scout cookies do have a few things going for them. First of all, by buying them, you're supporting girls (and getting some serious brownie points). Secondly, Girl Scout cookies are not following the super-size portion trend. \"They've been getting smaller over time,\" says Madelyn Fernstrom, Ph.D., NBC News Health and Nutrition Editor. \"So, one or two of your personal favorites can be a smart, guilt-free indulgence.\"\n\nMartha McKittrick, a registered dietitian in New York City, points out that the Girl Scout cookie bakers have added some whole grains to a couple of the recipes (albeit in very small amounts), which is an improvement. Some of the cookies also contain nuts, which offer protein and healthy fat.\n\nCassetty suggests keeping an eye out for reasonable amounts of added sugar too. For a serving of cookies, she says that's 7 grams. \"On a per serving basis, most Girl Scout cookies don't make the cut,\" she admits. \"But if you eat just one or two of the gluten-free Trios, it's not a terrible choice -- assuming cookies are not part of your daily diet!\"\n\nThe truth is you're getting a lot of refined carbohydrates, sugar and variable amounts of fat in your Girl Scout cookies. Many of them are particularly high in saturated fat -- with most top sellers having more than 20 percent of the daily value.\n\nInstead of focusing on individual nutrients, Cassetty says your best bet is to hone in on the serving size, which is standardized to the nearest ounce. That means the serving size for some cookies, like Shortbreads (aka Trefoils®), which are thin and light, have more cookies per ounce than a denser choice like the Caramel Delites® (aka Samoas®).\n\nCassetty's advice is to stick with a lighter cookie and eat just one or two, even if the serving size suggests it's okay to have four or five. \"A smaller dessert is always better than a bigger one,\" she says. \"Plus, satisfaction declines after the first few bites.\" So it's a strategy that pays off in several ways! Additionally, breaking up a serving for kids is a terrific way to teach them balance and moderation for indulgence foods.\n\nBelow is our breakdown of 2018 Girl Scout cookies from better to worst. We've sized up the nutrition labels* with a strong focus on calories, fat and sugar content per serving.\n\nComing in first place, these simple shortbread-style cookies contain only 4 grams of sugar per serving (and a serving is 4 to 5 cookies, depending on which licensed baker baked the cookies). They're also pretty low in calories compared to most of the other cookies. No wonder they're a top-five best-seller!\n\nThese chocolate chip, peanut butter, oatmeal cookies contain nutrition-positive ingredients like whole-grain oats and peanut butter, so they're rolling in at No. 2. They're also gluten-free, which makes them a good choice for anyone following a gluten-free diet.\n\nThese best-selling cookies also contain both oats and peanut butter. The Peanut Butter Sandwich features peanut butter as its first ingredient, contains an extra gram of dietary fiber, and has only 6 grams of sugar compared to the Do-si-dos®, which contain 11 grams of sugar per serving.",

Horne is a self-proclaimed \"Black Nerd\" for comics, anime, movies and tech.\n\nAccording to a 2016 analysis by author and self-proclaimed comic book historian Tim Hanley, only 6 percent of credits at Marvel comics were black, while 70.1 percent of credits were white. The proportions are roughly the same at DC Comics and Image Comics, publisher of \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Witchblade\".\n\nThe superhero Black Panther was created by writer/editor Stan Lee and writer/artist Jack Kirby. There were only two white main characters in the film: Klaw and Everett.\n\n\"This angered people,\" said Micheline Hess, creator and author of \"Malice in Ovenland.\" \"But they don't realize that that it's been like that for us our entire lives.\"\n\nHess said she and other comic fanatics did not have black superheroes to look up to when they were growing up because the only time comics included black characters were when they were depicted as villains.\n\n\"There is no problem with the villain being black, for example Killmonger in \"Black Panther,\" but they can't only be the villain,\" said Shawn Martinbrough, a critically-acclaimed creator and artist who worked on projects including \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America.\"\n\nKwanza Osajyefo, creator and author of the comic book \"Black\", explained to NBC News that it is important in media to carry all blackness and show diversity of political opinion by setting up an antagonist.\n\nJones echoed this sentiment.\n\n\"Villains have ideals too, but it's the full picture of humanity we have to show. It includes the facet of who we are [imperfect] as human beings,\" he said.\n\nKhary Randolph, a renown black comic book artist and cover illustrator of \"Black,\" said that several people are involved in the multi-step process of creating a comic character. In some situations, the race of the character is pre-determined by the writers and editors, but other times, it is completely up to the illustrator to visualize what the character will look like, as long as it stays within description guidelines and matches the script.\n\n\"I take this opportunity to challenge writers and editors -- by giving them a race or physical trait they weren't expecting,\" said Randolph. \"We've been socially conditioned to illustrate characters as white, simply by default. We have to unlearn this.\"\n\nSince creators in the comic industry are not always people of color, readers may find it controversial when non-ethnic writers and illustrators create ethnic characters.\n\nMartinbrough believes cultural awareness is important when it comes to comic writing.\n\n\"If a white guy wants to tell a story about a black character, I applaud them,\" he said. \"The audience's response will tell it all if someone messes up.\"\n\nOsaiyefo agreed.\n\n\"Do your research as a writer and the ethnicity of the writer or illustrator matters less if you've done the work, because it will reflect in your characters,\" he said. \"However, don't just throw in black characters to create inclusion, that's painting by numbers. Do it when you're ready.\"\n\nWith social media and the explosive growth of digital platforms, some comic artists claim that it's easier than ever to gain exposure and capture an audience through one's work. \"Movement to digital is a good thing for comics because one can showcase his or her work and receive immediate feedback,\" Jamal Igle, creator of \"Molly Danger\" and interior illustrator of \"Black,\" told NBC News.\n\nIgle explained that comics outside of mainstream DC and Marvel often have a hard time reaching mainstream audiences.\n\n\"If 'Black Panther' didn't have Marvel as a resource attached to it, it wouldn't have been this big,\" Igle said. \"'Black Panther's' success is a good thing for all diverse comic artists. It was a defining moment because it acted like a gateway drug for viewers. With the large platform they had for the movie, Hollywood now wants more of this. They will dig deeper and snatch up properties.\"\n\nAlthough there are a growing number of black artists and illustrators, Martinbrough said there is still a need to promote more black writers and editors.\n\n\"This is important because they make a lot of the decisions and with their perspective, they can figure out what's more authentic,\" Martinbrough said.\n\nHess said the comic industry also needs to work on improving gender, LGBTQ and minority racial diversity.\n\n\"There are very few women in a male-dominated space. There's a lot of progress that can still be made.\"",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nWhile none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States.\n\n\"It's bare-faced greed,\" said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. \"The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.\"\n\nKushner Cos. responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and \"if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.\"\n\n\"Kushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights,\" it said, adding that the company \"has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.\"\n\nNew York City Council members are calling for an investigation into the AP's report.\n\nThe falsified documents allowed the Kushner Cos. to escape extra scrutiny during construction projects that the watchdog group said led to harassment of rent regulated tenants.\n\nFor the three Queens buildings in the borough's Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos. checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.\n\nIn all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants. Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units. Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.\n\nHad the Kushner Cos. disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled \"sweeps\" on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.\n\nInstead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.\n\n\"It was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice,\" said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that he also bristled at a 60 percent rent increase, a hike the Kushner Cos. contends was initiated by the previous landord. \"They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave.\"\n\nTax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016.\n\nIn Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.\n\nAt a six-story walk-up in Manhattan's East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos. filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.\n\n\"All of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling. ... You heard the drilling in the middle of night,\" said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs. \"There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster.\"\n\nA knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.\n\n\"I know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out,\" Siwek recalls the man saying. \"We can offer you money.\"\n\nSiwek turned down the cash and sued instead. She said she won a year's worth of free rent and a new refrigerator.\n\nNew York City Council member Ritchie Torres, who plans to launch an investigation into permit applications, said: \"The Kushners appear to be engaging in what I call the weaponization of construction.\"\n\nRent stabilization is a fixture of New York City that can bedevil developers seeking to make money off buildings. To free themselves of its restrictions, landlords usually have to wait until the rent rises above $2,733 a month, something that can take years given the small increases allowed each year.\n\nSubmitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000. But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences. Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an \"amended\" form with the correct numbers.\n\nHousing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.\n\n\"There is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement,\" said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations. Until officials inspect every construction site, \"you're going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.\"\n\nNew York City's Department of Buildings did not comment in general about the false filings by the Kushner Cos., but said it disciplined a contractor who filed false documents while working on two of the Queens buildings, which are currently under investigation by a tenant-harassment task force. It added that the department is also ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors under city laws recently passed to crack down on tenant harassment.\n\n\"We won't tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants -- no matter who they are,\" spokesman Joseph Soldevere said.\n\nExactly how much money the Kushner Cos. earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear. Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold. The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.\n\nJared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos. last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House, sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules. But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.\n\nBack in Queens, the mailman Romano was one of the few rent-regulated tenants who fought back.\n\nHe hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60-percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.\n\nRomano is still in the building where he has lived for nine years, with his wife, four children and his guests from the construction days -- the mice.",

                "title": "How to grow your savings and reach your short term goals faster",
                "body": "Savings account interest rates at big banks have been hovering around 0.09 percent (that's right 1/10th of 1 percent). Inflation -- when the purchasing power of your money falls as prices for goods and services rise -- is usually around 2 to 3 percent per year. That means that the value of your money is still decreasing over time. \"Over longer periods of time, inflation is going to eat away at your buying power, so at the very least, you need to invest in a way that preserves that buying power,\" says McBride. That doesn't mean you're out of options. \"[Even if you're] very conservative [you] can still get more growth than a savings account and should be able to beat inflation,\" says Eric Anderson, first vice president and financial advisor at RBC Wealth Management.\n\nWhen it comes to \"safer\" investments, it's best to choose something where the principal amount of your investment is protected, says Jim Wang, founder of Wallet Hacks. One way to do that is by shopping around for a better savings or money market account than average. Although the average savings accounts are (as we noted) paying peanuts, the best are paying almost 20 times that much. You just have to search for them on a website like bankrate.com or gobankingrates.com. A certificate of deposit (CD) is another option to consider. CDs are savings certificates issued by a financial institution with fixed interest rates and maturity dates. Right now, you can find a 2-year CD paying around 2%. There is a penalty for \"breaking a CD\" or withdrawing the money before the agreed-upon date. But as long as you withdraw after the maturity date, you get to keep the principal investment and the interest you gained. Short-term government or corporate bonds are another conservative option. You're essentially providing a loan at a fixed interest rate, and the issuer is promising to pay back both the principal and the interest. As of the middle of March, 2-year Treasury bills were paying about 2.3% (Government bonds have tax-advantages as well.)\n\nFinally, you may want to take a look at high interest rate checking accounts. No, they're not typical savings vehicles. But some of them pay significantly more. High yield checking accounts have account minimums, not maximums, because they don't want to pay these high interest rates on unlimited sums. They typically require you to pay one bill automatically out of the account or receive one payment by direct deposit into it -- and they require you to use your debit card for purchase at least 10 times each month. (They make their money on swipe fees.) Right now, for example, Blue Credit Union is paying 4% on balances of up to $15,000. Keep close to that in the account for a year and you've netted $600. Magnify Money and Bankrate both maintain lists of some of the best paying high yield checking accounts; be sure to check them both, they have different listings.",

She offered the Mexican government's \"deepest condolences to the family and friends of the Sharps.\"\n\nThe office of the state attorney general was investigating the deaths.

A police official in the Sharps' hometown of Creston, Iowa, said the department was \"not releasing any information until we get autopsy reports back.\"\n\nIowa authorities identified the dead as Kevin Sharp, 41, Amy Sharp, 38, and their children, 12-year-old Sterling and 7-year-old Adrianna.\n\nAshli Peterson, who has been posting updates on the Sharp family and claimed to be a relative, posted on Facebook that she believed \"there was no foul play.\"\n\nShe stated on Facebook that the family left for Mexico on March 15 and was expected to return to St. Louis Lambert International Airport on Wednesday. When they failed to arrive they were reported missing to local police Thursday, she wrote.\n\nNBC News was not immediately able to verify Peterson's relationship to the family.\n\nThe day after the Sharps departed, the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory urging Americans to \"exercise increased caution\" when traveling in the state of Quintana Roo, which also includes Cancun, Cozumel, and Playa del Carmen.

                "title": "Why the Pennsylvania special election was a gut punch for the GOP",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Why the Pennsylvania special election was a gut punch for the GOP: Yes, last night's special congressional election in Pennsylvania was close; NBC News didn't call an apparent winner until 5:19 am ET. And, yes, this district won't exist in its current form come November due to the state's new map.\n\nBut the outcome -- Democrat Conor Lamb getting 641 more votes than Republican Rick Saccone in a district President Trump carried by 20 points in 2016 -- was a gut punch for Trump and the GOP 237 days before the 2018 midterms. Here are five reasons why:\n\n1. The result was further evidence that Democrats are WAY overperforming from 2016:\n\nIn the eight major races of 2017 and 2018, including last night, Democrats are performing on average more than 12 points better than Hillary Clinton did in these states and districts. And last night it was 20 points better.\n\n2. The GOP's messaging and money couldn't save Saccone\n\nPresident Trump inserted himself in this race, campaigning for Saccone on Saturday and timing his announcement on steel tariffs right before this contest. As we wrote last week, Trump turned a minor race into a major referendum on himself. \"After all the money, the campaigning and the tariff timing, to have a Republican lose in a district Trump carried by 20 points would suggest there's not more the president can do to help GOP candidates, even in Trump Country,\" we said.\n\n4. Lamb's apparent victory gives him a head start for November\n\nWith Pennsylvania's new congressional map, Lamb is expected to run against Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-Pa., in PA-17 - a more favorable district than the current PA-18 district. And so Lamb's victory helps him clear the PA-17 field, it gives him incumbent protection services and it puts Rothfus on notice.\n\n5. It could trigger some more GOP retirements\n\nFinally, last night's result could very well scare off a handful of GOP incumbents who are on the fence about running in 2018. The good news for Republicans is that many filing deadlines have already passed. The bad news is that one or two more GOP retirements in semi-competitive districts could end up proving decisive in November's race for control of Congress. That's maybe why Republicans have been spinning the results so much -- essentially saying, \"Hey, last night wasn't THAT bad\" -- so they can prevent more retirements.\n\nNow no single special-election outcome predicts how the midterms will turn out. We remember when Dems won a Pennsylvania special election in 2010 and still got creamed in the midterms. But here's another way to view last night: The Cook Political Report lists PA-18 as an R+11 district, and there are more than 100 GOP-districts that are LESS REPUBLICAN than it is.\n\nOne of the storylines going into last night's contest was the GOP trying to tie Lamb to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, even though Lamb said he didn't support her for leader. Well, while Pelosi is still toxic for Democrats, Lamb was able to counteract that by 1) distancing himself from Pelosi, and 2) having a story to tell.\n\nDemocratic observers tell us that someone with Lamb's bio (Marine, prosecutor) was better suited to fending off the GOP's Pelosi attacks than, say, Jon Ossoff did in GA-6, because Ossoff didn't have the same background and story that Lamb has.\n\nLast week, we described the PA-18 race as a proxy fight between Trump (who campaigned for Saccone on Saturday) and former Vice President Joe Biden (who stumped for Lamb last week). Well, Biden's side won -- narrowly.\n\nAnd a Biden supporter emails us, \"Lamb is the 16th Biden supported candidate to win this off-cycle. And like Lamb, they haven't been lay-ups...Alabama Senate, rural Virginia state leg races, Trump state leg districts in Florida, etc... He has already done stuff for candidates in PA, WI, MN and MI -- places we need to win in both '18 & '20, plus he's traveled to places like Montana & will be in North Dakota this week, as one of the few national Dems who can actually help there. At this point, I'm not sure there's anywhere in the US that a Dem wouldn't want Biden's help, and so far, he's saying yes as much as he can.\"",

                "title": "Five reasons why a single Trump tweet on Mueller stretched the truth",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Over the weekend, President Trump made his most direct -- and explicit -- criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation with this tweet: \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nYet that one tweet contained at least five inaccuracies or distortions.\n\nBy the way, here's a reminder of the known and reported contacts that Team Trump had with Russians, their supposed emissaries and WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign:\n\nThe New York Times: \"[Trump's attack on Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican and former F.B.I. director appointed by a Republican president, George W. Bush, drew immediate rebukes from some members of the party who expressed concern that it might presage an effort to fire the special counsel. Such a move, they warned, would give the appearance of a corrupt attempt to short-circuit the investigation and set off a bipartisan backlash. 'If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule-of-law nation,' Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president, said on 'State of the Union' on CNN.\"\n\n\"Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a sharp critic of Mr. Trump, [added]: 'People see that as a massive red line that can't be crossed,' he said. He urged Mr. Trump's advisers to prevail on him not to fire Mr. Mueller. 'We have confidence in Mueller.' Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said if the president was innocent, he should 'act like it' and leave Mr. Mueller alone, warning of dire repercussions if the president tried to fire the special counsel.\"\n\n\"The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, issued a statement likewise warning Mr. Trump to back off. \"As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job,\" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman. His counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had no comment, as did a number of other top Senate Republicans.\"\n\nAs one of us wrote over the weekend, \"Democrats enjoy a 10-point advantage over Republicans in congressional preference for the 2018 midterm elections, even as President Donald Trump's job approval rating has ticked up, the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds. Fifty percent of registered voters say they prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 40 percent want a GOP-controlled one.\"\n\n\"That double-digit lead -- typically a sign of strong Democratic performance for the upcoming election -- is up from the party's 6-point edge in January's NBC/WSJ poll, which was 49 percent to 43 percent, though the change is within the poll's margin of error.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, the NBC/WSJ polls finds that Trump's approval rating stands at 43 percent among all Americans -- up four points from January. Fifty-three percent of adults say they disapprove of the president's job, down from 57 percent two months ago. The improvement for Trump comes from Republican respondents (who went from 78 percent approve in January to 84 percent this month), white men (52 percent to 59 percent) and independents (33 percent to 45 percent).\"\n\nHere are the favorable/unfavorable numbers in the new NBC/WSJ poll",

                "body": "PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia -- Malaysia's government said Wednesday it will pay U.S. company Ocean Infinity up to $70 million if it can find the wreckage or black boxes of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 within three months, in a renewed bid to solve the plane's disappearance nearly four years ago.\n\nTransport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said there was an 85 percent chance of finding the debris in a new 9,653 square mile area -- roughly the size of Vermont -- identified by experts.\n\nThe government signed a \"no cure, no fee\" deal with the Houston, Texas-based company to resume the hunt for the plane, a year after the official search by Malaysia, Australia and China in the southern Indian Ocean was called off. The plane vanished on March 8, 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.\n\n\"The primary mission by Ocean Infinity is to identify the location of the wreckage and/or both of the flight recorders ... and present a considerable and credible evidence to confirm the exact location of the two main items,\" he told a news conference.\n\nIf the mission is successful within three months, payment will be made based on the size of the area searched. Liow said the government will pay Ocean Infinity $20 million for 1,930 square miles of a successful search, $30 million for 5,790 square miles, $50 million for 9,653 square miles and $70 million if the plane or recorders are found beyond the identified area.\n\nOcean Infinity Chief Executive Oliver Plunkett said the search vessel Seabed Constuctor, which left the South African port of Durban last week, is expected to reach the southern Indian Ocean by Jan. 17 to begin the hunt.\n\nHe said eight autonomous underwater vehicles, which are drones fitted with high-tech cameras, sonars and sensors, will be dispatched to map the seabed at a faster pace. Plunkett said the underwater drones can cover 463 square miles a day.\n\n\"We have a realistic prospect of finding it,\" he said. \"While there can be no guarantees of locating the aircraft, we believe our system of multiple autonomous vehicles working simultaneously is well suited to the task at hand.\"\n\nThe official search was extremely difficult because no transmissions were received from the aircraft after its first 38 minutes of flight. Systems designed to automatically transmit the flight's position failed to work after this point, said a final report from Australian Transport Safety Board last January.\n\n\"I feel very happy but at the same time very panicky whether it can be found or not. Now it's back to four years ago where we have to wait everyday (to find out) whether debris can be found,\" said Shin Kok Chau, whose wife Tan Ser Kuin was a flight attendant on MH370.",

The owners of emotional support animals will need to offer a document, signed by a doctor or licensed mental health professional, verifying that their animal can behave.\n\nLast year, \"Delta employees reported increased acts of aggression (barking, growling, lunging and biting) from service and support animals, behavior not typically seen in these animals when properly trained and working,\" the airline said.\n\nAmong the recent incidents: A man was reportedly mauled by another passenger's 70-pound emotional support dog as a Delta flight was boarding in Atlanta last June. The man could not escape because he was in a window seat and the attack left him with facial wounds requiring 28 stitches, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nFederal law permits service animals to fly in-cab with their owners -- as long as they do not pose a threat to the health and safety of others.\n\nRelated: Where are there so many animals in the sky?\n\n\"The rise in serious incidents involving animals in flight leads us to believe that the lack of regulation in both health and training screening for these animals is creating unsafe conditions across U.S. air travel,\" John Laughter, Delta's senior vice president of corporate safety, security and compliance, said in the statement.\n\nThe new requirements take effect March 1, the airline said.\n\nAmerican Airlines appeared to commend the new Delta rules, saying it was also looking into \"additional requirements.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, untrained animals can lead to safety issues for our team, our passengers and working dogs onboard our aircraft,\" the airline said in a statement. \"We agree with Delta's efforts and will continue to support the rights of customers, from veterans to people with disabilities, with legitimate needs.\"",

                "title": "Istanbul's new $11B airport aims to top Atlanta as the world's busiest",
                "body": "LONDON -- For centuries it has been at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Now Istanbul is making a bid to be a global meeting place with a new $11 billion airport that aims to overtake Atlanta as the world's busiest.\n\nNext month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's jet will be the first to land at the airport -- the latest in a string of high-profile public projects that he hopes will boost an economy weakened by terrorism and a failed coup in 2016 as the country faces a crucial election next year.\n\nCalled simply Istanbul New Airport, the project follows the commission of a 250-mile toll freeway, the opening of a $1.2 billion rail-and-road bridge stretching 1.4 miles across the Bosporus and the $66.5 million landmark Camlica mosque, the largest in Turkey.\n\nAlso planned is a 27-mile canal running parallel to the Bosporus, which Erdogan calls his personal \"dream.\" If built, it will turn the European side of Istanbul into an island.\n\nExperts say Erdogan hopes to secure not just economic growth but also his position as Turkey's most important leader since the modern republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.\n\n\"He loves his big projects, and the airport is perhaps the grandest,\" said Nigel Rendell, a London-based analyst with Medley Global Advisors. \"It allows him to show he is delivering on his promises, right at the time he is trying to extend his powers.\"\n\nThe new hub is on the site of a former forest 22 miles northwest of the city. It will replace the existing chronically congested Ataturk Airport -- the scene of a 2016 terrorist attack that killed 45 people -- when it opens to the public in October.\n\nIt will have the world's largest single terminal building, covering 1.3 million square feet and capable of handling 90 million passengers a year. That number will rise to 150 million when more terminals are added, which could see it leapfrog Los Angeles International, Beijing and even Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson -- which handled 104 million in 2016.\n\nOfficials aim to strengthen Istanbul against rival Middle Eastern mega-hubs such as Dubai and Doha, and help Turkish Airlines -- a partner in the Star Alliance alongside United Airlines -- compete with the so-called ME3 giants -- Emirates, Qatar and Etihad -- for long-haul connecting traffic. It may also attract new services from U.S. carriers, none of whom currently serve Istanbul.\n\nDesigners hope the airport will prove a more popular place to layover than Dubai or Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe duty free and shopping areas cover more than half a million square feet -- bigger than 10 football fields -- and there are 26 miles of baggage belts, capable of handing almost 30,000 bags an hour.\n\n\"Dubai has similar reach in terms of flights, but for much of the year it's too warm to be a comfortable city to walk around,\" said Johann van Rensburg, one of the lead architects of the new terminal. \"In Istanbul there is much more culture and a fantastic climate.\"\n\nHe said the terminal had been designed to make critical points, such as security checkpoints and check-in, less stressful and that passengers would not be forced to walk through stores to get to their gate like they do at many other airports.\n\n\"If you know exactly where you are going, you will be able to head straight there, or if you want to meander through the shops, you can go off to the side,\" van Rensburg said.\n\nMost important, there will be security controls outside of the building as well as between check-in and departures -- a design decision taken after the June 2016 gun-and-bomb assault on Ataturk Airport when attackers targeted the entrance. Security at the new airport will be \"top notch,\" van Rensburg said.\n\nSuch reassurance will be essential for Turkey, which saw tourism slump after the airport attack and a deadly mass shooting in an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Eve 2016. Political instability caused by the July 15, 2016, coup attempt and subsequent crackdown on media freedoms has also spooked visitors and investors.\n\nMinisters believe the new airport will support 225,000 jobs and contribute about $19.5 billion to the economy -- equivalent to 5 percent of the country's gross national product. And if only one in 10 passengers visits Turkey as a tourist, a further $7 billion will flow in.\n\nHowever, despite posting 7 percent growth last year, Turkey's economy has deeper worries.\n\n\"There are still some deep difficulties including high inflation, which is currently running at about 11 percent, and interest rates that were well above target,\" said Rendell, the analyst. \"The country is also very susceptible to exchange rates because it imports a lot of things and the currency had a volatile period last year.\"\n\nAnd while the major infrastructure works have created construction jobs and income, most of it has gone to companies that support or who have donated to Erdogan's dominant conservative Islamic AK Party, Rendell said.\n\nThe airport itself might have a slow start; its distance from the city, almost at the Black Sea, means many passengers will have to rely on a new subway line for which construction began only last year. Airport officials did not respond to questions about whether it would be finished in time for the airport's slated Oct. 18 opening.\n\nNevertheless, Erdogan remains optimistic that his latest project will secure him the 2019 presidential election, after which he will assume sweeping new powers of \"executive presidency\" granted in a narrow and divisive constitutional referendum victory last year.\n\n\"He has already assumed many extra powers under the emergency rules that have been in place since the coup, but it's the executive presidency he really craves,\" Rendell said. \"That would allow him to stay in power five more years and he could have a second term. That's the kind of power that worries people because he's very autocratic. He does pretty much what he wants.\"\n\nErdogan's ceremonial landing at Istanbul New Airport is to take place on Feb. 26, his 64th birthday, prompting speculation that the airport will ultimately be named after him.\n\nIf so, the symbolism would be stark; the old airport is named after Ataturk, the country's founder venerated by moderate Turks for his modern, West-facing secularism. Erdogan's opponents fear he is dismantling Ataturk's legacy by turning Turkey toward traditional Islam, emphasizing its Ottoman past and weakening ties with the U.S. in favor of Russia and Iran.\n\nThey point to the new Bosporus bridge, named in honor of the 15th-century Ottoman Sultan Selim I, often called Selim the Grim due to his hard-nosed rule, overseas conquests and persecution of minorities.\n\nFor his part, Erdogan told a crowd of thousands waving Turkish flags at the bridge's opening: \"When [a] man dies, he leaves behind a monument.\"",

                "body": "Travelers and advocates are baring their teeth at Delta's new rule that passengers with service animals must submit paperwork two full days before flying.\n\nWhile some fliers are cheering Delta Air Lines' new, stricter rules for those traveling with service or emotional support animals, many long-time guide dog users and organizations that advocate for travelers with disabilities say the guidelines, which require added documentation and pre-planning, are over-reaching, discriminatory and illegal.\n\nCiting a significant increase in the numbers and types of \"comfort\" animals passengers bring on planes -- and an 84 percent increase in reported animal incidents such as urinating/defecating, biting and attacks -- Delta announced last week that certification of a flyer's need for an animal and proof of an animal's training and vaccinations will be required for both service and emotional support animals.\n\nHowever, organizations such as The National Federation of the Blind believe elements of Delta's policy, which goes into effect March 1, violate the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act.\n\n\"We are particularly troubled by the requirement that guide dog users submit paperwork to Delta 48 hours before flying,\" the NFB said in a statement, noting that \"Travelers without guide dogs are not required to plan their travel 48 hours in advance.\"\n\nThe 48-hour 'intent-to-fly' requirement means guide dog users \"will no longer be able to fly on Delta for family, medical or other emergencies,\" said the NFB.\n\n\"We stand with NFB,\" said Eric Lipp, Executive Director of the Open Doors Organization. \"People with properly trained service animals are being punished by Delta.\"\n\nNoting that it has \"long been concerned with the abuse and fraud of animals purporting to be service or support animals,\" the American Council of the Blind also said Delta's revised policy discriminates against passengers with legitimate service dogs and makes travel more difficult for individuals who rely on their service animals for travel.\n\n\"I sympathize with the airlines,\" said Pat Pound, a disability consultant who is blind and travels with a guide dog. \"More people are cheating. Airlines are trying to maintain the system. But I don't think Delta's new policies will address the problem. And, as a person with a disability, I'll end up being penalized.\"\n\nAn on-line petition with more than 75,000 signatures is asking Delta not to make it harder for people to travel with emotional support animals -- but other airlines are already exploring following Delta's lead.\n\n\"We agree with Delta's efforts,\" American Airlines said in a statement. \"We are looking at additional requirements to help protect our team members and our customers who have a real need for a trained service or support animal.\" The carrier said from 2016 to 2017 it saw an almost 15 percent increase in the number of customers traveling with emotional support animals.\n\nUnited Airlines is reviewing its existing policy on service and emotional support animals, said airline spokesman Charles Hobart. \"This is something that is important to our employees and to our customers, including those with disabilities and those who do not have disabilities,\" he said. \"We understand this needs to be resolved soon.\"\n\nThe Department of Transportation had planned to draft new rules on service animals by July 2017, but those guidelines have yet to be released.\n\nGoing forward, \"I suspect there will be legal challenges to Delta's policy on service dogs from individuals and from organizations,\" said disability consultant Pound. \"This is how an airline is deciding to interpret the law, but a court may have a different idea about what that the law intended.\"",

Selter also boasts more than 11.7 million followers on Instagram.\n\nAmerican Airlines said in a statement that Selter was asked to leave the plane after a \"disagreement.\"\n\n\"American offered her hotel accommodations and transportation, which she declined,\" the airline said. \"She flew on American Sunday morning back to New York.\"\n\nIn a video posted by Selter, a woman's voice can be heard explaining to a man, who appears to be the pilot, that a flight attendant asked her to sit after she stood to \"put up\" her jacket while the plane was delayed.\n\nRelated: Ticket mix-up causes woman to miss flight to visit dying mom\n\nSeveral voices can be heard explaining the situation to the pilot. It is unclear which one is Selter's.\n\nThe woman behind the camera told the pilot that the flight attendant explained to her that the plane could not move until she sat down, but the two other people in her row were in the bathroom at the time.\n\n\"We also said, 'Would you like to get off?' and she said 'yes,'\" the unidentified flight attendant told the pilot.\n\n\"I was obviously being sarcastic, ma'am,\" the woman behind the camera replies.\n\nOther passengers, frustrated by the delays, begin to defend the woman as the video goes on.\n\nEventually, a video shows several police officers asking Selter to leave.\n\nRelated: Rep. Jackson Lee suspects United incident had racial tinge\n\nIn the final video posted to Selter's Twitter account, which appears to take place inside the terminal, a woman, who was not involved in the confrontation, explains why she, too, got off the plane.\n\n\"So, the thing is, I saw what the guy did to your sister. She was just standing after two hours. We've been waiting in the airplane. She was just standing because you and the other passenger went to the bathroom,\" the unidentified woman said. \"And then, one of the crew members, he just started shouting at her, harassing her. It was really bad.\"\n\nSelter did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",

Airport police and fire crews have been working with city, county and federal law enforcement agencies on how to deal with various scenarios. And the Transportation Security Administration is bringing in extra officers and passenger-screening canines to help process passengers heading home after the game.\n\n\"TSA operations at MSP following the Super Bowl will be an 'all hands on deck' operation,\" said TSA spokeswoman Lorie Dankers. \"From uniformed staff to plain-clothes administrative personnel, everyone will be working.\"\n\nTSA and MSP expect to set passenger records on the Monday and Tuesday after Super Bowl, but airport officials are confident their team is up for the challenge.\n\n\"We have a solid plan in place to keep everyone safe, the operation running smoothly, and travelers' experience positive,\" said MSP's Ryks.\n\nSafe and smooth is good, but MSP's Super Bowl welcome team is also offering fans of the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots some fun extras.\n\nA 10-day \"Performing Arts Spectacular\" is underway, with a lineup of events featuring everything from Bollywood, hip-hop and flamenco dancers to vocal and drum performances. The airport's animal ambassadors will be out in full force. And giveaways in the terminals will include a series of Super Bowl/Winter-themed MSP buttons and foldable terminal maps with disposable hand warmers attached.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Delta, Southwest, American and United, have added flights to MSP from Boston, Philadelphia and many other major hubs for Super Bowl ticket holders and last-minute planners heading to the Twin Cities to partake of Super Bowl festivities.\n\nIn addition to the extra flights, American Airlines, the official airline for the Philadelphia Eagles, is handing out Eagles rally towels to all passengers flying on from Philadelphia to Minneapolis-St. Paul through Sunday, Feb. 4.\n\nAnd on Saturday and Sunday, United Airlines is serving \"football favorites,\" including hot dogs and macaroni salad, to customers visiting the carriers' lounges in its hub cities.

                "body": "A beloved pet hamster that was flushed down a toilet has become the latest controversial case in airlines versus people seeking to travel with emotional support animals.\n\nBelen Aldecosea, 21, on Thursday accused Spirit Airlines of causing her to tearfully flush Pebbles the hamster down a toilet in an airport bathroom after the company refused to let her bring the pet on a flight as an emotional support animal, according to lawyer Adam Goodman.\n\nAldecosea made the choice after Spirit staffers allegedly told her before her trip that she could bring her pet and later refused to let the animal on her flight at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on Nov. 21, Goodman said.\n\n\"This is a horrible situation. We hope that no one ever has to go through a situation like this,\" he told NBC News Thursday. \"This is a really tiny, small innocuous animal that doesn't cause problems. Really, the airlines and TSA shouldn't have given her any problems about it if she had the appropriate medical documentation.\"\n\nGoodman said that Aldecosea was told by phone by an airline employee that she could fly with Pebbles as an emotional support animal, but then would not let her on the flight with her hamster.\n\nAldecosea is alleging that an airline representative then suggested she flush the animal down a toilet, according to Goodman. The college student had some ongoing medical issues and needed to catch a flight home to Florida, he said. Aldecosea had a benign, but painful growth on her neck and was traveling to Florida because she was withdrawing from school and having the growth looked at by a doctor, he said.\n\nShe was a student at Wilson College in Pennsylvania at the time and is now a student in Texas, he said.\n\nShe tried to find alternate modes of travel, but Aldecosea is too young to rent a car on her own and there was a lack of other options because of the Thanksgiving holiday, Goodman said, leaving the young woman with a \"horrendous\" decision to make.\n\n\"Spirit told her what to do. She thought she was following the rules,\" he said. \"Ultimately, the airline didn't provide what they said they were going to provide for her.\"\n\nSpirit Airlines strongly denied the allegation that an employee suggested she flush the hamster.\n\n\"After researching this incident, we can say confidently that at no point did any of our agents suggest this Guest (or any other for that matter) should flush or otherwise injure an animal,\" airline spokesman Derek Dombrowski said in a statement to NBC News.\n\n\"It is incredibly disheartening to hear this Guest reportedly decided to end her own pet's life,\" the statement added.\n\nRelated: Emotional support peacock denied flight by United Airlines\n\nSpirit's spokesman said that a reservation representative \"unfortunately, did misinform the Guest that a hamster was permitted to fly as an emotional support animal on Spirit Airlines.\"\n\nThe airline said when Aldecosea showed up to the airport with the hamster agents gave her the opportunity to take a later flight \"so she had time to find other accommodations for the animal.\"\n\nSpirit Airlines says on its website that it \"does not accept snakes, other reptiles, rodents, ferrets, and spiders.\"\n\nDombrowski said Aldecosea was originally scheduled to take a 10:39 a.m. flight on Nov. 21 but ended up taking a flight at 7:42 p.m. instead.\n\nAldecosea took the later flight without further incident, he said. Dombrowski added that the airline offered Aldecosea a voucher, but never heard back from her.\n\nGoodman said he and Aldecosea were \"going to look into all legal remedies and make a decision.\"\n\nAldecosea told the Miami Herald that the whole ordeal was \"horrifying.\"\n\n\"I was emotional. I was crying. I sat there for a good 10 minutes crying in the stall,\" she said.\n\nRelated: Delta sets new guidelines on service animals allowed on board\n\nThe hamster incident came after a separate airline turned away an emotional support peacock at a New Jersey airport last month. United Airlines said the bird did not meet its guidelines.\n\nAlso in January, Delta Airlines issued new requirements when it comes to emotional support animals.\n\nThe Department of Transportation's guidelines for air travel with service animals states \"unusual animals are evaluated on a case by case basis\" and that airlines may exclude animals that are too large or heavy to accommodate in the flight cabin, pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others, could cause a significant disruption of service or are prohibited from entering a foreign country.\n\nAirlines are also never required to accept snakes, reptiles, rodents, ferrets, or spiders.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe students intend to send a message to President Donald Trump and Congress and demand that their politicians pursue gun legislation to make it harder to acquire firearms. Their goal is to stem \"the epidemic of mass schools shootings that has become all too familiar,\" according to their mission statement.\n\nDemetri Hoth, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, spoke alongside Florida politicians and other students from D.C., Chicago and Minneapolis at a press conference at Capitol Hill on Friday.\n\n\"I stand before you here today to invite you, students and parents across America: Let us pray with our legs, let us march in unison to the rhythm of justice, because I say enough is enough,\" Hoth said.\n\nMarch For Our Lives events Friday included a voter registration drive, a concert and a candlelight vigil.\n\nA Rock the Vote event -- hosted by the National Education Association and run in partnership with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Urban League -- took place Friday at 6 p.m.\n\nA benefit concert at 6:30 p.m. was scheduled to include a number of notable artists, including Fall Out Boy, G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha, Lizzo and others. At 7 p.m., the Washington National Cathedral will host an interfaith prayer vigils for those who planned to participate in the march.\n\nPrior to all three events, some Parkland students met with members of Congress and former Vice President Joe Biden in private meetings, while others shared their mass shooting experiences at the Newseum.\n\nAll seemed to push for the same thing, however: more restrictive gun laws.\n\n\"Stop being coerced by the NRA,\" Hoth said, speaking to Congress. \"I urge you propose meaningful gun safety laws, vote yea to bills that advance gun control, and sing along with us to the melody of justice, never again, never again, never again.\"\n\nThe Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police have limited the event to three entrances where participants may join the march on Saturday. Organizers expect around 30,000 people to attend Saturday's rally.\n\n\"The support we've gotten is unimaginable,\" said Casey Sherman, a Stoneman Douglas junior and one of the main organizers. \"So we're really excited for this Saturday: It's going to be incredible. I can't even begin to tell you how proud I am of all the work that we and students across the country and across the world have been doing.\"\n\nSherman said that approximately 20 Stoneman Douglas students had worked to organize the march, but he said many more would be pitching in on Saturday.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told MSNBC that the country owed a debt to this group of Parkland students, who he planned to meet prior to the march.\n\n\"I'm going to look them in the eye and say, thank you to the students of Parkland and the students around the country who are finally changing the conversation here on Capitol Hill,\" he said.\n\nAnd those students aren't holding back. The March For Our Lives website allows attendees to print out a \"price tag\" of $1.05 to wear at the event. That price is the amount the NRA contributed to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., divided by the number of students in Florida, which organizers argue is how much each student is worth to the two-term senator.\n\nThe event also aims to be a massive voter registration push, as participants are encouraged to download \"Voter Registration Toolkits\" that are state specific and ensure those they know join the voter rolls.\n\nWhile tens of thousands of marchers are expected to join in throughout the United States -- with demonstrations planned in Boston, Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles -- there are a handful of solidarity events organized on Friday and Saturday in countries across the globe. Rallies are planned in Israel, New Zealand, Australia, the U.K. Japan, Belgium, India, France and Chile.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage, gun control advocacy groups, are helping the sister marches throughout the country coordinate with the March For Our Lives movement, and they're also acting as advisers to the teen organizers.\n\n\"We've really been getting a lot of advice and help in that area from people who have that experience,\" Sherman said. \"Of course we're advising [on] everything ... but we've really been focusing on those last kind of little final pieces ... that'll make our march so much more.\"\n\nA number of celebrities showered praise on the students. Some, including Miley Cyrus, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, Common and Ben Platt, also planned to join them on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Parkland, their teachers and parents also applauded the students' efforts.\n\nGregory Pittman, an American history teacher, said at a Stoneman Douglas pep rally on Tuesday that he was proud of his students, as they had taken what they'd learned in the classroom and applied it in the real world. He believed that this movement would only continue to grow.\n\n\"This is not the end of what they're going to do,\" he said. \"This is only the beginning both in Florida and definitely in Washington. We've only started in Washington.\"",

After the first pull, the finger remains stationary and the weapon repeatedly bumps against it: in essence, the rifle then fires itself.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms determined earlier that bump stocks should not be classified as machine guns, because the weapons they were attached to still required a separate trigger pull for each round fired.\n\nBut in proposing the new rule Friday, the Justice Department said the earlier ruling \"does not reflect the best interpretation of the term 'machine gun.'\"\n\nWeapons classified as machine guns are grandfathered and may be kept if they were legally possessed before the Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed. But because no bump stocks existed before the law was passed, the proposed rule said, gun owners who have the devices now \"would be required to surrender them, destroy them, or otherwise render them permanently inoperable.\"\n\nThe proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register next week, providing for 90 days of public comment. The government can then make the rule final.\n\nSessions' announcement came the day before a large anti-gun violence march set for Washington, D.C., on Saturday.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAnti-abortion measures gained ground across the country this week, with lawmakers in Kentucky passing a measure that, if signed into law, would be one of the most restrictive measures in the nation, and Idaho's governor signing a law requiring doctors to report to the state how many abortions a woman has had.\n\nIn Mississippi, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law banning abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nState legislators in typically conservative Utah, however, bucked the trend a bit by unanimously supporting a bill that makes it easier for women to purchase birth control.\n\nIn Kentucky, the Republican-controlled state Senate approved legislation on Thursday that seeks to ban an abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation after 11 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe procedure makes up 16 percent of all abortions performed in Kentucky, according to Reuters. After being approved by the Senate, 31-5, the measure will now be voted on by Kentucky's House of Representatives, which passed another version of the legislation on March 12 with a 71-11 vote.\n\nThe state's governor, Matt Bevin, a Republican, has described himself as \"a 100 percent pro-life legislator.\"\n\nIn Idaho, Gov. Butch Otter, a Republican, signed legislation on Thursday requiring that abortion providers report how many times their patients have terminated pregnancies, along with other personal information, such as the patient's age, race and how many children she has. The information will be compiled by the state into an annual report to be made public, although without identifying details.\n\nThe legislation came on the heels of another law that Otter signed on Tuesday that requires that women looking to have an abortion be notified that the procedure can be stopped halfway -- despite multiple medical experts who said that is not true.\n\n\"Claims regarding abortion 'reversal' treatment are not based on science and do not meet clinical standards,\" the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state in a fact sheet on their website. \"Yet, politicians are pushing legislation to require physicians to recite a script that a medication abortion can be 'reversed' with doses of progesterone, and to steer women to this care. Unfounded legislative mandates represent dangerous political interference and compromise patient care and safety.\"\n\nBoth Idaho laws will go into effect on July 1.\n\nThe passage of a Mississippi bill that also highly restricts abortion was temporarily blocked by a federal judge on Tuesday, after the state's only clinic that provides abortions, the Jackson Women's Health Organization, sued the state on behalf of its patients.\n\nThe 10-day block will buy the organization some time to fight HB 1510, a measure signed into law by Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, five weeks fewer than under the previous state law.\n\nIn his two-page ruling, Judge Carlton W. Reeves cited the landmark Supreme Court decision Row v. Wade, writing: \"The Supreme Court says every woman has a constitutional right to 'personal privacy' regarding her body. That right protects her choice 'to have an abortion before viability.' States cannot 'prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision' to do so.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood leaders harshly criticized the proposed ban in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"Mississippi already ranks last nationwide when it comes to the health of our women and children. If Gov. Bryant truly cared about the health and well-being of Mississippi women and families, he would be working to expand access to health care -- not taking it away,\" said Felicia Brown-Williams, Mississippi state director for Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates. \"This law was written by politicians, not doctors. HB 1510 is just the latest in a series of attacks targeting women and access to safe, legal abortion.\"\n\nIn Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, signed a measure on Tuesday that will allow women to obtain birth control directly from a pharmacy, instead of requiring a doctor's prescription.\n\nThe measure, unanimously passed by the state legislature, was sponsored by state Sen. Todd Weller, a Republican who highlighted that the policy would save the state money. The law, which will go into effect May 8, will still require that women fill out a form that assesses their risks of using birth control, as well as require that they check in with a doctor every two years to continue receiving the medication.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nLawyers told Steve Bannon and other managers of data firm Cambridge Analytica in 2014 that only U.S. citizens should be \"making decisions about U.S. election activity,\" but the Cambridge teams working on several congressional campaigns that year were largely composed of foreign nationals anyway, according to two former staffers.\n\nAs first reported by the New York Times, attorney Lawrence Levy of Bracewell & Giuliani sent a memo to Bannon, conservative megadonor Rebekah Mercer and Cambridge founder Andrew Nix that said Nix would have to be \"recused from substantive management of any such clients involved in U.S. elections\" because Nix is not a U.S. national.\n\nThe memo from former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's law firm, obtained by NBC News, also says that foreign nationals could collect and process data, but \"may not play strategic roles including the giving of strategic advice to candidates, campaigns, political parties or independent expenditure committees.\"\n\nIt also advises that \"final analysis of said data should be conducted by U.S. citizens and conveyed to any U.S. clients by such citizens.\"\n\nClick here to read the full memo\n\nBut Chris Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian who ran messaging for Cambridge out of its London office in 2014, said he worked on all the company's U.S. political campaigns in 2014, \"and stopped at most of them, like Thom Tillis's campaign.\" Tillis ran for and won a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2014.\n\nWylie said that many foreign nationals worked on the campaigns, and many were embedded in the campaigns around the U.S. \"It was not just me,\" he said. \"Like 20 other people were. We had Canadians, British, Eastern Europeans, Lithuanians, Germans, Romanians, Greeks.\"\n\n\"We weren't just working on messaging. We were instructing campaigns on which messages go where and to who.\"\n\nWylie said that his largely foreign team instructed the Tillis campaign \"on the messaging. We crafted his messaging, we targeted his messaging.\"\n\nHe said he couldn't recall any American Cambridge employees working on the Tillis campaign. \"There were three or four full-time CA staffers embedded in Tillis's campaign on the ground in Raleigh. All of them were foreign nationals.\"\n\nWylie left the company in December 2014.\n\nA second former senior Cambridge staffer also said that most of the messaging team in 2014 was composed of foreign nationals. The staffer confirmed that there were foreign embeds in Raleigh on the Tillis campaign.\n\nThe staffer said that the team handling the data and data modeling back in London was largely Eastern European and did not include any Americans.\n\nSCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, did not respond to the specific assertion that foreign nationals were directly involved in messaging decisions, but has previously told NBC News that all personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders. The company also said that Nix never had any strategic or operational role in U.S. campaigns.\n\nAn attorney for an electoral law watchdog group said he was \"not aware\" of the Federal Election Commission addressing whether the foreign national ban should specifically apply to a group like Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"The general rule that a foreign national should not be directing or otherwise involved in decisions about contributions or expenditures made by a campaign or super PAC should apply, regardless of the formal role they have in the campaign or with the superPAC,\" said Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center. \"The FEC has not squarely addressed this issue.\"\n\nFischer said that if the foreign national is only providing advice about expenditures, but is not part of the decision-making about the expenditures, \"the FEC might say that that's okay.\"\n\nFischer also said Nix could also play a major role as long as he were not involved in how particular committees made expenditures.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center has filed an unrelated complaint with the FEC that alleges Cambridge Analytica served as a conduit between the Trump campaign and a super PAC funded by the Mercer family during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe FEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

While his body was identified through dental records, the release says \"authorities are unable to confirm his time of death\" and the \"cause of death has been ruled undetermined by the state medical examiner.\"\n\nAs Dateline has previously reported, David was last seen in the early morning hours of Sunday, August 6, 2017.

                "body": "MIAMI -- College dropout Wayne Huizenga started with a trash-hauling company, struck gold during America's brief love affair with VHS tapes and eventually owned three professional sports teams.\n\nHuizenga owned Blockbuster Entertainment, AutoNation and the world's largest trash hauler, and was founding owner of baseball's Florida Marlins and the NHL Florida Panthers. He bought the NFL Miami Dolphins for $138 million in 1994.\n\nThe one thing he never got was a Super Bowl win.\n\nHuizenga died late Thursday, according to Valerie Hinkell, his longtime assistant. He was 80.\n\nThe Marlins won the 1997 World Series, and the Panthers reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1996, but Huizenga's beloved Dolphins never reached a Super Bowl while he owned the team.\n\n\"If I have one disappointment, the disappointment would be that we did not bring a championship home,\" Huizenga said shortly after he sold the Dolphins to New York real estate billionaire Stephen Ross, who still owns the team. \"It's something we failed to do.\"\n\nHuizenga earned an almost cultlike following among business investors who watched him build Blockbuster Entertainment into the leading video rental chain by snapping up competitors. He cracked Forbes' list of the 100 richest Americans, becoming chairman of Republic Services, one of the nation's top waste management companies, and AutoNation, the nation's largest automotive retailer.\n\n\"You just have to be in the right place at the right time,\" he said. \"It can only happen in America.\"\n\nFor a time, Huizenga was also a favorite with South Florida sports fans, drawing cheers and autograph seekers in public. The crowd roared when he danced the hokey pokey on the field during an early Marlins game. He went on a spending spree to build a veteran team that won the World Series in only the franchise's fifth year.\n\nRelated: Remembering Blockbuster Video (1985-2013)\n\nBut his popularity plummeted when he ordered the roster dismantled after that season. He was frustrated by poor attendance and his failure to swing a deal for a new ballpark built with taxpayer money.\n\nMany South Florida fans never forgave him for breaking up the championship team. Huizenga drew boos when introduced at Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino's retirement celebration in 2000, and kept a lower public profile after that.\n\nIn 2009, Huizenga said he regretted ordering the Marlins' payroll purge.\n\n\"We lost $34 million the year we won the World Series, and I just said, 'You know what, I'm not going to do that,' \" Huizenga recalled. \"If I had it to do over again, I'd say, 'OK, we'll go one more year.' \"\n\nHe sold the Marlins in 1999 to John Henry, and sold the Panthers in 2001, unhappy with rising NHL player salaries and the stock price for the team's public company.\n\nHe turned a nifty profit by selling the Dolphins and their stadium for $1.1 billion, nearly seven times what he paid to become sole owner. But he knew that the bottom line in the NFL is championships, and his Dolphins perennially came up short.\n\nHarry Wayne Huizenga was born in the Chicago suburbs on Dec. 29, 1937, to a family of garbage haulers. He attended Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, but dropped out and began his own garbage-hauling business in Pompano Beach, Florida, in 1962. He would drive a garbage truck from 2 a.m. to noon each day, then shower and go out and solicit new customers in the afternoon.\n\nOne customer successfully sued Huizenga, saying that in an argument over a delinquent account, Huizenga injured him by grabbing his testicles -- an allegation Huizenga always denied.\n\n\"I never did that. The guy was a deputy cop. It was his word against mine, a young kid,\" he told Fortune magazine in 1996.\n\nHe eventually bought out several competitors, expanding throughout South Florida. In 1968, he merged with the Chicago sanitation company his uncles owned, creating Waste Management Inc., which eventually became the world's largest trash company. That became his method of operation -- becoming the first national player in industries that had been dominated by small and local operations. He resigned from the company in 1984, taking $100 million in stock.\n\nBut retirement bored him and he soon began buying dozens of small businesses like hotels and pest control companies. In 1987, a business partner persuaded him to check out Blockbuster, a small chain of video stores. At the time, video stores were mostly locally owned mom-and-pop operations. Huizenga didn't even own a VCR.\n\n\"I had an image of them being dark and dingy and dirty types of adult bookstores,\" he told The Miami Herald. \"But when I finally saw a Blockbuster store, it opened my mind.\"\n\nThe stores were clean and carried 10,000 titles, 10 times more than the typical corner video store. He loved the concept and thought it could become the McDonalds of video. He and two partners bought 43 percent of the business for $19 million and he became chairman and president. By 1991, the chain had grown to over 1,800 stores, with one opening every 17 hours, on average.",

In a book she authored, due out in August, Rouse and her co-author show that Latino millennials are more supportive of gun control measures than either white or African American millennials.\n\n\"However, the issue of gun control has not previously been an issue Latinos care strongly about,\" according to Rouse. Immigration, education, or healthcare remain top issues for them.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this is something that hits home for young Latinos as a group and if they will mobilize to sustain attention on the issue, said Rouse.\n\nA 2014 Pew Hispanic Research survey found a majority of Latino registered voters (62 percent) thought controlling gun ownership was more important than protecting the rights of gun owners (36 percent).\n\nFor Parkland students grappling with the mass shooting, it's still very raw.

                "body": "Perhaps the most troubling issue for parents is that part of their job is to help their children feel safe in a world that can turn deadly in an instant.Damian Dovarganes / AP\n\nLike mass shootings in general, school shootings have gone from being a rare tragedy to a tragic reality. Already in 2018 there have been more than a dozen instances of gun violence in U.S. schools, including the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida that claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty members. This weekend, as many as 500,000 parents, students and others are expected to attend the March for Our Lives in Washington, DC to advocate for more sensible gun laws. These shootings and their aftermath leave many parents scrambling for words: How can you possibly explain gun violence to your kids and how to do you talk about it?\n\nI put these questions to mental health experts who just happen to be dealing with these concerns at home. Here are their best strategies to keep the lines of communication open and your own emotions in check.\n\nFor your own sake and your children's, it's critical that you make time to quell your own anxieties before diving into the issue at hand.\n\n\"To have these conversations open and honestly you need to take care of yourself as a parent,\" says Kristin Wilson, a licensed professional counselor and clinician with a teenage daughter. \"Have your own support system in a spouse or friend or another go-to person, so that when you're talking to your child you've already processed through it.\"\n\nWilson adds that she experienced her own scare when her daughter's school was on lockdown for over six hours due to the possibility of a shooter. She found out on the news, when it was leaked to a local media network.\n\n\"I was on the phone with my partner and my friends trying to process everything,\" she says. \"Having your own support group is important as is indulging in self-care so you're not so reactionary. Yoga, mindfulness practice, exercise and really anything you can do to better your mental health is essential, because sadly, this is a reality now.\"\n\nYou may be unsure where to even begin with such a heavy topic. Consider asking your kids what their questions are before you give your two cents.\n\n\"It is often best to let your child take the lead in asking questions about difficult situations so that you only share what you feel is necessary to satisfy their inquiries,\" says Dr. Allison Agliata, a clinical psychologist, head of an independent middle school in Tampa Bay and the mother of three children ages 12 and younger. \"Otherwise, as parents, we tend to either share too little and leave them wondering, or over-explain and freak them out.\"\n\nMost of the mental health experts I spoke with strongly recommended having screen-free routine family time, and using that time to talk one-on-one with your kids about school shootings and any other issues that may be top of mind. For Wilson, this means a daily check-in at the dinner table.\n\n\"Sometimes my check-in is as simple as, 'How was school today?' And other times it's a more uncomfortable topic about drugs and alcohol or school violence,\" says Wilson, adding that this longstanding ritual has enabled her daughter to always count on this time to talk, trusting that it's a space to discuss both the good and the bad. \"If you set the groundwork early, they will naturally come to you with concerns as well as really awesome things.\"\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be at the dinner table. Christopher Gerhart, a licensed and certified substance abuse counselor finds that he and his preteen daughter have their best talks about serious matters such as gun violence while he walks her to school. Kelley Kitley, a licensed clinical social worker talks with her four kids ages 11 and under individually at bedtime.\n\n\"For us it's a lot calmer. Our household is chaotic [during the day], but at that time lights are dim. It's usually about 15 minutes each and they really look forward to it,\" Kitley says. Dr. Agliata has found bedtime works best for her family as well adding, \"we reflect on the day and they have some one on one time with me to share their thoughts.\"",

                "body": "The extent of sea ice is tracked closely by researchers and is being connected by some scientists to unusual weather hundreds of miles to the south, including drought in California and big snowfalls along the East Coast. These researchers say that although it would be wrong to cite warming as the cause of any single weather event, the likelihood of extreme weather has increased as temperatures in the Arctic jump up.\n\nOther scientists cautioned against putting too much focus on Arctic warming, saying other factors are contributing to changing weather patterns in the lower latitudes. Both sides agree that more research is needed into the connection between warming in the far north and weather elsewhere.\n\nTemperatures in the Arctic have increased about twice as fast as they have in the rest of the globe over the past 25 years, an increase of seven degrees Fahrenheit, or more, in some areas. Less white ice on the Earth's surface means that less of the sun's heat is reflected back into space. That exacerbates the warming pattern and, in a vicious cycle, melts even more ice.\n\nThe scientific consensus is that the higher temperatures all over Earth have created secondary effects, like rapid sea level rise, more intense heat waves and a shifting in the ranges of some animals. As much as one-quarter of the globe's warming has been linked to the loss of sea ice.\n\nResearchers six years ago first suggested another profound impact: warming in the Arctic contributes to extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere. The theory goes like this: Warmer Arctic air is closer to the temperature in the lower latitudes, thereby weakening the atmospheric barrier that previously kept the jet stream flowing in a relatively straight line. The river of air that speeds west to east around the globe now meanders north and south. The peaks and troughs in this \"wavier\" path drive weather on Earth. And because the unleashed jet stream moves more slowly, weather systems tend to linger.",

                "body": "As political originals and party mavericks, Reagan and Trump shared a weapon that none of their contemporaries could match.White House/Universal History Archive\n\nBack when Republicans discussed the future of their party, \"Let Reagan be Reagan\" emerged as the demand of purist Reaganites who feared that moderate Republicans had reined in the Gipper. While the current GOP congressional leadership seems too cowed to do anything but let President Donald Trump be Trump, the updating of the catch phrase raises the question of how Trump's brand of authenticity will measure up as compared to Reagan's.\n\nAs political originals and party mavericks, Ronald Reagan and Trump shared a weapon that none of their contemporaries could match -- the public perception that each man was the genuine article, presenting himself without the usual filters of calculation and propriety. And yet, the defeats of Trump-endorsed candidates in Virginia, Alabama and Pennsylvania within the past six months show beyond reasonable argument that some mainstream Republican voters are disenchanted, if not completely alienated by the raucous uncertainty that currently rules the White House. As someone who rode the Reagan campaign plane in 1980 and covered the \"gaffes\" of his first year in the White House, I'm not convinced that Trump's Teflon coating will last.\n\nI am reminded of the most hilarious moment I witnessed in the same White House briefing room where Sarah Huckabee Sanders gamely now appears each day to sweep up the broken China. The late Jerry O'Leary, a crusty Washington Star reporter known for his impatience with spin, confronted Reagan's press secretary Larry Speakes after the president had made some questionable declaration that seemed to alter a long-standing U.S. position. I don't have the transcript, but I'm certain as to the key words of O'Leary's question: \"Larry, was the president making policy or was he just speaking for himself?\" No one, including Speakes, could suppress their laughter.\n\nThere is, of course, a serious journalistic question about how to assess mold-breaking officials. Political reporting should aspire to serve the reader rather than please the White House. And 38 years ago this month, my colleagues and I in the press pack assigned to the Reagan campaign plane were wondering whether the actor's presumably limited intelligence and lack of foreign-policy expertise would prevent him from winning the Florida primary. His opponent, George H.W. Bush, was one of the best-credentialed candidates ever. And yet, starting as an underdog among Florida's centrist voters, Reagan won by 27 percentage points, dealing Bush and the eastern Republican establishment a wound from which they never recovered.\n\nLooking back, what \"the boys (and women) on the bus (and campaign plane)\" didn't understand was that about half the electorate didn't care about Reagan's factual stumbles and knowledge gaps, which we recorded in colorful detail, because he had something that cancelled out such matters in middle America. He had authenticity. When The New York Times and the Washington Post ran detailed lists of Reagan's press-conference misstatements, we didn't grasp initially that many readers didn't care, for the simple reason that Reagan's errors were not news to them. They didn't support Reagan because of what he knew. They supported him of because of the kind of man he seemed to be.\n\nBeing seen as genuine may be the greatest single asset any candidate for elected office can possess, possibly even more important than money. In Trump, we have a political showman who possesses both money and an aura of candor that has so far indemnified him against a lot of press and partisan criticism. It is possible to push comparisons between Trump and Reagan too far, of course. Reagan had a stately presence. His flashes of temper -- as in his game-changing outburst, \"I paid for this microphone, Mr. Breen,\" in the 1981 New Hampshire primary -- seemed based in reality. But both Reagan and Trump successfully sold voters on the perception that they do not disguise their true selves. And the fact that both men were elected despite being actors -- in movies, television series and the Oval Office -- adds another level of complexity. Was their authenticity in itself an artifice?\n\nEither way, winning the election is only the beginning. And it remains to be seen whether Trump's stark Big Apple individuality will prove as durable as Reagan's cowboy affability. It's easy to forget that no modern American president had his IQ more brutally questioned than Reagan's was in his first two years in office. Clark Clifford, the mandarin Democrat and longtime presidential adviser, dined out all over Georgetown patronizing the new president as an \"amiable dunce,\" a lacerating phrase that made its way into the Wall Street Journal. In the end, of course, Clifford was disgraced by a bank-fraud indictment, and the triumphant \"dunce\" brought down the Soviet empire.\n\nReagan had a movie star's calculated instinct for staying in character. Trump lacks that appearance of self-control, but that does not mean that true believers won't stick with him or that the defectors in these early special elections can't be wooed back. Individualistic politicians can claim a wide strike zone or they wouldn't be successful. Indeed, in conversations with Trump's Alabama supporters across the socioeconomic spectrum, one hears a forgiving indulgence for his contempt for presidential tradition and criticism. As one wage-earning divorced woman told me, Trump sometimes makes her \"cringe,\" but she believes billionaires don't have to obey the rules. Where some might see a man out of control, she sees a mercurial independence to be envied by those on the daily treadmill.\n\nA big wild card is the Mueller investigation, with its steady drip of scandals like the Cambridge Analytica spying, which will play out in ways we can't predict. The other main unknown is whether we are near the point where a president who has bet the White House on his \"warts-and-all\" appeal will lose his safety net of support in the polls. That didn't really happen with Reagan until Iran Contra, when it became apparent that whatever one thought of the president's intellect, he was starting to lose his cognitive sharpness.\n\nWe saw measurable deterioration of Trump's clout in support in Pennsylvania's working class areas and a smaller, but decisive disenchantment is Alabama's bare-knuckled campaign arena. Commentators in both states seized on the authenticity of Congressman-elect Conor Lamb and Sen. Doug Jones as key assets. Playing to their native political cultures gave Democratic strategists a stronger hand to play than they have had in a long while.\n\nThe main show, of course, is on the Republican side. Judged by his Tweet archive, not even Trump gives House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell much credit for reliable convictions. Their press appearances have become excruciating, hair-splitting exercises in whether to follow Trumpian authenticity off a cliff. Who can blame them for preferring the safety of prepared statements?",

                "body": "BELLEFONTE, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania lawmaker has proposed a bill that would make severe hazing a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison -- and fraternity houses where the hazing happened subject to confiscation.\n\nFlanked by the family of Timothy Piazza, the 19-year-old who died after an alcohol-fueled fraternity pledge event at Penn State University last year, state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, a Republican, said at a press conference Friday that the new bill would create \"tiers\" of hazing offenses. That means hazing could be a third-degree misdemeanor if it resulted in bodily injury and a third-degree felony if it resulted in serious bodily injury or death.\n\n\"This is something that's been extremely important because under current law dealing with hazing, prosecutors can only charge M2s, misdemeanor twos, which may not reflect the severity of the crime,\" Corman said.\n\nOrganizations, such as fraternities and sororities, and institutions, such as colleges and universities, would also be subject to these tiers, and if they knowingly promoted hazing, they could be subject to property forfeiture, Corman added.\n\n\"This would now hold organizations that do not step up to be accountable for their actions,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nCorman's voice was choked with emotion as he praised Piazza's parents for their role in the bill.\n\n\"We're here today because of the courage of Jim and Evelyn Piazza,\" he said. \"As a parent, if it were me, I probably would have crawled into my bed, pulled up the covers, and stayed there. But because of their courage, we are here to make sure that this never happens again.\"\n\nCorman -- calling it the \"largest and most comprehensive rewrite of the hazing law\" in Pennsylvania and possibly the entire country -- said the bill is expected to be considered by the state Senate in April and is \"very confident\" it would pass.\n\nWhile some other states classify hazing as a felony, the Pennsylvania bill goes further by making it a third-degree felony and also subjecting the groups responsible to forfeiture. The bill also includes an amnesty provision, which would protect someone who places an emergency call to get help for the victim from criminal prosecution of hazing and underage drinking.\n\nIn court testimony, doctors have said they believe Piazza may have survived his injuries had an ambulance been called earlier.\n\nPiazza's father, Jim, said as the bill was introduced that he was hopeful it would deter future hazing incidents.\n\n\"No more college students should die for just wanting to join an organization. This law, if enacted, will change the landscape in Pennsylvania and hopefully will become the model for states to adopt throughout the country,\" he said.\n\nThe new legislation, called the Timothy J. Piazza Antihazing Law, was announced on the same day that a preliminary hearing started for Penn State fraternity brothers charged in Piazza's hazing death. The hearing is for 11 of the 26 men charged in connection with Piazza's death in February 2017 and is to determine whether there is enough evidence to send the cases to trial.\n\nThe case follows a previous preliminary hearing last summer that became heated at times as prosecutors and defense attorneys sniped at one another. The most serious charges -- aggravated assault -- were dropped against the fraternity members in September.\n\nPiazza, of Lebanon, New Jersey, died from injuries he suffered from falls, including one down a flight of stairs at the now-shuttered Beta Theta Pi house, during a pledge acceptance ceremony in which he became extremely intoxicated.\n\nRelated: Colleges are suspending Greek life. Don't expect the ban to last.\n\nProsecutors say a video, which was recovered by authorities after being deleted, showed that Piazza was given at least 18 drinks in less than an hour and a half during the pledge event.\n\nDuring this preliminary hearing -- expected to go through next week -- five of the defendants are still facing involuntary manslaughter charges, which carry a maximum punishment of 2-1/2 to five years in prison. Other charges include hazing, reckless endangerment, conspiracy and alcohol violations.\n\nThe ex-Beta members have denied all charges.\n\nCorman's anti-hazing legislation is backed by Penn State, which has also implemented measures to reform dangers within their Greek community since Piazza's death.",

A tariff on pork, in particular, would be felt strongly in parts of the red-state heartland, she said, while the potential for supply chain disruptions could be felt throughout the manufacturing sector.\n\n\"If we have a trade war, some companies are going to get hit pretty hard,\" said Brian Decker, a financial planner and founder of Decker Retirement Planning.

Simply put, the diet required him to eat normally five days a week and fast for two.\n\n\"In simple terms, it's eating as normally as you can for five days of the week and then on two days -- for two 24-hour periods -- you don't eat,\" Wentworth tells NBC News BETTER.\n\nThat doesn't mean you starve yourself for two days, Wentworth explains. It means that for two non-consecutive days of the week, you eat only one meal. On fasting days, for example, he skipped breakfast and lunch, and only ate dinner.\n\n\"It's a simple way to get basically a 20 percent reduction in total calories overall,\" says the engineer.\n\nHere's the breakdown of Wentworth's diet:\n\nWentworth says the diet worked because it allowed him to be flexible.\n\nFive days out of the week, Wentworth ate what would be considered a normal amount of calories to eat in a day. (How many calories a person needs to eat in a day varies between individuals and gender.) Like any diet, the 5:2 diet required him to be somewhat careful about what he ate, he says, since he had to ensure he was staying at a caloric deficit throughout the week.\n\nFor example, he would have a protein shake for breakfast, a chicken stir fry for lunch and a typical dinner with meat and vegetables, he says.\n\n\"Kind of the standard grain, protein and a veggie kind of setup,\" Wentworth explains.\n\nYou can eat some unhealthy foods, he added, but don't overdo it.",

                "body": "The Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Women's Health quietly removed a webpage dedicated to resources for lesbian and bisexual women.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services quietly removed lesbian and bisexual content from its women's health website last fall, according to a new report from the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit government watchdog group.\n\nThe findings, released on Wednesday, noted that the HHS-operated Office of Women's Health (OWH) \"removed a webpage with extensive information about lesbian and bisexual health, and links that correspond to that webpage.\" The removal, according to the report, happened between September and October 2017.\n\nThe removed \"Lesbian and bisexual health\" page, which had last been updated in 2012, contained answers to LGBTQ-specific health questions, including \"What factors put lesbians' and bisexual women's health at risk?\" and \"What challenges do lesbian and bisexual women face in the health care system?\" What was once the URL for this page now leads to a \"page not found\" error. A hyperlink that had previously led to the \"Lesbian and bisexual health\" page from the OWH's \"A-Z Health Topics\" page has also been removed.\n\nThe OWH website, womenshealth.gov, provides a wide variety of resources for women, from information on asthma to tips on healthy eating. Since May 2017, OWH has altered or removed several links and webpages from the website, which has been visited approximately 700,000 times over the past 30 days. The removal of other content will be the subject of subsequent reports, according to the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nIn a statement, an HHS spokesperson said the LGBTQ health content was removed in an effort to \"provide the most accurate health information\" on the site.\n\n\"As OWH updates its site, the outdated lesbian and bisexual health pages were removed and the health content was integrated into the relevant health topics pages across the website,\" the spokesperson said. \"This aligns with how people search for content. You can now find lesbian and bisexual health content by searching for relevant health topics on the womenshealth.gov website.\"\n\nThe chlamydia page, for example, includes \"Can women who have sex with women get chlamydia?\" among its contents.\n\nLGBTQ health advocates, however, are not entirely convinced the content's removal was benign.\n\nThe Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA), which was listed as a resource on the now-obscured \"Lesbian and bisexual health\" page, issued a statement strongly condemning HHS' removal of the content.\n\n\"The erasure of lesbian and bisexual health content from WomensHealth.gov is tantamount to discrimination against a vulnerable population that already suffers significant health disparities and discrimination in healthcare,\" GLMA President Dr. Gal Mayer stated, adding that the removal is \"yet another step HHS has taken to dismantle LGBTQ health initiatives over the past year under the Trump administration.\"\n\nGLMA is also calling on health professionals across the U.S. to take action against a recent HHS proposal, titled \"Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care,\" that would allow health care providers to \"refuse to perform, accommodate or assist with certain health care services on religious or moral grounds.\" This proposal would, according to GLMA, be a license to discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\nToly Rinberg, a co-author of the Sunlight Foundation report and director of the organization's Web Integrity Project, told NBC News that HHS' decision to take down the \"Lesbian and bisexual health\" webpage could generate confusion among visitors of the site, and the department should offer clearer communication to the public.\n\n\"What we're seeing is that federal offices and agencies are not proactively disclosing why they're changing websites,\" Rinberg said. \"The government should be minimizing confusion, especially at a time when there's such uncertainty in shifting priorities.\"\n\nRinberg said the Sunlight Foundation monitors thousands of web pages across HHS with software that flags changes in the pages' contents. If a change is significant enough, Rinberg said it is reported on. Sunlight Foundation uses the Way Back Machine, an internet archive tool, to verify the changes.\n\n\"Was the fact sheet removed because it was out of date?\" Rinberg asked, referring to a resource that had been on the \"Lesbian and bisexual health\" page. \"Was it removed due to maintenance? Was it the result of an untransparent policy decision? The public can't differentiate those without clear communication and advanced notice, which in this case was not provided.\"\n\nLGBTQ health experts also emphasized the need for transparency from government organizations providing resources to at-risk populations.\n\n\"There are a lot of misconceptions about health related to sexual and gender minority people,\" said Dr. Alex Keuroghlian, director of the National LGBT Health Education Center and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\"There's a lack of training of clinicians in this area, and both patients and clinicians are desperate for resources to be able to ensure that lesbian and bisexual women receive [adequate] care,\" Keuroghlian said. \"I'm of the opinion the more readily available and visible we make these resources, the better our public health strategy is for sexual minority women.\"\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation report raised concerns regarding \"other indications\" that HHS has \"deemphasized access to LGBTQ health\" under the Trump administration.\n\nFor example, the official OWS Twitter account, @womenshealth, has not mentioned LGBTQ health issues since a November 2016 post under the Obama administration.\n\nThe report also noted an HHS Draft Strategic Plan released in October 2017 made \"no mention of LGBTQ health,\" and that same month an HHS department withdrew a 2014 proposed rule that would have ensured Medicare- and Medicaid-participating health facilities treat same-sex married couples equally.\n\nIn another move that some advocates took to be indicative of a deemphasis of LGBTQ health, the White House did not mention gay and bisexual men or transgender women -- groups disproportionately impacted by HIV -- in President Trump's World AIDS Day proclamation.\n\nHHS is not the only government department that has scrubbed LGBTQ-related content from its website.\n\nMost notably, perhaps, was the removal of the White House's LGBT page, which had formerly been found at whitehouse.gov/lgbt. Under the Obama administration, the page stated the administration's commitment to the LGBTQ community and provided resources on bullying, AIDS and the now-defunct \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Now, however, it leads to a \"page not found\" error.\n\n\"We have the tools to monitor our federal government in this way,\" Rinberg said of tracking changes to federal websites. \"But at the same time, we shouldn't have to.\"",

                "body": "Half a million protesters expected at 'March for Our Lives' rally in DC\n\nA spokesman declined to comment on Biden's outreach to the Parkland families, which were described by three individuals who have helped arrange them. Biden, they said, made it known in the days after the Parkland shooting that he wanted to be a resource for the families, to offer both his personal condolences and words of advice about the difficult road ahead, should they want to seek it.\n\n\"The vice president, unfortunately, has direct, personal knowledge of what it's like to grieve for the loss of a child. And the conversations that he's had with the families have been very personal -- about not just this moment, but the coming weeks and months, and the challenges of moving forward,\" said Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who represents Parkland and has helped connect Biden with victims' relatives.\n\nMany of the conversations Biden has had have taken place over the phone. But as part of a previously-scheduled trip to Florida this week, Biden was told two victims' fathers were going to attend the Beau Biden Foundation fundraiser as guests of another attendee.\n\nGuttenberg had spoken with Biden by phone within a week of his daughter's death, and taken similar calls from other elected officials including Deutch, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Gov. Rick Scott. He also met personally for an hour with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom he has been critical of at times for his pro-gun stance.\n\nBut the conversations with Biden were different, Guttenberg said.\n\n\"He talked to me about both instances of tragedy in his life. He talked a lot about how finding mission and purpose after each of those helped him, day by day, put distance between what happened and finding a new place. It doesn't remove the pain, but it moves it further away,\" he said.\n\nBiden had just been elected to the Senate in 1972 when his first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident just before Christmas, one in which his two young sons were also severely injured. Beau, the eldest of his sons, lost his battle with brain cancer in 2015 while Biden was serving as vice president, and was still considering a bid for the presidency.\n\nPerseverance in the face of personal tragedy became a defining characteristic of Biden's four decades in public office -- a burden that he has said came with obligation.\n\n\"I believed it was my public duty to demonstrate to those millions of people facing the same awful reality that it was possible to absorb real loss and make it through,\" Biden wrote in a 2017 book detailing his son's final years.\n\nAs vice president, Biden often joined President Barack Obama in consoling victims of mass shootings. The two spent hours with victims of the Pulse Nightclub massacre in 2016, as well as the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012. Biden often insisted to relatives that they follow up with him.\n\n\"I have a long list of strangers who have my private number, and an invitation to call, and many of them do,\" he wrote in \"Promise Me, Dad.\"\n\nDuring his two conversations with Biden, Guttenberg said he offered support for his new mission advocating new gun safety laws, and advice about how to go about it.\n\nBiden has also offered to be a resource to the student activists who have led a new national movement to promote new restrictions on gun ownership. As thousands are expected participate in national \"March For Our Lives\" events this weekend, Biden will meet privately some of the movement leaders in Washington Friday, and perhaps participate himself in the National Mall gathering Saturday.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was lead author of a 1994 crime bill that included an assault weapons ban. After the Newtown massacre, Obama asked Biden to lead a task force that made recommendations about other gun policies that could be enacted either legislatively or through executive action.\n\nBut allies say Biden recognizes that the strength of the movement is not in the high-profile names who seek to attach themselves to it.\n\n\"I know the advice that the vice president will give them, which is just to keep going,\" said Deutch, who represents Parkland. \"They've got an enormous amount of passion, and I think he offers them the example of someone who has taken that passion for change and made it the central purpose of his life. He's done it. They can do it. And I fully expect that they will.\"",

                "title": "The biggest spending bill loser: President Trump",
                "body": "Trump threatens to veto spending bill hours ahead of shutdown\n\nTrump finds himself in a lose-lose political box: accept a bill palatable to most Democrats and Republicans but not his base -- or reject it, and risk more serious political damage by taking an extreme position at a time when his party is facing a tough electoral battlefield for control of the House.\n\nThat is, things turned out badly for him. By vetoing a bill that has such broad, bipartisan support, he could make them even worse.\n\nTrump left GOP leaders no choice but to write legislation that would attract Democratic votes while irritating the president and alienating GOP hard-liners -- a model that is likely to stick if Trump can't either unify the Republican Party on legislative items or find ways to lure moderate Democrats away from their own leaders.\n\n\"President Trump has done little or nothing to consistently build relationships across party lines -- or the tools necessary to pressure Democrats, even in red states,\" said Michael Steel, a former House Republican leadership aide. \"Plus, he hasn't been willing or able to get votes from recalcitrant conservative Republicans to pass bills on a party line vote, and avoid going to Democrats for their support. As a result, bipartisan support is necessary for a 'must-pass' bill, and the president doesn't always get his way.\"\n\nTrump was ambivalent enough about the outcome earlier this week that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had to remind him of what he'd gained in military spending -- and why he'd had to give ground on other policies -- before he seemed to endorse the bill publicly.\n\n\"They had a good conversation about the wins delivered for the president, and [Trump] is supportive of the bill,\" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Wednesday when it was reported that her boss had an unannounced meeting with the president. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a similar statement. And, hours later, Trump declared his position on Twitter.\n\nAs Trump pointed out, the bill contains a relatively small bump in funding for border security. But Democrats wouldn't sign off on substantial money for an actual wall after they couldn't come to an agreement with the White House over a permanent halt to the deportation of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children.\n\n\"It is troubling when we get a tunnel and we don't get a wall,\" North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said when details of the bill were first made public.\n\nAnd even as Vice President Mike Pence touted the bill as a victory for Trumpism during a stop in Manchester, N.H., Thursday, he noted that it was \"hardly perfect\" and that it would allow a president who vowed to make Mexico pay for a border barrier to \"start\" to build the wall.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who negotiated the final details of the measure with Ryan, McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she's perfectly fine with Trump claiming victory on the wall.\n\n\"If you want to think you're getting a wall, you just think it and sign the bill,\" she said before voting for it.\n\nIf the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill had their druthers, Pelosi's backing wouldn't be necessary to keep the government running. After all, they've shaped their midterm campaign strategy around telling voters she's too extreme for the country.\n\nBut Republicans are divided enough that GOP leaders needed Democrats to govern, which gave the opposition enough leverage to block many of Trump's top policy goals. And that, in turn, clearly infuriated Trump.\n\nKenneth Baer, a former associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama, cast the whole situation as a major political failure for the GOP.\n\n\"In a world in which one party controls both houses of Congress and the presidency, you'd expect that the president would get a vast majority of his budget priorities,\" Baer said. \"The fact that he did not is a sign of how out of step Trump is from congressional Republicans, how incompetent his White House is -- or both.\"",

                "title": "Trump favors confrontation and TV chops as he shuffles his team yet again",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's latest White House moves -- H.R. McMaster out as national security adviser, John Bolton in; personal lawyer John Dowd out, Joseph diGenova in -- share at least three things in common.\n\nOne, Trump is hiring people who prefer confrontation. Bolton, for instance, has authored op-eds calling for taking pre-emptive action against North Korea (\"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First\"), for ripping up the Iran nuclear deal (\"No fix will remedy the diplomatic Waterloo Mr. Obama negotiated\") and for bombing Iran (\"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran\"). DiGenova, meanwhile, has floated the conspiracy theory that a secret group of FBI agents created the Russia investigation as a way to keep Trump from becoming president.\n\nTwo, he's picking people who have A LOT of experience appearing on cable TV, especially Fox News. You can also throw in new top economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who's been a mainstay on CNBC.\n\nWhen one of us, back in 2015, asked then-candidate Trump where he got his military advice, he replied, \"Well, I watch the shows... I like [John] Bolton. I think he's a tough cookie; he knows what he is talking about.\"\n\nAnd three -- beyond their affinity for confrontation and cable TV green rooms -- Bolton and diGenova are going to give Trump the advice he WANTS. Indeed, McMaster's sin appears to have been giving the president advice he DIDN'T WANT. \"They had differed on policy ... with General McMaster cautioning against ripping up the nuclear deal with Iran without a strategy for what would come next, and tangling with Mr. Trump over the strategy for American forces in Afghanistan,\" the New York Times writes.\n\nSo meet the new team -- preferences for confrontation, for familiar faces on cable TV and for giving the president the advice he wants, not necessarily the advice he needs.\n\nThere's also been a common theme among the recent and not-so-recent White House departures: Trump has humiliated these people out the door. He announced dumping McMaster via a tweet; he fired former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by Twitter, too; and months ago, he got rid of former chief of staff Reince Priebus on the tarmac.\n\nSpeaking of confrontation, just think of all of the ways that Trump is jolting Washington and world capitals. He's slapping tariffs on China (and China is planning to retaliating back); he's fixing to scrap the Iran nuclear deal; and he's even rattling Republicans on Capitol Hill about his talk regarding special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn his 2016 convention speech, Trump announced, \"I alone can fix it.\" Well, in 2018, you can update that to: \"I alone can rattle it.\"\n\nHere are more poll results from our latest NBC/WSJ survey: \"58 percent agree with the statement that gun ownership does more to increase safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves. By contrast, 38 percent say that gun ownership reduces safety by giving too many people access to firearms, increasing the chances for accidental misuse,\" one of us writes.\n\n\"These findings represent a reversal from 1999, when a majority -- 52 percent -- said gun ownership reduces safety. And they come at a time when 47 percent of American adults say they have a firearm in the household, which is up from 44 percent in 1999.\"\n\n\"Still, gun-control organizations are one of the most popular organizations or movements that the NBC/WSJ poll measured. Forty-eight percent of Americans say they support gun-control organizations, including 34 percent who strongly support them. That's compared with 32 percent who oppose gun-control organizations.\"\n\nEven more numbers from our poll: \"A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that a majority -- 52 percent -- of Americans say that men do not accept and treat women as equals in the workplace, virtually unchanged since the poll asked the same question in 1999,\" another one of us writes. \"Women are particularly pessimistic, with 61 percent saying that their male counterparts fail to treat them as equals, exactly the same share as 19 years ago. \"And in June 2000 and now, exactly the same share of women -- 44 percent -- say they have personally experienced discrimination because of their gender.\"\n\n\"The stagnancy in how women view their treatment in the workplace comes as more of them have taken on a role as their household's primary wage earner. Nearly half of employed women -- 49 percent -- say that they work primarily because they are their family's main breadwinner, up from 37 percent in 2000. That includes 42 percent of working women with children.\"\n\nAnd here are still more numbers from the NBC/WSJ poll that were released on the same day that Trump slapped tariffs against China: Two-thirds of Americans - 66 percent - view foreign trade more as an opportunity for economic growth, versus just 20 percent who view it more as a threat to the economy. That 66 percent represents an all-time for a question that Gallup has been asking since 1992.\n\nBy the way, China has retaliated against Trump's tariffs, the Wall Street Journal says. \"Measures the Chinese Commerce Ministry rolled out Friday target $3 billion in U.S. goods, from fruit and pork to recycled aluminum and steel pipes that would be subject to higher tariffs. The ministry said the penalties are being imposed in response to new U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products, which the Trump administration announced earlier and which took effect Friday.\"",

                "title": "Bad nutrition advice dietitians are begging you to forget",
                "body": "FACT: Juicing to lose weight is a terrible idea. \"This is not a good road to lasting weight loss,\" explains Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, owner of Amy Gorin Nutrition in the New York City area.\n\nThere are so many reasons Gorin advises against juicing. \"For one, drinking only juice would leave you short of the calories your body needs to optimally function. You'd also be getting mostly carbohydrates and would be lacking the protein and healthy fats your body needs daily. Protein and healthy fats help to keep you full, so you'd also likely be very hungry on this diet!\"\n\nThough the advice may not be as sexy as juicing, if you really want to lose weight, Gorin recommends filling up on healthful foods instead. \"Eat a balanced diet of fruit and vegetables (some of my favorite in-season ones are asparagus and mango), lean protein such as tofu or salmon, whole grains (oatmeal or quinoa are great picks), and healthy fats such as avocado and olive oil.\" She also suggests cutting calories by limiting the foods that don't need to be in your diet, such as alcohol.\n\nFACT: Believe it or not, this isn't great for your body or your wallet. \"It's true that the perimeter of the store holds colorful produce (fruits and veggies that don't even require labels), meat and poultry, and the dairy, but if you ignore the center aisles, you'll be missing out on valuable foods that are kind to your body and your budget,\" advises Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN, author of \"Read it Before You Eat It - Taking You from Label to Table.\"\n\nWhen you steer towards the center, you'll discover plant foods like beans, whole grains and nuts. \"These foods are delicious, healthy, affordable, versatile, and easy to store,\" she says. Still, you can't ignore the fine print known as the ingredient list and Nutrition Facts Panel. \"Flip packages over to read what you're really getting,\" says Taub-Dix.\n\nFACT: This myth persists for dieters trying to cut fat and calories, but according to Angie Asche, MS, RD of Eleat Sports Nutrition, skipping the yolks is a big nutrition miss. \"Egg yolks are rich in vitamins A and D, fatty acids, and antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, to name a few,\" she explains. Asche encourages eating the whole egg for the most nutrition.\n\nFACT: Certainly, dietitians are proponents of proper hydration, both for working out and everyday life. It's the standard advice that they take exception to. \"Everyone varies in their age, size, gender, activity level and health status, so there isn't one fluid recommendation to suit everyone's needs,\" explains Rizzo, who instead, offers the following tip for determining your fluid status. Check your urine output and color. \"If there is a sizable amount and it's pale yellow in color, you're properly hydrated. If you only put out a small amount of dark-colored urine (like apple cider vinegar), you're dehydrated,\" she explains. The goal: drink enough fluid until your urine is consistently pale yellow. That's when you know you've met your individual fluid needs.\n\nFACT: \"The term superfood is a buzzword that has no meaning in the scientific or medical community,\" according to Mitchell Zandes, registered dietitian and nutrition blogger. How does a food get to superfood status if there is no acceptable definition? Though Zandes appreciates that superfoods are generally healthy, thereby steering people towards nutritious fare, there's no need to make a distinction between one healthful food and another. Just because a banana may not show up on a superfoods list doesn't mean you should avoid bananas at all cost. Recognize that headlines are meant to grab your attention but the reality is that even if it doesn't make it on a top 10 list, plant foods (those fruits and veggies, nuts and seeds, beans and whole grains that dietitians routinely recommend) will bring goodness to your plate and your body.\n\nFACT: \"While it's important to avoid gluten if you have a medical condition, like celiac disease, being gluten-free doesn't automatically make a product better for you,\" according to Patricia Bannan, MS, RDN, author of \"Eat Right When Time is Tight.\" \"Gluten-free products can vary greatly in the amount of sugar, fat, and other nutrients they contain,\" she explains.\n\nWhen manufacturers remove gluten, they often make up for the difference in flavor and texture by adding more sugar, salt and refined starches, like potato and tapioca starch. To avoid getting duped by gluten free foods, check the ingredient list and Nutrition Facts label to ensure your gluten free pick is also a healthy choice.\n\nFACT: \"A big misconception my clients have is thinking that completely eliminating bread, potatoes, pasta and rice will help with achieving a healthier weight, improving brain function, and a number of other things that don't have strong scientific backing,\" says plant-based dietitian Catherine Perez, MS, RD, LDN. \"Carbs, in the form of whole grain or whole starch sources, are packed with B vitamins, folate and fiber,\" she says, adding that fiber helps fill you up and feel more satisfied with meals. Both of these factors can help you achieve weight loss. Eating these foods can also keep your digestive system humming and prevent constipation -- an issue that can plague carb-avoiders.\n\nFACT: Just in case you weren't convinced that carbs can be okay, nutritionist Keri Gans, MS, RDN, author of The Small Change Diet, offers this reminder: \"No one food can make you gain weight.\" Take note: It's all about the portion and preparation. \"A huge bowl of fettuccine alfredo is definitely going to be high in calories. Prepared differently, you'll get a healthy meal. One of my favorites is a one-cup serving of pasta sautéed in olive oil with lots of veggies (spinach, broccoli and artichokes, being some of my go-tos), with grilled shrimp.\" You don't need to live without pasta, but find some other ways to love it as Gans recommends.",

McDougal repeatedly described Trump as \"very charming\" and \"sweet.\"\n\nMcDougal said she continued the relationship with Trump for about 10 months and broke it off in April 2007 because she felt guilty. She recalled traveling to meet Trump at his properties in New York and New Jersey and said she had sex with him \"many dozens of times.\"\n\nMcDougal said they also spent time at a resort at Lake Tahoe in California, where adult film actress Stormy Daniels has said she met Trump.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said in a lawsuit filed earlier this month that she had an \"intimate\" relationship with Trump in 2006 and 2007, and she is now locked in a legal battle over whether she can publicly discuss it.\n\nDaniels signed a nondisclosure agreement shortly before the 2016 election in exchange for a $130,000 payment facilitated by Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nFor her part McDougal said she never wanted to discuss her relationship and repeatedly rebuffed inquiries from reporters about the alleged affair. But after the story became public, she wanted to get out and tell her side of what happened, she said.\n\nThe White House has said Trump denies having an affair with McDougal and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the interview Thursday night.\n\nOn Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which she said paid her $150,000 during the presidential campaign for the rights to her story of an affair, but never ran the story.\n\nMcDougal's lawsuit, which asks a judge to invalidate the contract, alleges that Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, was secretly involved in her discussions with the tabloid's parent company, American Media, Inc.\n\nThe company has said that McDougal has been allowed to speak about her relationship since 2016 and the contract gave them discretion over whether to publish the story.\n\nMcDougal said she had feelings for Trump, but the affair was \"just tearing me apart.\"\n\n\"There was a real relationship there. There were real feelings,\" she said. \"He would call me baby or he would call me beautiful Karen.\"\n\nAsked if Trump ever said he loved her, McDougal said, \"All the time. He always told me he loved me.\"\n\nWhen asked if she thought this would lead to a marriage, McDougal said, \"Maybe.\"\n\nTrump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005, and their son, Barron, was born in 2006.\n\nSpeaking to CNN -- in what her attorney has said would be her only interview about the relationship -- McDougal apologized when she was asked what she would say to Melania Trump.\n\n\"What can you say except, I'm sorry?\" McDougal said. \"I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me.\"",

                "body": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- It's an unlikely location for a political uprising: A onetime drug rehab center in an office park, where metal bars still line the windows and the hum from the nearby I-20/I-59 overpass is constant.\n\nBut it is here that Jameria Moore, a 49-year-old attorney, launched her campaign for a judgeship on the Jefferson County Probate Court. She is one of about three dozen African-American women who are running for office as Democrats across deep-red Alabama.\n\nIt's an unprecedented number, according to party officials. Many, like Moore, are running for the first time. And many, like Moore, say Democrat Doug Jones' unexpected Senate victory in December inspired them to take a chance.\n\nBut there's more to this wave of black women candidates than that.\n\n\"It's so important that we step up, that we show the nation that we can lead,\" Moore told NBC News in a recent interview, as a small team of volunteers bustled about her law office and prepared for the campaign ahead. \"That, here in Alabama, we're ready to lead our state into the future.\"\n\nHer campaign is mounting a robust effort in a local race with a crowded Democratic primary field -- all in an intensely conservative state with a history of racial division.\n\n\"I have friends in other states who say, 'I don't know how you live in Alabama,' and I tell them, 'Why wouldn't I live in Alabama?'\" she said. \"This is an opportunity, that's how I look at it.\"\n\nIn the heady months after Jones' win -- an upset fueled in part by exceptionally high turnout by African-American women -- a new energy has fueled Jefferson County Democrats.\n\nNinety-eight percent of black women voted for Jones, according to an NBC News exit poll -- a decisive factor in the former federal prosecutor becoming the first Democrat in 25 years to be elected to the Senate from Alabama. Now, just three months later, an unprecedented number of African-American women are taking the next step in building on that momentum by running for local and statewide office.\n\nMore than 35 black women have launched campaigns or re-election efforts, and more than three-quarters of them are running here in Birmingham, in state and county judicial races, or for seats in the state legislature. Organizers and local officials say it's evidence of a small but significant Democratic burst of political activism that could put a blue-hued dent in a deep-Trump state.\n\n\"Alabama is not a state that is known for electing women to office, so, in some sense, this is surprising, historic and much needed,\" said Richard Fording, a professor of public policy at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe effort has been partly driven by national groups, which hit the ground during Jones' campaign and, after his win, stuck around, sensing further progress could be made.\n\n\"This place that was so resistant to change, where, now, a group of women who were looked down upon and dealt first-hand with the vestiges of slavery and segregation are the ones who can lead us forward -- it's monumental,\" said Quentin James, founder and director of the Collective PAC, a two-year-old group focusing on recruiting African-American candidates in statewide and local races across the U.S.\n\n\"Where better to demonstrate the progress being made than in Alabama,\" he added.\n\nThe new wave of candidates, as well as the voters who have empowered them, say their efforts and progress are driven not only by the encouragement they felt after Jones' win, but the wide-ranging impact of the #MeToo movement, Barack Obama's presidency and Trump's divisiveness and perceived animosity toward minorities.\n\nA half-dozen African-American women now running for office said in recent interviews that the gains made in local races in 2016 -- when nine African-American women were elected as judges in Jefferson County -- helped light the fuse.\n\nAs anti-Trump fervor rose, so, too, did the desire of black women to enter politics. And by fall 2017, as the #MeToo movement swept the country in October, and Jones won in December, it erupted into a full-blown fire.\n\nRep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., a four-term congresswoman running for re-election this fall who was cited as a trailblazer by many of the black women now running for office, said it's vital that women of all races be a part of the policy-making process \"as the nation grapples with the realities of sexual harassment and assault.\"\n\nRichard Mauk, chairman of the Jefferson County Democratic Party, said he first felt inklings of change in the majority-Democratic county about 10 years ago when Obama came to power.\n\n\"It showed that black people can be elected,\" he said. \"While it took a few years to trickle down, he, along with Michelle Obama, gave a lot of black women the idea that, yes, this is possible.\"\n\nMauk said the party does't have reliable records of candidate demographics, but said he'd never seen anything like this year's large number of black women running.\n\nJones, for his part, pointed out that African-American women have long been part of the political process in Alabama, even though they are significantly underrepresented in the state legislature.\n\n\"The difference now is simply the fact that you have more voices rising up,\" said Jones, who added that he recognized his own election as something that empowered this new wave of African-American women to seek office.\n\nMeanwhile, James, of Collective PAC, singled out Trump as the main motivator.\n\n\"You have a president who attacks black women,\" James said, pointing to recent criticism out of the White House of two Democratic congresswomen, Maxine Waters of California and Frederica Wilson of Florida. \"They're fed up, we're fed up, and ... it's crucial we have more voices on the public stage to fight back.\"\n\nCheri Gardner, a Democratic candidate for Jefferson County circuit clerk, says she felt \"electrified\" when Jones won. And while she entered her race before Jones' victory -- as Jameria Moore did -- she feels more motivated by the fact that Roy Moore, the Republican who lost to Jones and was accused of improper conduct with teenage girls, got as far as he did.\n\n\"I don't know if it was Doug Jones as much it was Roy Moore himself lighting the fire under African Americans and African-American women,\" she said in an interview at her sprawling two-story house in the city's Woodland Park neighborhood.\n\nGardner agreed that Trump, too, has been a major factor in the recent political mobilization of African-American women. \"We are the rare group that feels his insults two times over,\" she said.\n\nGardner, Moore and other candidates noted that their activism and political participation are nothing new. \"We didn't just become part of the political process,\" Moore said. \"We've always played a part in the process even before we had the right to vote.\"\n\nFor Audri Scott Williams, 62, a former Army reservist and activist, running for Congress in Alabama's 2nd District, which includes most of Montgomery, is realizing a lifelong dream. She cited \"a new sense of empowerment\" as motivating her to enter the Democratic primary for the right to challenge the four-term GOP incumbent, Rep. Martha Roby.\n\n\"The tinder was laid down, but Doug Jones was the spark that started a fire in black women knowing they have a lot of power,\" Williams said.\n\nPamela Wilson Cousins, a candidate for a judgeship on the Jefferson County District Court, also pointed to the Jones-stoked momentum as the reason behind her run. \"If I ever thought there was a time for me to run, this was it,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans dismiss the gender and race of the Democratic candidates, saying the GOP is focused on issues.\n\n\"We are excited to showcase our winning policies as opposed to the failed ones of the liberal Democrats regardless of who is on their ballot,\" Alabama GOP chair Terry Lathan said.\n\nThe raft of black women running, however, didn't happen on its own.\n\nProgressive groups and political strategists that had flocked to the area for the Jones race quickly realized how much untapped energy existed among Democrats who were women, African-American or both.\n\nSeveral organizations remained in the state after Jones' win to build out their infrastructure, with some expanding existing operations in other states into Alabama. They concluded that there was a genuine appetite for a fresh crop of diverse Democratic candidates and for a Democratic Party in the state broadly different from the one that had been stained for generations by Dixiecrats.\n\nOne group, Emerge Alabama, arrived in mid-2017 with the sole focus of recruiting female candidates in local races to beef up the party's long-term presence in the state.\n\n\"The idea was to address the very low representation of women in leadership, here and across the U.S., from top to bottom,\" explained Stacie Propst, the executive director of Emerge Alabama.\n\nHer group, which is active in 22 other states, recruits female candidates to run for local office and offers a 70-hour training curriculum for new candidates, including tutorials on fundraising, cultural diversity training, messaging and how to get on the ballot.\n\nAlabama's first class -- 26 women, including 16 who are now running (including Jameria Moore) -- \"graduated\" this month, said Propst, 51, a Tuscaloosa native who spent decades of her career in Washington before returning to Alabama. She said she also had never seen so many African-American women running for office in Alabama than she has this year.\n\nAnother group, Woke Vote, an Alabama-based grass-roots campaign that focused on turning out young, black voters for Jones, doubled down on its efforts after December.\n\n\"What we're doing isn't revolutionary in a lot of places, but is revolutionary for Democrats in Alabama,\" said Dejuana Thompson, the group's founder. \"We find the faith community, the students, the young people, we have a frank conversation with them about what's at stake and we ask them to turn around and do it themselves.\"\n\nThompson, a native of Birmingham who worked in Obama's Small Business Administration, said she's seen the group's efforts bear fruit now that so many women of color are on local ballots.",

Hiller, a New York-based attorney who sued Sessions unsuccessfully in a challenge of marijuana's federal outlaw status. \"If the state-legal cannabis industry were to be destroyed, millions of Americans who depend on medical cannabis to live would be unable to treat with their medication.\"\n\nCiting a bill signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 that allowed capital punishment in \"non-homicidal narcotics offenses,\" Sessions said in a letter to his troops Monday that \"I strongly encourage federal prosecutors to use these statutes, when appropriate, to aid in our continuing fight against drug trafficking and the destruction it causes in our nation.\"\n\nThe memo came after the president, speaking in New Hampshire Monday, said drug dealers and south-of-the-border narcotics imports were responsible for an opioid epidemic many experts blame on prescription drug abuse. \"If we don't get tough on the drug dealers, we're wasting our time,\" Trump told a crowd of supporters. \"That toughness includes the death penalty.\"\n\nWhile the president himself has expressed support for medical marijuana in the past, Sessions has offered no ambiguity on the drug.\n\nThe man who said in 2016 that \"good people don't smoke marijuana\" in January declared that his prosecutors were free to prosecute cannabis suspects in states that have legalized the drug. At the time he promised them \"all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.\"\n\nEven if the Trump administration's threat is hollow for state-legal cannabis concerns, people in the business -- recreational pot is now legal in nine states -- could be \"frightened away from operating their businesses,\" Hiller, the lawyer, said.\n\n\"Mr. Sessions, while often the butt of jokes on television shows like 'Saturday Night Live,' holds a very powerful position in Washington, D.C., and, by virtue of that position, is capable of causing real societal damage,\" he added.\n\nAdam Eidinger, co-founder of the organization, DCMJ, which pushed to legalize recreational marijuana possession in Washington, D.C., called Sessions' memo part of the Trump administration's \"draconian 'drug warrior' policies\" that \"don't work.\"\n\nLos Angeles dispensary owner Virgil Grant served time in federal prison after his shop was raided in 2008, before the administration of President Obama ordered prosecutors to back off on enforcement in states where pot had been legalized. He said some legit cannabis businesses in the state could make those weight and revenue thresholds described in Sessions memo, should prosecutors choose to target cannabis operators.\n\n\"This is taking us back to the Reagan era -- right back to the war on drugs,\" he said.\n\nBonita \"Bo\" Money, founder of the National Diversity and Inclusion Cannabis Alliance (NDICA), is concerned that the administration's stance is putting people of color who have been disproportionately prosecuted for drug crimes back in law enforcement's cross hairs. \"The real drug dealers are Big Pharma,\" she said. \"Now they want to target people of color in the cannabis industry.\"\n\nFormer narcotics kingpin and ex-con \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross, who's a board member of NDICA, said that, because he moved so much cocaine in 1980s, he would have been eligible for Death Row under the current administration. He sees Sessions' move as a step back when it comes to equal justice for African-Americans. \"I think blacks have paid the biggest price when it comes to going to prison for marijuana,\" he said.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Nearly six-in-10 Americans say that gun ownership increases safety, even as a plurality of respondents support gun-control organizations, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nThese numbers come in advance of Saturday's march in Washington D.C. -- and across the country -- calling for an end to gun violence and mass shootings after the February 14 shootings in Parkland, Fla.\n\nIn the poll, 58 percent agree with the statement that gun ownership does more to increase safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.\n\nBy contrast, 38 percent say that gun ownership reduces safety by giving too many people access to firearms, increasing the chances for accidental misuse.\n\nRelated: Poll: Democrats hold double-digit lead for 2018 midterm elections\n\nThese findings represent a reversal from 1999, when a majority -- 52 percent -- said gun ownership reduces safety. And they come at a time when 47 percent of American adults say they have a firearm in the household, which is up from 44 percent in 1999.\n\nThe numbers also highlight a stark divide by party, with 89 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of independents saying gun ownership increases safety, versus just 28 percent of Democrats who agree.\n\nStill, gun-control organizations are one of the most popular organizations or movements that the NBC/WSJ poll measured.\n\nForty-eight percent of Americans say they support gun-control organizations, including 34 percent who strongly support them. That's compared with 32 percent who oppose gun-control organizations.\n\nAs a plurality of Americans say they back gun-control organizations, the latest NBC/WSJ poll finds the National Rifle Association with its worst net positive-negative score since the 1990s.\n\nThirty-seven percent of respondents view the NRA positively, while 40 percent see it in a negative light. That's a noticeable shift from April 2017, when it was 45 percent positive, 33 percent negative.\n\nThe biggest drops for the NRA come from white married women (50 percent positive in April 2017, 35 percent now), urban residents (43 percent positive in April, 28 percent now), white women (47 percent positive in April, 33 percent now) and moderate/soft Republicans (72 percent positive in April, 60 percent now).",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nHe may be one of the architects of the war in Iraq -- a conflict President Donald Trump spent most of his campaign decrying -- but his sentiments on Iran and other critical foreign policy issues echo many of the beliefs of the current president, who on Thursday named Bolton as his new national security adviser. Bolton will be the third man to hold the job under Trump, replacing H.R. McMaster, an active duty three-star general who filled the role following the abrupt and controversial exit of retired Gen. Michael Flynn last year.\n\nIn Bolton, Trump selects yet another controversial figure for a senior adviser -- a lightning rod even within in his own party. The position does not require Senate confirmation, a sore spot for Bolton who resigned from his unconfirmed recess appointment at the United Nations in 2006 after it became clear he could not win Senate confirmation -- even from a chamber controlled by his own party.\n\nWith the help of Trump's newly-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Bolton will work to recast Trump's foreign policy, absent some of the more moderate figures who had thus-far counseled Trump, a foreign policy novice, through his first year in office.\n\n\"He's very, very smart and very aggressive,\" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News. \"A national security team made up of him and Pompeo is sure to be aggressive and get things done.\"\n\nBolton earned his reputation as a hardliner dating back to the days of the 2003 U.S.-led Iraq war, which began 15 years ago this week. In a 2007 speech to the American Conservative Union Political Action Conference, he said that the quantity of weapons of mass destruction possessed by deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein \"was never the issue.\" (No weapons of mass destruction were found following the invasion.)\n\n\"What President Bush did in overthrowing Saddam Hussein was to defend the critical national security interests of the United States,\" he said then. \"The real issue was the threat was Saddam Hussein himself and the decision to eliminate that threat to our security and the peace and security of our friends and allies was the right decision.\"",

A school resource officer got there within a minute and fired a shot at Rollins, but it's not yet clear whether Rollins was killed by the officer's bullet or took his own life.\n\nThe St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday Rollins and the girl had been in a relationship that recently ended.\n\n\"All indications suggest the shooting was not a random act of violence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nWilley had been in critical condition at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center. A fundraising page to help her family has raised more than $67,000.\n\nA 14-year-old boy who was shot in the thigh during the encounter was released Wednesday from a hospital.\n\nAttempts to reach Rollins' family have been unsuccessful.\n\nSt. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron credited Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill with preventing any more loss of life.\n\nCameron said Gaskill, a six-year veteran with SWAT team training, responded within a minute and fired his weapon simultaneously with a final shot fired by Rollins. The officer was unharmed.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said the Glock handgun used in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins father. In Maryland it is illegal for anyone under age 21 to possess a handgun unless it is required for their employment.",

                "title": "The Mueller effect: Foreign lobbyists wary of indictment rush to register",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The data firm whose work for Donald Trump's campaign attracted the interest of Robert Mueller's investigators recently filed paperwork showing it had helped spread negative information about Qatar, the Gulf nation targeted by the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates in a bitter propaganda battle.\n\nThe parent company of Cambridge Analytica filed documents with the U.S. Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Unit disclosing $333,000 in payments by the UAE for a 2017 social media campaign linking the Qataris to terrorism. In June the Trump administration endorsed the aggressive Saudi and UAE stance against Qatar, and their decision to cut diplomatic ties.\n\nThe filing by SCL Social Limited is one of hundreds of new and supplemental FARA filings by U.S. lobbyists and public relations firms since Special Counsel Mueller charged two Trump aides with failing to disclose their lobbying work on behalf of foreign countries.\n\nThe number of first-time filings like SCL Social Limited's rose 50 percent to 102 between 2016 and 2017, an NBC News analysis found. The number of supplemental filings, which include details about campaign donations, meetings and phone calls more than doubled from 618 to 1,244 last year as lobbyists scrambled to avoid the same fate as some of Trump's associates and their business partners.\n\nThe flood of new filings provides a small window into the long-opaque industry of foreign lobbying in Washington in which money is spent by foreign governments to sway the opinions of the American public and U.S. officials, most often against their adversaries.\n\nThe uptick, legal experts say, comes from a new awareness that a failure to disclose overseas political work could lead to federal charges.\n\nIn October, Mueller indicted former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates. They have pleaded not guilty. Former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI. Included in his statement of offense was the finding by Mueller's team that Flynn made materially false statements in his FARA filings about his work on behalf of Turkey.\n\nBefore Manafort and Flynn's wrongdoing came to light, there had been only three indictments for alleged FARA violations since the amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act in 1966. None resulted in a conviction.\n\nIn reality, lobbyists say, many American firms have been doing business for foreign governments over the past decade, often creating ad campaigns to promote a specific solution to a humanitarian crisis or organizing events to introduce foreign leaders to U.S. officials. Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election has pulled back the veil on this lucrative industry that has been quietly flourishing in Washington for years.\n\nOne lobbyist who has recently filed under FARA and spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity said the firms can work as \"little State Departments,\" doing the work of diplomacy for a foreign government inside the United States. The reason many have been reluctant to file under FARA, the lobbyist said, was most often at the request of the foreign client who wanted to keep the amount of money it was pumping into lobbying in the United States under wraps.\n\nNews reports that the FBI and Mueller were probing the FARA databases as part of the high-profile probe started circulating earlier this year, causing many lobbyists to take note and file paperwork on efforts they otherwise might have left undisclosed.\n\nThe $333,000 contract between SCL Social Limited and the National Media Council of the UAE included creating multiple ads on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media sites with the hashtag #boycottqatar, drawing ties between terrorism and Qatar.\n\nSCL Social Limited spread the negative ads during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September. Both the firm's lobbying activity for the UAE and its FARA filing are entirely in keeping with the law.\n\nBeyond ads specifically calling for President Donald Trump's attention to the issue, the filing does not mention the president or ties between his campaign and SCL's subsidiary, Cambridge Analytica. But the connections between the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica have been widely reported in stories about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nAlexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica who is listed on the filing, reached out to Julian Assange in July 2016 seeking access to emails from Hillary Clinton's private email server so he could use them as part of Trump's election efforts, according to multiple media reports.\n\nSome of the other relationships disclosed in the 2017 supplemental filings include work by a Washington-based firm known as West Wing Writers to craft speeches for Jordan's Queen Rania al-Abdullah. The Royal Hashemite Court of Jordan, which represents the monarchy, paid the firm more than $50,000 between October 2016 and May 2017 for the \"preparation of various public remarks and written communications\" by the queen. The firm said in the filing that the remarks often focused on humanitarian issues, but that they were not involved in the \"finalization of the remarks\" or how they were delivered.\n\nAnother Washington group, known as Logan International Relations, filed \"out of an abundance of caution\" for work it did for the Peace Ambassadors for Iraq. In the filing, Logan International Relations said it does not believe any of the work it performed is necessary for filing under FARA because its target was the European market.\n\nAnother filing came from a little-known company called MediaFix Associates, run by John Schwada, who filed in December 2017 for promoting a March 2016 appearance by retired four-star general Wesley Clark on CNBC and Fox Business Network. According to Schwada's filing, Clark raised concerns about Fetullah Gulen, an elderly Muslim cleric and known opponent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his influence in the United States.\n\n\"I was a novice in the world of international lobbying,\" Schwada told NBC about the late filing. He described the complicated guidelines for filing that make it difficult for someone new to the business.\n\nIn a high-profile case, veteran lobbyist Tony Podesta left the firm he founded, the Podesta Group, after it came to light that Mueller was investigating the firm for failing to disclose its work on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Podesta had previously said he did not know he was working for a political party because his group was doing the work as a sub-contractor through Manafort's firm. NBC News has previously reported that Podesta's firm is one of the unnamed companies in Mueller's indictment against Manafort and Gates.\n\nDaniel Pickard, a lawyer specializing in FARA, said that there has been a significant increase in new FARA clients. The main driver, he believes, is a new awareness of the repercussions for failing to disclose foreign lobbying work.\n\n\"There are a lot of people out there who are not aware of the requirements of the Act,\" said Pickard.\n\n\"There was certainly a misunderstanding on the part of some that believed that they were entitled to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act instead of FARA,\" he added, referring to an exception under the law but which does not apply to the representation of foreign governments and political parties. \"Now that it is public knowledge that the Justice Department is being more proactive, including looking through Lobbying Disclosure Act forms, we are seeing a lot more FARA filings.\"",

The result is a total of 3,290 tweets, all but almost 100 sent by the popular @ten_gop account.\n\nThe most popular tweets show a fervor for stoking partisan politics and a pro-Donald Trump agenda.

Hillary using the 'Mentally Ill' to incite violence at Trump rallies. #FreeJulian #BirdDogging.\"\n\nAnd on August 24th, 2016, it tweeted: \"MSM will never show this pic from #Austin, keeps saying only whites attend Trump rallies. #WhyTrumpCanceledRallies,\" drawing over 1,600 retweets and 1,600 favorites.\n\nThe account also jumped into the online conversation on debate nights.\n\n\"DONALD TRUMP to Hillary: \"You'd Be in Jail!\"RT if you also think that it was the best #debate line ever!!!!\" the account tweeted on October 10th, 2016.\n\nAfter the debate on Oct. 20, the account tweeted: \"Crowd chanting 'DONALD TRUMP' right behind @CNN pundits' They are sick of the media lies! #debatenight #TrumpWon.\"\n\nIt also participated in spreading both news and hoaxes about a 2016 shooting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nThe other account mentioned in the indictment didn't tweet as much and wasn't as widely followed. The account, operated by confirmed Russian agents, was more focused on drumming up attendance at real-world rallies for Trump.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2016, the account announced it was helping set up rallies and invited users to send it direct messages.\n\n\"Attention! #TrumpTrain is rolling into Florida rallying in every town! DM us if you want to paint Florida red!\" it wrote.\n\nAfterward, it congratulated everyone who came out to the rallies.\n\n\"#Florida Goes #Trump in #FtLauderdale! You guys are awesome! #TrumpPence2016 #HillaryForPrison,\" march_for_trump wrote on Aug. 20, the day the account helped organize a rally in Florida.\n\nTwitter, in a statement, said they were working with officials to prevent similar shenanigans in the future.\n\n\"Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election, in part by abusing social media platforms, go against everything we at Twitter believe.

Relatives who live in California said his wife, who is in Hong Kong, and his daughter, who lives in Virginia, were trying to hire a lawyer. The family members declined further comment.\n\nHis most recent job was director of security for Christie's in Hong Kong. The auction house said he worked there for 20 months directing physical security for the auction house with no role in data security or IT. Christie's said it had suspended Lee \"pending a criminal investigation\" and declined additional comment.\n\nLee, who was stationed in Hong Kong for the CIA, left the agency in 2007, giving up his top secret security clearance. When U.S. authorities began to suspect he was a traitor, they came up with a plan to lure him to American soil -- creating a job for him in the Washington, D.C., area, federal officials said.\n\nHe flew back with his family to the U.S. in August 2012, stopping in Honolulu, Hawaii, for a few days. In a scene out of a Hollywood film, surveillance teams secretly searched his hotel room and luggage, taking photographs of his possessions, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nWhen the Lee family arrived in Virginia, they checked into another hotel -- and investigators repeated the covert exercise.\n\nAmong the items of interest: a 49-page datebook and a 21-page address book with a treasure trove of details that would have thrilled any Chinese spy hunter. There were names and numbers of covert CIA employees, addresses of CIA facilities and rendezvous notes, court documents say.\n\nThe information ranged from classified to top secret, \"the disclosure of which could cause exceptionally grave damage to the National Security of the United States,\" the arrest warrant affidavit said. All of it should have been surrendered when he left the CIA, officials said.\n\nWhile Lee was living and working in the U.S., FBI agents interviewed him five times, and he denied being a spy. Eventually, as the U.S. continued to investigate, Lee returned to Hong Kong.\n\nOn Monday, Lee flew to JFK Airport in New York on a Cathay Pacific flight and was arrested. A complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Virginia was unsealed on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials familiar with the case say it is unlikely that Lee will be charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty. It may be that the government doesn't have the proof required for such a charge, or that it doesn't want to air secrets in an open courtroom.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, on Thursday laid out the case for why AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of his company would be good for consumers.\n\n\"We want to give them better programming at lower prices,\" he said.\n\nBewkes was speaking at the first day of opening statements in the high-profile court case between the companies and the U.S. Justice Department, which is attempting to block AT&T and Time Warner from becoming a media behemoth.\n\nThe core question is what impact the deal will have on regular Americans. Time Warner and AT&T have argued that together they can offer content -- such as \"Game of Thrones,\" which Time Warner owns through HBO -- to people for less money.\n\nGovernment lawyers have argued the exact opposite.\n\nOn Thursday, government attorney Craig Conrath called the merger a \"weapon of competition,\" explaining that bills could rise by as much as $400 million annually, or 45 cents per month, per consumer. Justice Department attorneys also fear AT&T could withhold Time Warner TV channels, which include CNN, TNT and TBS, among others, from competitor's video packages.\n\nOpening arguments, presented by both sides on Thursday, left Federal Judge Richard Leon with the difficult task of predicting potential harms of an acquisition that would put 141 million phone subscribers under the same corporate umbrella as one of the biggest content companies in the U.S.\n\nThe combined company would be worth around $290 billion, almost double the size of Disney, which is valued at $151 billion. Judge Leon joked he might try to buy a crystal ball to understand which side had the better handle on the future competitive landscape.\n\nMatt Wood, policy director at Free Press, a consumer advocacy group, said large acquisitions rarely result in better prices for people.\n\n\"Mergers create cost savings, but they don't have to pass them along to consumers unless there's competitive pressure,\" Wood said.\n\nAT&T has claimed that the competitive pressure necessary to lower prices is coming from tech giants including Facebook, Google and Netflix, each of which has billions of dollars at their disposal and are investing in their own content.\n\nRandall Stephenson, AT&T chief executive, has said that the company's plan is to combine the kind of data-intensive advertising that tech companies offer with high-quality content in hopes of attracting both advertising money and subscriber payments for cheaper, internet-delivered services such as AT&T's DirecTV Now, which has grown even as its DirecTV satellite service has lost customers.",

                "title": "Hyundai and Kia under scrutiny for air bag failures after 4 deaths",
                "body": "DETROIT -- Air bags in some Hyundai and Kia cars failed to inflate in crashes and four people are dead. Now the U.S. government's road safety agency wants to know why.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it's investigating problems that affect an estimated 425,000 cars made by the Korean automakers. The agency also is looking into whether the same problem could happen in vehicles made by other companies.\n\nIn documents posted on its website Saturday, the safety agency says the probe covers 2011 Hyundai Sonata midsize cars and 2012 and 2013 Kia Forte compacts. The agency says it has reports of six front-end crashes with significant damage to the cars. Four people died and six were injured.\n\nThe problem has been traced to electrical circuit shorts in air bag control computers made by parts supplier ZF-TRW. NHTSA now wants to know if other automakers used the same computer.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Hyundai recalled nearly 155,000 Sonatas due to air bag failures, which the company blamed on the short circuits. Hyundai's sister automaker Kia, which sells similar vehicles, has yet to issue a recall.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Kia said that it has not confirmed any air bag non-deployments in its 2002-2013 Kia Forte models arising from \"the potential chip issue.\" The company said it will work with NHTSA investigators.\n\n\"Kia will act promptly to conduct a safety recall, if it determines that a recall would be appropriate,\" the company said.\n\nBut a consumer complaint cited in NHTSA's investigation documents said Kia was informed of a crash near Oakland in which air bags failed to deploy and a passenger was killed.\n\nRelated: Over 652K Vehicles Involved in Latest Takata Air Bag Recall\n\nIn October 2015, the complainant told NHTSA that a 2012 Forte was involved in a serious front-end crash that occurred in July 2013. A passenger was killed and the driver was injured. According to the complaint, Kia was notified, the air bag computer was tested and it was \"found not to be working.\"\n\nPeople who complain to the NHTSA are not identified in its database. It was unclear whether the agency verified the complainant's statement. A message was left Saturday for agency spokeswomen.\n\nKia spokesman James Bell said he could not comment beyond the company's statement.\n\nIn addition, no deaths or injuries were disclosed in Hyundai's recall documents, which were posted by NHTSA in early March.\n\nHyundai spokesman Jim Trainor says the problem occurred in rare high-speed head-on collisions that were offset from the center of the vehicles. \"It's very unusual to have that kind of collision,\" he said Saturday.\n\nDealers will consider offering loaner cars to owners until the problem can be repaired, he said. \"We certainly would do everything we can to help our customers,\" Trainor said.\n\nHyundai said in a statement that the air bag control circuitry was damaged in three crashes and a fourth crash is under investigation.\n\nZF-TRW said in a statement that it is prevented by confidentiality agreements from identifying other automakers who bought its air bag control computers. The company said it is working with customers and supports the NHTSA investigation.\n\nAccording to NHTSA, Hyundai investigated and found the problem was \"electrical overstress\" in the computers. The company didn't have a fix developed at the time but said it was investigating the problem with ZF-TRW. Hyundai does not yet have a fix for the problem but said it expects the Sonata recall to start April 20. The problem also can stop the seat belts from tightening before a crash.\n\nRelated: Air Bag Maker Takata Will Reportedly File for Bankruptcy\n\nIn the documents, NHTSA said it understands that the Kia Fortes under investigation use similar air bag control computers made by ZF-TRW. The agency noted a 2016 recall involving more than 1.4 million Fiat Chrysler cars and SUVs that had a similar problem causing the air bags not to deploy. Agency documents show those vehicles had air bag computers made by ZF-TRW.\n\nThe agency says it will evaluate the scope of Hyundai's recall, confirm Kia's use of the same or similar air bag control computers and look into the cause. It also will investigate whether \"any other vehicle manufacturers used the same or similar\" ZF-TRW computers and whether there have been any similar air bag failures.\n\nThe agency says four crashes occurred in Sonatas and two happened in Fortes. One Forte crash happened in Canada. All six crashes were reported to NHTSA between 2012 and 2017, but it was unclear when they occurred.\n\nIn May of last year, NHTSA opened an investigation into whether Hyundai and Kia moved quickly enough to recall more than 1.6 million cars and SUVs because the engines can stall, increasing the risk of a crash. The investigation into three recalls by the two brands is pending. The agency also said it's investigating whether the automakers followed safety reporting requirements.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nCommercial truck driving has a reputation for grueling hours, weeks away from home, and a burly machismo that isn't particularly welcoming to women. It's high time that reputation got a makeover. A 2017 report by the American Trucking Association noted that the industry needs to hire almost 900,000 more drivers to meet rising demand, while the latest jobs report noted that 185,000 jobs have been added over the past four months alone. Bottom line: this sector is getting desperate for talent, and the problem is only worsening.\n\n\"The shipping infrastructure is facing a tight capacity crunch this year, and the small- to-mid-sized business shipper will feel the upward pressure in raised rates due to the lack of drivers and trucks available,\" said Tim Story, EVP of freight operations at Unishippers. \"The new mandate could result in a 4-8 percent loss in capacity (available trucks on the road).\n\nAnd the workers prized by many of these companies aren't getting any younger.\n\n\"The average age of commercial truck drivers is 55 and rising rapidly,\" said Jon Gilbert of PLG Consulting. \"The concern is that older, qualified truck drivers are retiring, and we are not getting adequate replacement drivers.\"\n\nYoung people looking at a first or new career may be disenchanted by commercial trucking not only because of what Gilbert describes as an \"arduous lifestyle,\" but because they need a special kind of license (CDL) to qualify. Though some companies offer free training (tuition can cost up to $8,000), that's hardly the standard, and either way it's a solid investment of time. You also need to meet physical and health requirements, and, in what is perhaps the biggest obstacle the industry sees here, be at least 21 to cross state lines.\n\n\"Right off the bat we're knocking a significant portion of potential workforces out with that age restriction,\" Brian Andalman, director of carrier sales and client services at AFN, told NBC News. \"If kids aren't interested in doing college but can't attack this arena, that's a big hurdle.\"\n\nNeil Abt, senior editor at Fleet Owner, noted that there are efforts in the industry to \"create graduated licensing programs that would allow 18-20-year-olds into the industry, as opposed to them starting a career elsewhere and being gone by the age of 21.\"\n\nHowever, the larger issue in appealing to younger adults seems to point to deeper roots.\n\n\"It is common for a speaker at a trucking conference to ask the crowd to raise their hands if they hope their children become truck drivers,\" said Abt. \"Few, if any, ever raise their hands.\"\n\nAbt notes that in recent years there has been more recruiting from companies via social media, which is \"a good start\", but Story observes that companies are struggling to lure fitting candidates -- and it's hurting their wallets, especially if they're shelling out higher pay to retain top talent.\n\n\"Carriers are having to spend more money on advertising to get people to apply, but only getting one to two drivers out of each 100 applications they receive,\" said Story. \"Between the training required, predominantly male-dominated field, age hurdles and more, carriers are having to pay drivers higher rates that will continue to increase. Right now, there aren't enough qualified drivers in the applicant pool to satisfy the needs of the industry. Until a recruitment solution is identified, it will continue to be a problem.\"\n\nOne company that seems to have found a solution, at least for itself, is UPS. Dan McMackin, public relations manager at UPS and a former truck driver himself, told NBC News that while the company does have to get creative during the Christmas season to bring in new workers, the company isn't facing any general shortage of drivers.\n\n\"We have roughly 127,000 drivers, and about 20,000 of those are tractor/trailer,\" McMackin said, adding that the majority of the drivers work in delivery. \"About 12,000 or so are over the road, but most just go out in one day for around five hours and then return that distance. This makes it a very unique and attractive job offering because you don't have to sleep in a truck cab or berth or eat at truck stops. We're one of the largest users of rail in America, so any ground shipments going beyond about two states away from origin go on the rails.\"\n\nThough UPS does recruit outside the company, most of its drivers come from the UPS pipeline and, like McMackin, have held other internal positions before they work up to being a driver, where the perks are cushy. \"They get a better package than I do: full pension, full healthcare, and a 401(k) that the company matches.\"\n\nMcMackin adds that while he's not certain of the stats, the job does skew mostly male, but that said, some of the best drivers he's ever worked with have been women, and he hopes to see more taking the wheel.\n\nThat most truck drivers are men is a critical point, and an area where the sector has the most advancements to make.\n\nEllen Voie, president and CEO of the Women In Trucking Association (WIT) is working to bring a sense of community to women drivers, as well as to foster initiatives that could attract more female truckers. Right now, only seven percent of the commercial trucker workforce is female. That number may have perhaps made sense 20 years ago, when you needed some brawn to navigate these massive vehicles, but trucks are so much more efficient today.\n\n\"There's very little physical exertion anymore,\" Voie told NBC News. \"Even the hood releases and the dollies are hydraulic. You just push a button. There aren't any challenges that women have that men don't when it comes to the job. But they do prioritize differently. Women are much more concerned about safety, both in terms of the safety of the equipment and their personal safety. The [former concerns] mostly maintenance, but personal safety, that is huge. Women are much more situationally aware and cautious. They don't park in the back where it's dark. They will often have a dog in the truck with them, and a personal safety device like a can of hornet spray because it can reach up to 15 feet.\"\n\nCurrently WIT has over 4,000 members, mostly in North America. The organization touts a Facebook group, a weekly newsletter, a quarterly magazine, various workshops and events, and an annual conference. Additionally, WIT works with manufacturers to provide women's feedback and suggestions.\n\n\"We work with the manufacturers on design and ergonomics so that women can feel as comfortable as men, given that they generally have shorter arms and legs,\" said Voie, adding that women often want their truck not to feel more like a home. Some manufacturers like Peterbilt, Voie notes, are paying attention. \"We're excited about their porta-potty and security alarm system.\"\n\nWIT is also optimistic about highlighting the job for the youngest generation. \"In a few weeks, we're coming out with a truck driving doll,\" she told NBC News. \"We're just really trying to introduce this field as an option to girls.\"\n\nA subject that has been sending jitters through the trucking industry at large is the slow but certain rise of self-driving vehicles. Drivers worry that these will replace their jobs, and this only deters young people more. Why join a workforce that will be obsolete in a decade?\n\n\"The talk of autonomous vehicles is creating a fear of truck driver extinction,\" said Story. \"More truck drivers are migrating to lucrative job positions in construction or manual labor remediation, where there is no current automation threat.\"\n\nBut some experts think that autonomous trucks could only help solve just about every problem the trucking industry has right now, including those of employees.\n\n\"Autonomous technologies could be the key,\" said Abt. \"This does not mean completely driverless, I cannot stress this enough. It is about making the job of driving easier, safer and maybe even more fun. A driver would still be needed in the vehicle, for emergencies, for handling the exit or entrance from the interstates, and for actually driving on the local roads. Additionally, there are technology limitations with weather, quality of road markings, and other issues.\"\n\nAlso, a truly autonomous vehicle isn't going to be standard anytime soon -- not when you consider just how much is involved for safety and security.\n\n\"You may see them here and there in the next two years, but it will be at least 10 to 15 years before autonomous trucks can capture a significant portion of the industry,\" said Vibhanshu Abhishek, assistant professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. \"You need a ton of data to assess the optimal way to respond to whatever a truck is seeing or sensing to have the safest and best running vehicle. It will take a long time to get data for every kind of situation, and intuition is a difficult thing to build in.\"\n\nBut even when it does happen, drivers shouldn't think it means they'll be out of work. If anything, they'll just work differently, and perhaps more enjoyably.\n\n\"Maybe the driver won't have to be staring all time out the window, and can do other things,\" said Abhishek. \"I can't predict the exact business model, but I am certain that the whole trucking experience will change such that it will be appealing to young truck drivers. They'll be attracted to the technology, and because the truck has so many safety features, they won't need as much experience.\"\n\n\"I also think that it will open the market up to more women,\" said Abhishek. \"It could really help solve this shortage, which is not just an American problem, but a global problem. Solving it could grow the economy worldwide.\"",

                "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's police and military will help secure water collection sites in drought-stricken Cape Town if authorities must turn off most taps on what they call \"Day Zero,\" a date currently projected to fall in the first half of April, the city said Sunday.\n\nHospitals, key economic and industrial areas and densely populated areas with a higher risk of disease would be exempt from a water cut-off, said municipal authorities, who plan to open a disaster operations center on Monday to prepare for a possible closure of taps in a city known internationally for its natural beauty and tourist attractions.\n\nSouth Africa's second-biggest city ramped up contingency plans as the water crisis hurt tourism and politicians bickered over alleged failures to offset a looming disaster blamed on explosive population growth over the last two decades and several years of drought that scientists say was possibly exacerbated by man-made global warming.\n\nCape Town's roughly 4 million residents can avoid \"Day Zero,\" slated for April 12, by each using no more than 50 liters (13.2 gallons) daily until adequate rainfall fills up depleted reservoirs and additional supply from aquifers, desalination and recycling schemes is activated, according to the city.\n\nSecurity forces would guard 200 water collection points where residents can pick up 25 liters (6.6 gallons) daily if the tap cut-off occurs, authorities said. Providers of bottled water are being encouraged to increase supply so people have the option of buying water, and water tankers would deliver to homes for the elderly and other care facilities.\n\n\"This crisis will demand a whole of society approach, where we all pull together to get through this,\" the city said in a statement that acknowledged \"panic\" among residents fretting over the possible difficulties ahead.\n\nThis weekend, Cape Town's water and sanitation department said it was investigating reports that some retailers might be illegally selling municipal tap water after people were seen lining up with empty bottles at two malls. Some residents are supplementing water supply by collecting from natural springs in the city.\n\nCape Town is run by the opposition Democratic Alliance party, which says the national government of the ruling African National Congress party has failed to deliver water to all municipalities as required by law. On Sunday, the ANC's provincial branch said the \"Day Zero\" warning was an opposition gimmick to drum up a sense of \"gloom and doom\" and suggested its own solutions, including reductions in production by brewers and soft drink companies.\n\n\"We need water, not sugary and alcoholic drinks,\" the party said.\n\nMeanwhile, tourism is taking a hit. Agencies have received cancellations from domestic and international travelers, said Cape Town Tourism CEO Enver Duminy, according to the African News Agency. He did not provide data on cancellations.\n\nOne visitor to Cape Town this weekend was Olympic great Usain Bolt, who attended a horse racing event. He was asked about the city's crisis at a news conference.\n\n\"Don't waste water,\" the Jamaican said. In the Caribbean, he said, \"we have this issue sometimes.\"",

Local residents were also asked to leave their homes overnight.\n\nA total of 284 flights were canceled Monday, affecting around 9,000 people, a spokesman for the airport told NBC News.\n\nLondon was heavily bombarded during the Second World War and unexploded ordnance is regularly discovered, particularly during construction work.\n\nLondon City Airport's runway was purpose-built on a marina adjacent to the Thames in 1987. A $477 million plan to expand the airport was approved in 2016.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAbout 13,000 tourists were trapped in the popular Swiss ski resort Zermatt Matterhorn for a second straight day Tuesday as officials warned of \"large and, in many cases, very large dry avalanches.\"\n\nIn a statement, the famed resort also warned: \"There are possible power breakdowns all over Zermatt.\"\n\nPolice and operators in the area closed roads leading in and out of the region on Monday morning and canceled all train services Monday night. Hiking and skiing in the area, about 75 miles east of Geneva, was also banned.\n\nThe decision to cut off access to the resort was made after the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research raised the avalanche risk level to 5 -- the maximum.\n\n\"Numerous large and, in many cases, very large natural dry avalanches are to be expected as a result of fresh snow and strong winds,\" the institute warned on its website. \"Without question, it is inadvisable to engage in ski touring, freeriding and snowshoe hiking outside marked and open pistes.\"\n\n\"There's no way in or out of town right now,\" said John Lauria of New York City, who was visiting Zermatt with his sister, Amanda.\n\n\"We were only skiing on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday were too much avalanche risk,\" Lauria told NBC News. \"Today, they didn't allow anybody on the mountain whatsoever.\"\n\nStill, there are worse places to be stranded, he said.\n\n\"There's enough cheese in this town to feed all of America for a full year,\" he said. \"And let me tell you, there's no shortage of beer, Champagne and other fine wines. We've been good. Sauna, massages, shopping, let me tell you: Not a big deal.\"\n\nAmanda Lauria said: \"Everyone seems to have a positive attitude and is looking forward to the skiing conditions tomorrow.\"\n\nNew snowfall Monday evening coated layers of old snow, creating a perfect environment for avalanches, the institute said.\n\nResort operators said that the measures were preventive and sensible under the circumstances and that there was no immediate threat to guests and residents.\n\n\"There are about 13,000 tourists at the moment that are spending the holiday here,\" Janine Imesch, a spokeswoman for Zermatt, told NBC News. \"The situation is under control, and there are no safety issues.\"\n\nAgence France-Presse estimated that the resort has a resident population of 5,500 people.\n\n\"Level 5 is almost unheard of in Zermatt,\" the Matterhorn Diamonds private ski school, which is based at the resort, warned in a tweet. It urged its customers to take care.\n\nSwiss police said they were launching \"preventative triggering\" of smaller avalanches with the aim of opening the resort's roads on Wednesday.\n\nWeather forecasts point to a reduction in snowfall during Tuesday, with no snow forecast for Wednesday.",

                "body": "The Transportation Security Administration is searching the cellphones and other electronic devices of domestic air travelers and should be ordered to document when, how and why, according to a federal lawsuit filed Monday.\n\nIn December, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeking records of TSA searches of domestic passengers' electronic devices, including disclosure of the equipment the agency uses to extract data from cellphones and other equipment.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the ACLU alleged Monday that the TSA, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, has failed to respond.\n\n\"TSA is searching the electronic devices of domestic passengers, but without offering any reason for the search,\" said Vasudha Talla, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Northern California office. \"We don't know why the government is singling out some passengers, and we don't know what exactly TSA is searching on the devices.\"\n\nNBC News reported last year that former Homeland Security lawyers were alarmed at the number of U.S. travelers' cellphones that were being searched at the border by a sister Homeland Security agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe ACLU, which is already challenging those searches, alleged in its suit Monday that similar searches of the cellphones of air passengers traveling solely within the United States have also \"multiplied year after year.\"\n\nThat the feds are technically able to scour your phone for its deepest, darkest secrets has been known for some time. The Department of Homeland Security has published dozens of technical reports detailing its ability to extract data from mobile devices, regardless of password protection. The most recent report, published in December, disclosed testing of search capabilities on a wide variety of popular Apple and Android phones.\n\nIn June 2017, John Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security and now the White House chief of staff, disclosed that Homeland Security was phasing in so-called enhanced screening beginning for commercial flights originating outside the United States. The TSA has said it began conducting such screening for domestic flights in October.\n\nBut while \"federal agencies have published their policies regarding searches of electronic devices at international borders,\" the ACLU alleged in its lawsuit, their \"policies on searching electronic devices of domestic air passengers remains shrouded in secrecy.\" [Emphasis in original.]\n\n\"Our phones and laptops contain very personal information, and the federal government should not be digging through our digital data without a warrant,\" Talla said Monday.\n\nThe suit seeks records specifically from the TSA field office in San Francisco and from TSA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. In addition to information about policies and technology, it seeks records detailing the training of officers conducting such searches, along with reimbursement of the ACLU's litigation costs and attorneys' fees.",

                "title": "Does it matter who wins in tonight's Pennsylvania special election?",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- By now, you know that the congressional district where tonight's Pennsylvania special election is taking place won't exist in its current form come November due to the state's new congressional map. And you also know that the outcome in this district likely won't tell us anything new about the political environment. (After all, there isn't much difference in Democrats winning by 2 points -- or losing by 2 points -- in this +20 Trump district.)\n\nBut the outcome of the contest between Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone DOES matter.\n\nIt matters because a victory clears the field for Lamb or Saccone when it comes to the new congressional districts where they'll likely run in November (PA-17 for Lamb, PA-14 for Saccone). \"If Lamb (D) wins, he'll be in a much stronger position to take on Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) in #PA17 in the fall (in fact, he'd probably be a slight favorite). If Saccone (R) wins, he'll have inside track for #PA14 to the south,\" the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman tweeted.\n\nIt matters because a GOP loss tonight could possibly lead to more Republican retirements. \"If [Lamb] wins, you're going to see probably another half a dozen Republicans say they're not running again,\" former Vice President Joe Biden said while campaigning for Lamb last week, per the New York Times' Jonathan Martin.\n\nIt matters because if they win, Lamb or Saccone would get incumbent-protection services as a sitting member of Congress.\n\nAnd it matters because of the campaign messages that the parties and candidates are trying to sell voters - like the GOP's tax cuts, the GOP's anti-Pelosi ads and the Dems' argument that they're running fresh faces who are \"stability\" candidates. \"If GOP can't sell tax cuts effectively in a CD that voted for Trump by 19.6%, where will they be able to in the fall?\" Wasserman asks.\n\nPolls close in Pennsylvania at 8:00 pm ET.\n\nNBC's Vaughn Hillyard: \"Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone on Monday evening asserted that his political opponents 'hate' the president, the United States, and even God. 'They're energized for hate for our president,' said Saccone, standing alongside Donald Trump Jr. in a firehouse in this western Pennsylvania town. He continued, 'Many of them have a hatred for our country. I'll tell you some more -- my wife and I saw it again today, they have a hatred for God.'\" Here's video of Saccone's remarks.\n\nIf you haven't checked out our new blog on the 2018 midterms and beyond -- The Rundown -- give it a try. Here's a link to bookmark and check daily.\n\n\"British Prime Minister Theresa May says her government has concluded it is 'highly likely' Russia is responsible for the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent,\" the AP wrote yesterday. \"May told British lawmakers on Monday that Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were exposed to a nerve agent known as Novichok, a weapon developed in the Soviet Union in the end of the Cold War.\"\n\n\"'Either this was a direct act by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others,' she said.\"\n\nBut guess who hasn't commented on the poisoning -- despite chiming in on past attacks or violence in the U.K.? President Trump.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did call the poisoning an \"outrage\" and said the United States stands by Britain. But she wouldn't say if Russia was behind the act. \"Right now, we are standing with our UK ally. I think they're still working through even some of the details of that. And we're going to continue to work with the UK, and we certainly stand with them throughout this process.\"\n\nBut guess who did single out Russia? Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \"Tillerson says ex-spy's poisoning in UK 'clearly came from Russia,' vows it 'will trigger a response',\" the AP says.\n\n(Update: After First Read was published this morning, the Washington Post reported -- and Trump himself subsequently confirmed -- that Tillerson is out as Secretary of State, to be replaced by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The Washington Post reported that Trump asked Tillerson to step aside on Friday, before his comments on Russia.)\n\n\"House Republicans investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election say they have found no evidence that Russians colluded with any members of the Trump campaign and dispute a key finding from the intelligence community that Russia had developed a preference for the Republican nominee during the election,\" NBC's Mike Memoli reports.\n\nBut remember, whether it was House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes' statement outside the White House or their release of the Nunes memo, the House GOP's credibility and good faith in this investigation ended a while ago.\n\nAs former top CIA official John McLaughlin, an MSNBC national security analyst, tweeted last night: \"As a subject or observer of Cong oversight of intell for 40 years, I've never seen a party drive a stake thru the process as House Reps just did. It depends on a bi-partisan approach that at least gives the minority a voice. Take that away and the thing dies. It just did.\"\n\nMeanwhile, this new story from the Washington Post isn't the greatest timing for Nunes & Co. \"In the spring of 2016, longtime political operative Roger Stone had a phone conversation that would later seem prophetic, according to the person on the other end of the line. Stone, an informal adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, said he had learned from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that his organization had obtained emails that would torment senior Democrats such as John Podesta, then campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton,\" the Post writes.\n\nA reminder: Podesta's emails were hacked in March 2016; WikiLeaks didn't start releasing them until October 7.\n\nMore from the Post: \"The person, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing federal investigation into Russian campaign interference, is one of two Stone associates who say Stone claimed to have had contact with Assange in 2016. The second, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, said in an interview Monday that Stone told him that he had met with Assange -- a conversation Nunberg said investigators for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III recently asked him to describe.\"\n\n\"In an interview Monday, [Stone] again denied that he had any advance notice about the hacked emails or any contact with Assange. He said he only recalled having one conversation with anyone in which he alluded to meeting the WikiLeaks founder -- a comment he said he made as a joke to a long-winded Nunberg. 'I wish him no ill will, but Sam can manically and persistently call you,' Stone said, recalling that Nunberg had called him on a Friday to ask about his plans for the weekend. 'I said, \"I think I will go to London for the weekend and meet with Julian Assange.\" It was a joke, a throwaway line to get him off the phone. The idea that I would meet with Assange undetected is ridiculous on its face.'\"\n\nSeptember 2015: FBI agent notifies low-level DNC tech-support contractor that at least one computer network had been compromised\n\nMarch 19, 2016: Russian hackers gain access to Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta's emails\n\nJuly 21, 2016: GOP convention concludes with Trump giving his speech accepting the Republican nomination\n\nJuly 22, 2016: WikiLeaks releases stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee\n\nJuly 27, 2016: In his final news conference of his 2016 campaign, Trump asks Russia: \"If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing\"\n\nOctober 4, 2016: WikiLeaks' Julian Assange says his organization will publish emails related to the 2016 campaign\n\nOctober 7, 2016: Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence release a statement directly saying that Russia is interfering in the 2016 election\n\nOctober 7, 2016: WikiLeaks begins releasing Podesta's emails\n\nOctober 31, 2016: \"This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove,\" Trump says on the campaign trail",

Plus the president's lawyer, John Dowd, says it's time to end Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Are we seeing a change in White House tactics from cooperation to confrontation? My guest this morning, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, Florida, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Mike Conaway of the House Intelligence Committee. Also the Democrats big win in Pennsylvania.\n\nREP. ELECT CONOR LAMB:\n\nIt took a little longer than we thought. But we did it.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nConor Lamb wins a district President Trump swept in 2016.\n\nWas this a rare red district win for the Democrats or a sign of a coming blue wave? We have the latest numbers from our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Joining me for insight and analysis are Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor for National Review, Eliana Johnson, national political reporter for Politico and the anchor of NBC Nightly News on Saturdays and on Telemundo, Jose Diaz-Balart. Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nGood Sunday morning to quote the great character Penny Lane in the movie Almost Famous, though without the jazz hands, \"It's all happening.\" Item: Attorney General Jeff Sessions fires former F.B.I. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe who has been a target of President Trump for months. McCabe along with former F.B.I. Director James Comey, who Mr. Trump also fired, are the two people best positioned to know whether the president obstructed justice in the Russia investigation.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nItem: President Trump's attorney John Dowd says he wants to see Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe shut down.\n\nItem: President Trump formally joins his legal team's response to the porn actress Stormy Daniels claiming in court papers that she has violated a confidentiality agreement. But by doing so, the president effectively admits he was a party to paying off Miss Daniels to keep her quiet.\n\nAgainst this flurry of activity over the last two days, and that doesn't even include Tuesday's firing of the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Twitter, we have a brand new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll with mixed news for President Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nOn the one hand the president's numbers are up a notch. 43% approve of his performance, 53% disapprove. Four point increase since he, we tested in January. It's the best Mr. Trump has done in our poll since September. At the same time though the Republican Party's numbers have slipped since January by a margin of ten points, 50/40, voters say they would prefer to see Democrats control Congress. Back in January the Democratic Party's lead was just six points, 49/43.\n\nBut we begin with the White House's escalating assault on the Russia probe with President Trump tweeting last night, \"The Mueller probe should never have been started,\" adding, \"It was based on fraudulent activities,\" he claims, and again he called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe president is making his most aggressive moves yet to shut down the Russia probe. A dramatic shift in his legal strategy. On Saturday Mr. Trump's attorney, John Dowd, called on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to, quote, \"Bring it in to the alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey.\" The statements from the president and Dowd are the clearest sign yet that the special council's job may be in danger after months of dropping hints.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nI'd like to see it end. Look, the whole Russian thing was an excuse. There is absolutely no collusion. That has been proven.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThe campaign against Mueller and the Justice Department has been cheered on by Mr. Trump's defenders in the conservative media.\n\nSEAN HANNITY:\n\nIf Rod Rosenstein had his way we wouldn't know about any of these scandals. People now need to be held accountable.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDemocrats are hitting back. On Saturday the Democratic leader of the Senate's Russia investigation, Mark Warner, tweeted, \"Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the special council now.\"\n\nSEN. BEN CARDIN:\n\nI just think this is outrageous. The Department of Justice, the F.B.I. should be independent.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAnother sign the administration is trying to delegitimize the Russia investigation: the eleventh hour firing of former Deputy F.B.I. Director Andrew McCabe on Friday night. Just 26 hours before his formal retirement following a recommendation from the F.B.I. McCabe has been a target of the president for months.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nHe got from five to $700,000, whatever the number was. Got that money for the wife. And you know in Virginia--\n\nHe has had some very troubling behavior. And by most accounts a bad actor.\n\nHas there been any curtailment of the F.B.I.'s activities in this important investigation since Director Comey was fired?\n\nOn Friday Mr. Trump called McCabe's firing a \"great day\" tweeting, \"Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choir boy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the F.B.I.\" Mr. McCabe is accused in an inspector general's report, which is not yet public, of not being forthcoming under oath about his decision to let F.B.I. insiders talk to a reporter during the presidential campaign about the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. In a statement McCabe dismissed the charges, quote, \"I'm being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\" Joining me now from Miami is Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Senator Rubio, welcome back to Meet the Press.\n\nI know it's been a extraordinarily busy time for you both locally and nationally. So -- and I want to try to get to a number of things with you. But let me start with Andrew McCabe's firing. Was he treated fairly?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nI don't like the way it happened. He should've been allowed to finish through the weekend. That said, look, there's an inspector general report that's due and work that's being done and after he had retired, if that report would've indicated wrongdoing or something that was actionable, there are things that could've been done after the fact. But, you know, 48 hours to go before retirement, I would've certainly done it differently given the fact there's still this report out there that hasn't come in.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAre you concerned about damage this does to the F.B.I., to the office of professional responsibility who apparently made this recommendation and the Justice Department itself?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nYeah, I just don't like this whole, you know, back and forth between the people outside the F.B.I. and in it. These agencies, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. I mean, all of these agencies are made up of thousands of people who are out there working every day. You know, the field offices around the countries, many of whom are far removed from any of the drama in Washington. They're just out there doing their work every single day. I would hate to demoralize the workforce. And more importantly, I would hate to discourage new people from coming into that. So I just don't like the whole tone. I don't like the fact they're in the news every day. I think both sides of this debate have done this from time to time. There was certainly a lot of criticism of Comey from Democrats when they didn't like how he handled the Hillary probe. So they're not above reproach. There are ways to hold them accountable. But I think we need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nNow you're on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Andrew McCabe says he believes he was fired because of the role he played and the actions he took and the events he witnessed in the aftermath of James Comey's firing. This apparently is based on testimony he gave to the House Intelligence Committee. Do you believe the Senate Intel Committee should call McCabe back to testify?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nPotentially. But ultimately, people have to understand our probe is different from the Special Counsel. Our probe is about election security, about the methods, about breakdowns in our intelligence system if they happen in terms of identifying Russian interference. We're not a criminal justice probe. We're not prosecutors. We are looking at what happened, how Russia did it and what we can do in the future to prevent that sort of interference in our election. And so that's what we're focused on. And to the extent that he has something to contribute towards that, we should talk to him again. The other stuff about collusion and the like, in the process of looking at everything, you may or may not run into something about that. But that's the Special Counsel's focus.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nYou know, the president tweeted about the Special Counsel late last night. He said this, \"The Mueller probe should never have been started and that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. And improperly used in FISA Court for surveillance of my campaign. Witch hunt.\" Is there anything about that tweet that you think is factually correct?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nWell, I would just say this about the Special Counsel. The Special Counsel is not simply looking at collusion. They're, they're, they're looking at the entire thing and what happened with regards to Russian interference and whether there was any U.S. laws broken in the process of Russian interference in our elections. That is what they're looking at. It is not a collusion probe. It is much broader than that. Now obviously, once you open that up and you start looking you can go in one direction or another. You go where the evidence takes you and that's what I support. I support going wherever the evidence and wherever the facts take us. And again, that's why leaks are bad. That's why all this other speculation out there is bad. I remain confident that the Special Counsel is gonna, is going to conduct a probe that is fair and thorough and is gonna arrive at the truth and is, and is not going to go down rabbit holes that are not places that we need to be going.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nI want to ask you about this news about Cambridge Analytica and, frankly, the news that Facebook may have known in the summer of '16 that 50 million -- that sort of the profiles of 50 million Facebook users were somehow in the hands of a, of a political consulting firm really without their knowledge. And they have testified before your committee. Have they been forthcoming to you? Do you think Facebook has told you the extent of everything that was done with their users?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nNo I don't. And, and I think we've learned that the hard way. Every time that we've spoken to them it's kind of rolled out as more coming out. Look, these companies have grown very fast. Within the span of less than ten years, they've gone from being a novel idea to a major corporation. And, and I'm not sure if the sort of institutional knowledge about the responsibilities both legal and ethical that come with that have kept pace with their growth. Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing. I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else. So we'll learn more about this in the days to come. But yeah I'm disturbed by that. I'm disturbed by the fact that Facebook has created filters to help the Chinese government censor. And they're begging to get back into China. There's a lot I'm disturbed about in these things.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBy the way, we're going to see the reelection, we should probably put that in quotes, of Vladimir Putin today --\n\n-- in Russia. And we, we found out what he did in Britain. The Brits, the Germans and we're standing behind them. But the president himself hasn't stood -- hasn't been as confrontational with Putin as many, I know like you, would like to see him. There's proportionate responses to Putin. But he doesn't even respond well to that. What should be done to get Putin to stop doing what he's been doing?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nWell, ultimately when it comes to the U.K. incident, I mean, that is an attack on an ally in a NATO nation. So I'm not saying that the response should be a military response. But I most certainly think it should be a comprehensive and coordinated response. And our allies, if we truly have an alliance with the U.K. that involves other countries like Germany and France, all the members of NATO, all of these nations should be coming together with a collective response, whether it's more -- whether it's additional sanctions or additional diplomatic actions, combined with some other perhaps NATO buildups and protective status increments. All of these things should be done in conjunction and together. There's got to be a collective response to this. Vladimir Putin is a cost-benefit analyzer. He is -- he is now going to weigh the costs and the benefits of the action he took. And if the benefits outweigh the cost he will do it again. He could do it again here inside the United States.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right. I finally want to ask you about the tragedy down at FIU, a school that's very important to you, frankly my home town. It's very -- it's been a tremendous source of pride for South Florida. But I want to ask you a question that an anguished uncle of a victim, Alexa Duran, has, is asking this morning in the paper. \"Why they had to build this monstrosity in the first place to get children across the street. Then they decided to stress-test this bridge while traffic was running underneath it.\" Obviously there's a lot of investigating to do. But that , frankly, that's the first question I think a lot of people have. Why were they testing this the way they did it?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO:\n\nWell, I don't think it's clear that there was testing going on. I think what we do know is that there was work ongoing. There were these rods that go inside, like cables. And they were being tightened. And they call it, you know, post-tension application. And it is during that work that the bridge collapsed beginning on the north end. Now obviously whether the work was the cause of it or not remains to be seen. I think clearly just from a laymen's perspective the fact that they were working on it actively at the time of its collapse leads you to believe it could have. The NTSB is on site. They've already taken samples. They're going to take entire chunks of that bridge for testing. We are going to know how -- why this failed. And primarily for the purposes of making sure it never happens again. And so, I don't -- but it's going to take a while. These are not quick investigations. But we will know the truth and we will know it in its entirety.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right, Senator Rubio, I know it's been a tough week for you down in South Florida. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views, sir.\n\nAnd joining me now is the Republican who has been in charge of the House version of the Russia investigation for the Intel Committee, Congressman Mike Conaway of Texas. Congressman, welcome to Meet the Press.\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nWell, good morning. My, my first Sunday morning show ever.\n\nSo I should be in church and Sunday school but I'm here with you instead.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nI, I, I appreciate that and my apologies to your pastor--\n\n--on that front. Let me start with something Andrew McCabe said following his firing because it involves the committee that you're a part of. He said, \"The release of this report,\" referring to the inspector general report on his conduct, \"Was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the president.\" Can you tell us if that sentence, if it's true that that's what McCabe did in front of your committee?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nI don't know how the inspector general got access to that testimony in front of our committee. If he did, I'm unaware of it so I'll have to, to run that to ground. But I don't know how the inspector general would have gotten that unless he got it from McCabe during his conversation with McCabe. So in terms of his testimony in front of us, I don't know how the IG would have gotten--\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nSo there is no way transcripts of Andrew McCabe's testimony are going to end up in the hands of, say, the White House or anybody else?\n\nWell, I mean, yes, we could vote to have that happen. But no there's-- that's -- that was committee sensitive information that should have stayed within the committee. And so how-- if the inspector general got, got permission to do it then that was -- he didn't ask me to do it and had to go a different route.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nHow would you characterize McCabe's testimony to you?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nYou know, I had previous little-- some experience with, with Andrew McCabe. But at the time he was giving it, you're listening to it, you're trying to analyze for veracity and those kinds of things. But, you know, he's a guy that's not used to being questioned like that. He's the guy who's usually questioning someone else. So he's uncomfortable. But I thought he was-- you know, tried to, to tell us what--\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nYou thought he was forthcoming? You felt like he was trying to tell you the truth?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nTo the extent that we knew it. But if that proves to be incorrect then that was a bad judgment on my part. But I didn't-- nothing that he said we said, \"Well, you know, Mr. McCabe that's just clearly wrong. X, Y, Z.\" We didn't have any kind of confrontation like that.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDo you understand why many people think he's not been treated fairly in the public square?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nYou know, I don't have access to the personnel records that the F.B.I. did to, to see that. You know, I--\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThe president of the United States targeted him for -- targeted -- President of the United States targeted him for over a year that created this cloud over him which we don't whether is fair or unfair.\n\nI don't know what he did to-- you know, the F.B.I., all the facts will come out. It's, it's pretty unfair of us to speculate at this point--\n\nBut is it an appropriate use of the bully pulpit? I mean, was that fair for the president to single him out like that? It made it so that he was in an untenable position, did it not?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nIf he did his job, if he told the truth, then he wouldn't have been in, you know-- we'll see. Again, we don't have access to actually what he did or didn't do. We've got both competing narratives going on out there. And the facts will, will support one or the other.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDid he back up Comey's contention that he was fired because of the Russia probe?\n\nNo, I'm talking about did he back up Mr. Comey's contention that Mr. Comey said he thought one of the reasons the F.B.I., that James Comey was fired, himself, reason he was fired, he had testified that he thought it had to do with the Russia probe. Did Andrew McCabe back up James Comey's testimony.\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nYeah, it's been a while since I sat through that, that testimony. I haven't had read it recently. We were focused not so much on that as the-- because that feeds into the collusion issue. And, and our, our committee doesn't -- was not charged with answering the collusion idea. So we really weren't focused on that direction. But I'd, I'd have to go back and check that.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right, I want to ask you, I know you're now saying that your committee was not focused on the collusion idea. You said on Monday in a conference call, \"At the end of the day we believe that the broader evidence available to us was that they,\" referring to the Russians, \"Favored her,\" Hillary Clinton, \"Over him,\" Donald Trump. \"And the main issue was to sow discord.\" The next day, you reversed that statement saying, \"No, no, no, no they were targeting-- they were trying to help Donald Trump.\" Definitively, what is your conclusion on this?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nWell, everybody gets to make their own mind. What we did with the ICA, which was what drove those com -- those comments, and I got us off on the wrong track, quite frankly, is that we wanted to look at the analytical integrity of that process throughout the ICA. And we agree with most of it. We'll have a second report on this-- that effort. But the idea that, that Putin wanted to help Trump that came out of the ICA, we don't believe that was supported by the standard tradecraft of analytics. Each of us gets to make up our own mind of what, what we said happened. Only Putin knows for sure what he was doing during that time frame. And he might have changed his ideas across that, that, you know, six year--\n\nBut you just said, you just said your job wasn't to figure out if there was collusion in the committee.\n\nOkay. Then why is Devin Nunes claiming, \"Well, there's no evidence of collusion\" if you didn't even investigate this aspect of it?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nWell, I don't, you know, well, that's (UNINTEL) - there's a chance Todd that I don't understand. Say that again.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWell, Devin Nunes has gone out there saying all the evidence he's seen, there is no, there has been no collusion.\n\nBut if you're not investigating collusion then you haven't--\n\nThat's all we investigated. We didn't investigate conspir-- or his obstruction of justice issue. We-- that's what we investigated, was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians or was there collusion between the Clinton campaign and the Russians?\n\nOkay. If you didn't interview George Papadopoulos, somebody who apparently is the person that triggered the investigation because he was bragging about potential access to damaging information on Hillary Clinton, if you didn't interview him, just that one, and there's other people you didn't interview, how can you draw this conclusion--\n\n--he got outside the opportunity for us to interview him when he was charged and is caught up in the Mueller investigation. We're trying to stay away from the Mueller investigation and not confuse that or hurt it one way or the other. So that part of the timing - front. The other issue is we couldn't feel a real good link between the Papadopoulos himself and his braggadociosness and the Trump campaign. He was kind of at the edge of the circumstances. And after he--\n\nWell we, all the other information we got and all the information we got about him, talked about him, he was not somebody that seemed to be a player in the, in the long-term.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDo you regret trying to draw a conclusion, a conclusion on collusion? My apologies, that is a tough phrase to say. Do you now regret trying to draw a conclusion about collusion?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nNo. Well, we haven't drawn that. What we said, Todd, excuse me, Chuck, is that we found no evidence of it. There may or-- you know, we-- that's a, that's a, that's a different statement. We found no evidence of collusion.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nTom Rooney, who's a member of the Intel Committee said, \"The committee has gone off the rails.\" And he says, \"We've lost all credibility and we're going to have to issue probably two different reports unfortunately and no one's going to really--\" he's implying that no one's going to know what to believe. Is he right?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nI -- you'll need to talk to Tom about that. What I believe is that by Thursday I hope that the Democrats will fold in whatever it is they want to put in the report. It's the report that we've got -- we're drafting at this point in time. And that we'll have that one report. I think the issues with respect to what the Russians did cyber-wise, social-media wise they'll agree with. What our system needs to do to protect itself for the -- in the '18 election, certainly the 2020 election, that the Democrats will agree with that. They're gonna -- they'll disagree with us on whether or not we found evidence of collusion. And they can have that section written in there differently. So, we'll have one report that will answer much of the questions that we want it to. The collusion issue, we found no evidence of it. The Democrats think they have. They've not shared that with us, if they have. I've shared all of my evidence we've got with them. But if they've got evidence of collusion, they haven't shared it with us.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDoes the blockbuster story about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook make you want to reopen the investigation?\n\nCambridge Analytica worked for the Trump campaign, had potential contacts with-- contracts with the Russians, manipulated Facebook data. Is this not part of your investigation? Why--\n\nSo, if there's criminal activity there then that's the Justice Department's responsibility. I don't have criminal -- criminal prosecutorial tools to make that happen. We're already confident that the Russians meddled in the campaign. We also know going forward that they-- that they likely--\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nSo, you're done? No reopening of this investigation under any circumstance?\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nNow hang on. Now oversight responsibility Intel Committee is ongoing. We will always watch what Putin does or doesn't do. We will always watch what these other actors around the world will do. So our oversight responsibilities are ongoing. If something came up that, that caused us to, to need to look at something, absolutely we'll look at that.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nMike Conaway, I have to leave it there. Republican from Texas. Thanks for coming on.\n\nMissing church this morning. I hope your, I hope your pastor forgives you. I appreciate you coming on--\n\nREP. MICHAEL CONAWAY:\n\nI don't need my pastor's forgiveness. I need Jesus Christ's forgiveness.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nFair enough. When we come back, is President Trump finally trying to shut down the Russia investigation? We're going to break it down with the panel. Stick around.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Welcome back, panel is here. The NBC Nightly News Saturday anchor and an evening anchor all week long on Telemundo, Jose Diaz-Balart, Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report, Eliana Johnson national political reporter for Politico and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review.Wow, I've got to start with a couple of new tweets from the president. He seems to be unloading again on Mr. McCabe, on the Mueller probe. He said this this morning, \"Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda. Probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them fake memos?\"And then he adds, \"Why did the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats and some big, crooked Hillary supporters and zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added. Does anyone think this is fair? And yet there is no collusion.\" Eliana, the president has declared war on the Mueller probe again.\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:Setting that aside for one second I actually think that the president is doing great damage to his cause because the McCabe firing, from what we know, was recommended by career officials. The president stepping into this is doing great damage because it is making it look like a political action. Yes, it was ultimately decided by Jeff Sessions. But I do think had the president stayed out of this he would've had the facts on his side.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Marco Rubio--\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:Jeff Sessions would have had the facts on his side.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Marco Rubio not liking how this was done.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG:Yeah, it was done badly. They peeled out the investigation of McCabe from the larger IG report. And there was a theory amongst some that this was done in some ways to save the Mueller probe.\n\nCHUCK TODD:That's the irony. Yeah, right. Sessions, to save Sessions, which, in turn, saves Mueller.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG:Right. Because if-- if Sessions had not fired McCabe, Trump could have used that as a pretext to fire Sessions, put in somebody who then fire Rosenstein. And then it becomes like a nursery's rhyme going all the way down. And so the irony here is that there are a lot of ironies here. There are also a lot of Democrats who don't like Andrew McCabe because they think he helped cost Hillary the election.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Which is I think what he lied about here supposedly. What he's being fired about is for helping Donald Trump get the Clinton email story into the New York Times. The irony of that is--\n\nAMY WALTER:You know--\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG:One last thing on Eliana's point. The poll that you have out today has Trump about ten in the generic. And a lot of that split has to do with the fact that a lot of suburban Republicans just don't like all of this drama. It turns them off. And this is going to overshadow the Republican efforts to get ahead.\n\nCHUCK TODD:It just feels like we're about to see Mueller and Trump--\n\nAMY WALTER:Go head to head.\n\nCHUCK TODD:--clash and it's an explosion. And it feels like this whole thing is--\n\n(OVERTALK)\n\nJOSE DIAZ-BALART:What an explosion it will be. If he goes through and takes out Mueller the reaction is going to be huge on--\n\nJOSE DIAZ-BALART:You know what I think, I think we're living in a different time space continuum in the United States and maybe anywhere else. We're living in what Catalan writer Andre Giuliana (PH) called the emotional spasms of Twitter. And every emotional spasm that comes out is something that the world reacts to and yet it's like are we living in a different time and space right now because of Twitter?\n\nAMY WALTER:--and he's used Twitter often to make these threats that never get followed up on. Right? He could be doing all of this and there is no actual clash. It's just a clash on Twitter. And that this debate about the merits of anything now has become impossible to have because it's not empirical, it's emotional. So half of the country's going to believe, or 40% of the country believes that McCabe was railroaded. And another 40% believe he had it coming to him--\n\nAMY WALTER:The actual facts are because we have now pushed our sides. And when you have John Brennan and James Comey coming out on Twitter and it was like a blowtorch.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Look, let's put the Brennan quote up because it was unbelievable. This is Brennan talking to the president. \"When the full extent of your finality, moral turpitude and political corruption becomes known you will take your rightful place as a disgrace demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe but you will not destroy America. America will triumph over you.\" I guess he does--\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:I think Brennan needs to stay off Twitter. Comey needs to stay off Twitter. These guys would all behoove themselves to just stay off Twitter. I don't think--\n\nSamantha Power responded to that tweet by saying, \"You don't want to make enemies with John Brennan,\" which is a really dumb thing to say because--\n\n-- it fuels the argument that the deep state is out to get them.\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:\n\nAnd Comey is threatening the president about what he's going to say in his book.\n\nNo but to Amy's point, you were saying a lot of this stuff doesn't come to fruition with the president. But I think what people around the president fear is that with the firing of Rex Tillerson and all these rumors of who else is going to be fired that the president is feeling more comfortable in his skin, feeling more comfortable in the job.\n\nAnd that more things are going to come to fruition that he will step up and fire H.R. McMaster, he'll get rid of more of his cabinet secretaries. That he's simply beginning to trust his instincts more. And a year into the job feeling more self-confident than he was a year ago.\n\nI think what we're going to have is we're going to have an 800 number where people get to call in and pick which cabinet secretary they want fired.\n\nYou talk to one set of people and they think the wheels are coming off this administration. And you talk to another set and it's exactly the presidency that they wanted. But the fact of the matter is I don't know if our institutions can handle what Trump is doing.\n\nJOSE DIAZ-BALART:\n\nYou know what, you step back and you look at the world. Strong men are getting stronger. You talk about the election happening today in Russia, we already know the results of the election.\n\nA country that likes our Facebook likes more than we do. And Venezuela has a sham election 20th of May. Cuba just had a sham election. China's strong man is going to stay stronger. And yet that's the big view. And yet we can't seem to see if our institutions are going to survive the emotional spasms of Twitter.\n\nYeah. And remember though that the F.B.I. still is more popular than the president. But the president is more popular than his party. And this has been the challenge all along that what the president's doing is very hard for his party to come out against. So this idea that you're going to see Republicans coming forward and trying to be sort of a moderating influence until the president does anything it's going to be very hard to do.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nJonah, you heard it in Marco Rubio's voice. He's clearly disturbed but he's trying not to get emotional.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG:\n\nYeah, look, you talk to people, one of the greatest disconnects in life, and you talk about earth too, right, different dimension is talking to congressman and senators off the record versus on the record. I'm not talking about Marco Rubio. I'm just talking about generic. The way that they talk about the Trump White House, the sense of chaos, sort of like--\n\n--a dysfunctional family worried that dad's in the ripple again when the Twitter starts going is palpable. And then you get them all on camera and the problem is most of Trump's policies, most of Trump's personality divides the GOP rather than attracts independents and moderates.\n\nAMY WALTER:\n\nWell, the other thing that I think is really difficult is that Republicans have no agenda this coming year. And so it's very difficult for them to say, \"Focus on this, our agenda,\" as opposed to the distractions coming out of the White House.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWe're going to try to get to that in the next round of the panel. Red Fox called he wants the ripple comment back. When we come back, one of ten Democrat senators trying to hang onto seats this year in states President Trump won in 2016. It's Sherrod Brown of Ohio.\n\nI saw on Twitter that your wife said you got a haircut yesterday for this. So I appreciate--\n\nCarlos in Garfield Heights. Good man. We sat there waiting for an hour and a half. He knows everybody in Garfield Heights, Maple Heights in the city of Cleveland.\n\n--before I get to the political landscape, what should Congress do as an institution in looking into the Andy McCabe firing?\n\nSEN. SHERROD BROWN:\n\nWell, you said something earlier about-- I was listening to the show from the studio on Cleveland-- about how what members of Congress say publicly and what they say privately and what Democrats say privately and publicly about this president and the dysfunction and the immortality isn't the same thing.\n\nBut I hear so many Republican senators grumble about his ethics, about his name-calling. I was with a CEO the other day who said he has never seen a business leader or a political leader who calls his employees or her employees names. And I think at some point Republican enablers in the House and Senate are going to say publicly what they've been saying privately. And that's when things change and we see a president back off this kind of name-calling, not telling the truth, sending out these tweets, all that.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDo voters in Ohio care about the Russia investigation right now?\n\nSEN. SHERROD BROWN:\n\nI think that a lot of people do. I think people, what they care about is they say a president who is engaging in that name-calling and they know people know he doesn't tell the truth about a whole lot of things. And I think people overwhelmingly wonder about President Trump when he calls everybody else names, including people in his own party, but he never, ever criticizes Putin. So I would guess 70%, 80% of the people in Ohio, including Trump voters, really do wonder what exactly it is between Putin and Trump that we don't know details about yet.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nIt's interesting to watch Conor Lamb's campaign. He didn't run against Trump per se. In fact, would embrace some things, policy-wise, that the president was pursuing. What's your pitch to the Trump voter in Ohio that says, \"You know what, I may not be happy with his style but I think he's delivering?\"\n\nSEN. SHERROD BROWN:\n\nWell, Conor Lamb's district is right on the southwest edge of Pennsylvania. From the state line to Ohio is only a few miles because it's the northern part of Wheeling in that area and West Virginia and towns like Steubenville and Bellaire and Saint Clairsville and Cadiz and Woodsfield, across that part of Ohio.\n\nSo I know that district in that sense. I know what kinds of people live there. And his race didn't particularly surprise me because Conor Lamb, what did he talk about? He talked about pensions, he talked about health care. My state alone 200,000 are getting opioid treatment right now because they have the Affordable Care Act. Conor Lamb knows that. And he fought for the Affordable Care Act and said, \"No I'm going to stand in the way of repealing it.\" He fought for a trade policy. He wasn't around to vote against NAFTA like I was.\n\nBut he knows what the steel-enforcement, enforcing steel-trade laws mean to his district. And all of my state. He knows what pensions mean. I was in Cleveland yesterday with 200 pensioners that will see 40%, 50% cuts in their pension in large part because of what Wall Street did. And it was my idea to set up this joint House/Senate bipartisan pension committee.\n\nHad our first meeting last week. 60,000 Ohioans could lose 40, 50. And what this town doesn't understand, Chuck, is that workers 30, 40 years ago sat down at the bargaining table, gave up dollars today, money they'd like for their families. But gave those dollars up so that in the future they would have economic security. That's been taken away from. That's the kinds of things Conor Lamb talked about. That's kinds of things I'll be talking about and working on. And that makes all the difference in the world regardless if you're a Clinton or a Trump--\n\n--it's interesting and I wonder how concerned you are about your own credibility being able to fight for these voters. Because here was Hillary Clinton and what she said earlier this week while giving a talk in India. Take a listen.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON:\n\nI won the places that represent 2/3 of America's gross domestic product. So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign make America great again was looking backwards.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nSenator, I heard you describe in those border communities there between Ohio and Pennsylvania, sounded like Hillary Clinton was talking about those people. What do you say to that?\n\nSEN. SHERROD BROWN:\n\nI say that I'm not going to look back. I don't think voters or citizens in my state particularly care about the 2016 election, whether it was Hillary or Donald Trump--\n\nWell then answer me this, what does she not get? Why do you think she views those--\n\n--listen, I'm not going to come on your show and analyze what Hillary gets today or not and what she got in 2016. Or I'm not going to come and analyze how Donald Trump keeps talking about Hillary Clinton. I think that's all pretty bizarre that he just keeps reliving. Chuck, when I won my first election many years ago for state representative, and I remember for three or four days I kept talking about the election, how great I was for winning the election.\n\nAnd then I realized nobody cared. So I stopped doing it. Maybe the press ought to stop covering it. And maybe Hillary and Trump ought to quit talking about it. The election is over. And it's time that we move on. We ought to be working on infrastructure and pensions. And all the issues that matter in places. In Conor Lamb's district and in my state. That's why people voted for him. And that's why people in the end will vote for me and will vote for Democrats that stick to those issues of fighting for consumers and fighting for health care.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nSenator Brown, I'm going to leave it there. But I think you're wrong. I think we all are stuck in this time warp where we're going to relive the 2016 election--\n\n--get out of us, Chuck. You have a pretty loud microphone there.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nI am half teasing there. I think we all want to get out of the 2016 election. Anyway, thank you very much.\n\nWhen we come back will what happened in Pennsylvania this week stay there?\n\nANNOUNCER:\n\nMeet the Press Data Download brought to you by Pfizer.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWelcome back, Data Download time. But it may also be time for Republicans to start hitting the panic button. Our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll combined with the results from last week's special election in Pennsylvania show the GOP could be in for a very rocky midterm season this fall. As we mentioned, the president's approval rating is actually up four points from January while those who want to see Republicans in charge of Congress is down giving Democrats a double-digit ten-point advantage. And Republicans are losing support among groups they typically rely on to push them over the top. Since January, Republicans are down three points among all white voters, down six with voters who live in GOP districts, down seven with suburbanites and down nine with white-collar workers. By the way, the GOP is also down double-digits with young voters. All of this played out last week when Democrats pulled off the upset in that special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional district, a place Donald Trump won by nearly 20 points less than two years ago. And come November Republicans will have a lot more districts just like it to defend. Districts home to a lot of the groups that our poll shows Republicans are now struggling to hold onto. There are 97 Republican districts where President Trump's margin of victory in 2016 was less than 20 points. Forty-four of those are even more suburban or urban. Ninety of those are younger on average than PA '18. And 96 of those 97 are more racially diverse than this Congressional district. Republicans were already worried about suburban districts around the big metro areas in this country from Orange County, California, to Northern Virginia, to Houston. That's where Hillary Clinton actually won districts. Now they have to start worrying about suburban districts in a lot more smaller to mid-size cities, places like Virginia Beach, Lexington, Kentucky, Little Rock, Arkansas and Omaha, Nebraska. In short, our NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Pennsylvania 18 may be less of an outlier and more a sign of things to come. We'll be back in a moment with end-game and something in our poll that we've never seen before that could be hugely significant in November.\n\nANNOUNCER:\n\nComing up, End Game and PostGame brought to you by Boeing. Continuing our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire.\n\nANNOUNCER:\n\nEnd Game, brought to you by Boeing. Continuing our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBack now with End Game and something that showed up in our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that we hadn't seen before. In districts currently held by the Democrats voters prefer Democrats by 24 points, 56/32. That's not surprising.\n\nWhat is surprising is that in the Congressional districts that we polled in that are all held by Republicans right now the generic ballot is dead even, 46/46. We've been looking at the Congressional ballot result through this lens since 2010. And both parties have always led in their own districts that they've held. And they've always led by double digits, just as the Democrats still do now.\n\nIt always has shown our polarization. This one poll could be an outlier. We'll have to wait for our next poll to see. Or it could be very rough sign for Republicans. Amy Walter, what was extraordinary about it, it was-- it was basically identical results that Conor Lamb had.\n\nAMY WALTER:\n\nI was just about to say we have seen it actually. And it was in Pennsylvania 18 where the generic ballot, when you asked that question right before the election, was 42/42 in a district that Trump carried by 20 points. The challenge for Republicans right now isn't just that the president isn't popular and has lost popularity even in districts that he won in 2016. The party's unpopular and the issues are unpopular. What Conor Lamb talked about and Senator Brown raised this about the issue of health care is going to be a big issue in this election. And the irony is Democrats lost the House in 2010 on Obamacare. Republicans could lose the House in 2018 by trying to repeal Obamacare.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nHow do you like them apples, Jonah? Health care, I've heard this too that on the trail. It's not Russia, it's not trade.\n\nIf you talked to Republicans over the last three months they all would say, \"Oh once the tax cut thing actually manifests itself, when people see their paycheck,\" and we saw in Pennsylvania 18, the dog didn't bark. And that's why at the end Saccone moved to, the Republican candidate, moved to his sort of \"they're coming for your bibles\" stuff because he hoped that would work instead. And that's got to be terrifying to a lot of swing districts. And if, if I were a district that a Republican candidate won narrowly in 2016 the PA18 thing is basically the equivalent of watching the rivers turn to blood. Right? I mean it is like the seven--\n\nAnd between now and November what do you have? Taxes, hey, taxes, taxes, taxes?\n\nThat's what you talk about Eliana. Where's the agenda?\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:\n\nI don't think that there is one between now and the November elections which I think makes it very difficult for Republicans. And I think the problem they face is that they didn't pass a reconciliation bill which means that they need 60 votes to get anything through the Senate. And, frankly, the House- anything that passes the Republican House is too conservative to get through the Senate which needs sort of oatmeal mushy type, you know, compromise legislation. And so I think there's nothing happening legislativ-- in terms of legislation between now and the election which leaves the headlines Trump tweets, you know the sort of circus of the executive branch.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG:\n\nOne quick point though, there are a lot of people, a lot of Democrats, I hear them on your cable show all the time saying that Democrats need to put forward an agenda. I think that's nuts.\n\nRight. If there's no agenda between now and November here's my suggestion, why don't you deal with the Dreamers? Why don't you deal with the Dreamers? 5th of March was supposedly their end date. The court stepped in. Why don't we deal with the Dreamer issue? It seems like everybody in agreement that they're-- should be dealt with. And no one's talking about it because they don't have to.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nUh, I want to change the subject to Facebook here. If Facebook were a Senator and we treated Facebook as an individual here's what Senator Facebook, here's what we would have put up in questioning Senator Facebook. Senator Facebook in November of 2016, your founder says the idea that fake news on Facebook swung the election is pretty crazy. Then Senator Facebook, on April of '17 you admitted malicious actors did spread misinformation in the 2016 election. On October of 2017, Senator Facebook says, Russia bla-- uh backed election content reached 126 million Americans. Then March '18, Senator Facebook, we found out 50 million users had their data from Facebook somehow ended up in the hands of a political consulting firm.\n\nThey do. And it's beyond this. It's also this idea that they can't control this platform that they created, that these bots are out there now whether it's on Twitter or Facebook. And driving a lot of--\n\nWell, that's what's really unclear. Is it that the technology has gotten away from them? Or is it that they just don't want to spend the money to do what they need to do--\n\nNBC Nightly News last night with this story and the New York Times says that they've seen evidence that when they said they were going to put or destroy the data they didn't.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBut they sent him a strongly worded letter. I believe Facebook said, \"You must do this. Okay, check a box here if you did it.\"\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG:\n\nThe weird irony is that Facebook is the home of everyone's sentiment-- putting their most sentimental part of their lives on there. They have pictures of their kittens and their grandkids and their vacations and love letters to themselves and to everybody else. Meanwhile, the the actual corporation, it's like they have Asperger's. They're totally tone-deaf to people's passions about these issues, about the invasions of privacy. And they're basically-- they're trying to turn human beings into commodities.\n\nWell, even though Facebook is now accused of having played a role in helping the Trump campaign I do think that they're a microcosm of why the president was elected. They have the smartest people in the country working for them. You know, eve-- every Ivy League graduate wants to go work at Facebook. Yet they are an example of sort of the failure of elites to sort of do their jobs.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThat's a great point. And it's a good one to end on. A lively panel, thank you all.\n\nThat's all we have for today. Enjoy those-- that UMBC game today. Sorry, UVA fans. Thanks for watching. We'll be back next week because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\n\nANNOUNCER:\n\nYou can see more End Game and PostGame sponsored by Boeing on the Meet the Press Facebook page.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's job approval is up to 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, but Republicans are seeing their 2018 prospects worsen. The poll shows people favor Democratic control of Congress by 10 points - 50 percent to 40 percent - up 6 points from last month, with the GOP losing support among key voter groups.\n\nThe numbers, combined with results in this week's special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, suggest a very rocky midterm season may await Republicans this fall.\n\nNot all voter groups are the same. The GOP relies on big support from some segments of the electorate to push them over the top and this latest poll shows declines in support among them.\n\nAmong white voters, support for Republican control of Congress dipped 3 points to 47 percent. With suburban voters, the drop was a steeper 7 points to 43. Among white-collar workers, there was a 9-point slide, to 38 percent. There was a huge 13-point decline among 18- to 34-year-old voters to 29 percent. And, perhaps most troubling for Republicans, among voters in GOP-held districts, there was a 6-point drop in those favoring Republican control of Congress, to 46 percent.\n\nThose changes look particularly concerning for Republicans when you compare them to results from past elections. In the 2014 midterms, for instance, Republicans won white voters by a large margin, 60 percent to 38 percent. And that year, the GOP won the vote out of the suburbs, 52 percent to 43 percent.\n\nOf course, one poll does not mean anything for certain about the electorate this fall. November is still many months off. But this set of data carry a little more weight because it comes on the heels of Tuesday's special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district. In that race, Democrat Conor Lamb pulled off a major upset in a district President Trump won by 20 points in 2016.\n\nAs we noted last week, there were demographic reasons for the GOP to be worried about the 18th. Those worries turned out to be warranted and these new poll numbers suggest those concerns could apply elsewhere.\n\nThere are 97 districts currently held by Republicans that Trump won by less than he won Pennsylvania 18, and many of them hold lots of voters that the latest poll indicates are problematic for the GOP.\n\nOf those 97 districts, 96 are more diverse than Pennsylvania 18, 90 are younger on average and 44 are more suburban/urban. Add it all up and those numbers look especially troubling to the GOP in some of the nation's biggest metro areas.\n\nOn the danger list: Republican districts that were already seen as competitive in suburban/urban areas around Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland, the Twin Cities, New York City, even Omaha, Nebraska. They are all places with voter populations that don't look very different from Pennsylvania 18, in greater Pittsburgh.\n\nIn essence, the Democrats' big upset in last week's special election might have felt like a shocker, but the numbers in the latest NBC/WSJ poll suggest Pennsylvania 18 may be less of an outlier than it is glimpse of the major challenges ahead for the GOP this fall.",

Tillerson, the former head of ExxonMobil, was fired by President Donald Trump this week.\n\n\"It's just crazy how one day you're the CEO of Exxon, a 50 billion dollar company,\" Goodman as Tillerson lamented in a thick Southern accent. \"And the next you get fired by a man who used to sell steaks in the mail.\"\n\nGoodman was joined by two familiar faces: \"SNL\" alums Bill Hader (the host of this week's episode) as short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and Fred Armisen as \"Fire and Fury\" author Michael Wolff.\n\n\"I'm the fidget spinner of the White House,\" Hader as Scaramucci bragged. \"I made a big splash and then one day everybody was like: Whoa, what the hell was that about?\"\n\nAnd as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Kate McKinnon riffed on the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was axed two days before he was to retire and be eligible for full pension benefits.\n\n\"I'm just a simple man who wanted to make things bad for immigrants and now here I am taking the away the pension of a Christian white.

                "body": "Celeb trainer Gunnar Peterson suggests adding sprint intervals to your cardio workout to bump up the calorie burn. Yuri_Arcurs / Getty Images\n\nIf you're like a lot of gym-goers, you hop onto the treadmill, set the incline to one level and hit the ground running for the next 30 minutes at the same pace. But what if you could supercharge your cardio routine without adding extra minutes to your workout? Celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson has a tweak you can make to burn more calories and fat and it's called HIIT. \"There's nothing wrong with [steady-state cardio], but I would suggest adding sprint intervals to your cardio workout to bump up the burn,\" he says.\n\nHIIT is designed to help you burn more calories in less time, while revving up your heart rate and metabolism, so you keep squashing calories hours after you stop moving. Moe Widdi, an ACE-certified personal trainer at the New York Health & Racquet Club, says, \"HIIT is by far the most effective for burning fat because of the maximal effort during shorter durations.\" Widdi says to think of exercise like an entire pie of pizza. \"Would you get more out of 60 percent of one slice of pizza (traditional cardio) or 30 percent of an entire large pizza (HIIT)? Obviously, we all want 30 percent!\" Follow these expert tips to help you HIIT it big, torch more calories and get major muscle gains.\n\nSometimes doing less really is more. A recent study from the University of Stirling in Scotland shows that people who do fewer repetitions during a HIIT workout reap better cardiovascular benefits than those who do more. Depending on how experienced you are at the gym, Widdi recommends 20 seconds of intense work and 10 seconds of rest for eight rounds. \"This totals three minutes and 50 seconds of full effort training, which is a lot harder than you think,\" he says. Peterson also suggests trying 10-15 second bursts every minute. And if you want to kick it up a notch, then increase your interval time to a minute of work and 20-30 seconds of rest.\n\nAdding some resistance in the form of weights to your HIIT workout can help increase your calorie burn, even hours after exercise, thanks to EPOC (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption). Research has shown that nine months of resistance training can help improve your resting metabolic rate (aka the rate at which you burn calories). When it comes to strength training, supersets are the equivalent of superfoods in nutrition.\n\nA superset is when you target different muscle groups in a row without rest in between. \"During supersets, you should do a push and pull exercise to target the front and back of your body. An example would be a chest press superset with seated rows,\" Widdi says. By training with anaerobic glycolysis, which is what happens when you lift weights, you're building lean muscle mass while burning fat. \"For every pound of lean muscle we gain, we need an extra seven to 15 calories. The more muscle we have the more food we need,\" Widdi explains.\n\nSpeaking of combining strength and cardio into one workout, EMOMs are another great way to sweat if you're strapped for time. EMOM is a form of HIIT that stands for \"every minute on the minute,\" meaning you do a designated number of reps and rest of the remainder of that minute. \"Think of using a rower and EMOM bump your intensity by rowing as though you're being chased for the first 15 seconds of every minute as an example,\" Peterson says. Widdi recommends adding a mix of upper, lower-body and core exercises to your EMOM to get in a full-body workout. \"It's like a three-for-one sale. EMOMs keep feeling new because of the eclectic exercise selection you complete,\" Widdi says.",

And the reason dates back to July 11, 2016.\n\nOn that day, a pair of city officers shot to death Joseph Mann, 50, who was holding a pocket knife. At the time, there had already been a string of complaints about police using deadly force to subdue suspects, and Sacramento found itself in the middle of a national debate over police accountability.\n\nMaking matters worse, the police department waited about two months to release dash-cam footage of the Mann killing. That \"lengthy delay\" compounded community outrage, the city's police watchdog, the Office of Public Safety Accountability, later said in a report.\n\nThat outrage included complaints about the deterioration of trust between the police and public. The city ordered a review, which culminated in a batch of reforms that included the use of officer-worn body cameras and the mandated release of video of officer-involved shootings within 30 days of the incident.\n\nThose changes made it possible for the Sacramento Police Department to release the video of officers shooting to death Stephon Clark on Sunday night, Chief Daniel Hahn said Thursday in an interview with NBC News.\n\nWhile the new policy, about a year old, requires the release of videos within 30 days, the department aims to get them out quicker, Hahn said.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will replace H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, President Donald Trump announced in a tweet Thursday.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,\" Trump tweeted. \" I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend.\"\n\n\"There will be an official contact handover on 4/9,\" Trump added.\n\nBolton, who served in the George W. Bush administration, is known for his hard-line foreign policy views, and has written in support of attacking North Korea.\n\nMcMaster's exit comes after months of speculation about not if, but when, McMaster would part ways with the administration. The timing of his departure fits what NBC News reported on March 1: That the administration's second national security adviser was slated to leave the White House by the end of the month.\n\nHis departure is also just the latest in a long line of them from the Trump White House. Only last week, Trump announced that he'd fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace him.\n\nMcMaster entered the administration after Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned under pressure and admitted that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with a top Russian diplomat. Flynn plead guilty in December to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia. While Trump enjoyed a close relationship to Flynn -- stemming in part from their days on the 2016 campaign trail together -- that relationship never materialized with McMcaster, leading to tension between the decorated military general and the commander-in-chief.\n\nAt times, those tensions spilled into public view -- like last month when Trump took to Twitter to correct McMaster's comments about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. During a speech at the Munich Security Conference, McMaster said that evidence of Russian meddling was \"incontrovertible\" -- a more direct confirmation of interference than the president has ever given of the events.\n\nWhat McMaster \"forgot to say,\" Trump chastised in the tweet, was \"that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bolton, who will become the administration's third national security adviser in just over a year, will enter the White House as Trump approaches one of the most high stakes periods of his presidency. Earlier this month, Trump accepted an invitation from North Korea's Kim Jong Un to meet, though no location or firm timetable has been set.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nA vehicle gained \"unauthorized access\" to Travis Air Force Base in California and exploded, killing the driver, base officials confirmed Thursday.\n\nThe vehicle crashed at about 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday at the main gate of the base, near Fairfield in Solano County about 30 miles southeast of Sacramento, officials said. The driver, who was not publicly identified, was pronounced dead at the scene as explosive-ordnance crews and Fairfield emergency officials responded.\n\nThe base, which employs more than 26,000 active-duty, reserve and civilian employees, said Thursday that the scene had been declared safe and that the gate was open, but it gave no further information.\n\nFairfield police Lt. Greg Hurlbut, whose agency assisted with the initial response, called it \"a unique and unusual situation.\"\n\nHurlbut told NBC News that the base's ordnance disposal personnel initially warned people on the scene of the possibility that a bomb was involved, but later declared the area safe after a robot was dispatched to check the vehicle out.\n\nThe FBI responded to the scene at about midnight, Hurlbut said. The FBI's Sacramento office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nVideos posted on a Facebook forum for members of the Air Force show a dark truck or sport utility vehicle in flames inside the gate with thick gray smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nAn account from an apparent witness on the forum said the vehicle was carrying propane tanks when it approached the gate. The driver \"started messing with a fuel ignition source to blow the propane tanks\" before driving to the side of the road, \"where he burned to death,\" according to the account.\n\n\"We didn't know if it was a terrorist attack or a suicide, but we were using the word bomb for the incident,\" according to the account, which said no shots were fired.\n\nNBC News hasn't verified the authenticity of the video or the Facebook accounts. The page is a well-established forum widely used by airmen and noncommissioned officers, and its contents are moderated.\n\nThe main gate at Travis is near the base's family military RV park. The base closed access to the camp overnight as it investigated and reopened it at 8 a.m. Thursday.",

                "body": "Staff shake-ups are nothing new for Trump. Why is his legal team different?\n\nTrump liked the idea particularly because it would be more in line with how the former CEO conducted business in the private sector: with a more open-door policy that allowed him unfettered access to outsiders and fewer roadblocks to decision making. And he has privately pointed to precedent in the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nSome allies grumbled about the feasibility of removing what in past administrations had been a critical position charged with managing the operations of staff in the White House, as well as the information flow, decision-making process and access to the president.\n\nBut several sources close to the administration argued it wouldn't be such a departure from the current status: \"Donald Trump is the chief of staff. He already calls the shots,\" said one.\n\nThe president's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, raised the prospect Thursday at a Financial Times forum, suggesting the president should become his own chief of staff if Kelly ever departed.\n\n\"I've actually argued that if General Kelly at any time does decide to leave -- (or) the president decides it's time for him to move on -- I don't believe there will be another chief of staff,\" Bannon said. \"I think there will be five or six direct reports like there was in Trump Tower.\"\n\nChris Whipple, author of \"The Gatekeeper\" about White House chiefs of staff, said the idea is ill-advised.\n\n\"History is littered with the wreckage of presidencies that have tried to do this, and Jimmy Carter is the perfect example of why it's a nonstarter,\" said Whipple, who explained that some presidents tried to institute \"spokes-of-the-wheel\" models of leadership inside the West Wing, with the commander in chief at the center.\n\nIt rarely worked, he said.\n\n\"The overarching thing that I learned from studying five decades of this is that every president learns, often the hard way, that you cannot govern effectively without empowering a chief of staff as a first among equals to execute your agenda -- and most importantly, tell you what you don't want to hear.\"\n\n\"If Trump is taking the opposite lesson,\" Whipple said, \"that way lies disaster for him.\"",

Terrorists come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and religions.\"\n\nThe calls for Conditt to be considered a terrorist follow criticism of how and when President Donald Trump has used the word \"terrorism\" in the past. Critics say he has been quick to use the word when suspects are Muslim, but appears reluctant to use it otherwise. Those concerns peaked last August, when members of Trump's own party, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., slammed Trump for not calling a deadly confrontation at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nIn the case of the Austin bombings, the White House said this week that the attacks did not appear to be terrorism. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted Tuesday that Trump was mourning the victims and added, \"There is no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\"\n\nFor Ami Pedahzur, a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has written extensively about terrorism, the bombings that paralyzed his hometown these past few weeks have felt a lot like terrorism -- even if officials haven't called it that.\n\n\"Basically when we talk about terrorism, we look at something that is politically motivated but is aimed at generating fear among people and altering their behavior,\" Pedahzur said in a phone interview from Austin. \"We are feeling terrified opening packages.\"\n\n\"In terms of [the bomber's] impact on everyday life here in town, it's absolutely terrorizing,\" he added. \"We don't know if he did it out of a political agenda, so he meets the definition of terrorism on every level -- except the motivation.\"",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe family of a truck driver killed in last week's collapse of a pedestrian bridge near Florida International University in Miami has filed a lawsuit against two companies involved in the project, saying the roadway below should have been shut down as work continued on the span.\n\nSix people, including Rolando Fraga, 60, were killed when the 950-ton pedestrian bridge collapsed on cars driving on Southwest Eighth Street shortly after 1:30 p.m. last Thursday.\n\n\"Safety is paramount in construction cases, and MCM knows that,\" attorney Christos Lagos, whose firm is representing Fraga's widow and his 15-year-old son, said at a news conference in Miami on Thursday, referring to Munilla Construction Management, the contractor. \"They know better than to not shut that roadway down right before that collapse.\"\n\nThe suit also names Figg Bridge Engineers, which was MCM's partner in the project. It seeks unspecified damages for Fraga's lost income and for the family's pain and suffering, and Lagos said the family wants the companies held responsible.\n\nThe federal National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the collapse.\n\nThe NTSB said Wednesday that its investigators have confirmed that workers were adjusting the tension on two tensioning rods at the north end of the span when the bridge collapsed, and workers \"had done this same work earlier at the south end, moved to the north side, and had adjusted one rod. They were working on the second rod when the span failed and collapsed.\"\n\nThe suit says, \"Post-tensioning operations should not be done without first providing for public safety by precluding any active movement under the structure.\"\n\nRelated: Collapsed Florida walkway was built using new 'accelerated' bridge technology\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation has said that the lead Figg engineer on the bridge project left a voicemail with the department on a landline saying that cracking had been observed on the bridge two days before the collapse, but it wasn't heard by the employee it was intended for until a day after the collapse, because the employee was out of the office.\n\nIn the message, the engineer said, \"From a safety perspective we don't see that there's any issue there, so we're not concerned about it from that perspective,\" but the cracks would have to be repaired, according to a transcript released by the department.\n\nLagos said he wants to know whether closing Southwest Eighth Street was discussed during a meeting at 9 a.m. the day of the collapse.\n\nFraga's 15-year-old son currently lives in a Central American country but had hoped to return to southern Florida to attend FIU and dreamed of becoming an engineer, said Lagos and another partner of the law firm, John Priovolos.\n\n\"He wanted to come back to Florida, to Miami, and his dream has been shattered, because of the negligence of MCM and Figg,\" Lagos said. Lagos said that like many fathers, Fraga's \"whole life was his son.\"",

                "body": "Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can damage the skin, joints, organs or other parts of the body, according to the Lupus Foundation of America. It causes a person's immune system to attack healthy tissue, triggering inflammation and pain.\n\nUp to 60 percent of people who receive a lupus diagnosis will develop kidney disease at some point in their lives. The illness garnered significant attention in 2017 when pop star Selena Gomez revealed she had undergone a kidney transplant because of the disease.\n\nSome of the most common symptoms include extreme fatigue, headaches, painful or swollen joints, fever, anemia, a butterfly-shaped rash on the face, and hair loss, according to the Lupus Foundation.\n\nSome people with lupus may see their fingers turn white or blue in the cold, known as Raynaud's phenomenon. Some experience no symptoms.\n\nNo one knows what actually causes lupus, but viral infections, hormones, genetics and environmental toxins seem to be some of the culprits being studied. Right now, there's no way to prevent lupus, said Ken Farber, president and CEO of the Lupus Research Alliance.\n\nThe disease is most common in women aged 19 to 60, and more likely to afflict women of color.\n\nAbout two-thirds of people with lupus will experience skin-related symptoms, with one of the most distinctive being a rash on the face that resembles the wings of a butterfly across the nose and both cheeks. Also called a malar rash, the red skin looks like a sunburn. Patients may also get rashes on any part of their bodies exposed to the sun.\n\nLupus is especially difficult to diagnose because there's no simple blood test for it. A variety of tests must be interpreted by physicians, primarily rheumatologists, according to Farber. An accurate diagnosis can take time -- almost six years, according to the Lupus Foundation.\n\nLupus can be life-threatening and there is no cure, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it. Treatments can lessen the severity of the pain, including anti-inflammatory medication and immunosuppressants. Kidney disease is one of the most common complications of lupus, although not every patient will need a transplant or dialysis.",

                "body": "Justina Machado: 'It's a universal story about family, told through the Latino lens' on Netflix's 'One Day At A Time'\n\n\"This is a quality show, with Latinos in front of and behind the camera,\" said Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the NHMC. \"If you read the reviews from major papers, the reviews have been lavish; people love this show. It makes you wonder what is going on with Netflix, is this some kind of anti-Latino situation? What kind of criterion are they using to deny it a third season?\"\n\nNogales noted the show offers a positive depiction of a Latino family at a time when Hispanics are still barely visible in the entertainment industry, and more importantly often portrayed in a negative light in the political arena.\n\nNetflix shows are not counted by traditional TV ratings, and viewer metrics are not publicly available. In their open letter to the company, the NHMC noted that Latinos consume streaming media at much higher rates than other demographics, and that by 2050, Latinos will constitute over 30 percent of the U.S. population. NHMC's Nogales said that that if Netflix does not renew One Day At A Time, Latinos will notice.\n\n\"Nobody will forget that they turned us down, again, even with a good vehicle,\" said Nogales. He hopes that people will sample the show, if they have not seen it already, and then contact Netflix or use social media to express support for a third season.\n\nThe original One Day At A Time premiered in 1975 and starred the late Bonnie Franklin as a divorced single mother raising two daughters in Indianapolis. While the show followed a familiar sitcom road map, complete with a goofy neighbor (Schneider, the building's superintendent), it was groundbreaking for its time. The show tackled topics like divorce, teen suicide, premarital sex and the role of women in the workplace.\n\nThe reboot of One Day At A Time features the striving Cuban-American Alvarez family in Los Angeles. Like the original, the lead is a single mom (Justina Machado), the family is working class, and the Schneider character is reprised too. It also features legendary actress Rita Moreno as the family's irrepressible abuela (grandmother). This incarnation of the show continues to take on relevant issues, like sexual identity, depression, veterans' issues including PTSD, immigration and bullying.\n\nNBC News was unsuccessful in efforts to contact Netflix regarding the future of the show.\n\nLatino performers and viewers say that One Day At A Time is the rare show where Latinos are depicted as fully-dimensional people. The lead character (Machado) is a military veteran and a nurse.\n\nThe show has been well received; a review from the New York Times praised it as \"a show that radiates delight.\" The Washington Post review called it \"a joy to watch,\" while the Los Angeles Times termed it \"smart, fun\" and \"big-hearted.\" In addition, writers from Latina Magazine to the Hollywood Reporter to New York Magazine have called for the series renewal.\n\nActress Karen Contreras told NBC that the representation and work opportunities offered by One Day At A Time were significant. \"If I were to compare myself to a non-Latino person who has been in the business as long as I have, they typically go on more auditions than I do. For Latinos, the roles available are nowhere near the roles available for other types.\"\n\nContreras cited another Netflix show, Orange Is The New Black, as being very diverse and inclusive - \"except that it is set in a prison.\"\n\nReferring to the types of auditions that Latino performers frequently go on, Contreras said, \"Why do we always have to speak with an accent, or be lower class? Why can't we just be lawyers or journalists or people like the Latinos I know? Why do we have to be seen, so often, as stereotypes?\"\n\nShe added that an authentic depiction of Latinos was especially important given the current political climate. \"A lot of times, it feels like producers can't get past seeing us as drug dealers or maids, so shows like this (One Day) matter.\"\n\nBeyond the issue of how Latinos are portrayed, One Day At A Time is the rare show where Latinos are depicted at all. A recent study by the University of California Los Angeles shows that Latinos are underrepresented across all areas of the entertainment industry.\n\nLatinos account for just 2.7 percent of all top movie roles in 2016, and 5-6 percent of roles on television. These low numbers are reinforced by similar studies from the University of Southern California and San Diego State University.\n\nAna-Christina Ramón, co-author of the UCLA diversity report and director of research and civic engagement for the division of social sciences at UCLA, told NBC in February that Latinos are basically the most under-represented group in the entertainment industry.\n\n\"Latinos are 18 percent of the population, but then when you look at the numbers in film and TV, they are just not there,\" she said. \"When Latinos are portrayed, they are often presented as criminals or immigrants, or in a one-dimensional fashion, so there is no way to counteract stereotypes if people are not interacting with Latinos in real life.\"\n\nIt is highly unusual for any show to have multiple Latino leads, and One Day At A Time showrunner Calderón Kellett has noted on Twitter that her show is diverse both in front of and behind the camera. On March 6th, she tweeted, \"Our (season two) directors were ALL either women, POC (people of color) or BOTH. Our writing staff is 50% female and 50% POC & 20% LGBTQIA+. Our guest cast was 61% female & 50% POC & disabled.\"\n\nFor some performers, the controversy over One Day At A Time's renewal feels familiar.\n\n\"We went through this same type of thing when The George Lopez Show was cancelled by ABC (in 2007),\" said actress Marlene Forte, who has appeared on shows like TNT's Dallas, Superstore, and The Fosters. \"Latinos are always fighting for this one nugget that they throw us, the one show we are represented on, and I am so tired of it. We need to be interwoven throughout TV, just like we are interwoven throughout the fabric of this country.\"\n\nAccording to Forte, One Day At A Time should be renewed, \"because it is well written, well- acted, and shows a Latino family in a positive light. It should not be renewed because it is a 'Latino show;' it should be renewed because it is a quality show. Period.\"\n\nForte believes that one reason that Latinos have not been able to emulate African-Americans seeking parity in the entertainment industry is because Hispanics lack a person with the clout of Oprah Winfrey or Tyler Perry, \"the type of person who can single-handedly get something produced and on the air. We have our superstars, but we are not there yet in that sense. It is a matter of recognition by the industry.\"\n\nYet despite this reality, Forte remains optimistic about the future for shows like One Day At A Time, and for Latino performers in general.\n\n\"We don't live in a box in this country, we are everywhere,\" she said. \"We have to keep striving for excellence, and be optimistic and not give up. We need to be bold and persistent -- because change is coming, and it is just around the corner.\"",

                "body": "Issa Rae and Chelsea Handler at a LinkedIn panel discussion on March 7, 2018. LinkedIn /\n\nAs we celebrate Women's History Month, many of us look to honor the achievements of historical trailblazers who have gone before us -- or even the various women in our life -- but we likely also acknowledge celebrities who have made a difference as well. Ahead of International Women's Day, I made a mental list of acclaimed women I've never met who inspire me, ranging from Gilda Radner to Frida Kahlo to Parkland survivor and activist Emma González. Chelsea Handler, the talk show host, actor, comedian and writer wasn't on the list; nor was the actor, writer, director, producer and \"Insecure\" creator Issa Rae. Until I heard both women speak in person.\n\nLinkedIn hosted a panel featuring both stars in Los Angeles earlier this month. The setting was casual, intimate and focused on one topic: success. Handler and Rae's generous, candid and often hilarious advice delivered to a room packed with eager listeners not only landed them on my list of incredible women to learn from, it gave me ideas I could start acting on right away. Here's a look at some of their most powerful insights that, though aimed at women, can be implemented by anyone at any stage in their career.\n\nWhen setting goals it can be tempting to get very specific about timing, but neither Rae nor Handler find setting end-dates all that useful.\n\n\"When I was like 19, I told myself at 21, I'm about to get an Oscar, but I didn't have a script,\" Rae said to a roar of a laughter. \"But after that I was like, 'I'm just setting myself up for disappointment.' So, I don't like to specifically plan things and say 'this will happen in two years or five years'; but I do like to put things out there because once I say it to myself, it's on my mind.\"\n\nHandler added that she's not a planner in the slightest, and often has no idea what she's even doing the next day. That may be an exaggeration, but Handler swears that she's \"just not goal-oriented in that way. I'm impulsive. I like that I live my life like that and that I don't have big plans.\"\n\nEven pioneering women as widely admired as Handler and Rae deal with impostor syndrome. But they're pretty good at fighting it.\n\n\"Just because you're successful doesn't mean you feel like you belong,\" Handler poignantly remarked. \"Impostor syndrome works both ways: sometimes someone you admire doesn't want to do a project with you and you take it personally like, 'oh maybe I'm not part of this club that I thought I was a part of. Sometimes you feel like 'How the [heck] did I fake this that whole time? What is my talent? What do I have to offer?' And conversely you can also feel like, 'I am proud of myself. I do belong here.' It's about making that narrative more of the latter than the beginning and saying it to yourself out loud.\"\n\nTaking ownership of our achievements rather than attributing our successes to luck is also a powerful tool.\n\n\"I know how hard I work,\" said Rae. \"I have paid certain dues and I know that this is what I want to do, so there is no one that is going to convince me that I don't belong here, or that I am lucky to be here. I have a lot of conversations with myself, and talk to myself a lot and answer to myself. I try to be as positive as I can in convincing myself that I deserve this.\"",

                "body": "Vice President Joe Biden wipes his eyes as President Barack Obama presents him with the Medal of Freedom on January 12, 2017 in Washington.Olivier Douliery / Pool via Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday morning to attack former Vice President Joe Biden, declaring that \"he is weak, both mentally and physically...he doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way...\"\n\nSetting aside the reality of a one-on-one cage match between septuagenarians, what stood out to me was Trump's use of \"weak\" and \"crying.\" It was a stark reminder of how trapped Trump is in within his arcane mindset that the only emotions worth showing -- if you are a \"real man\" -- are bravado and machismo.\n\nI always thought one of the most powerful memories of President Barack Obama's presidency was at the end, when Obama surprised his vice president with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Biden was understandably emotional during this remarkable display of friendship, loyalty and respect. Juxtapose that to the time when Trump launched callous attacks against Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow.\n\nIn one instance, we have Biden feeling free to express his feelings of gratitude. In the other, we have the president of the United States callously trampling on the feelings of the wife of a fallen soldier. Trump might not have cried when speaking with Johnson, but nothing about that interaction was strong.\n\nClearly, Trump thinks crying is inherently weak, and any emotion that isn't anger or aggression isn't an emotion men should show. His obsession with using nicknames like \"little\" or \"crying\" to refer to his detractors further illustrates this central tenant of his existence.\n\nOf course the irony here is that Trump was emotional throughout the campaign trail. But while Biden's emotional moments often seem to spring from a place of empathy, Trump's emotions are mostly grounded in his desire to dominate and belittle. It is a true blind spot for Trump, and one which has been all too apparent during recent presidential moments. (Remember the cue cards Trump carried while meeting with gun-violence victims?)\n\nDoes anybody doubt how a President Joe Biden would have addressed the survivors and students of the mass shooting at Parkland High School? After watching Biden very publicly grieve for the death of his son, does anyone question how Biden would have approached a phone call with a grieving Gold Star widow?\n\nIf Trump's first year in office has taught us anything, it's that voters respond to genuine emotion and authenticity. Biden's humanity, while a target for mockery by Trump (and sometimes others, is probably his greatest asset. And the notion that crying is a demonstration of weakness underscores why Trump has struggled with the (important) role of empathizer-in-chief during times of tragedy.\n\nPresidents must be able to provide all different kinds of leadership. In times of strength, they must stand strong and tall. But they must also be able to model emotional maturity; to show us that we are strongest when we are able to grieve together -- even when tragedy does not touch us directly. It is in these expressions of empathy and shared grief that we truly become united as a nation, bound together by our collective empathy.\n\nToday, we instead are lead by a president who tosses paper towels to the survivors of a devastating Hurricane. He praises the \"very fine people\" on \"both sides\" of a white supremacist march. He refuses to talk about gun control in the wake of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\nOf course, in 2018 it's astounding that we are even talking about gender stereotypes at all. The idea that there is one way that \"real men\" should or shouldn't act has been thoroughly debunked and the consequences so thoroughly detailed. Indeed, such stereotypes informed the attitudes of many of the so-called \"real men\" recently exposed by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements.\n\nWhen a bully picks on our children or siblings, we tell them that bullies lash out when they are confronted by their insecurities and feel threatened. Donald Trump is a bully. He doesn't have the ability to demonstrate empathy or decency and so he makes fun of anyone who dares to express it themselves. Trump sees Biden as a threat not because of what he says, but because of what he can do -- and what Trump knows he cannot.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nYet discussions with Mueller may have suffered a setback after Dowd's comments over the weekend calling for an end to the investigation, coupled with the president's own attacks on the special counsel, according to the two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe president's comments on Twitter and statement by Dowd were broadly seen in legal circles as a potential breach of trust between the two sides.\n\nDowd was unhappy about the addition of diGenova and perceived his addition as eclipsing his role and legal advice, people familiar with the matter said. He had been wary of Trump testifying before Mueller out of concern that he might unintentionally perjure himself.\n\nThe elevated role of diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who has accused the Mueller investigation of bias, and preparations for a possible presidential interview underscore Trump's desire to take a more aggressive approach to investigators and suggest he's moving toward a sit-down with Mueller.\n\nDiGenova is expected to bring at least two new lawyers onto Trump's legal team once he's formally retained, one person familiar with the discussions said.\n\nDiGenova declined to comment for this article.\n\n\"Joe diGenova would perform well by asking aggressive questions and making sure that President Trump is prepared for aggressive questions because he was an aggressive questioner as a U.S. attorney,\" said criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who has spoken out against Mueller's investigation.\n\nAnother top member of Trump's legal team, Ty Cobb, has long been a proponent of taking a transparent and cooperative approach to Mueller. Cobb did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's unclear who on the president's legal team might try to stop him from testifying before Mueller.\n\nTrump has expressed interest in bringing his former personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz back into a larger role, according to people close to his legal team.\n\nKasowitz, who has played an advisory role since being sidelined by Trump last summer, is someone Trump is comfortable with and has supported a less conciliatory approach to the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"The president trusts him personally and professionally,\" one person familiar with the discussions said of Kasowitz.\n\nWhile Kasowitz may have a larger outside role in advising the president, it's not clear he'll become a key player on his defense team. Kasowitz did not respond to a request for comment.",

                "title": "Poll: Workplace equality stalls for women even as perceptions improve",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- In the last two decades, more women have taken on a role as their family's primary breadwinner, and views of working mothers have become dramatically more positive. But when it comes to women's actual experiences with inequality and harassment in the workplace, the more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nA new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that a majority -- 52 percent -- of Americans say that men do not accept and treat women as equals in the workplace, virtually unchanged since the poll asked the same question in 1999.\n\nWomen are particularly pessimistic, with 61 percent saying that their male counterparts fail to treat them as equals, exactly the same share that said the same 19 years ago.\n\nAnd both in June 2000 and now, exactly the same share of women -- 44 percent -- say they have personally experienced discrimination due to gender.\n\nThe stagnancy in how women view their treatment in the workplace comes as more of them have taken on a role as their household's primary wage earner. Nearly half of employed women -- 49 percent -- say that they work primarily because they are their family's main breadwinner, up from 37 percent in 2000. That includes 42 percent of working women with children.\n\n\"While Americans have become less judgmental about working mothers, this is a story about taking one step forward and one step back,\" says Corrie Hunt of Hart Research, which conducted the poll along with Public Opinion Strategies. \"As Americans, we've become more willing to say the right things about women in the workplace, but we haven't put the supports in place to back it up. Our words have not yet been put into actions.\"\n\nPerceptions of working women who are also raising children have indeed become far more positive in the last two decades. In 2000, just 46 percent of Americans called it a positive development that more women are working while raising children, while 38 percent called it a negative development. Now? An overwhelming majority, nearly eight-in-ten (78 percent), call it positive, and just 14 percent disagree.\n\n(There is, however, a noticeable partisan difference. While a similar number of men and women -- 77 percent and 79 percent, respectively -- say that the growing number of mothers in the workplace is a positive development, a smaller share -- 61 percent -- of Trump voters agree, compared to 89 percent of Clinton voters. More than quarter -- 27 percent -- of Trump voters call the increasing number of mothers in the workplace a negative development.)\n\nThere is also a lingering partisan difference in views of how women overall are accepted in the workplace. While only 28 percent of Democrats say that women are treated as equals in the workplace and 68 percent disagree, Republicans say that women are treated equally by almost a 20 point margin. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans -- 58 percent -- say women are treated as equals by their male counterparts, while 36 percent disagree.\n\nAnd there's a also notable gender gap when it comes to ways that women experience workplace inequality. Majorities of employed men don't believe that there's a significant gap in how women are paid, promoted and valued at their workplaces, while employed women are a bit more divided. Only about one in seven men say male workers get promoted more readily than women and get paid more for doing the same work, while about one in three women say the same.\n\nSimilar to an October 2017 NBC/WSJ poll, about half of working women -- 49 percent -- say they have personally received an unwelcome sexual advance or other kind of sexual harassment at work.\n\nMany workplaces are trying to address the issue, although the poll also finds that few Americans say they're making personal changes. Overall, about half of Americans -- 48 percent -- say that the #metoo movement has increased discussion about what's appropriate in their workplace, although only 18 percent say they've personally changed their behavior as a result of the increased attention to harassment.\n\nWhile there has been some discussion of a backlash against the #metoo movement, a majority of Americans - 58 percent - say that the problem of sexual harassment is being appropriately addressed, virtually unchanged since the end of last year. But the 36 percent who say the response to sexual harassment has gone too far includes more than half of Trump voters (56 percent).\n\nAmericans also have grown even more convinced that the movement to address sexual harassment in the workplace has changed attitudes about the issue in the long run. Two-thirds (67 percent) say the changes will be long-term, up from 60 percent in December.",

It was the biggest point decline since Feb. 8, when it fell by more than 1,000 points.\n\nThe heavy selling on Wall Street came as investors were already rattled by the continued weakness in shares of Facebook, which has been dealing with public outcry and government inquiry into how a data firm associated with President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign acquired the user data of 50 million people.\n\nThere are also nagging concerns about how rising interest rates will affect an economy that rebounded from the recession under President Barack Obama and continues to grow under Trump.\n\nTrump set off the selling spree by signing a presidential memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of imports from China.\n\nUnder the terms of the memorandum, Trump will begin targeting the Chinese imports only after a consultation period.\n\nNevertheless, the Chinese vowed to defend themselves and respond in kind if necessary.\n\nPeter Donisanu, an investment strategy analyst for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told the Associated Press the risk of a trade war is low because the Trump administration is targeting goods that aren't central to China's economy. That could change if it puts tariffs on electronics or appliances.\n\n\"If the Trump administration really wanted to hurt China and start a trade war, then they would go after those larger sectors,\" he said.\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia. In a tweet, Rudd warned of the consequences of Trump's economic plans.\n\n\"And so the trade war begins,\" he tweeted. \"Easy to start. Hard to stop. Fasten your seat belts folks.\"",

It was an accidental discovery, which augmented the symbiotic relationship with bacteria that we evolved with over hundreds of years,\" explains Vincent Pedre, MD., board-certified internist, clinical instructor in medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and author of \"Happy Gut: The Cleansing Program to Help You Lose Weight, Gain Energy and Eliminate Pain.\"\n\nThe \"good\" bacteria some foods acquire during fermentation may potentially have a positive impact on your overall health while keeping \"bad\" bacteria at bay. \"Fermented foods can produce compounds that prevent and destroy the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut, assist in the production of neurotransmitters, acetylcholine (a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells) and serotonin (a feel-good chemical produced by nerve cells in your gut), aids in the production of stomach acid, boosts your immune system and improves your mood,\" says Sandra Allonen, MEd, RD, LDN, outpatient ambulatory dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA.\n\n\"Basically, the gut is the foundation of health upon which every organ in your body is dependent, including your brain,\" Pedre explains. \"If you can't absorb nutrients properly, then your body can't heal. If the gut is so permeable, as in leaky gut syndrome, this has been associated with whole body inflammation, increased risk for metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, obesity, dementia and diabetes. Food allergies and sensitivities may be seen on the surface as skin issues, like hives, eczema, and dermatitis, but also internally as migraines, allergies, and asthma. Thus, the gut is strongly connected to every organ system, including the brain, and is a major player in the evolution of systemic, chronic disease,\" he explains.\n\nPedre says fermented foods produce vitamins B12 and K2, which impacts the nervous system to the cardiovascular system to the bones; helping the body to eliminate toxins, fending off harmful bacteria, yeast, and parasites, adding what he calls \"friendly flora\" to the gut lining -- even boosting the immune system.\n\n\"Seventy percent of the immune system exists all along the digestive tract,\" Pedre explains. \"Favorable bacteria has a regulatory effect on the immune system, keeping inflammation down and promoting cells that control the immune response.\"\n\nRising awareness of gut health has driven the sale of probiotics (and related fermented drinks like kombucha) into big business. An article that questions the efficacy of probiotics in Scientific American cites statistics from San Francisco-based business consulting firm Grand View Research, estimating the global probiotics market exceeded $35 billion in 2015 and that it will reach $66 billion by 2024.\n\nBut probiotic supplements don't have plant fibers that contribute to a healthier gut microbiome, says Pedre. So, if you'd rather get your probiotics through fermented foods, where do you start?\n\nKeep an eye out for fermented foods that require refrigeration -- Allonen says most fermented foods in supermarket jars or cans have been pasteurized and cooked at high heat, killing any friendly bacteria. She also recommends introducing fermented foods into your diet gradually -- they can be problematic if you have yeast overgrowth, like candida. \"In this case, eating fermented foods may cause headaches, malaise, fatigue, muscle aches and sometimes even low-grade fevers,\" warns Pedre.\n\nReady to give fermented foods a try? Here are four to add to your diet:\n\nPedre recommends homemade kefir as a solid source of good bacteria. \"Homemade kefir can achieve probiotic concentrations in the trillions. This can be very beneficial for chronic gut issues of all types, including colitis.\" Be super careful though -- Allonen warns homemade fermented food that isn't prepared or handled properly can lead to food poisoning. If you aren't industrious, seek out plain yogurts and kefirs in the supermarket with live, active cultures and without added sugars or artificial flavors.\n\nTraced back to ancient times, a tablespoon of sauerkraut, or preserved cabbage, is a great way to take in some good bacteria, says Pedre. However, as this study and Pedre warns, fermentation can increase its histamine content, so those who are histamine sensitive may have a negative reaction to them, like allergies, skin rashes -- even hives. \"You know if you're histamine-sensitive if you tend to flush when you drink a glass of wine,\" says Pedre.\n\nThis tasty concoction of fermented vegetables and seasonings is the cornerstone of Korean cuisine. It's also full of fiber, live cultures and probiotics to keep your gut in check. Try it as a condiment with meat and vegetables in a lettuce wrap or taco, in scrambled eggs or in a salad or rice bowl.\n\nThis traditional Indonesian food made from soaked and cooked soybeans gets moldy during fermentation, infusing it with nutrients. This vegetarian staple can be used in place of meat in salads, soups, stews and more.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nIt looks like a tiny little alien, with its elongated head and oval eyeholes.\n\nThe mummified skeleton found in Chile's Atacama desert has been the source of many an alien-conspiracy theory, despite many studies showing the poor thing was human.\n\nNow, genetic research shows the six-inch-long skeleton belonged to a human fetus that had multiple genetic defects. They may have been caused by nitrate mining, the researchers said.\n\nAnd the researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, San Francisco say their analysis of the little skeleton could help living people here on Earth, because it's pointed them to a batch of damaging genetic mutations that doctors did not know about before.\n\nThe skeleton puzzled researchers and excited conspiracy theorists when it was found in 2003 because it was so strange. Tiny and deformed, it seemed human-like but was missing two of 12 ribs and had features that made it look adult-like, despite its very small size.\n\nDoctors soon identified it as human and possibly the remains of a miscarried fetus, but some of the deformities defied analysis -- further feeding suspicions of some kind of cover-up.\n\nGarry Nolan of Stanford University decided to do a deep dive into the DNA of the skeleton, which was only about 40 years old and well preserved from having been mummified in the super-dry Atacama.\n\n\"You can't look at this specimen and not think it's interesting; it's quite dramatic,\" Nolan said in a statement.\n\nThe analysis turned up many different mutations.\n\n\"In the Ata specimen, we have identified known mutations in genes associated with disease such as cranioectodermal dysplasia and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, which each produce (physical effects) similar to that observed in the Ata specimen,\" they wrote in their report, published in the journal Genome Research.\n\nFor instance, patients with cranioectodermal dysplasia can have elongated skulls with prominent ridges.\n\nMutations in several genes appear to have caused development of a club-shaped leg bone -- the femur -- they said, while other mutations led to a small body length, and four other mutations caused deformities in the arm bones.\n\nThe baby also appears to have had a premature aging disease that gave the bones features that made them appear to belong to a six-year-old child instead of a six-month fetus.\n\n\"The diseases identified were mostly associated to bone disorders, including scoliosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a disease of the joints and connective tissue), and musculoskeletal abnormalities,\" they added.\n\nThere were other genetic defects that would have killed any newborn, including one that would have made it impossible to breathe normally.\n\n\"Given the size of the specimen and the severity of the mutations described above, it seems likely the specimen was a preterm birth,\" Nolan's team wrote.\n\n\"Although we can only speculate as to the cause for multiple mutations in Ata's genome, the specimen was found in La Noria, one of the Atacama Desert's many abandoned nitrate mining towns, which suggests a possible role for prenatal nitrate exposure leading to DNA damage.\"\n\nHigh doses of nitrates can cause birth defects.\n\nAtul Butte of UCSF said the research was interesting but also offers an important lesson about checking out all the possibilities.\n\n\"For me, what really came of this study was the idea that we shouldn't stop investigating when we find one gene that might explain a symptom. It could be multiple things going wrong, and it's worth getting a full explanation, especially as we head closer and closer to gene therapy,\" Butte said in a statement.\n\n\"We could presumably one day fix some of these disorders, and we're going to want to make sure that if there's one mutation, we know that -- but if there's more than one, we know that too.\"",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe full classified report will now go to the nation's intelligence agencies so that the most sensitive information can be redacted before public release, likely next month.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, who has led the Russia probe since last April, said the release of the committee's findings and recommendations helps finally deliver \"answers to the questions the American people have been asking for over a year.\"\n\nConaway told NBC News that the committee would, however, continue its oversight work including with ongoing Russian malign activities.\n\n\"Our responsibility is to see what Putin is doing, what anybody might be doing. That just never ceases,\" he said.\n\nWhile the full, 250-page report will first be scrubbed by intelligence agencies, the committee did make public a summary of 44 findings. They ranged from the noncontroversial -- that Russia did indeed conduct cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions in the 2016 campaign and that Russian state actors and their intermediaries disseminated stolen communications from U.S. political organizations -- to some of the most bitterly contested, starting with the GOP's determination that there was no evidence of collusion.\n\nThe report faults the Obama administration for not doing enough to warn the public about Russian interference attempts and for an insufficient response, while also suggesting that officials leaked classified information about Russia's activities to undermine Trump before he assumed office.\n\nIn one case, the report appears to lend credence to reports that Russian officials attempted to establish a back channel to communicate directly with the Trump transition team. Those efforts, the report finds, \"suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign.\"\n\nThe Russia probe has led one of Congress's historically most bipartisan entities to a nearly irreversible divide. At one point during the contentious meeting Thursday, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., told NBC News he began making clucking noises to underscore what he said was the Republicans' lack of courage, warning his colleagues that the entire chapter could ultimately stain their legacies.\n\n\"I grant that's not professional,\" he said.\n\nSchiff noted that Republicans took the unusual step of making Thursday's meeting a closed session, meaning that a transcript of the proceedings would not be made public, as has been past practice.\n\n\"I think they're embarrassed about the shoddy nature of the work that they did and the indefensible nature of their arguments against holding Steve Bannon in contempt or subpoenaing certain records or witnesses,\" he said.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday passed a $1.3 trillion government spending deal reached a day earlier, as the Friday night deadline approached.\n\nHouse lawmakers approved the bill in a 256-167 vote, only hours after the legislation was formally released. The Senate could vote on the measure as early as Thursday, barring potential delays.\n\nLast month, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., caused the government to shut down as he filibustered the short-term spending bill under consideration at the time. On Thursday morning, he tweeted a photo of himself holding up the bill, and said: \"Well here it is, all 2,232 budget-busting pages. The House already started votes on it. The Senate is expected to soon. No one has read it. Congress is broken. ...\"\n\nRepublicans won't be able to pass the measure without some Democratic votes in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to end debate and advance the bill. Republicans currently have 51 senators, while Democrats have 49.\n\nThe release of the measure on Wednesday came after a days-long impasse over issues involving border security, an infrastructure project and gun-related provisions.\n\nThe bill includes a compromise on one of the president's top priorities: a new border wall. Instead of allocating all of the wall funds Trump had sought, the measure was slated to provide roughly $1.6 billion for physical barriers and technology along the U.S.-Mexico border. The White House had been pushing for $25 billion over a three-year period. The $1.6 billion amount only included $641 million for 33 miles of new border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley, not a concrete wall.\n\nThis deal does not address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program -- as Democrats had pressed for -- which the Trump administration had announced last September would end, tasking Congress with coming up with a legislative solution.\n\nThe measure provides a backdoor for construction to begin on the Gateway Project, a new rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, by making some of the federal funding that supporters wanted available through money appropriated for Amtrak and other accounts. As much as $541 million in funding would be available for the project this year, a Democratic aide said, with an extra $2.9 billion in grants also being made available. Trump had quietly threatened to veto the bill if it contained funding for Gateway, but Republican lawmakers who represent districts in the region had lobbied him to support the effort.\n\nIn the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida last month, the omnibus also wraps in provisions to improve state compliance with the national background check system for firearm purchases as well as funding for school safety programs.\n\nAmong the items that were excluded from the bill are an extension of Obamacare cost-sharing payments, legislation regarding sexual harassment reporting on Capitol Hill and legislation to protect Robert Mueller's position as special counsel overseeing the federal investigation into allegations the Trump campaign might have colluded with Russians seeking to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",

I'd like to do it as soon as possible,\" he said then, adding once more \"there has been no collusion whatsoever.

                "title": "Cynthia Nixon's political debut puts gay rights in spotlight",
                "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. -- In her first appearance as a New York gubernatorial candidate, \"Sex and the City\" star Cynthia Nixon hammered her Democratic opponent Gov. Andrew Cuomo on the crumbling subway, the \"cesspool\" of corruption in state government and inequality across the state. But she couldn't escape what she didn't mention in her speech, her sexual orientation.\n\nNixon, who if she wins would become the state's first openly LGBTQ governor, was asked by reporters about a comment made by former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a gay Cuomo supporter who called Nixon an \"unqualified lesbian.\"\n\n\"My being a lesbian or her being a lesbian I think has nothing to do with why we're running for office,\" Nixon told the scrum on her way out of an appearance this week in Brooklyn.\n\n\"I think it's time for an outsider,\" she said. \"I think it is time, not just in New York state but all over this country, to hear from the voices of real people who understand that our government ... is in the clutches of millionaires, billionaires and corporations.\"\n\nThe dustup over Quinn's remark, for which she later apologized, highlighted what could become a reality of Nixon's campaign leading to a September primary against the two-term incumbent Cuomo: Whether she likes it or not, Nixon will be forced to confront the issue of her sexuality and stand on gay rights.\n\nThat's especially true against a governor who has long gotten strong support in the gay community for his staunch fight for legislation in 2011 that allowed same-sex couples in the state to marry.\n\nJust last month, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, the Human Rights Campaign, endorsed Cuomo for re-election and also honored Nixon with a Visibility Award for using \"her talent and public platform to speak out for equality in this country and around the globe.\"\n\nFor now, Nixon's entry into the race this week hasn't appeared to shake Cuomo's support. Most major gay rights advocates and groups, both nationally and in New York, say they are either sticking with Cuomo or staying neutral, noting that LGBTQ issues are important but not the only factor to consider.\n\n\"Just because a candidate like Cynthia is LGBT, that doesn't mean that's just what she's running for,\" said Sean Meloy, political director for the Victory Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that works to get lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people elected to government offices but has not yet jumped into this race. \"I don't think people look at LGBT candidates purely as a LGBT candidate.\"\n\nNixon underscored that herself this week in her two-minute campaign announcement video on Twitter, mentioning such issues as crumbling infrastructure, income inequality and sagging upstate economies, but not a word about gay rights.\n\nBy Wednesday, she appeared to embrace the \"unqualified lesbian\" dig, going on Twitter to announce a campaign event at the Stonewall Inn, birthplace of the gay rights movement.\n\n\"Calling all qualified and unqualified lesbians and everyone who wants funded schools, affordable housing & working subways,\" she wrote.\n\nThe 51-year-old New York native and Grammy, Emmy and Tony winner has never held public office, but as an activist she has lobbied extensively for better education funding and advocated for gay rights.\n\nNixon, who had two children with longtime partner Danny Mozes, came out in 2004. Eight years later, she married Christine Marinoni, who worked for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as a special adviser for community partnerships in the city's education department. Nixon and Marinoni have a young son.\n\nNixon received some backlash in 2012 when she told The New York Times Magazine that \"homosexuality can be a choice,\" adding, \"I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me.\"\n\nAfter some gay activists complained that Nixon's remarks could be used to deny a biological basis for homosexuality, she told The Advocate magazine, an LGBTQ publication, that she's technically bisexual, and not by choice.\n\nFor his part, the 60-year-old Cuomo is a career politician with an extensive record of championing gay rights. In addition to legalization of same-sex marriages, Cuomo ordered state authorities to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, issued an executive order prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage based on gender identity and barred state mental health facilities from offering conversion therapy.\n\nCuomo \"has the best record of accomplishment on gay rights of any elected official in America,\" said Richard Socarides, a former Clinton White House adviser on LGBTQ issues. \"He's a true progressive and he will be hard to beat.\"\n\nHuman Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin called Cuomo \"a national champion for the LGBTQ community, with a proven track record of increasing much-needed protections and advancing equality for all New Yorkers.\"\n\nStill, Cuomo does have some vulnerabilities. Some in the LGBTQ community think he was late on some of its issues, noting New York was the seventh state to allow people of the same sex to legally marry, seven years after Massachusetts became the first and six years after Connecticut became the second.\n\n\"Nixon can make the case, did you lead the charge? Can we count on you to be a leader?\" said Fordham political scientist Christine Greer.\n\nCuomo made his first public comments about Nixon at a news conference Wednesday on the nor'easter. When asked about her, Cuomo responded: \"We're in the political silly season now. I've been here before. We're in a democracy, anybody can run. Anybody can say whatever they want to say.\"",

                "body": "LONDON -- Russia on Thursday condemned a remark by Britain's foreign minister as \"disgusting\" for saying President Vladimir Putin will try to use this summer's World Cup soccer tournament in Russia to burnish his country's image the way Hitler did when Germany hosted the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\n\n\"It's an utterly disgusting statement which is unworthy of a foreign minister, of any country,\" President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday. \"It's insulting and unacceptable.\"\n\nThe escalating fight between Moscow and London, which follows the poisoning of Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent, has diplomatic implications for the United States. Washington has already been the target of official Russian snark over the issue.\n\nSkripal and daughter, Yulia, are in critical condition after they collapsed on a bench in Salisbury, southwest England, on March 4.\n\nBritain blames Russia for the attack -- the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War II -- and has expelled 23 of its diplomats. Russia denies the accusations, and has taken retaliatory steps.\n\nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert tweeted Wednesday that \"logic and evidence\" show that Russia was behind the poisoning and called Moscow's denials \"absurd.\"\n\nRussia's embassy in the United States responded in a public Facebook post by accusing Nauert of \"incompetent reasoning.\"",

                "title": "Trump seeks new China tariffs, as trade war worries mount",
                "body": "Fear of a trade war drove markets down Thursday morning, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling by more than 400 points. Boeing and Caterpillar saw some of the biggest declines, reflecting fears by major American companies that new sanctions would affect economic growth and limit global expansion.\n\n\"The goal here is to get China to fairly treat U.S. companies the way we treat Chinese companies that are in our market,\" another official, taking questions from reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. The administration hopes that the tariffs ensure \"we are working and trade on a level playing field,\" this person said. How long the tariffs last, the official said, \"rests with\" China and the steps they take to correct unfair trade practices.\n\nThis latest round of tariffs follows controversial trade penalties leveled by Trump this month on steel and aluminum imports. That announcement was marked by the administration as a promise made and kept by the president -- but it lost him his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who was opposed to the tariffs and resigned in the midst of their announcement. Trump has hinted that Cohn could come back to the administration at some point.\n\nTo Trump, his willingness to take action has driven more trading partners to the negotiating table. \"Many countries are calling to negotiate better trade deals because they don't want to pay steel and aluminum tariffs,\" the president said.\n\nLighthizer told a Senate committee Thursday the president had decided that the E.U., Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea will be exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nThough the president said Thursday that there were \"a lot of different ways of counting\" the U.S.-China trade deficit, trade deficits are -- by definition -- calculated by subtracting exports from imports.\n\nAccording to federal data, China exported $505 billion in goods last year to the U.S. while the U.S. exported $130 billion in goods to China during the same time period. That puts the Chinese trade deficit at $375 billion in 2017, not $504 billion as Trump said it was by one measure. If the U.S. services surplus with China were included in those calculations, the trade deficit falls to $337 billion.\n\nWhile Trump took a hard line on Chinese economic practices during the 2016 campaign, his rhetoric as president has warmed toward the country. Trump has enjoyed a warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, applauding him for taking an increased role in the North Korea crisis and steering away from criticisms of China for currency manipulation and unfair trade practices.\n\nHe highlighted that \"great relationship\" Thursday as he announced the tariffs, predicting that ongoing negotiations will likely yield results for the U.S. and that, until then, Section 301 actions would begin to protect American interests.\n\nIn Beijing last year, Trump even said he didn't \"blame\" China for taking advantage of the U.S. on trade.\n\n\"After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?\" Trump said then. \"I give China great credit.\"\n\nBut Thursday's trade actions come more in line with Trump's tough talk from the campaign days, when he would rile crowds with vows to bring China into a more balanced trade relationship with the United States.\n\nNavarro alluded to decades of U.S.-Chinese trade policy that included talk, but little action. \"Talk is not cheap,\" he said. \"It's been very expensive to the American people.\" Asked about the impact on consumers, a senior administration official guessed that there would be \"minimal effects on the consumer.\"\n\nSome experts, however, think these tariffs could come at the cost of American buyers.\n\nDaniel Ikenson of the Cato Institute said the trade measures are \"likely to raise production costs for U.S. businesses, diminish U.S. productivity, squeeze real household incomes, reduce the revenues of U.S. farmers and other export-dependent industries targeted by Chinese retaliation, exacerbate tensions with China and other countries adversely affected by the restrictions, and hasten the demise of the rules-based trading system.\"",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nClifford said in a lawsuit filed earlier this month that she had an \"intimate\" relationship with President Donald Trump in 2006 and 2007, and she is now locked in a legal battle over whether she can publicly discuss it.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says Trump denies the affair. She also has said that as far as she knows, the president was not aware Cohen paid Clifford. Cohen has said he used his personal funds and was not reimbursed by Trump's company or campaign.\n\nClifford contends that the nondisclosure agreement she filed weeks before the election is invalid because Trump never signed it. Cohen, however, says it's still in force and secretly obtained a temporary restraining order against her from a private arbitrator.\n\nRelated: Stormy Daniels passed a lie detector test about sex with Trump\n\nIn a filing joined by Trump, Cohen had Clifford's lawsuit moved from California state court to federal court. Court papers say their goal is to push the dispute back into private arbitration and collect $20 million in damages from Clifford.\n\nThe legal threats have not silenced Clifford, who gave an interview to \"60 Minutes\" set to air Sunday and has been tweeting up a storm.\n\n\"Technically I didn't sleep with the POTUS 12 years ago,\" she tweeted this week. \"There was no sleeping (hehe) and he was just a goofy reality TV star. But I digress...People DO care that he lied about it, had me bullied, broke laws to cover it up, etc. And PS...I am NOT going anywhere. xoxoxo\"\n\nWhile Trump's team has sought to distance the president and his company from the agreement with Clifford, the letters sent by Avenatti on Thursday highlight ties between them.\n\nThey note that Cohen used his Trump Organization email account to correspond with one of the banks; Cohen has said he uses that account for nearly everything. Avenatti also noted that Trump Organization assistant general counsel Jill Martin initiated an arbitration proceeding, which the company says she did in \"her individual capacity.\"\n\nThe letter to the Trump Organization requests it preserve all records -- including texts, emails, photos, memos and financial statements -- related to the Clifford matter. It also asks for records related to a February exchange \"whereby Mr. Cohen attempted to interfere with Ms. Clifford/Daniels' ability to hire new counsel (i.e. Michael Avenatti).\" Avenatti provided no other details about that.\n\nRelated: Lawyer says ex-Playboy model had relationship with Trump\n\nThe letter to First Republic Bank, where Cohen and a company he created have accounts, seeks the preservation of all data and records related to the $130,000 wire transfer to Clifford, including a suspicious activity report it filed with the Treasury Department. A letter to City National Bank, where the payment was accepted, seeks similar material.\n\n\"You must act immediately to preserve any and all potentially relevant evidence, documents, tangible things and ESI. Failure to do so may subject you to liability,\" Avenatti warned in the letter.\n\nThe Trump Organization, Cohen and the banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letters.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- As hundreds of people stood in line for food and many went hungry during the days and weeks after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Walmart Inc. and local supermarkets threw out tons of spoiled meat, dairy and produce.\n\nEmails and text messages made public Tuesday in a letter sent by the top Democrat on the House oversight committee describe frantic efforts by officials at Walmart and the Puerto Rican government to get fuel for generators to prevent food from going bad.\n\nFrom the Federal Emergency Management Agency came only silence.\n\nWithin a three-hour time span, Walmart officials were able to connect, through email and text messages, with a congressman's office and local Puerto Rican government officials. They passed on their urgent request for help, just two days after the hurricane made landfall.\n\nMeanwhile, the letter states, FEMA remained unresponsive for days.\n\nThe fuel issue is another window into difficulties the agency has faced in responding to Hurricane Maria, along with providing Puerto Ricans with thousands of tarps for the homeless and millions of meals for the hungry.\n\nWalmart ultimately disposed of an unclear amount of perishable foods, and local supermarkets reported that they lost tens of thousands of dollars in perishable foods, according to the letter sent by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Stacey Plaskett, the delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nRELATED: FEMA under scrutiny over botched contract to provide meals for Puerto Rico\n\nTheir letter reiterates a request made to Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., in October for documents from the Department of Homeland Security related to FEMA's preparation for and response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Gowdy's office did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nMaria, which made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, shut down ports, destroyed crops, and disrupted the power grid, leaving supermarkets without electricity or the fuel to run their generators. Hundreds of thousands of people were also left without easy access to food.\n\nTwo days after the hurricane, a senior Walmart official emailed Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., to ask for help keeping food refrigerated in the few stores they had been able to get up and running.\n\n\"The problem is we're running out of generator fuel and need help getting the Governor's approval for me,\" the Walmart official wrote. \"Have you guys been in touch with anyone from FEMA that we can contact to help? We want to keep this food fresh for people.\"\n\nWalmart had opened three facilities to support the public and had plans to bring more on line, but the key to doing this was having power to run the operation and re-establish its supply chain, the Walmart official wrote.\n\nRoughly an hour after that first email, Gutierrez's office forwarded the email to a Puerto Rican government official. And 12 minutes later, the Puerto Rican government official responded: \"FYI I'm sitting with FEMA rep right now so we are taking care of this.\"\n\nWalmart officials sent over a priority list of a dozen of their top stores -- they operated 46 on the island -- needing fuel to keep food from spoiling, in addition to their distribution center and home office.\n\n\"Fuel at this point is becoming a key concern as we are less than 24 hours left in maintaining power in most facilities,\" the Walmart official wrote.\n\nThe message was forwarded by the Puerto Rican government official to a FEMA official 26 minutes later. But by Sunday, two days after initially reaching out, there was still no response from FEMA. The Puerto Rican government official texted Walmart that FEMA had not responded to numerous requests.\n\n\"Did the hospitals get fuel?\" the Walmart official asked.\n\n\"I think so. But I can't be sure. Our communication with FEMA on the specifics of certain things has been less than desired,\" the Puerto Rican government official said.\n\nThe following morning, the two exchanged messages again. The Puerto Rican government official informed Walmart that he had reached out to the island's emergency management agency, which they hoped could help.\n\nRELATED: Still waiting for power: Six months after Hurricane Maria, frustrated Puerto Ricans rally in D.C.\n\n\"Our chief concern right now is with our distribution center,\" the official text messaged back. \"We might have two days worth of fuel left. It is critical that we keep that going in order to preserve our fresh inventory. If that goes down it could take weeks to replenish which would have a big negative impact on the island.\"\n\nA week after the hurricane, still with no reply from FEMA, Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello personally reached out to FEMA to request emergency fuel for grocery stores to maintain perishable food supplies, the letter's timeline states.\n\nA Puerto Rican government official informed FEMA officials in an email that \"because of immediate threat to public health and safety, the Governor asked John Rabin (FEMA's Acting Regional Administrator for Region II) at 8:10 a.m. this morning to have FEMA deliver fuel to all grocery and large retail immediately.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly how much food was lost or whether FEMA ultimately provided the emergency fuel.\n\nResponding to a request for comment, FEMA spokesman Daniel Llargues said in an email Tuesday that the agency is aware of the letter and has consistently worked with the committee and will continue to do so.\n\n\"The protection of life and safety is our first priority in any response, including working closely with the government of Puerto Rico to support the fueling mission for critical infrastructure\" such as hospitals and communications centers, Llargues said.\n\nLlargues said that FEMA has distributed more than 13 million gallons of fuel to date. He did not provide any timeline nor did he confirm the details in the letter.\n\n\"It was tough at the beginning of that all the way through, it was tough, we didn't have power,\" Phillip Keene, a spokesman for Walmart, told The Associated Press. But he added, \"We felt comfortable that people were acting in good faith.\"\n\nKeene said he did not know how much food was thrown out and could not confirm details of the initial scramble for generator fuel. He said nearly all but a handful of stores were able to get back online within a matter of months, relatively quickly given the extent of the damage.\n\nManuel Reyes, the executive vice president of the Puerto Rico Chamber of Marketing, Industry, and Distribution of Food, told The Associated Press that the lack of fuel was a greater problem in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane due to logistics issues.\n\nReyes, whose organization represents grocers, food distributors and food manufacturers on the island, said large quantities of food spoiled because businesses ran out of fuel for their generators and there was no distribution system for delivering more. He said many businesses paid up to four times the real cost of fuel when buying on the black market, sometimes competing with large hotels, housing complexes or department stores.\n\nRELATED: Puerto Rico suspends $133M contract awarded to firm of Trump's failed FEMA nominee\n\n\"Since the beginning we made the local and federal governments aware of this, but as far as we know FEMA did not provide fuel or made trucks available to the private food distribution network,\" Reyes said. \"We believe they did provide some fuel to hospitals. We were forced to establish our own distribution system for our members using retrofitted waste-water trucks in order to keep some stores opened and food from going bad.\"\n\nReyes said that after three to four weeks, gas stations began to normalize and businesses could get fuel easier.\n\n\"But by that time the emergency generators, which are not designed for continuous operation, began failing and we needed new ones or spare parts but few were available,\" Reyes said. \"No help with that either.\"",

Hannah implicates specific people in her decision to commit suicide.\n\nSome mental health experts have raised issues with the series being more harmful than helpful.\n\nThe show is produced by Selena Gomez and based on the best-selling novel by Jay Asher.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nChina warned Thursday it would \"take all necessary measures\" to defend its interests if President Donald Trump imposes trade sanctions.\n\nBeijing was bracing for an announcement from Trump of tariffs of as much as $60 billion on Chinese imports, raising fears that the two countries could be sliding towards a trade war.\n\nThe tariffs will be imposed under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, focusing on Chinese high-tech goods. Trump says Beijing has forced U.S. firms to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there.\n\nWashington is also pressing China to reduce its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion.\n\n\"We are firmly opposed to the U.S. side's unilateralism and trade protectionism,\" China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Thursday, adding that China \"will certainly take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests.\"\n\nEchoing those comments, an editorial in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Thursday warned that \"history has shown the pinpricks of protectionism can ultimately lead to the shots of war somewhere down the line.\"\n\nThroughout his election campaign, Trump talked critically about the U.S. trading partnership with China. But the relationship between the two countries is particularly delicate right now as Washington continues to call on China to do more to thwart the nuclear threat from North Korea.\n\nTrump told Asian leaders last year that he would end \"chronic trade abuses\" that he said have harmed the U.S. \"I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it,\" Trump said at the summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders. \"They did not. But I will.\"\n\nHe Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, told Reuters: \"At the moment, it's very difficult for the two sides to sit down and talk because the Trump administration seems determined to go this way regardless of China's maneuvers.\"",

                "title": "Poll: Robert Mueller remains popular  --  unless you're a Republican",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal, special counsel Robert Mueller is viewed positively by 28 percent of Americans, versus 19 percent who view him negatively (+9) -- which is essentially unchanged from Mueller's 28 percent positive, 21 percent negative score (+7) in January's poll.\n\nBy comparison, Ken Starr's fav/unfav in the Sept. 1998 NBC/WSJ poll -- as the Starr Report was being released in the Monica Lewinsky investigation -- was 25 percent positive, 49 percent negative (-24).\n\nInside the numbers of the current NBC/WSJ poll, Mueller remains popular with Democrats and above water with independents -- but not surprisingly, he's unpopular with Republicans.\n\nSo over time, Mueller has gotten more popular with Democrats, less popular with Republicans, and it will be interesting to see if March's dip with independents continues.\n\nA reminder of the most popular -- and least popular -- figures and institutions in the most recent NBC/WSJ poll:\n\n\"A bipartisan agreement on a $1.3 trillion spending package was reached Wednesday after a days-long impasse over issues involving border security, an infrastructure project and gun-related provisions. The deal would keep the government funded through September and prevent a government shutdown -- if it's passed and signed into law by the Friday night deadline,\" NBC's Rebecca Shabad writes. \"The bill includes a compromise on one of the president's top priorities: a new border wall. Instead of allocating all of the wall funds Trump had sought, it was slated to provide roughly $1.6 billion for physical barriers and technology along the U.S.-Mexico border. The amount only included $641 million for 33 miles of new border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley, not a concrete wall.\"\n\n\"The measure would provide a backdoor for construction to begin on the Gateway Project, a new rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, by making some of the federal funding that supporters wanted available through money appropriated for Amtrak and other accounts... The deal would not cut funding for Planned Parenthood and there are no provisions that defund so-called sanctuary cities, said the Democratic source. The bill also provides for more than $300 million above the Trump administration's request for the FBI's efforts to fight terrorism, violent crime, election fraud and cybercrime, including Russian cyber-attacks in 2018.\"\n\n\"In the $1.3 trillion spending bill, Trump will secure about $1.6 billion in funding for barriers along the border, which White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted as a win but is nonetheless far short of the $25 billion the administration had sought,\" per the Washington Post. \"Democrats were prepared to give Trump the funding he wanted despite their stiff opposition to a wall, but Trump wasn't willing to compromise more on the fate of dreamers, leaving it unlikely either issue will be addressed anytime soon.\"\n\nLast night, Trump tweeted: \"Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn't care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.\"\n\nWell, it's now official in Pennsylvania. Yesterday, Republican Rick Saccone conceded to Democrat Conor Lamb in the PA-18 race. \"This afternoon, I spoke to Mr. Lamb, conceding the race in the Pennsylvania 18th Congressional District and congratulating him on his victory,\" Saccone said in a statement, per NBC's Alex Moe. \"While there are less than 800 votes separating us, the people of the 18th District deserve to have a voice representing them in Congress.\"\n\nGiven Saccone's concession, it's now time to re-up this March 11 tweet from President Trump: \"The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.\"\n\nActually, he's now 0-3 for candidates he's backed and campaigned for in the last three contests -- Luther Strange in the AL SEN runoff, Roy Moore in the AL SEN general and Saccone in PA-18.\n\nIn case you missed them, here were yesterday's midterm developments that we chronicled on our \"Rundown\" blog: The AP called the Democratic primary in IL-6 for scientist Sean Casten, who narrowly defeated Kelly Mazeski... Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant's pick of Cindy Hyde-Smith to fill retiring Sen. Thad Cochran's seat has made things a little messy for the GOP... And Illinois' gubernatorial primary - the Dem and GOP contests - was the most expensive non-presidential primary in history, according to Advertising Analytics.",

The sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time.\n\nAccording to the AP, the charges include illegally funding his campaign, passive corruption, and receiving money from Libyan embezzlement. Sarkozy has repeatedly and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSoon after winning the election, Sarkozy invited Moammar Gadhafi for a state visit to France. But in 2011, the French leader was at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes on Libya that helped rebels topple the leader.\n\nMoammar Gadhafi was killed in violence the engulfed the country in 2011, and now Libya is still split between rival governments in the east and west while ports and beaches are largely in the hands of armed groups.\n\nAfter this military intervention, Seif al-Islam Gadhafi gave an interview to Euronews in March 2011 alleging that Sarkozy had received money from the Libyan government.\n\n\"The first thing we want this clown to do is to give the money back to the Libyan people,\" he said at the time.\n\nAl-Islam again referenced France's involvement in the NATO-led bombing in his WhatsApp messages to Africanews this week.\n\n\"Ex-president Sarkozy is responsible for the chaos, the spread of terrorism and illegal immigration in Libya,\" he said.\n\nSaif al-Islam was Gadhafi's most prominent son and the family's most Westernized face. Although he held no formal position in the regime, he was seen by many as a reformer and the heir to his father's power.\n\nAfter the toppling of his father, he was jailed by rebels for seven years during which time images appeared showing he was missing several fingers. He was freed last year, his whereabouts are unknown, and remains wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity relating to the Libyan uprising in 2011.\n\nSarkozy has faced other campaign-related legal troubles in the past.\n\nIn February 2017, he was ordered to stand trial after being handed preliminary charges for suspected illegal overspending on his failed 2012 re-election campaign. Sarkozy has appealed the decision.\n\nIn 2013, he was cleared of allegations that he illegally took donations from France's richest woman, L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, on the way to his 2007 election victory.",

                "title": "House probe overlooked most Trump-Russia contacts, report claims",
                "body": "Senate report on Russian interference reveals 'sophisticated' attack\n\nAnother key finding, according to CAP's examination: At least 22 high-ranking Trump campaign officials knew about the contacts during the 2016 campaign and the transition.\n\nThe study was conducted by CAP's Moscow Project, a research initiative aimed at documenting Trump's Russia ties.\n\nThe report, provided to NBC News, comes as the committee is due to vote Thursday on its final report and effectively end its investigation. Committee Democrats disagree with its conclusions and have accused Republicans of prematurely shuttering the probe.\n\nBased on news reports, public statements, witness lists and indictments related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, the CAP report documents at least 70 contacts between the Trump team and Russia-linked operatives, from January of 2016 through 2017 as Trump took the oath of office. They include 22 meetings, including Skype calls.\n\nWhile many news organizations, including NBC, have documented the timeline and large volume of contacts between Trump officials and the Russians, the CAP report is particularly comprehensive, making some connections that have not been widely reported and taking an exhaustive view of how many Trump officials were aware of the regular interactions.\n\nAnd, the 12-page study claims, the committee failed to interview key witnesses involved in 60 percent of the cases.\n\nIn addition to Manafort and Flynn, these include George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign foreign policy aide whose boast about Russia having \"political dirt\" on Hillary Clinton sparked an FBI probe; and Anthony Scaramucci, the onetime White House communications director who criticized U.S. sanctions on Russia after a January meeting in Davos, Switzerland with Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin ally and the head of a sanctioned Russian investment fund.\n\nA spokeswoman for Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, who presided over the investigation, said the committee could no longer call Manafort and Flynn after they were charged or pled guilty in the special counsel's investigation.\n\nConaway has said dozens of interviews and a review of intelligence agencies' findings suggests the Russian goal was more to sow confusion and discord than it was to help Trump. That is at odds with the U.S. intelligence community, which said the Kremlin was clearly trying to help Trump.\n\nThe House probe is shuttering as new information is coming to light about Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to Trump's campaign, that could weigh in a collusion investigation.\n\n\"For months we urged the majority to bring in other witnesses from Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign digital media operation, but they were unwilling to do so. We now see the severe consequences of their failure to do so,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee's top Democrat.\n\nAlexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica's CEO, was suspended this week after he was secretly recorded talking about deceptive methods employed by the company, including bribes, blackmail and misinformation campaigns.\n\n\"The American people cannot rely solely on the investigative work of journalists,\" Schiff said in a statement.",

                "title": "A prison could save this rural county in Kentucky",
                "body": "WHITESBURG, Ky. -- If it wasn't for his family's bond to the mountainside where he grew up, Aaron Boggs might have fled by now.\n\nHis home is Letcher County, a rugged and remote part of eastern Kentucky sustained for generations by a coal industry that now hardly exists. He remains here out of a sense of duty, but now the prospect of a big new federal project is giving him hope that the area might have an economic future after all.\n\nThe project would be a prison.\n\nStarving for jobs, the county has asked the federal government to build a penitentiary here, on the site of an abandoned mountaintop strip mine.\n\n\"Having that kind of thing come in, it could symbolize a change in the economy and maybe turn the tide and everything will go back to what it -- halfway, at least -- to what it was when the coal mines were here,\" Boggs, 21, said.\n\nHe works at a restaurant while completing college, and envisions himself commuting to the prison from the converted trailer where he lives with his 19-year-old wife, on land still tended by his grandfather. \"Hopefully, if the prison does go in, I can get a job there and it will be secure and I'll be making enough to provide for us where we don't have to struggle.\"\n\nAround the country, impoverished rural communities have pursued prisons in the hope that they will deliver them from economic hardship. This began three decades ago, when America's rush to imprison coincided with the loss of farms, factories and other traditional sources of work that bolstered rural life. The need hasn't diminished, as rural America still seeks a path out of the Great Recession. But the exchange of land is no longer as promising what it once was.\n\nAs incarceration rates have fallen, and the country re-evaluates whether locking people up is sound criminal justice policy, many states are closing prisons, forcing rural towns that invested their futures in bars and barbed wire to find new uses for the buildings, as well as new economic engines.\n\nLetcher County, with 22,700 people in the southern Appalachian Mountains, appears stuck with no other solution.\n\n\"In much of rural America we get our identity from what we used to do: We used to be miners, farmers, loggers, we used to work at the plant. And as that work goes away, we want to feel like we're part of the American story and we're making a contribution,\" said Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, a nonprofit based in Whitesburg that advocates for rural communities. \"Politicians have just a few arrows in their quiver, and one of them is prisons, which, whether they work or not, they seem like they're a big deal. It's the one thing they give to rural.\"\n\nPart: 1 Prison as Salvation\n\nLetcher County's bid to be the home of America's next federal prison stems from its willingness to try something, anything, to save itself.\n\n\"It is desperate,\" said Jim Ward, the county judge/executive.\n\nWard has laid off or furloughed dozens of employees in the past year as taxes from the coal industry dried up. He has seen many of his constituents lose their homes, jobs and dignity. He talks to parents who see no path for their children to be successful if they remain. He has tried to diversify the local economy, fighting to bring in broadband internet service so that people can work from home. He's helped former coal miners get retrained in other occupations, then watched them leave for jobs elsewhere.\n\nA prison, he believes, might stanch the bleeding.\n\n\"Would it have been my first choice? Absolutely not. But it's here,\" Ward said as he finished a late dinner one December night at his son's Whitesburg restaurant. \"The money has been appropriated, and if it wasn't built in Letcher County, it would have been built somewhere else.\"\n\nThe project, first floated in 2005 and backed by a powerful congressman, calls for a high-security prison and a minimum-security prison camp on 570 acres of land at a cost of $444 million. The money has been approved by the federal Bureau of Prisons and received approval in the latest congressional spending bill, but it isn't clear if the Trump administration is fully committed to it.\n\nWard and other officials pushing the project have argued that, unlike coal, prisons are a good bet because they are \"recession-proof.\"\n\nThat was true for a long time. But perhaps not anymore.\n\nThe number of people behind bars is steadily dropping, a trend that spans 36 states and the federal system. The decline, which began a decade ago, has been driven by a number of factors: a drastic drop in crime, state fiscal crises and a bipartisan acknowledgment of the damage wrought by mass incarceration.\n\nLed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration has steered the government back toward stricter law enforcement and tougher sentencing. But even the Trump administration has questioned the need for another new federal prison.\n\nThat has stirred anxiety in Letcher County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump and has grown to expect that the prison will be built. Employment agencies have advised clients to consider corrections as a career path. Economic development consultants have recommended that local businesses become certified to bid on contracts to provide food and other goods to federal prisons in the area. Owners of land at the proposed site are prepared to sell to the government, although no contracts have been executed.\n\nThere is also small but fierce opposition to the plan, driven largely by concerns over its environmental impact, its contribution to mass incarceration and its potential for \"profiteering\" in Appalachia, as well as doubts about the promised economic benefits. Opponents hope there is still a chance that the project -- which would be the fourth federal prison complex in eastern Kentucky -- is canceled.\n\nCounty officials say the prison is just part of a larger plan that includes marketing the region's natural beauty to tourists, luring tenants to its largely vacant industrial park and exploring the viability of a casino. There was a slight uptick in coal jobs at the end of 2017, and officials see hope in a proposed battery factory in neighboring Pike County. But the prison and its 300 promised jobs is the only significant economic development in Letcher.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine people having hope in a prison, for crying out loud,\" said Joe DePriest, president of the Letcher County Chamber of Commerce. \"But it's more than we have going on right now.\"\n\nAlready, he said, talk of the prison has made things \"a little more positive.\"\n\nPart: 2 'We don't want to leave'\n\nGwen Christon isn't waiting for Letcher County's economy to bottom out.\n\nShe has a plan, and it involves the prison.\n\nChriston owns Isom IGA, a small grocery store she bought in 1998, when the coal business was booming and \"everything was good here.\"\n\nShe is the daughter of a coal miner, and the wife of one -- at least, she used to be. Her husband lost his $80,000-a-year job when a nearby United Coal plant shut down in 2012, at the start of the latest industry downturn. Since then, her annual net sales have dropped from $5.1 million to about $4.4 million -- the result, she says, of customers having less money to spend.\n\n\"And I'm not alone,\" she said. \"Every business has been affected in the same way.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2016, not long after the federal Bureau of Prisons committed to building the prison, Christon attended a series of seminars sponsored by the Kentucky Small Business Development Center to help merchants find ways to benefit from the project. She got certified to bid on federal prison contracts and submitted a winning proposal to provide dairy products to a medical facility in Lexington.\n\nHer profit margin was slim, but she saw an opening and has continued bidding on other jobs. She gets favorable consideration because she's categorized as a woman-owned business, and hopes to get certified as a \"disadvantaged\" small business because of the economic conditions.\n\n\"I just thought that if I'm going to survive, I have to find some way to sell groceries other than the traditional two feet walking in the door,\" Christon said. \"The prison here could be a shot in the arm.\"\n\nBut her confidence has limits. Her 21-year-old son, a college student, wants to move back home after he graduates and open a restaurant. She's not sure he should. \"I just don't know that the opportunities are here for him,\" she said.\n\nThat is what many young people in Letcher County -- including those who would have gone straight to the mines out of high school -- complain about. They describe being torn between staying in the place where they were raised and taking their chances elsewhere. Many endure long commutes to jobs outside the county.\n\n\"We don't want to leave; this is home,\" said Savannah Hall, 20, a college student who works as a bank teller in neighboring Pike County and whose husband is a mechanic. \"Unfortunately, a lot of people have had to leave. We know people who have relocated to different states because there's nothing around here. That's why we hope the prison will come into play, because we need it.\"\n\nBrian Fields, who teaches criminal justice at the Whitesburg campus of Southeast Kentucky Community & Technical College, said a good number of his students depart the county after getting their degrees. Some speak of the prison as a place were they'd like to work.\n\nHe spoke as he drove the back roads of Letcher County, through shallow valleys where generations of families have lived, past silent coal mines and lumber crews stripping hillsides of trees.\n\n\"That's why the prison is so important -- because it's the only shimmer of light we've got,\" Fields said.\n\nPart: 3 The cell-space bargain\n\nFor more than three decades, when the farms and factories failed them, rural Americans could always depend on prisons.\n\nThe prisons gave them jobs, and in return the government got room to lock up more people.\n\nThe bargain worked as the country shifted away from farming, mining and manufacturing and toward the service and information industries. At the same time, the war on drugs began producing waves of people sentenced to long terms behind bars. The government needed new places to put them, and hollowed-out rural communities began to see those prison projects as job-creators.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons gave priority to those communities, asserting that prisons brought new economic activity, from jobs to housing to hospitals.\n\nSince the 1980s, dozens of state and federal prisons have been built in Central Appalachia, many of them in eastern Kentucky. The construction took advantage of man-made plateaus left behind by a form of coal mining called mountaintop removal. The flattened hills sometimes became stores or golf courses, but were perfect for prisons.\n\nTo live by coal is to live with extremes: periods of breakneck growth and deep slumps. But the good times have grown less frequent. The bottom began to fall out about five years ago, with the expansion of natural gas drilling, a cheaper alternative to coal.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan sought to limit carbon emissions and help communities reliant on the industry retrain former miners and nurture small businesses. That transformation has yet to happen, but officials involved in local economic development say that the federal government's investment in creating a \"new economy\" in Appalachia is beginning to bear fruit, in the form of tourism, health care and the arts.\n\nIn Letcher County, the coal industry employed more than 1,500 residents in 2000, and now employs about 119. As the jobs have diminished, so has the rest of the economy. With less expandable income -- mining jobs typically paid $60,000 to $80,000 a year -- many small businesses in Letcher County are suffering, the local government is shrinking and the schools have less money.\n\nLaid-off miners who've remained are unable to find new work. The unemployment rate is consistently higher than that of Kentucky and the rest of the country, but researchers say that doesn't account for many who have stopped seeking work altogether. The median household income is about $29,000, far lower than the state and the nation. Nearly a third of all residents live in poverty. Most of those with steady employment work in hospitals and health clinics, or for the school district, for an oil company, or at grocery stores or restaurants. But those jobs typically don't come close to paying what the coal companies paid.\n\n\"Letcher County has sacrificed substantially to power the American economy with cheap coal and never got a lot for it,\" said Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. \"They got jobs that were decent-paying, but with it they got environmental problems, medical problems, black lung and broken backs. And now even that has dried up. Essentially the country is letting that happen, and not doing anything about it.\"\n\nAdding to the problems are drugs. America's opioid crisis has flourished in eastern Kentucky, where pharmaceutical companies and unscrupulous doctors pushed addictive pain medication on people who didn't need it. Many Letcher County residents complain that a large segment of the population is idle, dependent on drugs and public-assistance checks. Letcher, along with 53 other Kentucky counties, made the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of American communities with the highest risk of a drug-related HIV outbreak. The crisis has also made Kentucky one of the few states where the prison population is rising.\n\nBen Gish, editor of The Mountain Eagle, Letcher County's 110-year-old weekly newspaper, said the prison proposal is part of a much older story of exploitation and poverty, of booms and busts, and of government attempts to help. In 1963, Homer Bigart, a prominent New York Times reporter, came to the area to write about the lives of local residents, and Gish's parents gave him a tour. Bigart wrote a front-page story describing the area's \"grinding poverty,\" \"governmental neglect\" and \"the ravaging of a once-magnificent landscape.\"\n\nThe stories were noticed by President John F. Kennedy, setting in motion events that led his successor, Lyndon Johnson, to initiate the War on Poverty. Billions of dollars flowed into Appalachia to pay for roads, utilities and medical care.\n\nAnd yet much of what Bigart wrote could describe Letcher County today.\n\nAsked about opponents' claim that a federal prison could act as a drag on the economy, Gish replied, \"We don't have an economy to drag down.\"\n\nPart: 4 Mixed messages\n\nThe prison project was born in 2005, when a group of business and community leaders formed the Letcher County Planning Commission, a nongovernmental organization tasked with charting a post-coal future. Someone brought up the idea of a prison. Three nearby counties already had them, thanks in large part to Rep. Hal Rogers, a Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee (and its former chairman) known for his ability to bring federal projects to the district, one of the country's poorest. The group took the idea to Rogers, and the powerful congressman backed it. Soon the prisons bureau took it up as a possibility.\n\nA long planning process followed, and in 2015 the bureau allocated $444 million to build a high-security prison holding 960 men and a minimum-security prison camp for 256 men on 570 acres of land, including the former mining site, about seven miles west of Whitesburg. The bureau said the project would generate short-term economic benefits, in the form of construction jobs, as well as about 300 permanent jobs. That activity, according to the bureau, would \"ripple\" through the local economy in the form of \"increased and ongoing spending for goods and services\" to support the prison.\n\nBy 2015, a lot had changed. Under Obama, the government pursued policies that lowered drug penalties and prosecuted fewer nonviolent offenders, and as a result, the federal prison population began to decline. State governments were making similar moves, and the most aggressive of them were closing prisons. A new perspective on criminal justice policy began to take hold across the country, centered on reversing mass incarceration.\n\nAnd yet the Bureau of Prisons, which has opened seven new prisons in the last decade, remained committed to the Letcher County project, saying the federal system was still over capacity. All that was left before acquiring land and breaking ground was a review of an environmental impact statement, and the bureau's final \"order of decision.\"\n\nThe review lasted into the first year of the Trump administration, which abandoned Obama's approach to federal law enforcement and sought to turn the focus toward tougher prosecutions. It seemed that Letcher County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump, had the ally it needed to see the prison project to completion.\n\nBut when it came time to submit a budget plan, Trump left it out.\n\nHis fiscal year 2018 budget proposal called for a drastic reduction in domestic spending, including the elimination of the Letcher County prison. In a June 2017 House Appropriations Committee hearing, Rogers confronted Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who explained that the decline in federal prison populations made the Letcher County project unnecessary.\n\n\"The Bureau of Prisons just didn't feel that we needed that facility at this time,\" Rosenstein said.\n\nAnother omen came in late January, when the Justice Department ordered the bureau to slash staff and put more inmates into private prisons.\n\nBut Rogers, an old-style Republican who came of age when both parties thrived by delivering federal dollars to home districts, vowed to preserve the $444 million, which remains tied up in negotiations over the 2018 budget. Rogers sees hope in the Trump administration's fiscal year 2019 budget proposal, which does not mention cutting the money.\n\n\"The future prison in Letcher County will help relieve the burden of overcrowding on the system and provide long-term employment for folks in Eastern Kentucky,\" Rogers said in a statement.\n\nThe prisons bureau has continued to move forward on the project. Citing the Trump administration's new \"prosecution priorities,\" the bureau made the case for the new prison in a September 2017 environmental impact statement, saying it expected the overall federal prison population to climb again this year.\n\nOpponents of the project have cited the Trump administration's apparent reluctance as reason to abandon it. They also accuse the prisons bureau of failing to seek other methods to reduce crowding, such as compassionate release of elderly and severely ill inmates.\n\n\"I refuse to have our community's future built on the backs of other people,\" said Elizabeth Sanders, an organizer of the Letcher Governance Project, formed in 2016 to resist the proposal.\n\nShe added, \"At the same time, it's hard, because it's not a win if this doesn't get built.\"\n\nPart: 5 Lingering questions\n\nOpponents also argue that federal prisons don't necessarily help turn local economies around. They point to other eastern Kentucky counties that already host prisons and are still struggling.\n\nBut Elwood Cornett, who heads the Letcher County Planning Commission, said the group has spoken to officials in those counties and were given a positive impression.\n\n\"One told us he'd take another one,\" Cornett said. \"They bring jobs to local people.\"\n\nResearch on that is mixed.\n\nSome studies confirm what the boosters say: Prisons can lift local employment and, because prisoners are counted in the U.S. census as being residents of where they are locked up, deliver more population-based grant money. But other economic researchers have found that local residents are often shut out of the hiring process because they lack the required education or experience, or are too old. Over the long term, studies say, prisons may offer some reprieve from economic downturns, but may not actually offer any lasting improvement in unemployment rates or poverty levels.\n\nJohn Eason, a researcher at Texas A&M University who specializes in prison building in rural America, said he has found that poorer communities are more likely to host such projects, and those that do fare better than those that do not. Poverty rates, unemployment, household incomes and home values all improve in prison towns, he said.\n\nBut a prison isn't enough to pull a community out of economic distress.\n\n\"All of these places are bad off, and if you get a prison you're less bad off,\" Eason said.\n\nLee County, Virginia, just over the state line from Letcher County, is a good example. Lee is nearly identical to Letcher in many ways -- demographics, economy, median income. It, too, has been reliant on coal. And more than a decade ago, it lured a federal prison to town in hopes of putting more people to work.\n\nToday United States Penitentiary Lee is the county's second-biggest employer, behind the school board, and pays some of the highest wages.\n\n\"I would do anything I could to get another federal prison in southwest Virginia,\" said Duane Miller, executive director of the Lenowisco Planning District Commission, which covers several counties, including Lee. \"They've been wonderful to the region, and while there were a lot of questions when it first came, we can say now, 14, 15 years down the road, we'd certainly do it again.\"\n\nBut the prison employs only 378 people. Lee County's unemployment rate remains higher than when the prison arrived in 2002.\n\nDavis, who runs the Center for Rural Strategies, said Letcher County would be better off focusing on developing itself as a place where people would want to live while working from home, or where they can retire. That means broadband internet, good schools and health care, and more restaurants and coffee shops. It has that potential in Whitesburg, which is a stop on the Southern music circuit and is home to Appalshop, which began as a project of the War on Poverty and now runs a community radio station, a performance space and art gallery.\n\nWhile Davis doesn't doubt the prison proponents' intentions, he sees the project as a wasted opportunity.\n\n\"It's a sign of government trying to help, but it's not necessarily an effective strategy,\" Davis said. \"It's a bunch of generals trying to fight the last war, trying to recreate old economies in ways that in the end don't serve the people they're representing.\"\n\nPart: 6 Bigger dreams\n\nAaron Boggs struggles to balance his ambitions with his desire to remain in Letcher County.\n\nJust about all the men in his family have worked the coal mines, and those that still do have chased jobs in other states. In better times, he might have done the same.\n\nHe and his wife work in restaurants and live in the small hillside home where his mother raised him, next door to his grandfather. He's studying at Eastern Kentucky University for a bachelor's in criminal justice, which he expects will help him start a career in law enforcement.\n\nBoggs wants to make enough money to allow his wife to stop working at a fast-food joint, to build a new house on his grandfather's property and to travel every now and then. But he also longs to be part of something better for Letcher County.\n\n\"That's part of the reason I stay here,\" he said. \"Not only to take care of the land after papaw gets too old to work on it, but so I can provide for the economy here.\"\n\nSo he dreams of a federal prison.\n\n\"I think that's the way most people feel,\" he said. \"The prison really would bring something - more hope - back to the people.\"",

                "body": "Bill Murray on the Today Show on March 21, 2018.Nathan Congleton / TODAY\n\nWe are living in interesting times, and people are becoming politically activated who weren't previously.\n\nI was thinking, looking at the kids in Parkland, Florida who have started these anti-gun protests, that it really was the students that began the end of the Vietnam War. It was the students who made all the news, and that noise started, and then the movement wouldn't stop. I think, maybe, this noise that those students in Florida are making -- here, today -- will do something of the same nature.\n\nYou've got to surround a deeply political issue like gun control or a war, to come at it from every single direction. You can't just focus on one thing, or aim for just the one goal.\n\nEnding the Vietnam war was not a simple thing, either: You had to make sure that all our people were safe; we had to make sure that they were as safe that you could be. And, you might remember, people thought it was going to be the end of the world if we lost Vietnam. But that war had to stop.\n\nAnd now, well, Vietnam is now one of the most wonderful places to go in the world. People love going there; they love the people. And we all survived: they survived, we survived. People will survive. If you can just stop shooting at them, they really do pretty well.\n\nIt's the right idea for a human to live in peace, and a peaceful nature is a proper thing. For children to be concerned about going to school, worried about what could happen to them at school, that makes for a horrible moment. It's just a horrible place for us to be at.\n\nThe thing that's so powerful about students is that, when you haven't had your idealism broken yet, you're able to speak from a place that has no confusion, where there is a clear set of values.\n\nBut there are idealists left over the age of 18, I'm sure of it. Idealism is a voice that's inside of you; it's your conscience. That can really deteriorate along the way, depending on the road that you follow, and it can become almost dysfunctional, but it's there. Everyone has it. Sometimes it's just a whisper, but, in some people, it's a shout.\n\nAs told to THINK editor Megan Carpentier, edited and condensed for clarity.",

                "body": "A man walks past a mural in an office on the Facebook campus in Menlo Park, California on June 11, 2014.Jeff Chiu / AP file\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica story has struck a chord because of the company's connection to Trump and their resemblance to cartoon villains -- and there's seemingly no doubt that the company violated Facebook's rules. But Cambridge Analytica's harvesting of more than 50 million Americans' personal information without their knowledge or consent is really just a byproduct of the larger disease.\n\nFacebook -- and countless companies like it -- are in the business of collecting and selling access to everyone's data on a scale that boggles the mind.\n\nFacebook says that it is \"outraged\" over the brewing scandal and that it \"will take whatever steps are required\" to prevent a similar incident from happening again. But why should anyone trust them? Their business model, as well as countless other online companies', is to control and then sell to advertisers microtargeted connections to the most massive collection of personal data in human history, encompassing literally billions of people.\n\nThat it why Facebook -- along with Google, Verizon, and other tech giants -- is at this very moment vigorously trying to stop a California ballot initiative that would go a long way in allowing users to protect themselves from falling prey to the exact kind of unknowing data collection about which Facebook says it is so upset.\n\nThe LA Times reported on Tuesday that Facebook is plowing a million dollars into a political action committee whose goal is to prevent California residents from voting on a measure that would bring much needed transparency to what data tech companies collect and how that data can be used. As the LA Times described it, the proposed ballot measure \"would require companies to disclose what personal information from Californians they collect, buy or share [and] allow many consumers to 'opt out' from those practices.\"\n\nThe reason that the proponents of the ballot initiative feel it's necessary is that Facebook knows everything about you -- more than even your closest friends and family members -- and not just the information that you may choose to post to your personal profile. They know many of the websites you visit, all the sites you are forced to sign into using your Facebook information, the drafts of posts you delete, what music you listen to and where you are at all times of the day when the app is open. And there's no simple way to find out what all they know, with whom they share it or how to change or stop it.\n\nThe sheer volume of information they have on you, as well as your limited ability to stop them from collecting it, is why 89% of all new advertising income is going to Facebook and Google.\n\nTo protect that business model, Facebook in some cases actively attempts prevent users from knowing exactly all the data it has on you and how they gather that data. That's why it took a years-long legal fight in Europe to force them to allow users to download an archive of your profile information. It's why Facebook refuses to disclose how its friend recommending system works, despite the fact that it outs people all the time who would prefer to keep their identity siloed and private. It's partly why Facebook refuses to release all the political ads bought by Russian actors and countless others.\n\nIt's not just about protecting \"trade secrets.\" The more that people understand how Facebook actually works, the less they'll like it. This is why we often have to rely on leaks to the press to understand how Facebook actually works.\n\nThis tension between the need for transparency and maximizing profits has reportedly played out internally at Facebook. Facebook's chief of security, Alex Stamos, will allegedly be leaving the company later this year over disputes with the policy and legal team over transparency around the Russia ads. The New York Times reported that \"The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives.\"\n\nThe organizers of the important California ballot initiative are calling on Facebook to drop its opposition to the measure in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica, but you can bet they that won't. With its massive population, California laws are a bellwether for the rest of the country and, if it passes, it's likely that Facebook would have to comply nationwide, or that other states would soon follow.\n\nFacebook can talk all it wants about how upset they are that its firehose of personal data was misused, but until they provide users the tools to truly control their own data, you can expect something similar to happen again.",

He followed that up with a media blitz, speaking to CNN, Recode, Wired and the New York Times.\n\n\"We let the community down and I feel really bad and I'm sorry about that,\" he told Recode.\n\nFacebook breached user trust with its loose handling of data in the past and was now dealing with the consequences, Zuckerberg conceded in interviews. The company was now ready to regain that trust by limiting what data developers can access and by building a tool to let people know if someone may be collecting data on them, he said.\n\nWith big tech facing increasing calls for regulation, Zuckerberg told CNN he \"is not sure we shouldn't be regulated\" but said \"the question is more, 'what is the right regulation?'\"\n\nHe expressed support for more regulation when it comes to online advertising. Sen. Mark Warner is currently sponsoring a bill that would hold online political advertisements to tougher standards, such as requiring social media companies to maintain public records for election ads and requiring those ads to include the same disclaimers seen in broadcast and print election ads.\n\nWhen asked by Wired whether Facebook data may have gotten into the hands of Russian trolls or other groups that researchers may not yet be aware of, Zuckerberg said he wasn't sure.\n\n\"I can't really say that,\" he said. \"I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit.\"\n\nZuckerberg's media blitz, including his one televised interview, drew some criticism for sounding like a regurgitated version of the message he posted on his Facebook wall on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nZuckerberg has also drawn criticism for not speaking out sooner.\n\nOver the past few days, Facebook has raised questions from regulators over its privacy practices and taken a beating in the stock market. The barrage has caused some privacy activists and Facebook users to call for people to delete their accounts.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nWhich of these three cases present the greatest threat to Trump and his presidency?\n\nThe answer: The first case to get him into discovery, and a deposition, where he would answer questions under oath. If a litigant can depose Trump, they likely will depose Trump. So which one of the three has the best chance? Let's take a look.\n\nHer case is similar to Daniels' in that both are asking a court for a declaration of their rights under certain contracts. But McDougal's legal situation differs from my Daniels' in several aspects.\n\nFirst, at the core of this dispute is not a settlement agreement or a nondisclosure agreement. It's a licensing agreement.\n\nAMI paid McDougal to license her story, much the way a company might pay a recording artist to license a song. The language in the contract is harsh, and unsurprisingly slanted toward AMI, which is run by David Pecker, a friend of the president.\n\nUnder the contract, McDougal grants the rights to any story about any physical relationship she has ever had with \"any then-married man.\" The grant of rights to her story to AMI was complete and exclusive. Importantly, McDougal reserved none of the rights in her own story -- which means her own tale was no longer hers to tell, under the contract.\n\nMcDougal is now asking a state court to declare the AMI contract void from its inception -- or void \"ab initio\" -- for three reasons: (1) there was \"fraud in the execution\" -- she was fraudulently denied knowledge of the essential terms of the contract; (2) the contract was essentially for an illegal corporate contribution, which makes the contract illegal; and (3) it's against public policy.\n\nTo prove fraud in the execution, McDougal will have to show she signed the contract without knowledge or without reasonable opportunity to learn of its essential terms. This allegation is key for another reason: Claims of fraud in the execution may be resolved by the trial court, and not by arbitration.\n\nMcDougal's illegality theory is that the entire transaction was a disguised agreement to make an undisclosed, illegal corporate contribution to the Trump campaign, for the ultimate purpose of influencing the 2016 presidential general election. An illegal contract is void. McDougal will argue that because the arbitration agreement was part of an illegal contract, she may avoid arbitration altogether.\n\nHer lawyer alleges that she and Trump had a 10-month affair that ended in 2007. The White House has denied Trump has any relationship with McDougal.\n\nLike McDougal, the path to legal victory for Daniels lays in avoiding the arbitration clause contained in her agreement.\n\nThe defendants in her lawsuit have removed the case to federal court, but the next maneuver by the Trump defense will be a motion to return the case to arbitration. If the McDougal and Daniels cases are forced into arbitration, there will be no discovery, no jury trial and no depositions under oath.\n\nDaniels claims she had sex with Trump in 2006. The White House has denied that Trump had an affair with her.\n\nShe's in a totally different position. And that's why her case has suddenly overtaken the others as the greatest present threat to the Trump presidency.\n\nZervos is not bound by the strictures of any contract. Her case is not based on a contract but in \"tort\" law. Contract law enforces the intentions of parties to an agreement. Tort law is primarily designed to vindicate social policy, and right civil wrongs committed by one person against another.\n\nZervos alleges that in 2007 Trump kissed her and touched her in a sexual way. Trump has repeatedly denied her claims.\n\nZervos' defamation claim against Trump is that he intentionally published a false statement of fact which injured her. Now that a New York Court has allowed her case to proceed, the next step is discovery, where the parties exchange information, and appear for depositions. These are interviews conducted under oath, where the witness must answer all questions, unless privileged or plainly improper and prejudicial.\n\nAdditionally, because depositions are sworn testimony, the perils of perjury lurk behind every answer to every question.\n\nIf Trump is forced to sit for a deposition, he's in as much peril as if special counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed him to testify before a grand jury. In that sense, the civil cases against him are as perilous as the Russia investigation.",

                "body": "Police fired 20 shots at a man suspected of breaking car windows in Sacramento, California, not discovering until after he was down that man was carrying only a cellphone, according to police video released Wednesday.\n\nThe man, identified as Stephon Clark, 23, the father of two young children, was killed Sunday night as police and Sacramento County sheriff's deputies responded to a 911 call reporting that a man was smashing car windows.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that Clark was shot in the backyard of his grandparents' house, where he'd been staying.\n\nCommunity activists and relatives of Clark have questioned why officers needed to fire 20 shots. In a statement, police said: \"At the time of the shooting, the officers believed the suspect was pointing a firearm at them.\"\n\nIn the three law enforcement videos -- one from each of the two shooting officers' body cameras and one from a sheriff's helicopter that aided them in tracking down the suspect -- officers report several times before they confront the man that they believe he is armed.\n\nAt one point, the helicopter deputy tells officers on the ground that the subject appears to be carrying a \"tool bar\" of some sort.\n\nIn the body camera videos, the two police officers begin running through the neighborhood toward the suspect, shouting at him to stop and show his hands.\n\nEventually, the officers come to the corner of a house where the suspect appears to be trapped by a fence. From around the corner, shielded by the side of the house, they again shout at the man to show his hands.\n\nThree seconds pass before one of the officers yells \"Gun! Gun! Gun!\" and both officers open fire. The 20 gunshots are all fired within about two seconds, according to the videos.\n\nAt no time can the officers be heard identifying themselves as police, but the police department said it hadn't released all of the video it was reviewing. It promised to release the rest of the video soon.\n\nAs backup officers arrive, at least one of the responding officers reports that he thought he saw a weapon.\n\n\"He came up, and then he kind of approached us hands out, and then he fell down,\" one of the officers says. Then, one of them says he saw \"something in his hands -- it looked like a gun from our perspective.\"\n\nFinally: \"He was still pointing when I saw him again,\" one says.\n\nAs officers roll the man over onto his stomach to handcuff him, the only object visible at the scene is a light-colored cellphone.\n\nPolice acknowledged in their statement Wednesday that no weapon was found.\n\nSaquoia Durham, Clark's aunt, told The Sacramento Bee after she viewed the videos on Wednesday that she believed her nephew didn't have to die.\n\n\"As soon as they did the command, they started shooting. They said, 'Put your hands up, gun,' and then they just let loose on my nephew,\" Durham said.\n\n\"They didn't give him a chance to put his hands up or anything, and then when they shot him down, they knew they messed up,\" she said.\n\nNeither officer has been identified.\n\nSacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said that one was a two-year veteran of the force and that the other was a four-year veteran. Both officers, who were immediately placed on one paid administrative leave pending the investigation, had four years' previous experience with other agencies, he said.",

                "body": "The man's complaint seemed straightforward: He had come to the emergency room last June at Harrington Hospital in Southbridge, Massachusetts, for wrist pain that wouldn't quit.\n\nThe 24-year-old patient seemed anxious. But he didn't present any signs of being dangerous -- red flags that nurse Elise Wilson had come to recognize over the course of her four-decade career. She had spent 35 years in the ER, where nurses encounter violence from patients or patients' relatives \"almost on a daily basis,\" she said.\n\nWilson started entering the patient's vital information into a computer in a triage room. When she turned around, he was looming over her with a knife.\n\n\"The first thing he did was punch me in the head,\" Wilson, 66, said.\n\nFrom there, a normal day at work turned into a fight for survival as Wilson got stabbed in her neck, then nearly a dozen times in her arm. With the other arm, Wilson grabbed her nurses' clogs and banged them on the floor to catch other hospital employees' attention and screamed.\n\nNearly 10 months later, Wilson still hasn't recovered from the stabbing and cannot return to work. (The man accused of stabbing her, Conor O'Regan, has schizophrenia, has been deemed unfit for trial and is in a psychiatric facility.)\n\nBut her resolve to protect other health care workers is stronger than ever -- especially after the killing last week of three staff members at a Yountville, California, treatment facility by a troubled veteran.\n\nHealth care workers face an alarmingly high rate of serious workplace violence, which is on average four times more common in health care than in other private industries, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that up to 38 percent of health workers throughout the globe suffer physical violence at some point in their careers. And the American Nurses Association, which represents 3 million nurses in the U.S., reports that 1 in 4 nurses has been assaulted at work.\n\nThere have been high-profile incidents in recent years: the Utah nurse whose rough arrest after she refused to draw an unconscious patient's blood was caught on video; a Boston surgeon who was fatally shot by a patient's son.\n\nBut health care workers say they deal with other violence on a regular basis, like being kicked, pushed, hit, spit on, and verbally abused.\n\n\"We work with people with histories of violence who may be delirious, have dementia, be under the influence of drugs, and we also work very close to them, almost intimately, and often we're alone when we're working with our patients,\" said Seun Ross, the director of nursing practice and work environment at the American Nurses Association. \"I think that all of those aid in the profession's propensity to being exposed by violence.\"\n\nYet despite the frequency with which the incidents happen, there are no federal regulations that protect health care professionals from workplace violence -- only some scattered state laws. While OSHA has offered voluntary guidelines for keeping health care workers safe for more than two decades, they don't require that hospitals or other health care centers implement them.\n\nAdvocates hope to change that. Last week, just two days before 36-year-old veteran Albert Wong slipped into the Pathway Home in Yountville and held three staffers hostage before killing them and then himself, a congressman from California introduced a bill called the Health Care Workplace Violence Prevention Act.\n\nIt calls for OSHA to require health care employers to adopt a comprehensive workplace violence prevention plan.\n\n\"Every hospital needs to have a plan to deal with workplace violence and reduce it,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who introduced the bill. \"You may want to make sure that the tables and lamps are locked down so that people can't throw objects at health care workers, you may want to make sure that there's a safe exit, enough security, that people aren't bringing weapons of any kind into a medical facility. What the bill does is require that hospitals comply with an OSHA standard.\"\n\nThose in the medical profession say that not only are such precautions necessary, but better responses from supervisors and managers in response to violence are needed, too.\n\nOne woman, a 26-year-old nurse from Tennessee who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of job repercussions, recalled a time last year while working in the ER when a patient, frustrated that he wasn't allowed to get out of his bed, bit her so hard on her arm that it left a large bruise. She told management, but nothing happened.\n\n\"They ask if we want to report it, and then we fill out an occurrence report sheet, and then after that, that's really it. I never get a follow-up,\" she said, adding that in other venues, that type of aggression would be unacceptable. \"I can't go to Target and bite somebody over their prices.\"\n\nStill, many in health care are quick to dismiss violence as part of their jobs. Dr. Kayla Behbahani, a chief resident in psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, hopes to change that.\n\nBehbahani has been shoved by a patient. And when she was in her third year of residency, a mentally ill patient in an outpatient clinic became agitated when Behbahani wanted to admit her to the hospital.\n\n\"She told me that the last person who admitted her to the hospital received 57 stitches, and at that point she reached for her cane,\" Behbahani said.\n\nBehbahani was shaken up, but wasn't hurt by the encounter. She's now on a workplace violence prevention committee at her hospital and urges residents to report any threatening behavior.\n\n\"It turns out a lot of health care providers don't report verbal aggression. They only report physical. We're trying to change that behavior,\" she said.\n\nIt's not just mentally ill patients who lash out: According to a 2014 study in the Journal of Emergency Nursing, patients with dementia or Alzheimer's and patients on drugs were the most likely to hurt nurses.\n\nKhanna, the California representative, hopes that his bill will get bipartisan support so there can be a federal standard on de-escalating and preventing violence.\n\nIn Massachusetts, there's pending legislation called \"Elise's Law,\" named after Wilson, the ER nurse who was stabbed. It would require all health care providers to do an assessment of the risk for workplace violence and then require them to develop a plan to prevent it, which could mean increasing security staff or putting metal detectors in parts of the hospital.\n\n\"I don't care who passes the law, so long as something passes,\" Wilson said. \"They need to make it a standard that all states have to follow.\"\n\n\"It's just so risky out there now,\" she added. \"It's not like we're police officers with bulletproof vests.\"",

                "title": "Science-backed reasons to have a pint on St. Patrick's Day",
                "body": "Sometimes there's nothing better than cracking open a cold one after a long day.\n\nWe tend to view beer as a guilty pleasure -- maybe because we associate all those suds with a beer gut and inevitable weight gain. But you'll be happy to hear that, when consumed in moderation (we repeat, moderation), the benefits of a pint of beer go may far beyond helping you wind down after a stressful week.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes \"drinking in moderation,\" anyway? The Dietary Guidelines for Americans defines moderate alcohol consumption as having one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. While research does show there is room for imbibing as part of a balanced, healthy diet, they also advise not to start drinking if you currently abstain.\n\nBut if you do keep a six-pack in the fridge, pop one open and say \"cheers\" to these potential health benefits.\n\nMany experts agree that beer is more like a food than a beverage -- after all, it is referred to as liquid bread. If you've ever sipped a pint of Guinness, you know exactly what they mean. While that does mean you need to be mindful of how many calories you're sipping in each glass, it also means the liquid contains some good-for-you nutrients.\n\nAccording to one study, \"beer contains more protein and B vitamins than wine. The antioxidant content of beer is equivalent to that of wine, but the specific antioxidants are different because the barley and hops used in the production of beer contain flavonoids different from those in the grapes used in the production of wine.\"\n\nCharlie Bamforth, a professor of brewing sciences at the University of California, Davis, also claims that beer trumps wine when it comes to B vitamins, phosphorus, folate and niacin. Beer also has significant protein and some fiber. And it is one of a few significant dietary sources of silicon, which research shows can help prevent osteoporosis. Preliminary research by Bamforth also suggests that beer may contain prebiotics that feed the good bacteria in our gut.\n\nA study published in the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes found that people who drink 3 to 4 times per week were less likely to develop diabetes than those who never drink. And when compared to those who didn't drink beer, men who enjoyed between one and six beers per week had a 21 percent lower risk of diabetes.\n\nWine tends to be the choice on the bar menu associated with a healthy heart. But there's reason to love beer for the same reason. A preliminary study presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2016 followed 80,000 participants for six years and found that moderate drinkers had the slowest decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"good\" cholesterol, levels -- and in turn, a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases. Research also shows that of men who have already suffered a heart attack, those that drank beer moderately were 42 percent less likely to die of heart disease.\n\nMove over milk -- could there be a new bone-building beverage in the fridge? A review published in the International Journal of Endocrinology found that moderate beer consumption increased bone density in men. No, it's not the buzz that's helping those bones grow: it may be the silicon found in your pint, which is an essential mineral for bone formation.\n\nAnother benefit of having silicon on the ingredients list? It helps protect your brain from compounds thought to eventually cause cognitive diseases. Which may be why researchers at Loyola University in Chicago found that moderate beer drinkers are 23 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's and dementia than those who don't drink beer. Another explanation: Beer is shown to raise good cholesterol which improves blood flow to the brain.\n\nAnd ordering a few pints may give you a boost at trivia night. According to one study, people with a slight beer buzz solved puzzles faster than their sober counterparts. In fact, alcohol made subjects almost 30 percent more likely to find the unexpected solution.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology found that beer can keep bacteria from forming -- and growing -- on your teeth. The researchers tested the effects of beer extracts on the bacteria that form biofilm and promote tooth decay and gum disease, and found that even the weakest extract of beer tested blocked the activity of bacteria. Beer was also one of the best extracts for blocking communication between bacteria, which slows their growth. Good old Guinness was the beer they used in testing -- another reason to channel your inner Irishman at the bar.\n\nNext time your spouse asks why you're still at the bar, tell them you're fighting inflammation.\n\nInflammation in the body is the underlying cause behind many diseases, and according to a study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, hops (an essential ingredient in beer) has anti-inflammatory properties. The researchers compared the anti-inflammatory effect of different hops and found that the consumption of hops in beer form interfered with inflammation causing compounds.\n\nA study conducted by a psychologist at the University of Texas found that people who drink moderately live longer than those who don't. But don't use it as a license to binge drink this weekend because heavy alcohol use can negatively impact your health. The jury is still out, but studies suggest that a healthy amount of beer can add years to your life, given that it positively impacts cholesterol levels, lowers your risk of diabetes and strengthens your heart.\n\nRegardless of the reason why, we'll take it as a cue to crack open a cold one tonight.",

Those are the feelings blogger Raluca Loteanu felt towards her husband in the stress-filled, sleepless months after their son was born.\n\n\"I often felt powerless because I had no help, and I felt like I was doing everything alone even though my husband was helping me,\" Loteanu tells NBC News BETTER. \"So I was struggling to find a balance, and it was harder than I imagined before having a baby.\"\n\nThe \"Playful Notes\" blogger says her husband, who works full time as a software engineer, had his own frustrations.\n\n\"He was working all day,\" she says, \"and then in the evenings, he was helping me with the baby. So this left him with almost no spare time for the things he used to do before having the baby.\"\n\nInstead of trying to see things from his perspective, Loteanu acknowledges, she accused him of not helping her. He would get defensive, she recalls, and the two would bicker constantly.\n\n\"I wasn't such a great wife then because I was complaining all the time about how hard it was for me, and I was blaming him for some things that weren't working in our relationship, and I think he started to feel unheard and alone even though we were together.\"\n\nExhausted from all the conflict, Loteanu tried a different approach: \"effective communication.\" Also known as non-violent communication, she says the technique involves resolving frustrations with empathy instead of anger.\n\n\"I started to talk more about my feelings and my needs without making any judgments about him,\" Loteanu says.\n\nFor example, rather than telling her husband \"I'm tired because you never help me,\" she would tell him: \"I feel very tired, I feel very overwhelmed with the changes in our lives and I really need your help. How can you support me in this?'\"\n\nIt's simple: Effective communication involves switching the focus from your partner to yourself, she explains.\n\n\"This made a huge difference for both of us,\" she says.",

                "title": "Istanbul's new $11B airport aims to top Atlanta as the world's busiest",
                "body": "LONDON -- For centuries it has been at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Now Istanbul is making a bid to be a global meeting place with a new $11 billion airport that aims to overtake Atlanta as the world's busiest.\n\nNext month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's jet will be the first to land at the airport -- the latest in a string of high-profile public projects that he hopes will boost an economy weakened by terrorism and a failed coup in 2016 as the country faces a crucial election next year.\n\nCalled simply Istanbul New Airport, the project follows the commission of a 250-mile toll freeway, the opening of a $1.2 billion rail-and-road bridge stretching 1.4 miles across the Bosporus and the $66.5 million landmark Camlica mosque, the largest in Turkey.\n\nAlso planned is a 27-mile canal running parallel to the Bosporus, which Erdogan calls his personal \"dream.\" If built, it will turn the European side of Istanbul into an island.\n\nExperts say Erdogan hopes to secure not just economic growth but also his position as Turkey's most important leader since the modern republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.\n\n\"He loves his big projects, and the airport is perhaps the grandest,\" said Nigel Rendell, a London-based analyst with Medley Global Advisors. \"It allows him to show he is delivering on his promises, right at the time he is trying to extend his powers.\"\n\nThe new hub is on the site of a former forest 22 miles northwest of the city. It will replace the existing chronically congested Ataturk Airport -- the scene of a 2016 terrorist attack that killed 45 people -- when it opens to the public in October.\n\nIt will have the world's largest single terminal building, covering 1.3 million square feet and capable of handling 90 million passengers a year. That number will rise to 150 million when more terminals are added, which could see it leapfrog Los Angeles International, Beijing and even Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson -- which handled 104 million in 2016.\n\nOfficials aim to strengthen Istanbul against rival Middle Eastern mega-hubs such as Dubai and Doha, and help Turkish Airlines -- a partner in the Star Alliance alongside United Airlines -- compete with the so-called ME3 giants -- Emirates, Qatar and Etihad -- for long-haul connecting traffic. It may also attract new services from U.S. carriers, none of whom currently serve Istanbul.\n\nDesigners hope the airport will prove a more popular place to layover than Dubai or Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe duty free and shopping areas cover more than half a million square feet -- bigger than 10 football fields -- and there are 26 miles of baggage belts, capable of handing almost 30,000 bags an hour.\n\n\"Dubai has similar reach in terms of flights, but for much of the year it's too warm to be a comfortable city to walk around,\" said Johann van Rensburg, one of the lead architects of the new terminal. \"In Istanbul there is much more culture and a fantastic climate.\"\n\nHe said the terminal had been designed to make critical points, such as security checkpoints and check-in, less stressful and that passengers would not be forced to walk through stores to get to their gate like they do at many other airports.\n\n\"If you know exactly where you are going, you will be able to head straight there, or if you want to meander through the shops, you can go off to the side,\" van Rensburg said.\n\nMost important, there will be security controls outside of the building as well as between check-in and departures -- a design decision taken after the June 2016 gun-and-bomb assault on Ataturk Airport when attackers targeted the entrance. Security at the new airport will be \"top notch,\" van Rensburg said.\n\nSuch reassurance will be essential for Turkey, which saw tourism slump after the airport attack and a deadly mass shooting in an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Eve 2016. Political instability caused by the July 15, 2016, coup attempt and subsequent crackdown on media freedoms has also spooked visitors and investors.\n\nMinisters believe the new airport will support 225,000 jobs and contribute about $19.5 billion to the economy -- equivalent to 5 percent of the country's gross national product. And if only one in 10 passengers visits Turkey as a tourist, a further $7 billion will flow in.\n\nHowever, despite posting 7 percent growth last year, Turkey's economy has deeper worries.\n\n\"There are still some deep difficulties including high inflation, which is currently running at about 11 percent, and interest rates that were well above target,\" said Rendell, the analyst. \"The country is also very susceptible to exchange rates because it imports a lot of things and the currency had a volatile period last year.\"\n\nAnd while the major infrastructure works have created construction jobs and income, most of it has gone to companies that support or who have donated to Erdogan's dominant conservative Islamic AK Party, Rendell said.\n\nThe airport itself might have a slow start; its distance from the city, almost at the Black Sea, means many passengers will have to rely on a new subway line for which construction began only last year. Airport officials did not respond to questions about whether it would be finished in time for the airport's slated Oct. 18 opening.\n\nNevertheless, Erdogan remains optimistic that his latest project will secure him the 2019 presidential election, after which he will assume sweeping new powers of \"executive presidency\" granted in a narrow and divisive constitutional referendum victory last year.\n\n\"He has already assumed many extra powers under the emergency rules that have been in place since the coup, but it's the executive presidency he really craves,\" Rendell said. \"That would allow him to stay in power five more years and he could have a second term. That's the kind of power that worries people because he's very autocratic. He does pretty much what he wants.\"\n\nErdogan's ceremonial landing at Istanbul New Airport is to take place on Feb. 26, his 64th birthday, prompting speculation that the airport will ultimately be named after him.\n\nIf so, the symbolism would be stark; the old airport is named after Ataturk, the country's founder venerated by moderate Turks for his modern, West-facing secularism. Erdogan's opponents fear he is dismantling Ataturk's legacy by turning Turkey toward traditional Islam, emphasizing its Ottoman past and weakening ties with the U.S. in favor of Russia and Iran.\n\nThey point to the new Bosporus bridge, named in honor of the 15th-century Ottoman Sultan Selim I, often called Selim the Grim due to his hard-nosed rule, overseas conquests and persecution of minorities.\n\nFor his part, Erdogan told a crowd of thousands waving Turkish flags at the bridge's opening: \"When [a] man dies, he leaves behind a monument.\"",

A public relations firm spent $270,000 on behalf of the Saudi government at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. on an undisclosed date, the report said, citing public documents and a USA Today article.\n\nWeissman said he believed that the Saudi effort to curry favor with the Trump administration \"stands out above all.\"\n\nSaid Weissman, \"The Saudis ... have been undertaking a full-fledged effort to seduce Trump and those close to him. In that light, the event at the Trump property looks even worse, and more corrupting.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the government of Malaysia, the American Turkish Council and the Kuwait Embassy also spent money at Trump properties. Trump critics say that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits the president from earning money from foreign governments.\n\nRepublican campaigns spent more than $305,000 at Trump properties last year. Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke's campaign for Senate spent more than $3,000 on lodging and food for its volunteers in the Trump International Hotel in D.C. in February, March and April, according to the report. Clarke ended up dropping out of the Wisconsin Senate race in July, but he has been rumored as a favorite for a future position in the Trump administration.\n\nOther well-known Republican politicians' campaigns spending money at Trump properties included those of Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has feuded with Trump and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, both of California. NBC News previously reported that Rohrabacher has known ties to Russia and that his meeting with Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators.\n\nOther non-political organizations detailed in the report included GEO Group, a for-profit prison company that has benefited from Trump administration policies, and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.\n\nThe day before his inauguration, President-elect Trump resigned from his namesake company and more than 400 affiliated companies, according to a Trump Organization spokesperson. Following a previously announced plan, he transferred control of the companies to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric and a financial officer. Sean Spicer, who was then the White House spokesman, said after the inauguration that Trump had \"gone above and beyond in what he has done to make sure there are no conflicts.\" Trump's defenders have also said that all measures he has taken are voluntary, since conflicts of interest laws do not apply to the president.\n\nIn Public Citizen's report, the group's research director, Alan Zibel, said Trump had not gone far enough to distance himself from his business interests by putting his sons in charge of his company's operations, reshuffling his businesses into a holding company held by a trust he controls himself and opening the Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House before the 2016 election.\n\nThe hotel's opening resulted in the \"highly unusual situation of a president deriving financial benefit from a private business used by entities with business before the U.S. government,\" Zibel said.\n\nAt least a half-dozen parties have filed lawsuits against the Trump International Hotel and other Trump entities, alleging conflicts of interest and patterns of discrimination.\n\nIn one case, filed in late December, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington alleged that Trump's \"business interests are creating countless conflicts of interest, as well as unprecedented influence by foreign governments.\" The case was dismissed in the Southern District of New York in December because of a lack of standing.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- A report released Tuesday by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security found that the majority of convictions for international terrorism brought by U.S. courts since 2001 have been against people born outside of the U.S., bolstering the Trump administration's argument for tougher immigration standards.\n\nThe report found that out of 549 convictions for international terrorism-related charges since Sept. 11, 2001, 254 were not U.S. citizens, 148 received U.S. citizenship through naturalization and 147 were U.S. citizens by birth.\n\nBut testimony from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen paints a more nuanced picture, as do several national security analysts.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Nielsen said the report included people arrested overseas and brought to the U.S. to face trial. A U.S. official estimated the number of those arrests at close to 90, further skewing the numbers toward foreign-born defendants.\n\nKaren Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at the Fordham University School of Law, said the long timeline of the report overshadows the evidence -- and the effects -- of a more recent tactic used by ISIS that has produced U.S.-born attackers. Unlike al Qaeda, which carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, the Islamic State has a decentralized power structure that relies heavily on radicalizing recruits living in Western countries and recruiting lone wolf attackers via social media.\n\n\"I think they are doing everything they can to justify the Muslim ban, and the unfortunate part of this is the backing away from the homegrown terrorist suspect ... and how to prevent it,\" Greenberg said. \"And if you are born in another country and, 20 years later, you become a terrorist, whose fault is that -- the country you were born in or the country you've lived in?\"\n\nGreenberg's research on ISIS cases in the U.S. from March 2013 through the present found that U.S.-born defendants account for 84 out of the 156 cases prosecuted, or more than half.\n\nThe new DOJ/DHS report does not account for attacks inspired by American ideologies, such as white supremacy, because those crimes are not charged as international terrorism.\n\nThe report was commissioned by one of President Donald Trump's executive orders and is being interpreted by Trump's Cabinet members as a clear indication of the need for tougher immigration policies in order to fight terrorism.\n\n\"We want to bring in individuals who love this country, who love its people, who have skills, who speak English and are committed to supporting our values and our way of life,\" said a U.S. official presenting the report on a call with reporters.\n\nThe current immigration system, \"doesn't promote the admission of individuals who are likely to succeed and are likely to assimilate,\" the official said.\n\nTrump's ban on travel to the United States from certain countries deemed to pose a threat was pinned on the argument that tougher immigration standards would prevent terrorism. But critics of the policy say that the ban was racially motivated and argue that it does not account for the many American terrorists who were radicalized while living inside U.S. borders.\n\nIn Congressional testimony in July, Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at The George Washington University, said \"the vast majority\" of so-called homegrown extremists who have been radicalized on U.S. soil are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Hughes called for a more robust program to prevent such radicalization.",

                "body": "The Navy will convene court-martial proceedings against five sailors relating to two deadly ship collisions last year, including the commanding officers of both vessels, a military spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\nFour sailors aboard the USS Fitzgerald, a destroyer which collided with a merchant ship off Japan in June, leaving seven sailors dead, will have court-martial proceedings convened on charges including dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel and negligent homicide, Navy chief of information Capt. Greg Hicks said.\n\nThe four include the commanding officer, two lieutenants and one lieutenant junior grade, the Navy said.\n\nCourt-martial proceedings will also be convened against the commanding officer of the USS John S. McCain, another destroyer which collided with a Liberian tanker off the coast of Singapore in an August crash that left 10 sailors dead, and charges include dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel and negligent homicide, Hicks said. A chief petty officer also had a charge of dereliction of duty preferred, or instigated, against him and it is pending referral to a forum.\n\nFour USS Fitzgerald and four USS McCain crew-members will also face non-judicial punishment, Hicks said.\n\nRelated: Navy ship collisions occurred amid budget woes, sailor fatigue, leaders say\n\nThe decision to convene court-martial proceedings against the sailors comes \"after careful deliberation\" and was announced by Admiral Frank Caldwell, who was assigned to review accountability actions and punishment in the crashes, Hicks said.\n\nThe collisions -- which occurred months apart -- led to the commander of the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, to be relieved of his post. Rear Adm. Charles Williams, the commander of Task Force 70, and Capt. Jeffrey Bennett, the commander of Destroyer Squadron 15, were also relieved of their duties.\n\nThe Navy had already announced punishment for the leadership of the Fitzgerald. The commanding officer, executive officer and senior enlisted officer were all relieved of their responsibilities aboard the ship.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by the crew,\" Admiral William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, said at the time.\n\nRelated: Pacific Fleet commander Swift to retire in wake of deadly crashes\n\nThe command officers of the USS John S. McCain were relieved of duty in October. They were said to have exercised poor \"judgement\" and \"leadership,\" according to a statement from the U.S. Pacific Fleet.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFirst Read is your briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter\n\nWASHINGTON -- In 2016, Donald Trump won Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district by 20 points, 58 percent to 38 percent. And in 2012, Mitt Romney won it by 17 points, 58 percent to 41 percent. But when Democrat Conor Lamb takes on Republican Rick Saccone in tomorrow's special congressional election to fill the PA-18 seat, the race appears to be a pure 50-50 contest.Here are three reasons why the race outside of Pittsburgh is so competitive:\n\n1. The Democrats' enthusiasm advantage: From Kansas and South Carolina to Virginia and Alabama, Democrats -- win or lose -- have overperformed in most of the major races over the past year in the Trump Era.\n\n2. Scandal isn't helping the GOP: The reason there's a PA-18 special election in the first place is due to the resignation of anti-abortion Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., who left his seat after allegedly encouraged his lover to terminate her pregnancy. \"You guys can decide why the stakes are high nationally,\" Lamb said, per NBC's Alex Seitz-Wald. \"I think for our people, they feel very let down by people like Tim Murphy, who were hypocrites.\" And remember, parties that have to defend a seat vacated as a result of scandal typically have a hard time -- see Democrats who lost Anthony Weiner's congressional seat in 2011.\n\n3. Lamb is viewed as the better candidate: Democrat Conor Lamb has outraised and outspent Republican Rick Saccone over the airwaves (although GOP outside groups have more than made up the gap). On the ground, NBC's Seitz-Wald has noticed a lack of energy coming from the Saccone campaign. \"Have never been to a political event quite as low energy as Rick Saccone's 'GOTV Rally' Friday night. No more than 2 dozen volunteers, many from out-of-state, who complained the locals were unenthused,\" he tweeted. And even Republicans have admitted that Lamb is the superior candidate. \"Candidate quality matters, and when one candidate outraises the other 5-to-1, that creates real challenges for outside groups trying to win a race,\" GOP strategist Corry Bliss told Politico.\n\nAdd them all up -- Democratic enthusiasm, GOP scandal and a superior Dem candidate -- and you see why this race is so close, even in Trump Country. By the way, those same three features defined last December's Alabama Senate race, and we saw how that race turned out.\n\nOur initial instinct isn't to hype up a presidential race that's still two years away, but there were several developments that were hard to ignore. First, Trump unveiled his 2020 slogan -- \"Keep America Great!\"\n\nThen, on \"Meet the Press,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said that a Republican needs to primary Trump in 2020.\n\nAnd also on \"Meet\" yesterday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wouldn't answer the question if she would serve a full term if she wins re-election in November.\n\n\"President Donald Trump took the first step toward arming America's teachers on Sunday night, promising Justice Department assistance to help fund firearms training for school personnel,\" NBC's Alex Johnson writes. \"The proposal would also seek to bolster firearm background checks, expand mental health programs and encourage military veterans and retired law enforcement officers to take up careers in education. But it doesn't include a proposal the president floated March 1 to raise the minimum legal age to buy semi-automatic weapons from 18 to 21, an idea the National Rifle Association vigorously opposes.\"\n\nAsked on \"Today\" why Trump has backed away on raising the age limit, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos -- who had a rough interview on \"60 Minutes\" -- responded, \"The plan is really the first step in a more lengthy process. And the proposals the president has put forward really encompass a lot of things that are supported on a broad bipartisan basis.\"\n\nThe New York Times asks the question. \"'The ironies abound,' said Robert S. Litwak, the director of international security studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars and the author of 'Preventing North Korea's Nuclear Breakout.' 'The man who wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" has staked out a position that the Iran deal was the worst one in history,' he added. 'And now he has to show that he can do much better, with a far harder case.'\"\n\n\"[CIA Director Mike] Pompeo acknowledged that Mr. Trump, given his disparagement of the Iran deal reached by the Obama administration, will have to get a better deal out of Mr. Kim. 'I think that's the case,' he told the host, Margaret Brennan, adding that he thought Mr. Trump would be negotiating from a greater position of strength. That is a debatable notion. Mr. Kim has driven the pace of this diplomatic effort so far, and American officials have conceded surprise at his boldness. And if Mr. Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, Mr. Kim may well wonder why he should negotiate with the United States if a subsequent president can simply pull the plug on any agreement.\"\n\nIt was exactly one week ago when former Trump aide Sam Nunberg made those multiple TV appearances, initially saying he would defy special counsel Robert Mueller. And here he was yesterday, telling MSNBC's Alex Witt that he answered all of Mueller's questions.",

                "body": "A couple of years ago, Tom Santone, a 39-year old school teacher from New Jersey, found himself in a place he didn't like: he had joined the \"dad bod\" population. \"Over several years of little activity, I was overweight, and my blood pressure and blood sugars were too high,\" he says. \"My doctor told me that if I lost some weight, I'd live a longer, healthier life.\"\n\nWhile there has been a trend to embrace the dad bod -- a typical middle-aged male physique complete with stomach paunch -- as Santone's physician told him, it's not healthy. Numerous studies, in fact, have revealed that fat centered around the abdominal area greatly increases the odds of cardiovascular mortality. But for many men who juggle fatherhood, career and other commitments, finding the time to transform a dad bod into a fit bod is a huge barrier.\n\nRecognizing this, athletic trainers are designing and rolling out dad bod workouts to help this busy population regain health. That's the goal of Gene Shirokobrod, a Maryland-based physical therapist, gym owner and dad himself. In an effort to figure out the best way to go about it, Shirokobrod decided to \"decondition\" his body, then design and follow a dad bod workout program before offering it to his clientele. \"I realized that I work 10 feet away from the gym area of our facility and even for me, fitting in a workout can sometimes be difficult,\" he says. \"So I spent 14 weeks with no workouts to walk in the shoes of men who have lost fitness, then began moving my way back in as efficient manner as possible.\"",

Ty Trippet, a spokesperson for Bloomberg News, declined to comment.\n\nMeredith has said that the titles for sale may be acquired by a wealthy individual or a philanthropist. One media investor, who did not wish to be named, joked that he would only be interested if the titles were free.\n\nMeredith acquired Time Inc. in November for $1.8 billion in cash with the backing of the Koch brothers, the conservative billionaires who said they would not be involved in the operations but invested $650 million.\n\nNews of the layoffs and the sale came on the same day that ad firm Magna projected print advertising to slide by 18 percent, while digital advertising is expected to increase 14 percent to $97 billion. Time Inc., which was publicly traded before being acquired, has had a hard time reversing widespread declines in its business.\n\nMeredith, which owns one of America's best-selling magazines, Better Homes and Gardens, said in a statement that it planned to realize \"between $400 million and $500 million of cost synergies from the Time acquisition,\" adding that \"200 employees have been notified that their positions have been eliminated.\"\n\nAnother 1,000 positions will be cut over the next 10 months, the company told staff on Wednesday in a company meeting.\n\nSeveral potential buyers have looked at acquiring Time Inc. titles in the past.

He told The New Yorker of his interest last year, though American Media later poured cold water on the idea in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nPecker isn't the only high-profile media executive to have considered making an offer for some of the Time Inc. titles. A group spearheaded by Edgar Bronfman Jr., the former chief executive of Warner Music, got together with the music label's owner, Len Blavatnik, and another media executive, Ynon Kreiz, to look at Time Inc. That, too, failed after the bid was rejected as too low.",

                "body": "LIMA -- Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced he had submitted his resignation to the country's Congress on Wednesday after vote-buying allegations ensnared his center-right government on the eve of an impeachment vote.\n\nThe 79-year-old former Wall Street banker promised an orderly and constitutional transition to power and denied the opposition's allegations that he was corrupt.\n\nIt was unclear whether the opposition-controlled Congress would accept his resignation or move forward with its plan to vote on immediately forcing him from office on Thursday on grounds he is \"morally unfit\" to govern.\n\nThe political drama threatens to thrust the country into a period of political instability just three weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump's scheduled visit to Peru for a regional summit.\n\nWHY HAS KUCZYNSKI OFFERED TO RESIGN?\n\nPresident Pedro Pablo Kuczynski offered his resignation to Peru's congress after videos emerged showing the president's allies discussing state contracts as political payback for an opposition lawmaker who could vote to block his impeachment.\n\nImpeachment proceedings began after documents showed Kuczynski's private consulting firm received $782,000 in payments from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht more than a decade ago. Some of those payments overlap with his years as a government minister.\n\nWhile no one has proven that he committed a crime, proponents for his removal say he should have disclosed the payments, or at the very least, failed to recognize a conflict of interest.\n\nLawmakers fell eight votes short of the 87 required to impeach Kuczynski in December. Another vote on his removal scheduled for Thursday was expected to be similarly tight.\n\nWHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE?\n\nThe president has likened the attempt to remove him to a coup. His main defender is Kenji Fujimori, who led a splinter group of lawmakers that defied his sister Keiko's leadership of the Popular Force party and blocked the first impeachment attempt. The son of former strongman Alberto Fujimori also appears in one of the videos that sparked renewed calls for his resignation.\n\nKuczynski contends he left the reins of the consulting company in the hands of a business partner while he served in government, had no knowledge of the Odebrecht payments and paid taxes on all of his earnings. Odebrecht has confirmed the transactions were not part of the larger bribery investigation currently underway in Peru involving the firm.\n\nIn his resignation announcement, Kuczynski said the videos where his allies are trying to secure the support of a congressman were edited in a \"malicious\" manner to give the impression that they were trying to offer public works projects in exchange for the congressman's support.\n\nWHY HAS KUCZYNSKI OFFERED TO RESIGN?\n\nKuczynski's resignation could throw a wrench into Peru's plans to host President Donald Trump and other regional leaders at next month's Summit of the Americas. If his resignation is approved, power would be transferred to Vice President Martin Vizcarra, who in December said he'd go down with Kuczynski but is now expected to try and fill his shoes.\n\nDuring his 16 months in office, Kuczynski has been outspoken in his criticism of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, lambasting him as a dictator and inviting regional leaders to Peru to apply pressure on the socialist leader. Vizcarra, a relatively unknown former governor, is expected to pursue a more modest agenda focused on building bridges with Keiko Fujimori's party and maintaining Peru's much-vaunted economic stability.\n\nWHAT IS ODEBRECHT ACCUSED OF DOING IN LATIN AMERICA?\n\nIn a 2016 plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department, the construction company admitted to paying nearly $800 million in bribes in a dozen countries -- all but two of which are in Latin America. The bribes were paid to politicians, their campaigns and political parties to secure lucrative public works contracts that stretched into the highest echelons of government.\n\nIn Peru, Odebrecht has acknowledged paying $29 million to politicians in exchange for public works contracts.\n\nWHO HAS BEEN JAILED OR REMOVED FROM OFFICE?\n\nIf his resignation is accepted, Kuczynski would become the first sitting president removed from office in Latin America as an indirect consequence of the Odebrecht scandal.\n\nFormer Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is appealing a corruption conviction, while former Peruvian President Ollanta Humala is in jail awaiting trial. Another former Peruvian president, Alejandro Toledo, has been accused of taking $20 million in bribes from Odebrecht and is currently in the U.S. seeking to avoid extradition. In Ecuador, Vice President Jorge Glas was recently sentenced to six years in prison for orchestrating an Odebrecht bribe scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other political leaders are under investigation as public prosecutors across Latin America continue to bring charges against lawmakers who participated in the scheme.",

                "body": "Three weeks of terror in central Texas ended before dawn Wednesday in a ditch at the side of an interstate outside Austin, with an explosion that killed a young man suspected in a string of deadly bombings across the state capital.\n\nThat final blast, triggered as police closed in on Mark Anthony Conditt, 23, marked the culmination of several coordinated investigations conducted by hundreds of federal and local authorities, some high-tech and some old-fashioned.\n\nThey worked in plain view and in seclusion, assembling pieces of a case that expanded to include five explosions since March 2 -- three at homes that killed two and injured two, one triggered by a trip wire that injured two, and one in a package at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, there were examinations of the bombs themselves by teams from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who collected, reassembled and studied the pieces of devices that detonated. In this phase, experts say, just about anything is a possible clue: the types of explosives, detonators and wires; surfaces containing potential DNA or fingerprints; labels, tape and stickers; tiny tool marks. The assembly itself might reveal unique identifiers.\n\nRelated: Who was Austin bomb suspect Mark Anthony Conditt? 2012 blog reveals views\n\nIn this case, investigators noticed something peculiar about the batteries.\n\nAmid the remnants of the five explosions, investigators found \"exotic\" Asia-made batteries that had been ordered online, multiple senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told NBC News.\n\nThis allowed investigators to link the blasts, a sign that a single person was responsible.\n\nAnother break came from closely guarded software that allows FBI agents to use cell tower signals to locate and track individual cellphones.\n\nThat pattern-based technology, used by the FBI's cellular analysis survey teams, gave investigators the ability to identify mobile phones near the blast sites. Zeroing in on devices that showed up repeatedly, they came up with a list of phone numbers of people who were in the area of the bombings, senior federal law enforcement officials said.\n\nGreg Carl, the former director of the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, where improvised explosive devices from war zones and American streets are examined, said the Austin investigation appeared to be \"textbook\" in the use of hundreds of agents, in labs, at computers and in the streets. \"You're pulling large amounts of data and then going through it, like finding a needle in a haystack,\" Carl said. \"That's where it comes down to old-fashioned police work.\"\n\nFinally, investigators examining surveillance footage at FedEx centers saw a man drop off two packages, one of which later exploded at the FedEx facility near San Antonio, several law enforcement officials said. Footage shared with the public showed the man, believed to be Conditt, wearing gloves and a blond wig.\n\nWhile the high-tech investigations unfolded, agents and police officers were doing the shoe-leather detective work also typical in serial bombing cases: canvassing neighborhoods where the bombs were delivered, talking to witnesses, sifting through tips from the public and hundreds of reports of suspicious packages.\n\n\"It's nice to see that it was good old-fashioned hard work and dedication that resolved this and not theories and psychological profiles,\" said Max Noel, a retired FBI agent who helped track Theodore Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, who was responsible for string of bombings that killed three people and injured 22 over 17 years before his 1996 arrest.\n\nConditt's biggest slip-up was apparently thinking he could drop off a package with a bomb at FedEx, Noel said.\n\n\"He almost became arrogant,\" Noel said. \"To think he could get away with doing that by wearing disguises and what have you.\"\n\nWitnesses told investigators of relevant purchases Conditt had made at stores, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Austin NBC affiliate KXAN. Witnesses also remembered seeing the man with the wig in the FedEx center, and told investigators about the car he was driving, Abbott said. That drew investigators closer to Conditt.\n\nInvestigators tracked the suspect's car to a Red Roof Inn in the city of Round Rock, authorities said, just north of Austin, and 15 miles from Conditt's hometown, Pflugervile.\n\nBy Tuesday night, authorities had obtained a federal warrant for Conditt's arrest, charging him with unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device. The affidavit that provides the explanation for the warrant remains under court seal.\n\nRelated: Austin bomb suspect Mark Anthony Conditt used 'exotic' batteries in explosives, sources say\n\nAt some point, Conditt -- who authorities say had no criminal history -- turned off his cellphone, making it difficult to track him, two senior law enforcement officials said. But late Tuesday or early Wednesday, he switched it back on, alerting police to his position. They began following him.\n\nAs investigators made preparations to take Conditt into custody -- there was the possibility of more explosions -- the suspect got into his car and drove away, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters Wednesday. Officers tailed him, while tactical vehicles made their way to the area.\n\nThen Conditt stopped the car in a ditch alongside Interstate 35. A member of the Austin Police Department's SWAT team approached. An explosion went off inside the car, Manley said. The blast knocked the SWAT officer back. Another officer fired at the car.\n\nThe finally had their man. And he was dead.\n\nBut the case is not closed, authorities cautioned.\n\n\"There are still two things we did not know,\" Abbott told KXAN. \"We don't know whether or not he had preset or mailed any other bombs before he was apprehended. We also have not been able to rule out if there are any other accomplices who may be a part of this who still pose a danger.\"\n\nAnd authorities still are working to understand Conditt himself, and what drove him to plant the bombs.\n\n\"I think we will be able to piece together the puzzle of who this man was and why he did what he did,\" Abbott said. \"And that will resolve a lot of the uncertainty that still exists.\"",

At first, you'll see a room filled with gently-used clothes and furniture, but if you look a little closer you'll notice something unique about the staff: The shop employs many people with disabilities ranging from autism to brain trauma.\n\n\"It's the best thing ever!\" Heather, a 31-year-old longtime TERI employee who has Cerebral Palsy, says about the shop.\n\nTERI, which stands for Training, Education, Research and Innovation, offers many of the workers with special needs their first \"office\" experience. The store sells everything from used furniture and clothes to artwork and crafts created by the employees with special needs.\n\nIn addition to the 25 employees with disabilities are volunteers and other employees passionate about serving the community.\n\nShaunda Anaya, the store manager, says the shop helps the workers develop socially, build relationships, and gain other basic life skills. But, she says, it's a learning experience for everyone.\n\n\"You could be having the worst day in your own personal life,\" says Anaya, but the employees \"are just happy and change everything for you. You see that happen with customers.\"\n\nAs the collection at TERI grows, so does its impact on the community. The store's profits go to TERI Inc, a San Diego-based nonprofit which provides opportunities, such as academy programs and horseback riding lessons, for about 800 individuals living with developmental and intellectual disabilities.\n\nMatthew Anderson, a member of the development team at TERI Inc, says many people feel intimidated around people with special needs. His best advice for those who fear they'll do or say the wrong thing: Follow the golden rule -- treat others as you want to be treated.\n\n\"They just want to be loved and have relationships,\" says Anderson.\n\nAt the heart of the store is a mission rooted in compassion and inclusion. Anaya says TERI Inspired Resale gives so much more than new items to fill a house; it provides a place for many to call a second home.\n\n\"There's still a big stigma for people with disabilities and not everybody is willing to have them work in their stores,\" says Anaya. \"With TERI having their own store, there is no stigma. This is their store.\"",

They accepted a trial court judge's instructing the jury to decide based only on the sheet music to the songs, and not the recordings.\n\nDissenting Judge Jacqueline Nguyen offered a harsh dissent, saying that the songs resemble each other only in style not substance and that the decision was detrimental to the future of artists and creativity.\n\n\"The majority allows the Gayes to accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style,\" Nguyen wrote. \"'Blurred Lines' and 'Got to Give It Up' are not objectively similar. They differ in melody, harmony, and rhythm. Yet by refusing to compare the two works, the majority establishes a dangerous precedent that strikes a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere.\"\n\nHoward King, an attorney for Williams and Thicke, seized on Nguyen's comments.\n\n\"We stand by the fact that these are two entirely different songs,\" King said in an email to The Associated Press. \"The thorough and well-reasoned dissenting judge's opinion is compelling and enhances the prospects for success in a further review by the Court of Appeals.\"",

A new analysis, led by David Miller of Northwestern University, shows a weakening of the stereotype of scientist as a man.\n\nWomen have made considerable inroads into science fields since the 1970s and children's drawing reflect this: 28 percent of students drew a female scientist in more recent studies.

                "body": "Meghala and Priyanka painting a mural in Bangalore, India, in March 2018.Priti Salian /\n\nDressed in blue jeans and a red T-shirt, with her hair tied loosely at the nape of her neck, Purushi moves closer to examine the mural in front of her. Then she reaches for a paintbrush, mixes colors to get the right hue of brown and gets working on the eyelids of the transgender woman she is painting on a public wall in Bangalore. Her deft fingers measure each stroke, to get the facial features right. It's not something every artist painting along with her could be tasked to do. Intricate artwork requires practice and passion, and Purushi has both.\n\nPurushi, now 31, had not previously recognized her talent for art or dreamed of becoming an artist. Just like a lot of other transgender women in India, she only begged or did sex work for survival. That all changed when she was invited to participate in the Aravani Art Project, a public art venture launched in 2016 by Bangalore-based artist Poornima Sukumar.\n\nLed by a core team of three cisgender (non-transgender) and two transgender women, the project employs people from the trans community to paint murals in public spaces. The murals' themes represent slices of the trans experience and are a celebration of the community, according to Sukumar, who serves as director of the project. Portrayals of acceptance, violence, gender expression and equality have been painted in cities across India and on one wall in Colombo, Sri Lanka.\n\nSukumar met Purushi along with several other trans women more than three years ago when she was working on a documentary about transgender life in India. Sukumar worked on the film between 2012 and 2015 and noticed when she wanted to share stories about her experiences with the trans community, her friends would shy away from the subject.\n\n\"My friends were ignorant about transgender people's lives and also a bit wary to talk about them due to the stereotypes they held about the community,\" Sukumar explained, noting that due to widespread stigma and discrimination, transgender women in India often must resort to survival sex and begging in the street. Some even resort to pleading for money at weddings and birthdays in return for blessings.\n\nFor this reason, Sukumar wanted to bring the community out into public spaces where they could be seen doing something other than begging. Being an artist herself, she thought a public art project would be the easiest way for her to help engage the community. She hoped this would \"raise questions in people's minds about [transgender people's] lives and drive someone to have a dialogue about them and even with them.\"\n\nSukumar started having conversations about the proposed public art project with transgender women in Bangalore, where she lives, and then in other cities across India. It wasn't easy, she said, as it took time to build trust and have the trans women open up to her. Most of them, she added, were unfamiliar with painting murals and were skeptical of someone offering to compensate them to paint.\n\n\"Basically, they are just not used to anyone being nice to them,\" Sukumar said.\n\nSukumar's observation is not isolated. A 2016 study of 60,000 transgender people across 17 states in India found that a large portion of the community receives no support from their biological family, and the biggest perpetrators of violence against trans people are members of law enforcement. A separate report found approximately 60 percent of transgender people have experienced some form of harassment or violence.\n\nOnce an Aravani Art Project mural gets funded or commissioned, Sukumar connects with members of the trans community in that particular city. She and her team then spend a few weeks with them to understand their culture, their lifestyle and any unique issues they face. Together, they come up with a suitable theme to paint and a caption that accompanies the artwork.\n\n\"They convey and we articulate,\" said Sukumar, who outlines the design on the wall either herself or with the help of Sadhna Prasad, an illustrator and core team member of the Aravani Art Project. Geometric patterns are created within those outlines to enable even novice artists to fill in colors with little guidance. Depending on the size of the wall and the funds available, Sukumar hires anywhere from just a few transgender women to a dozen to paint the mural.\n\nOnce the mural is completed, Sukumar said the relationship between her team and the trans women they collaborate with does not end.\n\n\"Whether we work together again or don't, we never lose touch,\" she said, noting she and her friends can often be seen around Bangalore working on art projects or just having lunch with transgender people in the community.\n\n\"Over a period of time, the transgender community has started to understand that we share their stories without any agenda and give something back to them,\" she said.\n\nPriyanka Divaakar, a 32-year-old transgender actress and radio host in Bangalore, said she joined the Aravani Art Project as a core team member because of her fondness for sketching and painting. \"I also want people around me to understand that transgender people have the same skills as others, and we can do every work that anybody else can,\" she added.\n\nRaina Roy, a Kolkata-based transgender activist who painted a mural for Aravani Art Project in her city in February, echoed Divaakar. \"People don't know that we can be artists or even have a profession,\" she said.\n\nIndia's 2011 census recorded nearly 500,000 transgender people living across the country. However, due to discrimination, there is very little integration of transgender people in the workforce. In 2014, a Supreme Court ruling gave trans people a \"third gender\" status and rights to education, jobs, health benefits and other welfare measures. However, a bill to work out the specifics of the ruling is still pending revision and is likely to be considered in parliament soon. The transgender community is strongly against a few issues in the bill, most importantly, the definition of transgender person as \"neither wholly male or female\" and the suggestion of medical screening for to establish one's trans identity.\n\nMeanwhile, projects like Aravani are trying to bring transgender people to the forefront and give them a voice. Sukumar said when people hear about her project, they often come and watch the work of transgender people, have conversations with them and sometimes express a desire to hire them.\n\nRoy is hopeful about public response in Kolkata. \"When people will see faces on the wall that are a reflection of the trans community, they'll realize we exist,\" Roy added. \"And I hope that seeing our work, someone will hire us for painting.\"\n\nWhile the Aravani Art Project is only able to provide the trans community with temporary work thus far, for participants like Purushi, painting murals is about much more than economics.\n\n\"Painting is what really makes me happy,\" she said, adding that she often assists Sukumar with her other art projects as well. She also said creating art makes her feel more respectable in society and gives her a sense of dignity that she did not have before.\n\n\"When someone asks me what I do, I don't have to think. I tell them I'm an artist,\" she said enthusiastically.",

                "body": "FBI director says politics did not play in firing of Andrew McCabe\n\nSome of the harshest words of criticism of the bureau have come from President Donald Trump, who has said the agency is in tatters. But Wray said he urges the bureau's rank and file to embrace the criticism.\n\n\"Our folks are human beings like anybody else. Would we prefer not to get criticized? Of course. But in many ways we're our own toughest critics,\" he said.\n\nWray said the criticism has not affected the FBI's recruiting or retention. The bureau remains highly selective in admitting applicants to become agents, with an acceptance rate of about five percent -- comparable to the admission rate at Harvard or Stanford. And its attrition rate is 0.8 percent, he said.\n\nDespite the FBI's admission that it failed to follow up on two tips about Nikolas Cruz, charged with killing 17 people last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, Wray said the number of tips has actually gone up since then.\n\n\"We were worried, would people suddenly not want to call in?\" he asked. \"If anything, we've seen exactly the opposite -- a sharp uptick. It's been quite significant.\"\n\nIn the interview, Wray also surveyed some of the biggest threats facing America. Countering terrorism remains a top mission, and Wray said the FBI now has more than 3,000 open investigations nationwide, divided about equally among suspected ISIS-directed threats, suspected homegrown violent extremists inspired by global jihadist organizations, and cases of suspected domestic terrorism -- a higher number than previously disclosed.\n\nSome cases involve physical or electronic surveillance but all are full-field investigations, beyond simply assessing tips. \"This is in big cities and small towns. It's a real problem.\"\n\nAnother growth area for the FBI has been tracking foreign espionage, and Wray said the Chinese are by far the most active. In terms of targeting vital assets, \"there's no country that's even close,\" a threat that he said has been significantly underestimated.\n\nThe Chinese government and Chinese companies aggressively go after a range of U.S. targets, from firms in the Fortune 500 to small start-ups, he said, seeking trade secrets as varied as the details of control systems for wind turbines in Massachusetts to the genetic makeup of corn seeds in Iowa.\n\nSome Asian-Americans groups blasted the FBI director for telling Congress in February that Chinese businessmen, students, and scholars present such a threat that it demands a \"whole of society\" response by the U.S.\n\nBut Wray defended those remarks in the interview.\n\n\"To be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin,\" he said. \"But when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.\"\n\nAs for one of the FBI's traditional missions, Wray called the four percent increase in violent crime in 2016 very significant. The figures for 2017 are not yet final.\n\n\"In a country our size, a four percent increase is essentially equivalent to about 50,000 people. So imagine Yankee stadium sold out, full of violent crime victims, and that's the difference from one year to the next,\" he said.\n\nAmong the factors causing the increase are crimes tied to the opioid epidemic and the rise in ultra-violent gangs.\n\nWray took the reins of the FBI when it was reeling from the abrupt firing of his predecessor, James Comey, and said his foremost priority was \"to try to bring some stability and calm to the organization.\" He said he plans to serve out the full 10-term term.\n\n\"All I am, is focused on trying to see if I can make this place even better than when I found it,\" Wray said.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act very nearly failed to become law due to an intraparty dispute among Democrats over how to handle the abortion issue. Now a similar argument between Democrats and Republicans is slowing progress on a bill that could help cut soaring premiums and shore up the ACA.\n\nAt issue is the extent to which the Hyde Amendment -- language commonly used by Congress to prohibit most federal abortion funding -- should be incorporated into any new legislation affecting the health law.\n\nRepublicans generally want more restrictions on abortion funding. Democrats generally want fewer. Here's a guide to the history of the current impasse:\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, named for Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), an anti-abortion crusader who died in 2007, prohibits federal funding of abortion in Medicaid and several other health programs run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Current exceptions allow for funding in cases of rape, incest or \"where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed.\"\n\nBut the Hyde Amendment is not permanent law. Rather, it has been included every year since 1977 as a \"rider\" to federal spending bills. Hence, its exact language changes from time to time. The rape and incest exceptions, for example, were not included in the annual HHS spending bill from 1981 to 1993. During that time, the only exception was for abortions required to save a pregnant woman's life.\n\nHyde-like language has been added to other annual spending bills over the years, so federal abortion funding is also now forbidden in private health insurance plans for federal employees, women in federal prisons, those in the Peace Corps and women in the military, among others.\n\nOver the years, Democrats have worked, unsuccessfully, to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, charging that it unfairly harms low-income women who cannot afford to pay for abortions. Proposed elimination of the language was included in the Democratic Party's 2016 platform.\n\nRepublicans have tried, also so far unsuccessfully, to write the Hyde funding prohibitions into permanent law. \"A ban on taxpayer funding of abortion is the will of the people and ought to be the law of the land,\" said then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) in 2011.\n\nRepublicans in both the House and Senate unanimously refused to support the Affordable Care Act when it passed Congress in 2010. Even without their backing, abortion remained a huge hurdle.\n\nIn order to pass the bill over GOP objections, Democrats needed near unanimity among their ranks. But the Democratic caucus at the time had a significant number of abortion opponents, particularly those representing more conservative districts and states. In order to facilitate the bill's movement, House and Senate leaders agreed that the health bill should be \"abortion-neutral,\" meaning it would neither add to nor subtract from existing abortion restrictions.\n\nThat proved difficult. So difficult that to this day there is disagreement about whether the law expands or contracts abortion rights.\n\nDemocratic sponsors of the bill were buffeted by appeals from women's groups, who wanted to make sure the bill did not change existing coverage of abortion in private health insurance; and from abortion opponents, led by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , who called the bill a major expansion of abortion rights.\n\nThe bill passed the House in 2009 only after inclusion of an amendment by Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), a longtime opponent of abortion. That bill included a government-sponsored health plan and Stupak's provision would have made the Hyde Amendment a permanent part of that plan. The amendment also banned federal premium subsidies for private health insurance plans that offered abortion as a covered service, although it allowed for plan customers to purchase a rider with non-federal money to cover abortion services.\n\nThe Senate bill jettisoned the government-sponsored plan, so no restrictions were necessary on the abortion issue. And it was the Senate plan that went forward to become law. Still, differences remained over how to ensure that subsidies provided by taxpayers did not go to private plans that covered abortions.\n\nIn the upper chamber, a compromise was eventually reached by abortion-rights supporter Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), who opposed abortion. Nelson was the final holdout on the bill, which needed all 60 Democrats then in the Senate to overcome unanimous GOP opposition. The Boxer-Nelson language was a softening of the Stupak amendment, but still allowed states to prohibit plans in the ACA's insurance marketplaces from covering abortion.\n\nIn addition, President Barack Obama agreed to issue an \"executive order\" intended to ensure no federal funds were used for abortions.\n\nIn the end, both sides remained unhappy. Abortion opponents wanted the Hyde Amendment guarantees in the actual legislation rather than the executive order. Abortion-rights backers said the effort constricted abortion coverage in private health plans.\n\nAnd both sides are still unhappy. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group, 26 states have passed legislation restricting abortion coverage in any plan sold through the ACA's insurance exchanges.\n\nAnother 11 states have passed laws restricting abortion coverage in all private insurance sold in the state. Nine of those states allow separate abortion \"riders\" to be sold, but no carriers offer such coverage in those marketplaces, according to a 2018 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nThree states -- California, New York and Oregon -- require nearly all insurance plans to provide abortion coverage, according to the National Women's Law Center.\n\nThe issue for 2018 is a bipartisan bill that seeks to \"stabilize\" the individual insurance market and the ACA's health insurance exchanges by providing additional federal funding to offset some recent premium increases. Some options include restoring federal subsidies for insurers who cover out-of-pocket costs for very low-income customers and setting up a federal reinsurance pool to help insurers pay for very expensive patients.\n\nBut once again, the abortion debate threatens to block a consensus.\n\nMany Republicans are dubious about efforts to shore up the health law. They still hope its failure could lead to a repeal they were unable to accomplish in 2017.\n\nEven some who say they are sympathetic to a legislative remedy want to add the permanent Hyde Amendment language that was left out of the final ACA, although included in Obama's executive order.\n\nThat is \"not negotiable for House Republicans,\" a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told The Hill newspaper. The White House has also endorsed a permanent Hyde Amendment.\n\nBut Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who has been negotiating the insurance bill for the Democrats, calls any additional abortion restrictions \"a complete nonstarter\" for Democrats.",

                "body": "The Maryland school resource officer who possibly prevented a massacre by fatally shooting a rampaging student got a shout out Wednesday from another so-called \"good guy with a gun.\"\n\nStephen Willeford, who was hailed as a hero in November after he fatally shot the gunman who'd killed 26 people at a Texas church, said he would \"be honored to shake the hand\" of St. Mary's County Sheriff's Deputy Blaine Gaskill.\n\n\"I think what he did was outrageously courageous and needed to be done,\" Willeford, an NRA instructor, told NBC News on Wednesday. \"He's a true hero who put his life on the line. I would love to meet him. I think that would be excellent.\"\n\nAsked if he had any advice for Gaskill now that he's in the public eye, Willeford chuckled and said \"no.\"\n\n\"He's another good guy with a gun,\" he said.\n\nWilleford is not likely to get any argument on that from Gaskill's boss, Sheriff Tim Cameron, or Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Both have praised the 34-year-old \"tough guy\" for putting his own life on the line Tuesday.\n\nGaskill, who has yet to make a public statement, confronted 17-year-old Austin Wyatt Rollins in a hallway at Great Mills High School and opened fire after telling the student to put down his gun, police and witnesses have said.\n\nRollins, at the point, had already wounded 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey and a 14-year-old boy whose name police have not released. Willey remains in critical condition. The boy was treated for a gunshot wound to the thigh and has been discharged, police said.\n\n\"While it's still tragic, he may have saved other people's lives,\" Hogan said of Gaskill in the aftermath of Tuesday's shooting.\n\nThe reports of Gaskill's heroics come as a national debate is underway on how best to prevent deadly school shootings. It was rekindled by the Valentine's Day massacre of 17 students and staffers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nGaskill's reported actions also stand in stark contrast to that of Parkland school safety officer Scot Peterson who resigned amid reports that he went awol when the shooting started.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has been quick to hail Gaskill as proof that armed guards and teachers are a better deterrent than gun control. But what Gaskill is reported to have done is extremely rare.\n\nThe Washington Post, which has done an analysis of dozens of school shootings, reported Wednesday that Gaskill would only be the second school resource officer to kill an active shooter since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Parkland mass killing, President Donald Trump has called for arming teachers -- an idea praised by the National Rifle Association and dismissed as a \"colossally stupid idea\" by many educators and school safety advocates.\n\nStill, Florida Gov. Rick Scott last month inked a new law that defied the NRA by raising the age to buy all firearms to 21 and imposed other gun-buying restrictions -- but also allowed trained school workers and teachers to arm themselves.\n\nWilleford's brush with fame came after he pursued Texas church shooter Devin Patrick Kelly and shot him dead. He used a rifle similar to the Ruger AR-556 that Kelley used to commit the massacre.\n\nIt was later revealed that Willeford was a longtime NRA gun instructor -- so the powerful gun lobby, which has been fighting attempts to ban such weapons, was quick to dub him as their kind of hero.\n\nThey did the same for Gaskill on Tuesday.\n\nWilleford, who recently was the guest of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Tex., at the State of the Union address in January, has done only sporadic interview since the Nov. 5 tragedy that suddenly made him famous.\n\nHis lawyer, Pamela Thompson of San Antonio, said that's mostly been by design.\n\n\"First, everybody wants a piece of him and he can't take time off from his job to do interviews,\" she said. \"He did what he did because of the training he had and because it was the right thing to do. He didn't do it to be anybody's hero.\"",

                "body": "Wardens assist Sudan as he grazes at the conservancy in Kenya in 2015.Thomas Mukoya / Reuters file\n\nUnable to stand and sick from old age, the last male northern white rhino was put down on Monday. The sad demise of Sudan, whose keepers loved him as a \"gentle giant,\" means that only two members of the species are still alive -- and both are female.\n\nNot long ago, such a tragic situation would have meant certain extinction for a species. But thanks to advances in assisted reproduction, that may not necessarily be the case with northern white rhinos or any other endangered species.\n\nScientists have been collecting and storing animals' sperm and egg cells, as well as bits of skin and other tissue, that one day may be used to revivify species in danger of extinction as a result of hunting or habitat loss. These are part of a grand rescue plan for the northern white rhino that was set in motion long before Sudan's death. And similar plans might possibly be used to save polar bears, elephants, and other beloved animals whose futures are very much in doubt.\n\n\"I would prefer that we would really care about animals to stay in their habitats and have, let's say, free lives in a place where they belong,\" said Jan Stejskal of Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic, where Sudan lived before he was transferred to the Kenyan wildlife preserve where he died. \"But if we get to a situation where we did with the northern white rhino, then I would still say we should try and not just let them go.\"\n\nBeyond preserving their habitats and protecting them from poaching and other threats, the most obvious way to help endangered animals is to use the same in vitro fertilization (IVF) methods used in human fertility clinics: Collect sperm from males and eggs from females, combine them in a lab to produce embryos, and then transfer these embryos to females to grow into babies.\n\nIVF has been used with cattle and horses, as well as for tigers, ocelots, and antelopes, said Pierre Comizzoli, a research biologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington D.C., who isn't part of the rhino rescue mission. But the odds of success with IVF are slim because, as Comizzoli told NBC News MACH in an email, \"We don't understand the basic biology in many species.\"\n\nLuckily, some of Sudan's semen was collected and frozen years ago, along with that of other northern white rhino bulls. Scientists say it should be possible to use sperm from these samples to fertilize eggs harvested from the last two females of the species, Fatu and Najin, who remain at the same Kenyan preserve where Sudan died.\n\nAs neither animal is healthy enough to carry a pregnancy, researchers will have to look to the northern white rhino's cousin -- the southern white rhino -- to find surrogate mothers.\n\nThings would be easier if rhino eggs could be frozen and then thawed, as needed, to create embryos, but for unknown reasons, many animal eggs tend not to be viable once thawed. \"In the future, we may be able to freeze the [egg cells], but now we have to work around it,\" says Stejskal.\n\nSo it's a race against time to hone the technique while Fatu and Najin are still alive. \"The main thing is those two cows mustn't die, because they can still produce the eggs,\" said Morné de la Rey, a veterinarian and director of the company Embryo Plus, who is working on refining these techniques in southern white rhinos.\n\nThe good news is that it might be possible to save Sudan's kind even if his survivors die before doing their part in the IVF process. Scientists say that it may be possible to create new eggs and sperm cells from different types of animal tissue, like skin -- and several institutions around the world have been stashing tissue samples from the northern white rhino and other species.\n\nSome northern white rhino skin cells have already been successfully grown into stem cells. \"The next steps will take us, we hope, to sperm and eggs,\" said Barbara Durrant, director of reproductive sciences at San Diego Zoo, which is among the institutions storing animal tissues. These would then be used to create embryos to be implanted into a surrogate mother.\n\nSo far, this approach has been used successfully only in lab mice, but Durrant is undeterred. \"We know it can be done, the principle is there, but we do realize the mouse to the rhino is a huge step,\" she says.\n\n\"This is the only way to go, right now, said Comizzoli. \"This is a really ambitious project. But if we really want to regenerate and resurrect that species, this is the kind of approach that has to be taken.\"\n\nOf course, bringing new animals to life in the lab won't mean much if habitats disappear and poaching continues. \"We've been messing with nature in the past so much by killing these animals and slaughtering them and using their rhino horn [as] an aphrodisiac, that is messing with nature,\" said de la Rey. \"If we don't rectify that, the animal will remain extinct.\"",

Opioid overdoses kill around 35,000 people a year, the CDC says.\n\nLower back pain costs 3 million years of productive life every year in the U.S. -- a calculation that takes into account both people affected and how long their pain keeps them out of work.\n\nThe causes are not obvious.\n\n\"Rarely can a specific cause of low back pain be identified,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain.\"\n\nThe problem's likely to get worse as people live to older ages, the researchers predicted.\n\nStudies show what works best to treat lower back pain: physical therapy, psychological counseling, stretching, massage and other non-invasive treatments. Rest rarely helps: all patients should be urged to stay active.\n\nThe American College of Physicians says in its guidance that patients with lower back pain should try heat wraps and exercise first, and prescription drugs should be used only as a last resort.\n\nBut that's not what patients are getting.\n\n\"Only 12 percent of people with chronic low back pain with depression in the USA had seen a psychiatrist or psychologist in the previous year,\" the researchers wrote. Only 8 percent got cognitive behavioral therapy, which has been shown to help, and fewer than half are ever prescribed exercise.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve voted Wednesday to raise interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point, in the central bank's first policy meeting led by its new chairman, Jerome \"Jay\" Powell.\n\nThe move marks the first rate hike for 2018, bringing the benchmark interest rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent due to a \"strengthened\" economic outlook, said the Federal Open Market Committee in a statement. But it won't be the last rate hike this year -- the Fed has already penciled in three increases, with a fourth one also likely, depending on the pace of economic growth.\n\nThe meeting was the first major test for Powell, whom President Donald Trump tapped to replace Janet Yellen when her term as Federal Reserve Chair expired last month.\n\nA Republican and former hedge fund executive, Powell is not new to the Fed, having served on the board of governors after being nominated by President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\nRelated: Why the Federal Reserve could look totally different (this) year\n\nDuring his five years as a governor, Powell was mostly aligned with Yellen's dovish policy-making -- but the heating up of the economy after years of easy lending has brought the Federal Reserve into a new era. The chairman must balance out the burgeoning job market, an uptick in wages, and the Trump administration's economic stimulus package, all of which could lead to an overheating of the economy -- and inflation.\n\nIt's been two years since the Fed started to tighten its monetary policy, having held rates at close to zero for seven years while it helped to shepherd the nation out of a recession.\n\nIn the time since December 2015, when Yellen approved the first interest rate increase in almost a decade, rates on consumer loans have slowly crept up -- but are still far below pre-recession levels.\n\nHigher rates are a boon for consumers who have money stashed in savings accounts, which are currently offering the highest rates in more than seven years.\n\nHowever, each hike in the interest rate means that consumers with credit card debt will have to fork out a little extra each month to meet the minimum payment -- and delinquency rates are already on the rise, indicating that many Americans are already overextended.\n\nHomeowners with a fixed rate mortgage are not affected by rate hikes, but anyone with an adjustable-rate mortgage will find themselves shelling out hundreds more by the end of the year.\n\nHomebuyers have been racing to lock in their mortgages in anticipation of the succession of rate hikes, as indicated by an uptick in mortgage applications in the last three months.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's likely pick to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is facing significant criticism because of a 20-year-old controversy over shoddy HIV research.\n\nThe Army in 1994 acknowledged accuracy issues with HIV vaccine research led by Dr. Robert Redfield, who is expected to head the CDC, but concluded at the time that the data errors did not constitute misconduct.\n\nYet one of the whistleblowers who first raised the matter to the Army told Kaiser Health News this week that he remains so troubled about Redfield's handling of the vaccine research that he has decided to speak out publicly.\n\nRedfield was principal investigator over clinical trials of a treatment vaccine at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The research was conducted at a time when there was intense pressure to come up with a treatment for HIV/AIDS, which often killed patients within a matter of months.\n\n\"Either he was egregiously sloppy with data or it was fabricated,\" said former Air Force Lt. Col. Craig Hendrix, a doctor who is now director of the division of clinical pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"It was somewhere on that spectrum, both of which were serious and raised questions about his trustworthiness.\"\n\nIn a letter to Trump this week, Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, cited the research controversy as an example of a \"pattern of ethically and morally questionable behavior\" by Redfield that should prompt the president to reconsider the appointment.\n\nRedfield's appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, was leaked to the news media over the weekend. Redfield did not respond to questions, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, declined to comment.\n\nRedfield, who denied any scientific misconduct at the time, is now an HIV/AIDS expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He has been praised by his supporters for his care of patients. He oversees a clinical program that treats 6,000 patients in the Baltimore-Washington area, according to an online bio.\n\nBut Redfield's critics said the expected appointment demonstrates that the Trump administration is not vetting appointees thoroughly. The first CDC head, Brenda Fitzgerald, stepped down in January after a controversy over her purchase of tobacco stocks, and former HHS Secretary Tom Price resigned late last year amid criticism over his use of government and private planes for official travel.\n\n\"The White House claimed they would do better background checks,\" said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, founder and senior adviser of Public Citizen's Health Research Group. \"But that statement is dangerously laughable. If they had done a proper background check, they wouldn't have chosen Dr. Redfield.\"\n\nPublic Citizen, a Washington watchdog group, was a leading critic of the Army's handling of Redfield's data at the time and obtained and published documents that detailed the controversy.\n\nHendrix, who was the director of an Air Force HIV clinical unit when he raised the concerns, said: \"Two members of his [Redfield's] team told me they had tried to replicate the analysis, but they couldn't. When they tried to go to the Army, they said they were ignored.\"\n\nAfter Hendrix couldn't replicate the results, he drafted a letter to his superiors reporting the data problems.\n\nHendrix said Redfield's superiors initially told him not to send a letter detailing the concerns. Instead, the military scheduled a meeting with Redfield and other researchers so Hendrix could discuss the concerns. In the meeting, Hendrix recalled, Redfield acknowledged he had overstated how promising the results were.\n\n\"I thought it was resolved,\" said Hendrix, who said he later called Redfield to say he was proud to work in an organization that could openly discuss such concerns.\n\nHowever, Hendrix soon heard Redfield make the same inaccurate representations of the data at a conference and decided to file an official complaint requesting an investigation into scientific misconduct.\n\nAn Air Force institutional review board also recommended that the Army launch an inquiry stating: \"The committee agreed the information presented by Dr. Redfield seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher and has the potential to negatively impact AIDS research funding for military institutions as a whole.\"\n\nBut the Army did not appear to launch a full investigation, said Hendrix, who was interviewed at the time by the military official who conducted the inquiry. The military official declined Hendrix's attempts to provide documented evidence, telling him the investigation was \"informal.\"\n\nHendrix later asked the commander of his hospital about the outcome of the investigation. He recalled that the commander called another officer to ask.\n\n\"I just remember him saying \"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"When he hung up, he told me, 'We will not be discussing this again.'\"\n\nRedfield was transferred from the laboratory he headed and assigned to treat patients, although the Army said he was not being punished. The Army also said the data would be corrected, and the military scrapped the program.\n\nThe project had earlier drawn criticism because Congress had set aside $20 million for the vaccine after lobbying by a former senator on behalf of the manufacturer.\n\nHendrix said he occasionally interacted over the years with Redfield and holds no grudges.\n\n\"Before this happened, he made important contributions to HIV-prevention efforts,\" he said. \"I respected him.\"\n\nHowever, he said, he remains disturbed by the military's handling of the matter. He teaches a class on medical ethics and uses his own experience without naming Redfield to describe to his students the ethical quandaries faced in research.\n\nFaulty data can lead other scientists to repeat the same mistakes and prompt participants to seek out trials for drugs and vaccines that don't work.\n\n\"It's a huge waste of funds,\" he said. \"But just as importantly, it diminishes trust, which is essential in science. If truth is eroded, then the whole enterprise falls apart.\"",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nIn 2009, Bernhard Rieder created an app similar to the one that allegedly helped Cambridge Analytica collect data on 50 million people.\n\nBut he deleted the data.\n\n\"I should have stored all the data, get that Lamborghini,\" said Rieder, an associate professor of new media and digital culture at the University of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.\n\nRieder's work sheds light just how many different parties could have accessed the data of Facebook users by exploiting the same loophole that allowed Cambridge Analytica to build its data set.\n\nWhen asked how many companies might have been able to collect this kind of data, Rieder responded: \"Hundreds of thousands?\"\n\nRieder built a tool he called Netvizz, a Facebook data extractor for academics studying social networks. The app, which Rieder said was used by more than 100,000 researchers, is still working today, though it was weakened when Facebook made changes to its programming interface in 2015, limiting the kind of information apps could pull in an effort to protect its users' privacy.\n\nRieder said that getting user data was the easy part.\n\n\"Before 2015, you could get troves of data, especially as an app,\" Rieder said.\n\n\"I could have easily created a trove comparable to [Cambridge Analytica],\" he said. \"So a lot of people could have. And a lot have.\"\n\nRieder's work is suddenly very relevant because of the allegation that Cambridge Analytica received Facebook user data acquired through the same means -- an app that users connected to through Facebook.\n\nRieder joked about a Lamborghini because he knows the data that these companies harvested is valuable. Cambridge Analytica brought in nearly $6 million in payments from the Trump campaign and millions more from other Republicans and PACS in the run-up to the 2016 election, with the promise that its insight into people's identities, friends and \"likes\" could help sway the election.\n\nRieder's Netvizz never stored the data it collected, and the files it generated were deleted at regular intervals. This is what academic researchers were supposed to do. Facebook's terms of service (TOS) dictated that any data collected should be deleted within 24 hours, but Rieder said the company never once made sure he had done so.\n\n\"Facebook never asked for [deletion] other than the general demands in the TOS, i.e. deleting after 24 hours,\" Rieder said.\n\nReider said he was speculating, but added that academics were followed ethical rules, while the numerous business and marketing apps had no such compunction. Even for researchers, he said, apart from the ethical commitment, there was no real incentive to delete Facebook data -- and plenty of incentive not to delete it.\n\n\"If you don't have clear ethical pressure, why not keep it for further use?\" he said. \"Get to know your customers better, improve your service, check your demographics, etc.\"\n\nReider isn't alone in his thinking.\n\n\"I think this was a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Bart Preneel, a professor at Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium, who co-wrote the 2017 paper, \"Collateral damage of Facebook Apps.\"\n\nPublished by the International Association for Cryptologic Research, the paper offered a window into how a political data broker like Cambridge Analytica could have turned the survey answers of 270,000 willing participants into a political weapon armed with the personal information of 50 million Americans.\n\nPreneel's paper highlighted how apps could siphon off identities and information including location, groups, interests, \"likes,\" photos and videos, relationship details, religion, and even politics from people who never opted in the certain apps, but were friends of others who had.\n\n\"I think that part of the business model of Facebook was to grow very quickly and I think this was a side effect, of which researchers have warned for a long time,\" Preneel said.\n\nReider echoed a chorus of researchers and privacy advocates this week, expressing surprise that a story about Facebook data had captured the public's attention.\n\nFar more user data is currently for sale than what Cambridge Analytica collected, he said.\n\n\"This is quite specific since it involves academics, but this is nothing compared to what data brokers have for sale,\" Rieder said. [The story] seems very media compatible, like a shady dataset, exchanged by some guy in a suit, used to fool the American public. But it's pretty much business as usual in advertising, etc. This is just a small view into a huge business.\"",

                "body": "Most of us assume a level of equality with our peers, so when we see them with more stuff -- new cars, new countertops, new whatever -- the natural instinct is to worry.Mark Airs / Getty Images\n\nDid you catch the story about the Instagram influencer who ran up $10,000 in credit card debt in an effort to curate the picture-perfect life? What about Stacy London's raw and humbling account of how a bad year tipped off a downward spiral of overspending as she attempted to keep up appearances? They're not the only ones according to a recent Morningstar study by senior behavioral scientist Sarah Newcomb.\n\nIn the study, Measuring Up: Social Comparisons and Financial Wellbeing, Newcomb writes that where a person believes they stand relative to others has a much larger impact on happiness than their actual income. And the more often you compare, the worse the likely impact on your financial wellbeing.\n\n\"We make comparisons as a natural way of assessing where we are and how we're doing in life and society,\" Newcomb explains. \"It's not going to go away -- you might as well ask that we stop being human.\"\n\nMost of us assume a level of equality with our peers, so when we see them with more stuff -- new cars, new countertops, new whatever -- the natural instinct is to worry: \"Oh no, am I falling behind?\" But we don't know for sure that they're better off, we just know that they appear to be.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no equivalent measuring stick that can tell us how we compare when it comes to our underlying financial lives. \"We don't see [the savings in] people's bank accounts and debt, we only see their stuff,\" says Newcomb. That leads to the temptation to overspend -- sometimes until it hurts.\n\nIncluded in the research was a 2016 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that showed that when one person won the lottery, their neighbors had a higher chance of filing for bankruptcy in subsequent years. (Yes, you read that right. The lottery winners didn't go belly up. The neighbors did.)\n\nThe problem is that these days those defacto lottery winners are riding around in your back pocket every day, and they're in bed with you every night -- via social media. \"We're not just comparing ourselves to neighbors and colleagues anymore. We're comparing ourselves to everyone in the world because it's all right there in front of us,\" explains Rachel Cruze, author of \"Love Your Life Not Theirs: 7 Money Habits for Living the Life You Want.\" Even if we understand logically that social media likely represents the best part of everyone's lives, it's hard to keep that knowledge front and center when confronted by perfect vacation pics. \"You're not seeing the credit card bills and the second mortgage, so you're literally comparing yourself to a false-reality, make-believe world,\" Cruze says.\n\nThere was one ray of hope in Newcomb's study: When people compared themselves to a mentor or role model, they felt great about their financial wellbeing, even if their role model made more money than they did. Why? There's something inherently different about the comparisons you make with someone you respect.\n\nWhen we compare ourselves to neighbors and friends, we immediately ask: \"Do I measure up right now?\" But with role models and mentors, we're more likely to make an aspirational comparison, asking: \"What can I do differently to ensure that I reach this level one day?\" Newcomb says. \"With a mentor, you know you're not in their shoes yet, but you want to be. Your need to compare is channeled into a plan for how to reach your goals rather than a judgment about whether or not you've crossed the finish line yet,\" she says.\n\nThere's an easy way out of this: just flip the lens through which we see the comparison. The solution is not to drive yourself into debt to keep up with the Joneses. It's okay to love the Joneses, says executive and personal coach, Keren Eldad. \"Think about what you like about the Joneses, and let it inspire you to figure out how to raise your game in your financial life. Think of the changes you can make, the action you can take, the books you can read and the guidance you can seek to get there,\" Eldad says.\n\nIf all else fails, it's okay to take a break from social media for a while, or go on an Instagram \"diet\" where you check in less frequently, Cruze says. You can also find something else meaningful to do on your phone besides scrolling through other people's photos. A gratitude list -- a simple list of the things in your life that you're thankful for -- can easily be kept in the \"notes\" section of your phone, and added to any time you need a reminder that what you have in life is enough. \"The next time you see that friend of yours who's going on vacation again, take a deep breath, look at your list and refocus your perspective,\" she says.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe current compromise provides only a fraction of the funding President Donald Trump had sought for a border wall, instead providing roughly $1.6 billion for physical barriers and technology along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a GOP source familiar with negotiations. A Democratic source said that the amount only includes $641 million for 33 miles of new border fencing, not a concrete wall.\n\nIn recent days, the White House had requested $25 billion for Trump's proposed border wall over three years in exchange for a 2.5-year extension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), which President Barack Obama created in 2012 to defer deportations for people who came to the U.S. illegally as children. Democrats rejected that offer.\n\nAccording to the GOP source, this deal does not address DACA, which the Trump administration had announced last September would end, tasking Congress with coming up with a legislative solution.\n\nSources said the measure would provide a backdoor for construction to begin on the Gateway Project, a new rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, by making some of the federal funding supporters wanted available through money appropriated for Amtrak and other accounts. As much as $541 million in funding will be available for the project this year, with an extra $2.9 billion in grants also being made available, the Democratic source said.\n\nTrump had quietly threatened to veto the bill if it contained funding for Gateway, but Republican lawmakers who represent districts in the region were lobbying him to support the effort. The Democratic source said that the Department of Transportation will have \"a limited ability to withhold the funding\" despite Trump's opposition to the project, and that the bill includes language that requires the transportation secretary to sign off on grants in compliance with requirements in current law. At the same time, this portion of the bill can be viewed as a compromise because it doesn't make as much available for the project as originally requested.\n\nThe deal would not cut funding for Planned Parenthood and there are no provisions that defund so-called sanctuary cities, said the Democratic source, who added that the bill also provides for more than $300 million above the Trump administration's request for the FBI's efforts to fight Russian cyberattacks in 2018. The bill also offers a $2.8 billion increase to help battle the opioid epidemic.\n\nA major funding increase for school safety was expected in the spending bill. Two Republican sources familiar with ongoing negotiations said Tuesday that the bill would provide more than $2 billion for school safety, which is far more than the $50 million the House passed in the STOP School Violence Act and more than the $100 million in the Senate version of a similar bill. Democrats have argued that the $2 billion figure is Republican spin because that total includes money for programs that already exist.\n\nSchumer's office said that the actual amount may be as much as $250 million on new programs to ensure school safety. The bill does not provide money for arming teachers.\n\nRepublicans won't be able to pass the measure without some Democratic votes, at least in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to end debate and advance the bill. Republicans currently have 51 senators, while Democrats have 49.",

I love the way it quietly falls from the sky, the serenity it brings as it forces a busy city to take a breather and behold the sight of white fluffy flakes gently piling up on the garbage-strewn streets, creating a winter wonderland.\n\nBut I really, really hate snow days. Because like the pristine whiteness of snow on a city street, that serenity lasts for all of a New York minute, especially if that snow day lands smack in the middle of a week day and you're a working parent. There is no serenity to be found in a household when your sweet little first-grader is bored and needs attention that you can't wholly devote to him because you're swamped with deadlines and scheduled with conference calls.\n\nThen there is the kind of snow day that comes the second day of spring, a week before spring break. I, like many New York parents (and others in the tri-state area), had been bracing myself for the inevitable announcement because the forecast was truly frightful. It wasn't just the foot of snow we were expecting, but brutal winds, too -- the kind where tree limbs fall and who knows what else ... pieces of scaffolding? Air conditioning units? Definitely not the day to take the kids out for a snowball fight. You know you're going to both be stricken with cabin fever when the weather is too treacherous to venture outdoors.\n\nNo amount of anticipation can defuse my anxiety; I'm inherently neurotic. So it's not that I was wholly unprepared, but I was filled with dread when I went to drop off my son at school the day before the snow began. The looks of exasperation, even anticipatory exhaustion, on parents' faces when talk of the impending storm came up -- \"Do you really think it's going to happen?\" \"Please no, I'm so done\" -- suggested I wasn't alone.\n\nBut the fact is, I'm lucky; many of us are. I helm an online magazine and work remotely from home (though, like most people, boast an inbox that never empties). My son can occupy himself for an hour at a time, color and draw, watch cartoons, while I edit stories and do my calls. At worst, he'll be \"soooooo bored.\" And maybe a little lonely for a few hours. But he'll be fed. He'll be warm.\n\nAnd when I'm done, we'll get to play together and I'll write off the rest of the day.\n\nOther kids won't be so lucky: 20 million kids in this country rely on free lunch, and nearly 12 million rely on free breakfast. And as of two years ago, nearly 100,000 New York City kids were homeless. So what happens when school isn't in session? Are these kids someplace warm? Are they getting fed? A snow day could feel interminable and dire.\n\nThen think about the parents who are juggling jobs and paid hourly, who can't afford to take the day off to care for their children when school is not in session, who are already scrambling to figure out what to do when spring break comes. A day off may not only mean losing wages, but losing the job itself.\n\nSo what's the solution: No more snow days? That's obviously impossible. But we do have to find a way to take care of our kids and our parents when weather brings the city to a halt, because it is only going to more treacherous as time goes on, thanks to climate change.\n\nLast night on Facebook, as I was griping about the snow day with fellow parents, we were talking about how happy some of our kids were about it. And then I remembered my favorite snow day -- days really -- during the 38-hour Blizzard of '79 in Chicago, when the city was brought to its knees not simply because of the storm but because of the incompetence of Mayor Michael Bilandic. He failed to keep the streets plowed, bringing transportation to a complete stand still: Cars buried, trains and buses unable to move. The snow remained unshoveled and unplowed for a full 51 days.\n\nMy memory is of being excited that I got to finally wear my new Snoopy moonboots from Sears, and building forts in the six-foot-high snow drifts with the kids on my block. It was my idea of bliss. And if I recall correctly, those long January days were my parents' idea of hell.",

                "body": "Trump's silence on human rights represents a failure to capitalize on the leverage the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia.Jonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\nPolicy wonks and politicians have long touted Saudi Arabia as a key U.S. ally, a much-needed bulwark of stability in a \"turbulent Middle East.\" This relationship will likely get a boost this week, following Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's meeting Tuesday with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe U.S.-Saudi friendship spans decades, but Trump and the crown prince, commonly referred to by his initials \"MBS,\" share a particular talent at attracting headlines. They also appear more brazen, almost eager, to spin facts -- or ignore them -- to deflect criticism of their own and each other's rights abuses at home and abroad.\n\nAfter rapidly consolidating power at home, MBS is on a world tour aimed at shoring up foreign support and investment. His trip to the U.S. reportedly will include not only Washington, but New York, Boston, Seattle and Silicon Valley -- centers of American power and industry.\n\nSaudi Arabia (with its array of public relations firms) has a particular narrative to sell on this trip: A country on the cusp of change. A bold reformer on a transformative path. An ally dedicated to helping the U.S. meet its security needs against extremists and Iran.\n\nAnd yet, since MBS was promoted to Crown Prince last June, his government has rounded up prominent clerics and intellectuals and worked to stifle any form of dissent. In just the past two weeks, journalists reported that 17 detainees among the princes, businessmen and government officials imprisoned this past November in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton on alleged corruption charges required hospitalization for physical abuse. (Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has denied that any abuse occurred.) Even some of the reforms have been mixed with repression: When Saudi Arabia finally lifted the ban on women drivers, officials called women who had long worked for the change, ordering them to be silent.\n\nAnd so, as the Saudi delegation makes its way around the country, U.S. lawmakers need to push past the official spin -- to look squarely at Saudi rights abuses and their impact and to consider what more the United States could do to best ensure that its relationship with Saudi Arabia does not enable or contribute to enormous harm.\n\nThis is acutely true when it comes to Yemen, the site of the world's worst and largest humanitarian crisis. Millions are facing starvation, disease, death and destruction by the Saudi-led coalition and their adversary, the Houthi armed group, who have been fighting for nearly three years. Both sides have been responsible for war crimes.\n\nMohammed bin Salman is a key player in this war. He is the defense minister of the nation leading the coalition fighting the Houthis and serves as the coalition commander.\n\nThe United States, too, is a party to this conflict -- alongside the Saudis -- providing aerial refueling to coalition aircraft on bombing missions, and, at least early in the war, intelligence. According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International reports, U.S.-origin munitions have been found at the site of more than two dozen apparently unlawful coalition attacks in Yemen.\n\nIt is unlikely that Trump pressed the crown prince on rights abuses when they talked. For his first trip abroad as president, Trump flew to the Saudi capital and praised Saudi Arabia's \"strong action\" in Yemen and announced an enormous package of weapons sales -- a clear signal of U.S. support. In his speech to Arab leaders in May 2017, he said: \"We are not here to tell other people how to live,\" a statement consistent with his silence on Saudi Arabia's draconian male guardianship system, and its detention of human rights activists and other critics of the government. Trump also made no mention of the thousands of civilians killed or wounded in the Saudi-led campaign.\n\nIn Yemen, the coalition could mitigate suffering -- by compensating victims of unlawful strikes, ending unlawful attacks and freeing up access for commercial and humanitarian goods. In Saudi Arabia, the crown prince is trying to take credit for women's rights reforms, even though Saudi women have been emancipating themselves for decades.\n\nThe U.S. should push MBS further -- make clear that he won't be seen as a reformer unless he abolishes the male guardianship, under which every Saudi woman has a male \"guardian\" who has the authority to make a wide range of critical decisions on her behalf, and releases all men and women still imprisoned for peaceful activism, including those jailed for pushing for women's equal treatment.\n\nTrump's silence on human rights represents a failure to capitalize on the leverage the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. But, Congress can do more. U.S defense contractor Raytheon is reportedly courting lawmakers, seeking approval to sell billions of dollars more precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. Weapons deals need Congressional approval and controlling arms sales is one of the tools available if Congress wants to help stop Saudi abuses. The last three years have made it clear that Saudi Arabia pays attention when countries seriously consider curbing sales; it's time for Congress to step in and make clear it will do so.\n\nAnd this isn't just a policy question -- it's a legal question, too. Those U.S. munitions found in Yemen? Some of these weapons were manufactured after it became clear that coalition forces were frequently committing laws-of-war violations. At least four were made by Raytheon. U.S. officials who are involved in selling arms to a government that is likely to use them are at risk of aiding and abetting war crimes. Pleading ignorance is no longer credible: evidence of war crimes has been mounting for three years.\n\nThe president and the crown prince might not want to reckon with the reality of their rights abuses, but U.S. lawmakers owe it to the Yemeni civilians still suffering, the Saudi activists still behind bars and the women still fighting for freedom -- full freedom -- to ask the right questions and to push these powerful leaders to answer them.",

                "title": "Israel admits to strike on suspected Syrian reactor in warning to Iran",
                "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's confirmation Wednesday that it was behind the 2007 bombing of a suspected Syrian nuclear facility had a specific intended audience: longstanding enemy Iran.\n\nThe airstrike on the al-Kabur site in Deir al-Zor destroyed what was believed to be a nuclear reactor, and had been one of the most secretive Israeli military operations in recent memory. Although Israel was widely believed to have been behind the Sept. 6, 2007, strike, it has never before commented publicly on it.\n\nIntelligence Minister Israel Katz sent \"congratulations\" to then-prime minister Ehud Olmert for the \"decision to destroy the nuclear reactor in Syria eleven years ago.\"\n\n\"The operation and its success made it clear that Israel would never allow nuclear weapons to those who threaten its existence,\" he said on Twitter. \"Syria back then -- and Iran today.\"\n\nIsrael is deeply alarmed by Iran's growing regional power and ambitions. Tehran is allied with the government of President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war in Syria -- also a longstanding enemy of Israel. Sunni powers in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are also deeply suspicious of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which they claim have not been curbed by a landmark 2015 international agreement that saw some international sanctions lifted.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman underlined intelligence minister Katz's statement.\n\n\"The motivation of our enemies has grown in recent years, but so too the might of the ... Israeli Defence Forces,\" he said in a statement. \"Everyone in the Middle East would do well to internalize this equation.\"\n\nIn a lengthy release, the Israeli military said that eight F-15 fighter jets carried out the top-secret airstrikes against the facility about 300 miles northeast of Damascus, and destroyed a site that had been in development for years and was scheduled to go into operation at the end of 2007.\n\nAmos Yadlin, who was the head of Israeli military's intelligence at the time, told NBC News that a unique intelligence operation in Syria in 2006 led to the conclusion that Israel was \"facing a project of a plutonium nuclear reactor which has only one purpose -- to produce a nuclear bomb.\"\n\n\"The question was how much time do we have, our accurate answer was that we have six to seven months before it will be hot, and then we moved to the operational planning,\" said Yadlin, the current head of the Institute for National Security Studies research institute in Tel Aviv. \"We understood that we have two goals: No core, no war -- destroying the nuclear reactor on one hand, and avoiding a war on the other hand.\"\n\nIsrael and Syria were bitter enemies before the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011. Since the conflict erupted, Israel has carried out well over 100 airstrikes, most believed to have been aimed at suspected weapons shipments destined for the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, Hezbollah.\n\nWhen asked whether he believed the announcement was intended as a message to Iran or Assad-allied Russia, Yadlin said: \"It is signaling that when it comes to the very vital interest or the very serious threat to the existence to Israel, Israel is going to act -- even if Israel has to act alone.\"\n\nIsrael's announcement comes amid rising tensions in the regions, with Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman visiting Washington. On Tuesday, Prince Mohammed said if more wasn't done to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, his country will pursue its own \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has forged closer ties with longstanding American ally Saudi Arabia, has long promised to scrap the agreement with Iran that saw Tehran curtail its nuclear ambition in exchange for a lifting of punishing economic sanctions.\n\nIn Iran, where the country was celebrating New Year, there was no immediate reaction to Israel's announcement.",

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster briefed the president in person before the call in the White House residence.\n\nThe State Department spokeswoman noted that some people were paid to turn out to vote in Russia and opposition leaders were intimidated or jailed.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are have criticized Trump for calling Putin to congratulate him\n\nSen. John McCain of Arizona said, \"An American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.\" McCain's Arizona colleague, Sen. Jeff Flake, labeled Trump's congratulatory call \"odd\" while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said calling Putin \"wouldn't have been high on my list.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted that President Barack Obama made a similar call at the time of Putin's last electoral victory. Huckabee said, \"We don't get to dictate how other countries operate.\"\n\nIn the call Trump didn't raise Russia's meddling in U.S. elections or its suspected involvement in the poisoning of a former spy in Britain.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- In his nearly three years as president or a presidential candidate, Donald Trump has never been shy about openly criticizing others, including foreign leaders. He ripped into London's mayor. He fired back at British Prime Minister Theresa May (initially tweeting at the wrong Theresa May). And he's hurled insults at North Korea's Kim Jong-Un.\n\nWhich all makes Trump's reluctance to forcefully criticize Vladimir Putin -- after the election interference in 2016, after the poisoning in Britain and after the voting irregularities in Russia -- all the more striking. Even when the president is instructed NOT to congratulate Putin.\n\nThe Washington Post: \"President Trump did not follow specific warnings from his national security advisers Tuesday when he congratulated Russian President Vladi­mir Putin on his reelection -- including a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating 'DO NOT CONGRATULATE,' according to officials familiar with the call.\"\n\nMore from the Post: \"Trump also chose not to heed talking points from aides instructing him to condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain with a powerful nerve agent, a case that both the British and U.S. governments have blamed on Moscow.\"\n\nNBC's Ali Vitali adds, \"The White House said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's congratulatory call to Russian President Vladimir Putin on his recent re-election wasn't focused on allegations that election meddling or fraud may have contributed to that victory because the United States should not 'get to dictate how other countries operate.'\"\n\nThat White House objective not to dictate how other countries should operate might be a surprise to Vice President Pence, who's expected to criticize Venezuela in a speech today. \"The White House says Pence will use his address to the Organization of American States to ask nations to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to address the country's humanitarian crisis, release political prisoners and hold free and fair elections,\" the AP wrote.\n\nHere's your biggest news of the day so far: \"The suspect in a spate of bombings that terrorized residents of Austin, Texas, died early Wednesday after detonating an explosive inside his vehicle as a SWAT team tried to apprehend him on the side of a highway, officials said,\" per NBC News. \"Authorities had tracked the suspect -- a 24-year-old white man -- to a hotel in Round Rock, a city in the Austin metropolitan area, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference.\"\n\nThe big storyline out of last night's Illinois primaries was that two vulnerable incumbents -- Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic Rep. Dan Lapinski -- barely won their primaries. But barely was enough.\n\nOn Tuesday, we posed four questions. Well, here are the answers we got:\n\n1. Is Gov. Bruce Rauner in trouble in his GOP primary?\n\nIt turned out that Rauner WAS in trouble, but he still held off Republican challenger Jeanne Ives, beating her 51.5 percent to 48.5 percent. The personally wealthy Rauner outspent Ives over the airwaves by a 6-to-1 margin, $16.4 million to $2.8 million.\n\n2. Who wins the Dem primary for governor -- the billionaire, the Kennedy or the former teacher?\n\nAnswer: The billionaire J.B. Pritzker, who received 45 percent of the vote, while former teacher Dan Biss got 27 percent and Chris Kennedy got 24 percent. Pritzker spent $33.5 million in ads. The Rauner-vs.-Pritzker general will likely set records in ad spending.\n\n3. Does an incumbent Dem congressman go down to defeat?\n\nNo. Incumbent Rep. Dan Lapinski BARELY won, beating Dem challenger Marie Newman, 51 percent to 49 percent. The National Republican Congressional Committee released a statement last night trolling the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for not endorsing Lapinski. \"If the DCCC fought Republicans half as hard as their own party, I'd be worried for 2018,\" the NRCC said.\n\nBut the NRCC might not want to celebrate too much: Their candidate in this IL-3 district is Holocaust denier and white supremacist Arthur Jones, who was unopposed on the GOP side. Bottom line after the Lapinski-vs-Newman race: The Dem base appears to be SLIGHTLY more forgiving than the GOP base of ideological heresy.\n\n4. Which Democrat comes out ahead in the crowded race to face Peter Roskam in IL-6?\n\nIt's still unclear. With 86 percent of precincts reporting, planning commissioner Kelly Mazeski leads scientist Sean Casten by just 260 votes. But the outstanding vote appears to be favorable for Casten, and the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman gives him the edge.\n\nBy the way, while Illinois is a blue state, check out this difference in turnout: With 97 percent of precincts reporting, 1.2 million participated in the Dem gubernatorial primary, versus 680,000 in the GOP primary. That's almost a 2-to-1 margin. By contrast, in 2014 when Democrat Pat Quinn was governor, 820,000 took part in the GOP gubernatorial primary, versus 447,000 on the Dem side.\n\nAnd in last night's competitive primaries in IL-12, which is represented by potentially vulnerable Rep. Mike Bost, 49,310 participated in the Democratic primary, while 37,742 participated in the GOP primary, where Bost had a challenger.\n\nYour authors have seen A LOT of different stories in the two decades we've covered politics -- the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Chandra Levy murder, Mark Foley, the recent Dem/GOP retirements in the wake of the #MeToo Movement. But we've NEVER seen these back-to-back-to-back stories in the span of just hours involving the president of the United States:\n\nThose are THREE different stories that broke in just the matter of hours in ONE day. The sheer volume of these kinds of stories involving Trump is stunning, especially for those of us who spent so much time covering that blue dress in the 1990s.\n\nHere's another striking finding from our most recent NBC/WSJ poll: The NRA's fav/unfav rating is underwater, with 37 percent viewing the organization positively and with 40 percent seeing it in a negative light (-3). That's a noticeable shift from April 2017, when it was 45 percent positive, 33 percent negative (+12).\n\nIn fact, it's the first time since before 2000 when the NRA has been viewed more negatively than positively in the NBC/WSJ poll.\n\nThe biggest drops for the NRA came from white married women (50 percent positive in April 2017, 35 percent now), urban residents (43 percent positive in April, 28 percent now), white women (47 percent positive in April, 33 percent now) and moderate/soft Republicans (72 percent positive in April, 60 percent now).\n\nFinally, here are some numbers that show how the gender/racial/education divides in our politics are only increasing, according to a new Pew study based on interviews with more than 10,000 registered voters in all of 2017.",

And they have an almost supernatural sense of smell.\n\nNow Chinese researchers have sequenced the genome of the American cockroach and discovered why they are so hard to kill.\n\nIt's all in the DNA, they report in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe American cockroach, known scientifically as Periplanta Americana, has an enormous genome, Shuai Zhan and colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, found.\n\nAnd it's more closely related to termites than it is to German cockroaches, despite their shared unsanitary habits and ability to horrify homeowners and terrorize tenants.\n\nCockroaches spread germs and can aggravate asthma and allergies.\n\n\"The harm of American cockroaches is becoming more serious with the threat of global warming,\" Zhan's team wrote. \"Our study may shed light on both controlling and making use of this insect.\"\n\nAnd the DNA explains why they are so prolific.\n\nWhen under stress, females can lay unfertilized eggs that will hatch in a process called parthenogenesis or \"virgin\" reproduction. The team found genes that explain how this can happen.\n\nThey can also survive terrible injuries.\n\n\"The American cockroach has a strong capability of limb regeneration during the nymph stages, which is the main reason to call it 'Xiao Qiang' in China,\" the researchers wrote. The name translates as \"little mighty one,\" and the team found genetic pathways that underlie the process.\n\nDNA can also explain their noxious habits.\n\n\"Cockroaches generally live in moist and unsanitary areas and are particularly fond of fermenting foods; thus, they have numerous opportunities to be exposed to microbes and pathogens,\" the team wrote. The insects have extra genes related to chemoreception, or smell.\n\nAnd the insects have evolved sophisticated ways to deal with their dirty environments. Their cells respond to infection with bacteria and fungi by secreting antimicrobial peptides that go into the hemolymph -- the juice that squirts out when you stomp on a roach.\n\nPlus they have natural detoxification mechanisms. Targeting these genetic pathways might be a better way to kill the pests, the Shanghai researchers suggested.\n\nIt also might be possible to exploit these properties, they said.\n\n\"Beyond serving as a pest, this cockroach is also important in traditional Chinese medicine, well documented in Chinese medical encyclopedias,\" they wrote. \"Moreover, its ethanol extract has been developed as a prescribed drug (Kang Fu Xin Ye) for wound healing and tissue repair.\"\n\nUnderstanding the genetic secrets could help scientists replicate the cockroach's superpowers, they said.",

                "title": "Work stress can be contagious: Here's how to fight back",
                "body": "Stress is contagious and coping with it at work can be difficult, but there are some strategies to help.Rafal Rodzoch / Caiaimage - Getty Images\n\nAccording to a study from the Max Planck Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, in coordination with the Technische Universitat in Dresden, being around someone who's currently stressed can increase your own stress levels.\n\nDescribed as a form of \"empathetic stress,\" this effect is quantifiable -- meaning it can be directly measured. It isn't a case of imagining yourself as more stressed while you're around a stressed person; it's a case of measurable hormones being released into your bloodstream that actively increase your stress levels.\n\nAs you might imagine, these effects are more strongly correlated with individuals who share a significant connection. In the study, subjects were more likely to exhibit a stress response while observing a stressed loved one than they were a stressed stranger. However, proximity wasn't much of a differentiator -- watching a stressed person through a one-way mirror and watching a video of a stressed person yielded similar results to observing a stressed individual in person.\n\nWhat does this mean for you, the stress-conscious professional who's constantly moving to reduce the stress in your life? First, it could lend some substantial reasoning to your situation -- if you feel exceptionally stressed, look around you. Are your coworkers constantly stressed? Is your boss always stressed? Is your spouse always stressed at home? If any of these are true, the empathetic stress you experience could be compounding the natural stressors of your life.\n\nSecond, it means there are actionable steps you can take to reduce the amount of stress in your life, in addition to personal habit changes like eating healthier and exercising; you can modify your environments by shaping the behaviors of others, thereby reducing the collective stress of your home or workplace.\n\nIt's not always possible to remove yourself from a stressful situation, but when it is possible, make an effort to do so. For example, if two coworkers near you are venting to each other about the increased workloads of the group, get up and take a walk away from them.\n\nIf you find yourself especially frustrated about a particular task or a recent event at your desk, go outside for a breath of fresh air. This is going to do one or both of two things; first, it could reduce your exposure to other stressed people, thereby reducing your empathetic stress reaction. Second, it could prevent your personal stress from affecting others, thereby reducing the empathetic stress reaction of the group.\n\nOf course, avoidance is neither an effective nor a possible strategy in all situations. If a coworker is venting to you as a confidant, getting up to leave might cause more stress than it reduces. Use your best judgment, and remove yourself only as you feel it is appropriate.\n\nHelp everyone in your environment understand the effects and dangers of empathetic stress, and work with individuals in the group to introduce and enforce stress-relieving habits. For example, you could lead a lunch break workshop on stress relieving habits, such asdeep breathing exercises or regular physical exercise. You can't always prevent stress in your life, but you can take measures to stop it from affecting you chronically.\n\nIf everyone in your office or household started practicing one new stress-relieving habit, each individual's stress would decrease slightly. This individual decrease would have a cascading effect as the cumulative effects of empathetic stress gradually reduce and everyone is able to function more efficiently.",

                "title": "Ahed Tamimi: Teenager becomes symbol of Palestinian resistance",
                "body": "NABI SALEH, West Bank -- The online footage of a 16-year-old Palestinian girl, Ahed Tamimi, slapping and punching armed Israeli soldiers towering over her reverberated around the world.\n\nAfter being arrested with her mother, Nariman, days after the Dec. 15 incident, the teen with long blond curly hair swiftly became a global symbol of resistance to Israeli occupation.\n\nTamimi, now 17, did that by simply bucking a longstanding stereotype of Palestinian activists -- hoary old warriors and rock-throwing young men -- and in the process electrifying a Palestinian population disheartened by years of settlement-building on land envisioned as a future state. She also prompted renewed international attention on Israel's occupation of the West Bank, and on the Palestinian cause in general.\n\nThe teen's fate now lies in the hands of an Israeli military judge who is weighing charges of incitement and assault. She has been imprisoned since her arrest, and her trial was scheduled to resume Sunday behind closed doors. Family members told NBC News it had been postponed until March 21.\n\nSineen Amereh, 16, a Palestinian resident of Arab-majority east Jerusalem, has no doubt about Tamimi's importance to her people's struggle against the occupation, as well as to the role of girls in that resistance.\n\n\"She's a perfect idol for all girls her age -- nobody before has done something like that,\" said Amereh, an 11th grader. \"If we weren't brave, then the Israeli soldiers would think we're weak, think we will just give up.\"\n\nAmereh says she and others are scared of soldiers like the ones Tamimi faced, but her fellow teen's actions have given her confidence to stand up to injustice.\n\n\"Everyone is afraid, but we will keep fighting because it is not easy to give up on your land, on your home,\" said Amereh.\n\nIt is commonly felt by Arabs in east Jerusalem and the West Bank -- which Israel has occupied since the 1967 war with Syria, Jordan and Egypt -- that Israel is deliberately driving Palestinians from their homes. From 1967 to 2016, some 200 Jewish settlements housing around 600,000 people were built on occupied land, according to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem. There are some 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli checkpoints limit the movement of Palestinians, and many cannot get to land that they say is legally theirs but lies near Jewish communities. Meanwhile, a process to create an independent Palestinian state as part of a \"two-state solution\" has foundered.\n\nWhile Ahed Tamimi has excited many Palestinians hoping to end decades of statelessness, she and her family have been denounced in Israel for being, at best, terrorist-sympathizers who train children to deliberately provoke soldiers on film to discredit the country and its army.\n\n\"It's an extended family that committed terror attacks, and she's part of this theater,\" said Anat Berko, a member of Israel's Parliament and an expert on female and child Palestinian suicide bombers.\n\n\"You're speaking about a society that used and abused those children,\" Berko said of the Palestinians, adding that filmed episodes involving Tamimi and her family were classic \"Pallywood\" -- an attempt to manipulate the media to score public relations points against Israel.\n\nBerko praised the Israeli military -- \"the best soldiers on earth\" -- who have been criticized for heavy-handedness in this and other cases.\n\n\"She slapped a soldier and he didn't do anything,\" Berko said. \"An American soldier or a British soldier -- do you think he would let her push him in such a way?\"\n\nBerko does not question the Tamimis' authenticity, but others have.\n\nIsraeli Deputy Minister Michael Oren sparked outrage in January after admitting that the Tamimis had been the subject of a classified investigation into whether they actually \"light-skinned\" actors and not a real family.\n\nAhed Tamimi has long been filmed and photographed protesting and confronting soldiers in Nabi Saleh, a cluster of buildings on a couple of hillocks in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nAn Israeli watchtower sits in a gray-walled base on the road into town. Next to it a sign warns in white lettering against red: \"The Entrance For Israeli Citizens Is Forbidden, Dangerous To Your Lives And Against The Israeli Law.\"\n\nRows of neat red-roofed houses sit within sight of the village. This is Halamish, a Jewish settlement deemed illegal by international law.\n\nIn 2009, led by Ahed Tamimi's father, Bassem Tamimi, villagers and rights groups started holding weekly Friday protests against what they saw as the settlement's expropriation of land and appropriation of the village's water source -- a spring.\n\nIn a recent act of violence in Halamish, a Palestinian man broke into a home in July and fatally stabbed three member of one family\n\nNabi Saleh has an estimated population of around 600, almost all of whom are Tamimis, a clan famous for its decades-long resistance to Israeli occupation. Hundreds of villagers have been detained, wounded or killed protesting.\n\nIn 2011, Mustafa Tamimi died after a tear-gas canister hit him in the face at close range as he threw rocks at soldiers. In 2012, Rushdi Tamimi was shot dead by Israeli soldier while he was throwing stones. Tamimi's cousin Ahlam Tamimi was imprisoned for her involvement in a 2001 suicide bombing of a Jerusalem pizza restaurant that killed 15 and wounded more than 120.\n\nA handful of Israeli soldiers stand smoking on the side of the main road into Nabi Saleh one day last week. Three skinny young men hover around 100 yards away. A couple of hours later, a series of booms echo up the hill, sending a herd of goats scurrying to the edge of a field. White clouds of tear gas drift over the rocky ground before dispersing.\n\nA few children wander the town's streets, chatting and joking with journalists. One is Mohammed Tamimi, 15, a gangly boy who looks like part of his skull has been sliced off at an angle.\n\nAccording to the family, Mohammed's injury provoked Ahed's outburst in December. Family, rights activists and journalists who have seen medical documents say he was shot in the head by an Israeli soldier minutes before the confrontation in the front yard of Ahed's house.\n\nAt least one Israeli military official contests that account, and says Mohammed admitted during interrogation that he was injured falling off a bicycle. Later, Mohammed said he had been under duress during the detention -- part of regular sweeps of Nabi Saleh's young people -- and was afraid he wouldn't be let go if he told the truth.\n\nIsrael has been criticized for its arrests of boys and more recently girls -- a trend Ahed has been part of.\n\nIn 2015, one out of every 250 inmates in Israeli prisons was a girl, according to Ayed Abu Eqtaish of the Defense for Children International Palestine, which advocates for the rights of minors in Israeli detention. After October 2015, that ratio rose to around 10 girls out of every 300 inmates.\n\nAmnesty International has also criticised Ahed's detention, saying in a statement that \"footage of this incident shows that she posed no actual threat and that her punishment is blatantly disproportionate.\"\n\nShe's also garnered the support of a series of public figures in the U.S., including the N.F.L.'s Michael Bennett, the academic Cornel West, and the actors Danny Glover and Rosario Dawson, who signed a petition calling for her release.\n\nThe comedian Sarah Silverman provoked praise as well as outrage when she said on Twitter that Jewish people had \"to stand up EVEN when -- ESPECIALLY when -- the wrongdoing is BY Jews/the Israeli government.\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on this story, an Israeli military spokesperson said in a statement that \"unfortunately, in recent years, many minors, sometimes very young, have been involved in violent incidents including acts of terror, and other offenses.\"\n\n\"When the law is enforced against minors, it is done taking their age into account,\" it added.\n\nPrivately some Palestinians are asking whether they should allow their sons and daughters to get caught up in protests at all. While there has been no public discussion on the issue, Nabi Saleh's children haven't held a protest in weeks.\n\nOne Palestinian who asked not to be named because he didn't want to put his children in the public eye said that while he admires Ahed as a fighter for Palestinian rights, he would not wish for his own daughter to do the same.\n\n\"She should go to school and be at home,\" he said.\n\nAhed's younger cousin Janna, 11, does not stay at home. She calls herself the world's youngest journalist and has some 275,000 followers on Facebook, where she goes by the name Janna Jihad. She's been active since the age of 6 or 7.\n\nJanna speaks English with an American accent, and finishes many of her statements with, \"So yeah.\"\n\n\"I wanted to be the voice of the Palestinian children and send their message to all the world,\" Janna said. \"Let this world know about our suffering our feelings, our parents getting killed, our sisters and brothers getting injured and arrested.\"\n\nJanna then climbed a tree next door to pick green almonds for her family and guests, before kicking a soccer ball up the road outside Ahed's home.\n\nBassem Tamimi, Ahed's father, is exhausted by the constant media requests, as well as from looking after three children without his wife -- who remains in jail too -- while also working at the Interior Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nAn experienced activist, he has been detained many times by Israeli authorities, and convicted of \"sending people to throw stones, and holding a march without permit.\"\n\nAmnesty International has called Bassem Tamimi a prisoner of conscience, while the European Union has labeled him a human rights defender.\n\nA tour of Ahed's bedroom reveals orange walls out of the 1970s, dirty clothes spilling out of a hamper and posters of Ahed on one of two single beds covered in rumpled purple sheets.\n\nWhile Tamimi says he's slept in his daughter's bed a few times since she went to jail, he is unsentimental about raising his children to fight the Israeli occupation. For one thing, he said, it is impossible to keep them out of trouble, what with regular military raids and the presence of soldiers.\n\n\"In India they give a small amount of poison to every child born to protect him and defend him from the snakes,\" he said. \"And we must train ourselves from the snakes in our life, the occupation.\"\n\nHis children have no choice but to live under occupation where \"there was no safe place,\" he said.\n\nBut, he adds, \"if you give me a promise from your country, and European countries ... if we have a promise that the occupation will leave our life [in] 10 years, I will send [Ahed] to be a dancer.\"",

Or is there a way to use the \"free\" social media platform without allowing it to make money off your personal data?\n\nRevelations that the Trump-linked political data firm Cambridge Analytica skirted Facebook's privacy policies to suck up data on over 50 million Americans, and undercover videos showing the company executives boasting about their deceptive campaign tactics are just the nudge some users need to quit the platform entirely, judging by the social media outcry that sent the hashtag #deletefacebook trending Tuesday.\n\nOne of the loudest voices came from Brian Acton, co-founder of WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased in 2014. \"It is time. #deletefacebook\" he told his Twitter followers.\n\nAs the saying goes, when the service is free, you are the product.\n\n\"All data-based companies use collected data to make money. Where we draw the line on what they can and can't do is the $64,000 question right now,\" said Raj Goyle, former deputy legal director of the ACLU and co-CEO and co-founder of legal tech site Bodhala. \"It's extremely hard for people to safely use a platform when they are not completely sure what they should be protecting themselves against, and what warning signs they should be looking for.\"\n\nBut for those who can't quite quit Facebook, there are ways to at least minimize the site's ability to monetize your personal information without entirely losing the ability to see what cute thing your cousin's baby gurgled this hour or what your co-worker thinks of his sandwich.\n\nFor starters, you can go into your applications tab. Under \"Apps, Websites, and Plugins\" hit the edit tab and \"Disable Platform.\" This will stop your data from streaming through Facebook's API, which is how third parties see all your activity. It will also prevent you from logging in to other sites with Facebook, shut down your Instagram access, and you won't be able to play platform-based apps like \"Farmville\" anymore.\n\nIf that's too much and you're mainly just bothered about the news that your friends who use an app could end up sharing your data even if you never used the app or got any notification, then uncheck all the radio buttons under the \"Apps others use\" heading for the pieces of data you don't want your friends to share.\n\nEach button warns you that might not be able to use certain apps on Facebook and other sites, but if you just bookmark the address above then you can go always go back and re-enable something if you later find a web service isn't working the way you want it to.\n\nThe sharing doesn't stop there. \"Even if your profile is set to private,\" said Ron Schlecht, managing founder of cybersecurity firm BTB Security, your likes, tagged photos, and other details, \"can be made available to people who are not your friends or outside your social network.\"\n\nSome people try to hide by using a fake name or persona on Facebook. But the cellphone number or email address they used to authenticate themselves is connected to all that data, said Schlecht.\n\nThat personal identifier can then be connected by data brokers to other sources of your data and reconnect your profile. So while you might be hidden from your old high-school boyfriend or boss, the data miners can still find you.\n\nThis is why it can be good to download a copy of all your Facebook data. It can be a memento of all your Facebook activity, but it can also be a learning experience to see just how much information you're sharing. Go under \"Settings\" and select the option to download your data. It will take a few minutes and the information will come in a few folders, including one that divides up your friends based on whether they're part of your \"starting adult life\" or \"established adult life,\" along with a file of your facial recognition information called facedata.htm.\n\n\"In addition to raising questions about Facebook's role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies,\" wrote EFF, a non-profit digital privacy and rights advocacy group.\n\nUltimately, it may be a contradiction to think that anyone can use a website designed to connect people and their data together and not have their information exploited.\n\n\"It's not possible to use Facebook safely because the platform is about putting vast amounts of personal information in one place,\" said Goyle. \"Technology is so well developed that it can accurately analyze scraps of information to reconstruct whole profiles of valuable user data. Facebook itself cannot fully protect users from companies and people who want to make use of that information - nor does it seem to want to.\"",

                "title": "Opinion | Trump knows what Dems don't: voters don't care about the deficit",
                "body": "President Donald Trump pumps his fist after speaking at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on March 13, 2018 in San Diego, California.Kevin Lamarque / Reuters file\n\nPresident Donald Trump has overseen a $1 trillion increase in the national debt since coming into office just 14 months ago, pushing the total debt north of $21 trillion.\n\nBut don't worry about it. There's nothing scary about today's debt or deficit figures on their own -- and Republicans know that complaining about the deficit doesn't move the needle much on Election Day.\n\nYes, Trump rode into office promising to eliminate the national debt by the end of a second term and to make great budget deals for the country, only to preside over trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. And, yes, $21 trillion sounds like a big number, especially because the spending bill coming down the pike in Congress this week would accelerate the accumulation even more. (Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week provided public reassurances that the White House still has debt reduction as a goal.) And yes, congressional Republicans who did nothing but complain about the deficit and debt under former President Barack Obama have proven themselves to be hypocrites by casting their fiscal concerns aside now that someone with an R after his name is in the White House.\n\nBut the deficit also doesn't hurt anybody politically. Per the polls, voters do not rank fiscal matters such as the debt very high on the list of things they care about: Of all the critiques of Trump, \"too much government spending\" is nowhere to be found amid the lax response to Russian election meddling and porn star intrigue.\n\nAnd there's nothing inherently wrong about borrowing in order to pay for things that matter. In fact, that's exactly what a government overseeing an economy like the U.S.'s should be doing: Using every tool at its disposal to fund programs that improve the lives of its citizens. Criticizing the debt on moral grounds, or because the number sounds like a big one when devoid of context, misses the point.\n\nFirst, the U.S. prints its own money, so the government is not going to run out of it. Second, inflation -- which should eventually rise as the government spends, hurting everyone's purchasing ability -- is low, as it has been for years. Rising inflation would indicate that the U.S. economy is maxed out and running too hot; its relative absence indicates the opposite.\n\nMeanwhile, the debt crisis that so many analysts and members of Congress have warned about since the government first started responding to the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession hasn't come, nor is there a hint it will anytime soon. As a percentage of the economy, the deficit is still just half what is was during the worst of those years.\n\nWhile talking about the deficit may help some members of Congress score cheap political points with partisans (particularly when the opposing party holds the White House), there's no evidence that increasing the deficit causes any politician a real problem on Election Day. If anything, it's the opposite, as politicians who never preside over deficit reduction handily win re-election all the time.\n\nAnd that makes sense: Spending helps the government do tangible things for people, which those people see, feel and vote on. Their actual experience with the economy is far more important than some theoretical debate about debt with consequences that never arrive.\n\nThe GOP today then is just following the well-worn tradition of Republicans coming into office having made lots of promises about deficit reduction, only to throw them all out the window and pay no political price. President Ronald Reagan played that game, as did President George W. Bush. In 2002, then-Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly made a key observation: \"Reagan proved deficits don't matter.\" In the 1980s, Reagan oversaw America crossing the $1 trillion debt threshold for the first time, despite his professed deficit concerns; the current trajectory means that some future president will face $2 trillion annual deficits.\n\nAnd just like in 2018, the reason for those deficit numbers under Reagan was pretty simple: Tax cuts and defense spending increases. The recently-enacted Republican tax plan will cost some $1.5 trillion over a decade. The GOP has also pushed for more defense spending, even as the U.S. outspends all of its most important geopolitical rivals in that department combined.\n\nTherein, though, lies the proper line of critique when it comes to the national debt: Not the top-line number, but what is being bought with the borrowing. The Republican tax plan, for instance, is a problem not because of the cost, but because of who it benefitted -- which is largely wealthy Americans and big corporations. Spending that same $1.5 trillion on something like infrastructure or tax breaks purely for low-income folks would have been a much better use of the money because it would have impacted more people per dollar and been a long-term investment in America's economic vitality.\n\nUntil the economy is at full employment (which, even at the current low unemployment rate, is almost certainly not yet the case), deficit spending is going to improve things for more people than it will hurt.\n\nWhat matters is what the government buys, not that it borrows. And if the worst should happen, the Federal Reserve can always step in and cool things down by hiking interest rates.\n\nSo Trump and his team should rest assured that the deficit is not something of which it should be afraid. In fact, their best political move is to ignore the debt scolds entirely until the economy is undeniably humming along at full strength. And for Democrats, the lesson is clear: Turning into deficit hawks won't turn you into election-winners.",

                "body": "CHICAGO -- Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, narrowly won a primary Tuesday over a progressive newcomer who argued the congressman's views no longer reflect the Chicago-area district he has represented for seven terms.\n\nMarie Newman, who was little-known when she decided to challenge Lipinski for the seat he inherited from his father, had backing from progressive groups as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won Illinois' 3rd Congressional District by 9 points over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\nWith 97 percent of precincts reporting votes, Lipinski's margin over Newman was less than 2 percentage points. She told supporters in an email earlier Tuesday night that \"there's a good chance we wake up in recount mode.\"\n\nBut recounts are unusual in Illinois, and the process is a difficult one.\n\nAlthough the Blue Dog caucus of moderate and conservative Democrats of which Lipinski is a part already has dwindled in recent years, his close nomination fight could embolden liberals in other races across the country.\n\nShe campaigned as the \"true Democrat,\" blasting Lipinski for opposing abortion and voting against same-sex marriage and President Barack Obama's signature health care overhaul.\n\nLipinski was first elected in 2004, taking over a seat his father held for more than two decades. He faced little serious competition since then in the heavily Democratic district, which includes parts of Chicago's southwest side and several suburbs.\n\nLipinski described himself as a \"workhorse\" who delivered for the district, bringing in federal transportation dollars and jobs. That helped earn him the support of many labor organizations, including the Illinois AFL-CIO.\n\nHe has called Newman and her supporters a \"tea party of the left\" and says their efforts to drive out Democrats with differing views will hurt the party and add to gridlock in Washington. Democrats, he said, should be united in fighting President Donald Trump, not going after each other.\n\n\"It's been blasting from both sides,\" said Joe Nowak, a 36-year-old trucking company employee who lives and voted in Summit. He said he didn't care about issues about guns or abortion but that he was supporting Lipinski because \"he's been around the neighborhood.\"\n\nBut Suzanne Riordon, a 56-year-old investment banker from suburban Brookfield, said Lipinski has been a disappointment. She was particularly angry about his vote against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I don't think Lipinski has our best interest at heart as a democrat and for what we want, what we the people have been asking for. He doesn't listen to us,\" she said. \"He's been my congressman for a long time and I don't think he stands for what we stand for.\"\n\nNewman is a small-business owner who also runs an anti-bullying organization. She says she will push for health care for all, a $15 minimum wage and a path to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe GOP nominee is Arthur Jones, a self-proclaimed Nazi and Holocaust denier who was the only Republican to file for the office after the Illinois Republican Party unsuccessfully tried to recruit a candidate.",

In a statement Tuesday, Savage noted the \"passionate opinions\" that the case had stirred up and said he had \"come to understand Jules' vantage point better, and to appreciate the courage it took for her to speak up.\"\n\n\"When Jules cried out for justice, I carelessly turned the topic to my own story of moral change, as if getting my own life in order should help to make up for what she went through and continues to go through,\" said Savage, who acknowledged for the first time that he took advantage of Woodson without her consent in what he called an \"abuse of power.\"\n\n\"I agree with Jules that, of all places, we as the Church should be getting this right,\" Savage said, adding: \"After much prayer and counsel, I now believe it's appropriate for me to resign from my staff position at Highpoint Church and step away from ministry in order to do everything I can to right the wrongs of the past.\"\n\nWoodson went public with her story in January, writing on Watch Keep, a blog for victims of abuse, that she was inspired to come forward by the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. In the blog post, Woodson said Savage drove her to a deserted back road and sexually assaulted her, then asked for forgiveness and pleaded with her \"not to tell anyone what had just happened.\"\n\nThe Montgomery County, Texas, district constable's office said that it interviewed Woodson in early January but that the statute of limitations had expired and that no charges could be filed.\n\nWoodson told the Commercial-Appeal newspaper of Memphis on Tuesday that she was \"trying to process\" the news of Savage's resignation and was considering releasing a statement later.\n\nChris Conlee, Highpoint's lead pastor, said in January that the church knew of the 1998 incident when it hired Savage and that church leaders had \"total confidence in the redemptive process Andy went through under his leadership in Texas.\"\n\nBut in a new statement Tuesday, the church said its initial backing of Savage was \"defensive rather than empathetic in its initial reaction to Ms. Jules Woodson's communication.\" Highpoint said the church would commit itself to \"develop a deeper understanding of an appropriate, more compassionate response to victims of abuse.\"\n\nHighpoint said it had asked MinistrySafe, a legal institute in Fort Worth, Texas, that works with churches to address child sexual abuse cases, to investigate its training, policies, screening practices and supervision in ministries serving minors.",

Ahh, the never-ending battle.\n\n\"When we add up these time surveys ... we know men are doing more than ever,\" Dr. Orbuch says. \"Nonetheless, women continue to do more in terms of home labor and child care than men. [And] regardless of division of household labor women still do the emotional responsibility ... they're still responsible for organizing who does what around the house or saying to partner will you do x, y, or x?\"\n\nTrue. I may not be using the word 'help,' but that's still what I'm asking for when I request my husband's presence in the laundry room.\n\nAnd it just takes one look at the response to the Harper's Bazaar article or the viral Facebook post to see many people are ready for a change.\n\nSo ditching the word help might be one step, but how do we get to the next level, the one where, semantics aside, it's not necessary to ask for anything? Deleting a word won't change anything \"unless we also have a discussion about how women feel when [their partner] says help,\" says Dr. Orbuch, \"and about how women do a disproportionate share of emotional labor.\"\n\n\"Language is one important thing to change perceptions and improve relationships,\" Dr. Orbuch goes on, \"but the other, probably more important one, is that we have to share our expectations and beliefs and feelings.\"\n\nAnd we can get there. The dream of an equitable relationship with both partners shouldering their fair share of the burden isn't just a dream. \"We know that when boys grow up in families where they're expected to do around the house or they see fathers doing around the house as much as mothers that they also do, they grow up doing,\" Dr. Orbuch says. \"Men are not wired genetically not to do home labor or childcare. In different cultures and ethnicities men do more around the house and with childcare.\"\n\nSo, yes, conversations are in order. But please, let's start with digging in when it comes to that four letter word. We don't need help, we need partners.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe most common sexually transmitted disease can double a woman's risk of ovarian cancer, according to new research released Thursday.\n\nWomen who had chronic chlamydia infections had twice the risk of ovarian cancer compared to women with no evidence of ever having been infected, researchers are expected to report at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in April.\n\n\"Our data is lending support for there being a role of pelvic inflammatory disease in ovarian cancer and the prime cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, particularly in the U.S., is chlamydia infection,\" the National Cancer Institute's Britton Trabert told a briefing ahead of the meeting.\n\n\"We are seeing a doubling in ovarian cancer risk with a prior history of pelvic inflammatory disease.\"\n\nOvarian cancer is not common, but it will be diagnosed in more than 21,000 American women this year and it will kill more than 14,000. It is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women, killing 55 percent of patients within five years.\n\nChlamydia is very common. More than 1.5 million Americans have chlamydia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics, but it often causes no symptoms, so people can be infected for months or even years and not know it.\n\nOver time, chlamydia causes widespread inflammation that that cause infertility. This new study suggests it may also cause cancer.\n\nThe team was unable to test for gonorrhea, another extremely common sexually transmitted infection that also causes pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\nA doubling of risk doesn't raise the number of cases significantly, but there are not many known causes now, aside from genetics.\n\nThe single best-known risk factor is a family history of ovarian cancer. But most cases are in women with no known family history of ovarian cancer. Women with endometriosis -- an overgrowth of the uterine lining -- have a higher risk of ovarian cancer.\n\nScreening for ovarian cancer is tricky because the symptoms are vague. They can include bloating, which can be caused by something as simple as a heavy meal.\n\nThat's why knowing that an infection raises risks can be useful. Trabert said more studies will be needed to show if quickly treating chlamydia lowers risk of cancer and, of course, to confirm whether infection raises the risk in the first place.\n\nTrabert's team looked at two different studies -- one in Poland, which involved 278 ovarian cancer cases and 556 women without cancer, and a U.S. study comparing 160 ovarian cancer patients and 159 people without.\n\nThey tested blood samples of the patients for an antibody that shows when someone has been infected with chlamydia.\n\nIn both studies, women with evidence of previous chlamydia infection were twice as likely to be in the ovarian cancer group. Women with antibodies against other infections, such as herpes or hepatitis, were not more likely to have ovarian cancer. And women infected with HPV, which is known to cause other types of cancer, did not have a higher risk of ovarian cancer.",

                "body": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nHalf a million years ago, something big happened in east Africa.\n\nIt was a big enough change to transform the terrain, reshape the landscape and to alter the populations of animals living there.\n\nAnd it completely transformed the early humans who lived there.\n\n\"What we are seeing is the demise of a way of life in early human ancestors that persisted for hundreds of thousands of years,\" said paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, who heads the Smithsonian's Human Origins Program.\n\nBefore the change, pre-humans such as Homo erectus had lived happily for millennia using crude, heavy stone axes. Afterwards, the early humans living in the area traded for sharp, strong obsidian and made delicate tools and spear heads. They learned to hunt new kinds of animals and they carried around a lot of raw materials for making black and red paint or ink.\n\nNew studies from Potts and colleagues published Thursday paint a clear picture of a time of total disruption in what is now southwestern Kenya. Not only do they document periods of devastating earthquakes, but climate change that transformed the area from a rich, stable plain to an area ravaged by unpredictable floods, intense thunderstorms and then long droughts.\n\nThere's not much evidence of anything between about 500,000 years ago, and 320,000 years ago. But the transformation is sweeping.\n\nGiant ancestors of elephants, zebra and baboon-like apes disappeared, to be replaced by more modern-looking grazers such as antelope and oryx.\n\nThe humans who lived there changed -- a lot. Big, clumsy stone axes known as Acheulean tools disappear and instead the archeologists found finer, lighter and more varied tools. They're made from materials not found locally, such as obsidian and chert, which indicates they were carried and traded over distances.\n\n\"The large, clunky technology is gone and in its place is a smaller technology, more mobile,\" said Potts. \"What we are looking at is a real change from the hand ax times. Think of the same technology produced over and over again for hundreds of thousands of years. That's not us. I can barely keep up with the latest version of Windows,\" he said.\n\n\"The history of technology has been the same ever since, going from large and clunky to small and portable.\"\n\nIt's not clear which species of early humans is responsible for the artifacts. Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis both lived on the African continent. But Homo sapiens fossils from Morocco date back to 300,000 or so years ago.\n\n\"This represents a significant revision in African hominin behavior at or near the time of origin of Homo sapiens,\" the teams of scientists wrote in one of the reports published in the journal Science on Thursday.\n\nWhatever species they were, they had to adapt to the climate changes, the natural disasters and the disappearance of the foods they were used to eating; they had to learn how to communicate with other groups of hominids, how to trade information and trade tools and, possibly, food.\n\n\"All of these are fundamental aspects of our humanity that are right there at the beginning of our species,\" Potts said.\n\nThe ancient people used dye.\n\nThe team found rocks with streaks of pigment, blocks of iron-rich minerals used to make ochre and other colors, and pretty colored stones carried from afar.\n\nThat shows people were thinking beyond the simple needs of survival.\n\n\"Color is the root of complex, symbolic behavior in humans,\" said Potts. \"We use it in clothing, uniforms, flags, tattoos -- whatever ways we have of signaling that I am a member of this particular group.\"\n\nWhat were these early Africans doing with the lumps of coloring?\n\n\"We don't know what they were applying it to but they almost certainly applying it to something; perhaps their skin or hair,\" Pott said. \"That is a pretty human characteristic.\"\n\nIn other words, the early humans who lived in this area were becoming more like modern humans. And it sure looks like the dramatic changes were forcing it.\n\n\"All this transition, this transformation of human behavior is occurring at a time of upheaval of the landscape,\" Potts said.\n\nIt's not news to anyone that human beings adapt and even evolve in the face of change. As the Ice Age glaciers receded, so did Neanderthals, to be replaced by modern Homo sapiens from the Near East and Africa.\n\nBut this change was happening 320,000 years ago. The indications are that trade was taking place 100,000 years earlier than anthropologists have believed.\n\nWhat do the changes say about humans alive today in a time of climate change?\n\n\"We certainly are running an experiment right now where humans are taking what is already a dynamic planet and messing with it,\" Potts said.\n\nThe findings in Kenya indicate people can likely survive. \"I tend to be optimistic in that the adaptability of human beings tends to be pretty astonishing,\" Potts said.\n\nBut he points to the profound transformation of the hominids of prehistoric Kenya.\n\n\"Often what people mean by survival in a modern context means whether their way of life will persist and thrive,\" he added. \"The moral of this story is that the status quo does not survive.\"",
