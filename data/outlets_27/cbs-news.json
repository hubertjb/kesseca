                "title": "Will Republicans' accomplishments suffice for voters this fall?",
                "body": "With passage of an enormous budget bill, the GOP-controlled Congress all but wrapped up its legislating for the year. But will it be enough to convince voters to give Republicans another term at the helm?\n\nIn two big ways, Republicans have done what they promised. They passed a long sought tax overhaul bill that slashed tax rates. They've rolled back regulations, in ways they claim are boosting the economy. In the Senate, they confirmed a justice to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut there are signs Americans wanted more: immigration reforms, gun control legislation, even an infrastructure plan that President Trump promised voters. Tax cuts, for now, will have to do.\n\n\"It's very clear that tax reform was going to be the biggest legislative crown jewel of this Congress,\" said Matt Gorman, the spokesman for the House GOP's campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"That is a massive centerpiece of our campaign.\"\n\nBut polls swing wildly these days, strategists said. Voters are rarely focused for too long on single issues that can make or break campaigns, as when Republicans seized control of the House in 2010 amid the economic downturn or Democrats pushed to the majority in 2006 over opposition to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and congressional ethics scandals.\n\nMr. Trump's mixed messages on the GOP's accomplishments only make the campaigning more difficult. At the White House on Friday, he toyed with a veto of the $1.3 trillion budget package, complaining it lacked his immigration deal and smacked of overspending, before ultimately signing it. Such shifting views leave Republicans without a reliable partner as they try to push through political headwinds in what's expected to be a tough battle for majority control of the House and Senate.\n\nLawmakers left town for a two-week recess that marks the unofficial end of the legislating season having shelved resolution of other issues.\n\nCongress failed to pass legislation to curb rising health insurance premiums or protect young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation, two issues that have stirred voters this year. And ahead of the nationwide \"March for Our Lives\" protests against gun violence, lawmakers took modest steps to boost school safety funds and improve compliance with the federal gun purchase background check system.\n\nKris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the measures are \"just not enough.\"\n\n\"The American people have been screaming from the rooftops for real, bold change to fight against\" tragedies such as the Florida and Las Vegas shootings, Brown said. \"We have seen the consequences of Congress's inaction.\"\n\nCongress' spring agenda is thin. It includes modest plans to finish a banking bill that rolls back some of the regulations put in place after the financial crisis and pass a big farm bill that sets agriculture and school nutrition policies. The Senate also has to begin confirmation hearings for Trump's nominees for secretary of state and CIA director.\n\nThe one legislative lift will be another spending bill when the one Mr. Trump signed into law expires at the end of September. But it may bring more political risk than reward for Republicans, since conservatives largely sided with the president against this one, and could pose a more serious threat of voter revolt in the fall.\n\nStrategists say it will be up to candidates to make the case that GOP's signature legislative accomplishment is worth their re-election.\n\nDemocrats have been hammering on the tax law as a giveaway to big business, in part because the steep reduction in corporate rates, from 35 percent to 21 percent, is permanent while the reduced rates for individuals and other provisions for families, including expanded child tax credits, expire in coming years.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has derided the lopsided benefits for households as \"crumbs\" -- a quip Republicans eagerly throw back at Democrats.\n\nTo prop up public opinion of the GOP's top accomplishment, millions are being spent by outside groups. American Action Network, which is aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, is unleashing more than $30 million in ads, and the network backed by the influential Koch brothers will spend more than $20 million, heaping praise on lawmakers who voted for the tax cuts and informing voters about those who didn't.\n\nAnd with passage of tax cuts so important to the GOP election effort, Republicans might take the unusual step of trying to pass them again.\n\n\"We think there's more we can do,\" Ryan said.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are seriously considering legislation this summer -- \"Tax Cuts 2\" -- that would try to build on the original bill that became law in December by making the individual tax cuts permanent.\n\nA do-over tax cuts bill is not expected to pass this Congress. But setting up another showdown accomplishes political goals for Republicans by turning attention back on the tax law, and pushing Democrats into the uncomfortable position of voting against it, again.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, one of the groups in the Koch network, launched an ad campaign urging Congress to fortify the law by making tax cuts permanent. \"More needs to be done,\" the group says on a website for its advocacy.\n\n\"Even if there are things that get passed between now and the fall, the bottom line is the single most important piece of legislation is going to be the tax bill,\" said veteran strategist David Winston, who advises House and Senate GOP leadership. \"That defines what this Congress is about.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The \"March for Our Lives\" rallies unfolding in Washington, D.C., and across the country Saturday have attracted hundreds of thousands of people protesting gun violence, and a handful of prominent celebrities have pledged donations to support the cause and its participants. The movement, organized mainly by Never Again MSD (Marjory Stoneman Douglas), an organization set up by students in the aftermath of last month's deadly Parkland high school shooting, has attracted financial support from stars including Taylor Swift and George Clooney.\n\nSwift, who often stays quiet on social issues and started out her career as a country music star, broke her silence on gun control via Instagram. She announced Friday she donated, although didn't disclose an amount.\n\n\"No one should have to go to school in fear of gun violence,\" she said.\n\n\"I've made a donation to show my support for the students, for the March for Our Lives campaign, for everyone affected by these tragedies, and to support gun reform.\"\n\nSwift's announced donation came after pledges from other big names, including Clooney and his wife, Amal. They pledged a $500,000 contribution and also said they would join in the rally on Saturday.\n\n\"Amal and I are so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women from Stoneman Douglas High School,\" Clooney told People magazine. \"Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country, and in the name of our children Ella and Alexander, we're donating $500,000 to help pay for this groundbreaking event.\"\n\nLate last month, Oprah Winfrey matched the $500,000 donation.\n\nFamous Hollywood producer Steven Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw, said they would donate the same amount.\n\n\"The young students in Florida and now across the country are already demonstrating their leadership with a confidence and maturity that belies their ages,\" they said in a statement. \"Kate and I applaud their efforts to take a stand for the benefit of this and future generations. They are an inspiration to us all, and we are joining in this movement with a donation of $500,000.\"\n\nFilm executive Jeffrey Katzenberg also joined in, claiming he offered $500,000 to the movement.\n\nOrganizers hoped Saturday's rally in Washington would attract 500,000 people. Additional rallies were planned in more than 800 cities across the country and around the world.",

                "title": "Friends and peers on comedian Garry Shandling's lasting influence",
                "body": "When influential comedian Garry Shandling died two years ago, he was remembered as both a top standup comic and the creator of two of the most innovative sitcoms in television history: \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" and \"The Larry Sanders Show.\"\n\nNow, Shandling is the subject of the new documentary \"The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling,\" by fellow comedian and film director Judd Apatow. Apatow had incredible access to his hugely successful but highly insecure subject, including Shandling's personal journals, letters, recordings and videos.\n\nCBS News contributor Jamie Wax sat down with Apatow and Shandling's fellow performers Dave Coulier, Penny Johnson Jerald, and SNL alum Kevin Nealon. They are are all featured in the film and called Shandling a friend and inspiration.\n\n\"He was doing what we aspired to do and he was doing it well. He was - his craftsmanship of his jokes were amazing and his performance was great. And wanted to be like him,\" Nealon said.\n\n\"Everything Garry created was crafted with a certain tip of the hat towards his own vulnerability. And that made him extremely likeable,\" Coulier added.\n\nThat vulnerability is seen throughout Apatow's documentary.\n\n\"Working with Garry was always very difficult because he was as brilliant as anybody's ever been in comedy writing,\" Apatow said. So if you were writing with him, you know, it would be like tryin' to paint with Picasso. And Picasso's like, \"Why are you usin' red? I'm like, 'I don't know. I thought red worked here.'\"\n\nApatow's admiration came early. He was just 16 when he scored an interview with the comedian for his high school radio station.\n\n\"I was obsessed with comedy, and hunting down all my heroes to meet with them, and talk with them when I was in high school, and Garry was somebody that I really looked up to, even then,\" Apatow said.\n\nHe got the idea for the documentary after creating material for his funeral, material that went beyond the comedy Shandling was known for.\n\n\"Even though he struggled, his real focus was on being a better person, being a more loving person, being there for other people and it moved people, deeply in a way I had never seen before and I thought that there's probably a way to make a documentary that could inspire people and move people in the same way,\" Apatow said.\n\nAfter his death, Apatow learned about the stacks of journals Shandling left behind dating back to 1977.\n\n\"I wasn't overwhelmed. In the beginning it was very hard to just listen to him just as a friend, it's hard to watch everything and dive deep into his head,\" Apatow said.\n\nHe wrote in one entry: \"Your strength now is to move on to live moment-to-moment... That is discipline - it will require strength.\"\n\nThe material helped provide a rare glimpse into a public figure's private reality including how major incidents, like the death of his brother, shaped his life, influenced his creativity, and even affected his ability to trust.\n\n\"For me it was just so interesting thinking, 'I never knew this about Garry,'\" Coulier said. Added Jerald, \"But it's also like Garry's joke when he says his friends tell him that he has intimacy problems, but they don't know me.\"\n\nShandling spent his life trying to master his craft, but in fact the secret to his success may have been something you can't acquire - something you peel away.\n\n\"I think Garry taught us all and leaves with us all the freedom to be naked. And the ability to be able to laugh at yourself,\" Jerald said.\n\n\"I look at Garry as an innovator. Not only with his standup, but what he did for television,\" Coulier said.\n\n\"He taught me that real comedy comes from truth. Being honest,\" Nealon said.\n\nFor Apatow? \"I think basically what he was trying to say in all of his work is that people should love each other and take care of each other, and be kind. And when they aren't, it's funny.\"",

                "body": "Jess Wolfe from Los Angeles and Holly Laessig of Cleveland -- the frontwomen of indie pop band, Lucius -- met in Berklee College of Music in Boston. The first time they sang together, there was an instant connection.\n\n\"It was an automatic musical, vocal kinship,\" Wolfe said. \"We have very different voices separately of one another, but together, it formed pretty instantly this third entity.\"\n\n\"I think it was an accident at first because we were both gonna sing the melody. And we just both started singing it, and in the headphones 'cause we were in the studio ... it sounded like a double tracked vocal,\" Laessig said.\n\nThey moved to New York to form a band and began to dress alike - and then look alike, reports CBS News' Anthony Mason.\n\n\"We had a friend, our friend James, who was like, 'I mean, you sound like one, why don't you dress like one,'\" Wolfe said.\n\nLaessig said their look is still morphing every day. \"It definitely helps you become a different person... It's like a character. I think that was part of it for us from the beginning. You know to feel like we can also be transported along with the audience.\"\n\nThey released their debut album, \"Wildewoman,\" in 2013. Their follow up, \"Good Grief,\" lifted them into the top 100 of the Billboard's album chart. Their new album, \"Nudes,\" includes a performance with Roger Waters, who they met at the Newport Folk Festival in 2015.\n\n\"Jay Sweet, who runs Newport called us up and said Roger is doing a surprise set, and he's lookin' for some singers, and you're the ones. Can you do it?'\" Wolfe recalled. \"That show was incredibly special... Just an unforgettable moment and afterwards, he wrote us and said we're brothers and sisters now, let's do this again. And, oh, by the way, I'm doing a concert in the desert with Paul McCartney, Neil Young, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Who. Do you wanna do it?'\"\n\nThey performed at the Desert Trip Festival in California last spring and then joined Waters on his world tour. It was long, but it introduced Lucius to a new audience. Wolfe and Laessig have been singing together now for 13 years.\n\n\"It's like any relationship or thing that you find in your life that feels sort of, I don't know, dreamlike, or perfect,\" Wolfe said. \"There was never a moment where we said, 'we shouldn't be doing this.'\"",

Starting out as a puppeteer with Jim Henson in the 1960s, Oz was a driving force in the long-lasting success of \"The Muppets.\"\n\nFor his new documentary \"Muppet Guys Talking,\" Oz recruited four of his closest colleagues to discuss what made their work so special. Oz told \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" that the initial idea for the documentary actually came from his wife, a producer.\n\n\"She saw us guys, how we clowned around, and still cared about each other and screwed each other over but still love each other. But she'd never seen this kind of a work atmosphere and she wanted to get it out there,\" Oz said.\n\nAside from the unique working relationship among the group, the documentary explores how Jim Henson's legacy continues to live on in their work.\n\n\"If you see our documentary, you can have a sense of what - what was inside him is now inside us,\" Oz said. \"Jim never told us what to do. He never said anything. He never told me once. He just was himself and we learned through osmosis and just followed him.\"\n\nWhen asked about his recent comments on how Disney has handled \"The Muppets\" franchise in Henson's absence, Oz insisted he's not been \"critical\" but instead \"hopeful\"and \"pleading.\"\n\n\"Disney really wants to do a good job. They're really doing the very best they can,\" Oz said. \"The thing is what they don't understand is that one can't just write for 'The Muppets.' There are performers who have been with Jim for decades, and they're not being part of the process. Those people....They are brilliant. They know the soul. And I can't - I just wish they would be asked to be part of the creation, and that's what would make a success for Disney really.\"",

                "body": "The White House issued a simple statement Saturday, as hundreds of thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., New York and cities around the country and world to protest gun violence at March for Our Lives rallies. Mr. Trump is at his club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., this weekend, about 40 miles from the Parkland high school where 17 people were killed last month.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump has yet to issue any comments about the rallies from his Twitter account.\n\nWhite House press secretary Lindsay Walters said they \"applaud the many courageous young Americans\" speaking out Saturday, pointing to what Mr. Trump has done to address gun violence. The omnibus spending bill Mr. Trump signed Friday afternoon -- after threatening to veto it -- included provisions to strengthen the background check system and fund DOJ resources for stopping school threats.\n\nOn Friday Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions also announced the a new federal rule to ban bump stocks, a device used in last year's Las Vegas shooting that allows legal guns to function like automatic weapons.\n\n\"We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today,\" Walters said. \"Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the president's, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix NICS and STOP School Violence Acts, and signed them into law. Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the president's commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nMr. Trump has said he wants to be \"very strong\" on background checks, arm teachers and other campus officials, and perhaps raise the age for purchasing some guns from 18 to 21. But raising the age for gun purchases has little support from Republicans, who control both the House and Senate. The president has said some Republicans are \"petrified\" of the National Rifle Association, but maintains that the leaders of the NRA are \"great people.\"",

Counter-protesters and opposing activists shouted at one another. Police stepped in between the groups to keep the peace.\n\nWhen the counter-protesters moved to Boston Common, police officers on bicycles formed a perimeter around them to prevent any potential clashes.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, a pro-gun rally was taking place Saturday. CBS affiliate KUTV reports gun rights advocates arrived at the Utah State Capitol. They chanted \"freedom!\" as they marched.\n\nThe rally is called \"March Before Our Lives\" -- a counter-protest to the rally pressing for gun legislation. KUTV reports Utah Gun Exchange was holding the counter-demonstration.\n\nIn Texas, Fort Worth police formed a protective circle Saturday morning around two counter-protesters using a microphone to disrupt the city's \"March for Our Lives\" event as it was about to get underway, J.D.

                "body": "LIMA, Peru -- A Peruvian judge on Saturday barred recently resigned President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski from leaving the South American nation for 18 months while he's investigated for money laundering. The ruling came a day after congress accepted Kuczynski's resignation and swore in Vice President Martin Vizcarra as his successor.\n\nKuczynski, 79, is being probed for some $782,000 in payments his consulting firm received a decade ago from Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant at the heart of Latin America's biggest-ever bribery scandal. Some of the payments took place when Kuczynski was a government minister, raising questions about whether they were made in return for political favors.\n\nThe former Wall Street investor has denied any wrongdoing. He said the consulting firm, Westfield Capital, was then being managed by his business partner and that he paid taxes on all earnings from that era.\n\nOdebrecht has admitted to paying $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America including $29 million in Peru.\n\nAt the same time the hearing was taking place, prosecutors carried out a search of Kuczynski's home in Lima and another property outside the capital.\n\n\"Peru since the 19th century has watched the sad show as presidents and ex-presidents flee the country and justice,\" said Hamilton Castro, the anti-corruption prosecutor who had requested Kuczynski be barred from leaving Peru. \"This is the historical behavior that we seekers of justice have to take into account.\"\n\nKuczynski's lawyer promised his client's full cooperation and said he would abide by the prosecutor's request not to leave the country. Kuczynski was not present at Saturday's hearing.\n\nKuzynski is the fourth former Peruvian president to be investigated for taking payments from Odebrecht. One is currently in jail while another, Alejandro Toledo, for whom Kuczynski served as finance minister, has refused to return to Peru from the U.S. to face charges.",

                "body": "Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is speaking out over he was apparently fired from the bureau for a \"lack of candor.\" McCabe authored an op-ed published in the Washington Post Friday night, claiming those accusations are \"not true.\"\n\n\"Not in my worst nightmares did I ever dream my FBI career would end this way,\" McCabe wrote.\n\nMcCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions two days before he could retire, after FBI officials recommended that he be fired. McCabe is expected to be the subject of criticism in an upcoming Department of Justice Inspector General report.\n\n\"I have been accused of 'lack of candor,'\" McCabe wrote. \"That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators. When asked about contacts with a reporter that were fully within my power to authorize as deputy director, and amid the chaos that surrounded me, I answered questions as completely and accurately as I could. And when I realized that some of my answers were not fully accurate or may have been misunderstood, I took the initiative to correct them.\n\nAt worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted -- and for that I take full responsibility. But that is not a lack of candor. And under no circumstances could it ever serve as the basis for the very public and extended humiliation of my family and me that the administration, and the president personally, have engaged in over the past year.\"\n\nMcCabe's firing last week was not unexpected. But it was how he was fired that the former FBI official found disconcerting. McCabe claimed he learned he was fired after a friend called to to tell him the news from TV.\n\n\"So, after two decades of public service, I found out that I had been fired in the most disembodied, impersonal way -- third-hand, based on a news account,\" McCabe wrote. \"Shortly after getting word, I noticed an email from a Justice Department official in my work account, telling me that I had been 'removed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the civil service.'\"\n\nMcCabe said he awoke to a tweet from President Trump praising his firing.\n\n\"I was sad, but not surprised, to see that such unhinged public attacks on me would continue into my life after my service to the FBI,\" McCabe wrote. \"President Trump's cruelty reminded me of the days immediately following the firing of James B. Comey, as the White House desperately tried to push the falsehood that people in the FBI were celebrating the loss of our director.\"\n\nMcCabe said young people cannot be \"dissuaded\" from public service by the \"divisive politics and partisan attacks that now so characterize our national discourse.\"\n\n\"There is nothing like having the opportunity to be a part of the greatest law-enforcement organization in the world, working every day for goals that you respect and cherish,\" McCabe said. \"It is the best job you will ever have. Even if a president decides to attack you and your family. Even if you get fired on a Friday night, one day from your retirement.\"\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that McCabe had overseen a criminal probe investigating whether Sessions was untruthful in congressional testimony last year about his contacts with Russians. A Justice Department official claimed Sessions did not learn of the probe until it was reported this week, after McCabe's firing.",

                "body": "CAIRO -- Egyptian authorities arrested a British journalist and expelled her from the country after threatening her with a military trial, The Times said on Saturday. The move comes as part of a heavy crackdown on media ahead of this month's presidential elections.\n\nBel Trew, who has been in Egypt for seven years, had been detained and faced \"sufficiently outlandish\" threats to suggest a misunderstanding over reporting she carried out in a central Cairo district, The Times (of London) said. She was expelled in late February. The British daily has been since attempting to bring about Trew's safe return to Cairo to cover the elections but to no avail.\n\n\"It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return,\" The Times said in a statement. Egyptian authorities were not immediately available for comment.\n\nTrew said in an account on the Times' website that she has been listed as a persona non-grata and that Cairo authorities threatened to re-arrest her if she attempts to return.\n\nShe said her reporting in the district of Shoubra was part of a story on a migrant boat that disappeared two years ago. An informer seems to have reported her to the police, she added. She was stopped shortly after she left a cafe where she was conducting an interview.\n\n\"The taxi had just pulled away from the café ... when a minibus of plain-clothes police officers cut us off. Five men jumped out and took me to a nearby police station,\" she said, adding that she provided the authorities with the audio recording of the interview. \"It was either ignored and not listened to - or listened to and ignored,\" she said.\n\nEgypt has often detained, jailed and prosecuted journalists under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military's 2013 overthrow of elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, after mass protests against his one-year divisive rule.\n\nAdvocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt as 161 out of 180 countries on their 2017 World Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Egypt among the top worst jailers of journalists in a December report. It says some 20 reporters remain detained; several face charges of spreading \"false news.\"\n\nSome 500 websites have been blocked since last year including many run by rights groups, sites critical of the government and the VPN services that help users bypass the blocks.\n\nPro-el-Sissi businessmen have also expanded their reach into an already cowed private media, according to Reporters Without Borders. The group says security forces maintain a list of \"wanted\" journalists they have sometimes even forcibly disappeared, and are especially keen to crack down on individuals who sell video content to opposition media abroad.\n\nThe government's stepped up warnings to the media ahead of the 26-28 March presidential election, in which el-Sissi faces no serious challenge after a string of hopefuls were forced out of the race or arrested. His only challenger is a little-known candidate who supports him.\n\nEarly March saw some of the harshest official rhetoric to date taking aim at the press. The country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, described the media as \"forces of evil\" -- one of el-Sissi's hallmark phrases -- saying they have been trying to \"undermine the security and safety of the nation through the broadcast and publication of lies and false news.\" El-Sissi himself described any defamation of the country's security forces as \"high treason.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, a bill was proposed in parliament criminalizing any statements authorities define as insults toward the armed forces or police, with penalties of at least three-year jail terms and fines upward of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (or $567).\n\nEgyptian authorities have also published a list of telephone numbers for citizens to alert reports they view as undermining security or spreading false news.",

                "title": "Trump's impulses make it tougher to negotiate with the White House",
                "body": "Days of conflicting and misleading statements from President Trump and his top aides have fueled new questions about the White House's credibility, sowing mistrust and instability within the West Wing and leaving some congressional Republicans wondering if they have a good faith negotiating partner in the president.\n\nOne former congressional GOP leadership aide said it was becoming impossible for Republicans to negotiate anything with White House officials, given the president's willingness to undermine his own team's public and private assurances. In turn, White House officials have found themselves in the bizarre position of urging lawmakers to ignore some of the president's own statements.\n\nThat was the case on Friday, when Mr. Trump blasted out a morning tweet threatening to veto a massive government spending bill that the White House had guaranteed lawmakers and the public that he would sign. White House officials privately insisted the president was simply venting after watching news coverage that cast the deal as a defeat for several of his priorities. After hours of uncertainty, Mr. Trump's veto threat crumbled, and he ultimately signed the legislation.\n\nStill, it left some Republicans rattled.\n\n\"The spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who has been critical of the president. \"Disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, intemperate statements are not conservative virtues in my opinion.\"\n\nTrent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader from Mississippi, said GOP lawmakers \"feel a good deal of consternation\" about the White House-induced whiplash. But he added: \"I assume there was method in what the president did.\"\n\nMembers of both parties said they were troubled that Mr. Trump seems oblivious to how he has undermined his own clout and agenda by staking out positions and then brazenly abandoning them. Where legislators once might have attributed such missteps to the president's newness to Washington and its ways, not anymore.\n\nMr. Trump's vacillating on the spending bill was just one in a series of recent instances that put the credibility of the White House's words under a microscope. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump bragged at a private fundraiser about having made up facts on trade during a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. And in recent days, he and his staff have issued stern denials about the prospects of national security adviser H.R. McMaster departing the White House and a potential shake-up on the legal team that handles Trump's role in the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and obstruction of justice. Beyond public statements, White House chief of staff John Kelly had privately assured his staff that no shakeup was on the horizon.\n\nBy week's end, McMaster was out. And the legal team had lost one attorney and appeared to be looking for another one.\n\nTrump's trouble with the truth is hardly new. He frequently mangles the facts on everything from the size of his inauguration crowd to the scope of the tax bill he signed late last year. And as his boasting about his interaction with Trudeau underscored, the president rarely appears to be embarrassed or ashamed about repeating statements that have been proven false.\n\n\"There's a fundamental difference between this White House and those of the modern era that preceded it,\" said Timothy Naftali, a historian and the former director of Richard Nixon's presidential library. \"It doesn't care about its credibility outside of a narrow swath of the American people.\"\n\nNumerous polls show a majority of Americans don't believe Mr. Trump is truthful, including a recent Quinnipiac survey in which 57 percent said the president was not honest. Mr. Trump's backers sometimes point to the fact that he was elected even though polls during the campaign showed similar results.\n\nMr. Trump's willingness to skirt the truth has frequently put his advisers in the awkward position of issuing strong statements in public that are quickly undermined by the president. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly batted down reports about McMaster's ouster in the days leading up to Mr. Trump's announcement that he was bringing in a new national security adviser.\n\nAnd on the eve of Trump's spending bill veto threat, budget director Mick Mulvaney left no ambiguity about the president's plans to validate the measure.\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill? Yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nWhite House officials privately contend that they are often left in an impossible situation given Mr. Trump's willingness to change his mind. Even if their statements are true at the time, they say, there's no guarantee the president's position will hold.\n\nPeter Wehner, who served in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, said Trump ultimately has no one to blame but himself.\n\n\"He doesn't even know what his own stance is,\" said Wehner, a frequent Trump critic. \"It just devalues his word and his threats and promises and his presidency.\"",

                "title": "Trump transgender military ban: Democrats, LGBT groups are outraged, and GOP is silent",
                "body": "President Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.\n\nThe White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" -- those who may require substantial medical treatment -- \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nMr. Trump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards - including those regarding the use of medical drugs - equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nThe new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nRep. Ted Lieu, D-California, tweeted about the \"stupid bigotry from @realDonaldTrump,\" writing, \"As a veteran who served on active duty, we focused on the mission. We didn't care if you were transgender, bald, gay, or had freckles. No evidence a trans sniper is less accurate or a trans pilot is less effective.\"\n\nDemocrats on the House Armed Service Committee said that the president's decision is \"vicious, inhumane and utterly wrong,\" and they pointed out, \"There are scores of transgender men and women serving in the military right now, under a policy that had already been established & vetted by DOD and validated by the courts.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nJoshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\nUnder guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.",

                "title": "AP fact check: Trump on trade, Islamic State, vets, Clinton",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump isn't always bringing genuine statistics to the fight as he goes after China on trade.\n\nTrump stretched credulity on a variety of subjects over the past week, trade among them. He mangled comments from 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton, inflated expectations of an overhaul in health services for veterans and gave his administration too much credit for defeating the Islamic State.\n\nHere's a look at some of his recent statements.\n\nTRUMP: \"Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let that happen.\" -- comments at the White House on Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That didn't happen. Last year, Americans bought about $506 billion in goods from China. That's not \"lost\" money but purchases of products that Americans wanted. And it's only part of the equation. China bought more than $130 billion in goods from the U.S. So the actual trade deficit in goods was $375 billion.\n\nFactor in trade in services and the actual U.S trade deficit with China was $337 billion.\n\nTRUMP: \"On terrorism, in Iraq and Syria, we've taken back almost 100 percent, in a very short period of time, of the land that they took. And it all took place since our election. We've taken back close to 100 percent.\" -- National Republican Congressional Committee dinner Tuesday. Comments Friday: \"We've gotten just about 100 percent of our land back from ISIS.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: It's not true that progress against the Islamic State group \"all took place\" since the election. The Obama administration said IS had lost more than 40 percent of its territory by the time the last president left office.\n\nISIS was pushed to the point of collapse in Mosul, its main Iraqi stronghold, before Trump took office. In 2016, Iraqi military forces, supported by the U.S.-led coalition, waged successful battles to oust ISIS from Fallujah, Ramadi, eastern Mosul and a number of smaller towns along the Tigris River. They also established logistical hubs for the push that began in February 2017 to retake western Mosul.\n\nIt's true that advances since then have decimated ISIS as a territorial force. Those advances came on many fronts from multiple foes of the Islamic State, including U.S.-backed Iraqi forces and fighters of Syrian President Bashar Assad, supported by Russia. The assertion that \"we've taken back close to 100 percent\" is only supportable if \"we\" means the various groups, often hostile to one another, that have been battling ISIS.\n\nTRUMP on Clinton: \"I would say her last statement about women -- they have to get approval from their husbands, their sons, and their male bosses to vote for Trump. That was not a good statement. Not good.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's not what she said. In remarks this month in India, Clinton advanced the theory that a slim majority of white women voted for Trump because of \"ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.\" She did not say women felt they needed approval from men to vote for Trump -- but rather that they faced pressure from them to side with Trump instead of her.\n\nTRUMP: \"Republicans also repealed one of the nation's cruelest and most unfair taxes ever: the Obamacare individual mandate. And the mandate is gone forever. And that's a beauty. You pay a lot of money not to have to pay and not to get health care. So you're paying not to have health care. I mean, that wasn't so good. But we got rid of it.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The mandate is not gone. Fines for going without health insurance coverage are still in effect this year. They disappear next year under the repeal law he signed.\n\nTRUMP on a marketing campaign against opioid abuse: \"That's the least expensive thing we can do, where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials. And we'll make them very, very bad commercials. We'll make them pretty unsavory situations.\" -- speech in New Hampshire on Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: This \"scared straight\" advertising was neither inexpensive nor particularly effective the last time it was tried and researched. There is some evidence, though, that anti-drug messages focused on teenagers' need for independence can help discourage drug use.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2004, the U.S. government spent nearly $1 billion on a national campaign to persuade young people to avoid illegal drugs, particularly marijuana. A 2008 follow-up study funded by the National Institutes of Health found the campaign \"had no favorable effects on youths' behavior\" and may actually have prompted some to experiment with drugs -- an unintended \"boomerang\" effect.\n\nTRUMP: \"Choice is coming. Choice -- where the veterans can actually, instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks, they can actually go and see a doctor and have it taken care of, and we pay. And that's going to be the big one.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A long-term plan along these lines doesn't appear to be coming any time soon. It's stalled in Congress and delays experienced in the program so far mean it won't be fully implemented until 2019 or later.\n\nA choice program was put in place after a 2014 wait-time scandal that was discovered at the Phoenix VA hospital and elsewhere throughout the country. It allows veterans to go to private doctors if they endure long waits for VA appointments. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative arm, people using the program suffer wait times potentially as long as 81 days. Last summer, an unexpected budget shortfall in the program forced VA to limit outside referrals, leading to additional delays in medical care.\n\nVA Secretary David Shulkin said last month VA care is \"often 40 percent better in terms of wait times\" compared with the private sector.\n\nHe hoped a long-term overhaul would be approved by Congress in December, but proposals have stalled due to disagreements over cost and how much access veterans should have to private doctors.\n\nDEMOCRATIC SEN. PATTY MURRAY, questioning VA Secretary David Shulkin: \"I was really concerned to see your budget asks for a large decrease in the Office of Inspector General ... . I want to know why this budget doesn't provide the OIG with the full funding that they need.\" -- Senate hearing Wednesday on VA budget.\n\nSHULKIN: \"We are supportive of the role of the OIG as well. And in fact this budget actually does provide them the resources. ...They do have the staffing they need.\" -- Senate hearing Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Neither is entirely correct.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed budget would provide $172 million to VA's internal watchdog office for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. That's technically an increase from the administration's $159 million budget level in 2018, but a decline from the office's actual spending of roughly $174 million due to increased demands to investigate problems at VA. The inspector general's office used leftover money from previous years to fill the gap, cash that is now largely gone.\n\nTo maintain current staffing levels, the IG's office is seeking $181 million for the next budget year, or $9 million above what the Trump administration is proposing. Without that money, it says it will have to cut the equivalent of 30 full-time staff positions, most of them directly involved with the IG's core criminal investigations, auditing and health inspections work.\n\nThe IG office, with about 850 full-time staff, is charged with keeping watch over the government's second largest department, whose 360,000 employees provide medical care and other benefits to 9 million military veterans. In recent months, the watchdog has put out blistering reports concluding that Shulkin violated ethics rules during an 11-day trip to Europe and that systemic leadership problems at VA put patients at risk. Shulkin is now being investigated over allegations that he used his security detail to run personal errands for him; he has denied wrongdoing.",

Among those who share the goal of enacting stricter gun laws, this support rises to 66 percent.\n\nYounger Americans, particularly those in the post-millennial generation, are more supportive of this movement than those who are older.\n\nYounger people ages 18-29 (29 percent) are more likely than those over age 50 (18 percent) to say they'll participate in the March for Our Lives either in person or online.\n\nSixty-three percent of Americans favor stricter laws to cover sale of guns, and most of them think the recent student organizing and marches - including March for Our Lives- mark a turning point in the effort to enact stricter gun laws.",

Organizers in Washington, D.C., alone are hoping to draw half a million people.\n\nThe movement to speak out against gun violence -- and call for stricter gun control measures -- was sparked largely by the outspokenness of a handful of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed in the deadly Feb. 14 shooting. Many of them believe Congress and White House leadership have not done enough, so they're taking to the streets.\n\nHere is a list of where people are marching Saturday, and when.

                "body": "Chef and food writer David Tanis grew up with a love of cooking and often tried his hand at recipes he saw in the New York Times. Later while at college in California, he found himself more often in the kitchen than the library and eventually ended up working for Alice Waters in the early days of her influential Chez Panisse. It was the beginning an association that lasted for a quarter century.\n\nHe now lives in New York, where he's best known as the author of several acclaimed cookbooks, including his latest: \" David Tanis Market Cooking: Recipes and Revelations, Ingredient by Ingredient,\" published last October.\n\n1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Season the chicken generously inside and out with salt and pepper, then massage the skin to distribute the seasoning evenly. Put the thyme and rosemary into the cavity, then put the bird in a shallow earthenware baking dish or roasting pan. Tie the legs together if you wish. Surround with the garlic heads and add the wine to the dish.\n\n2. Roast the chicken, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue roasting for 45 to 60 minutes more, until the juices run clear when a thigh is probed with a paring knife. The bird should be well browned and the garlic soft and caramelized. Remove from the oven, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Carve and transfer to a warm platter. Surround with the garlic heads and serve the garlicky pan juices separately.\n\n3 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter or vegetable oil\n\n1 small cauliflower (about 1 1/2 pounds), cored and cut into 1/4-inch slices\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n1 teaspoon cumin seeds\n\n1 teaspoon black mustard seeds\n\n2 teaspoons grated fresh turmeric, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n\n2 or 3 kaffir lime leaves (optional)\n\nA 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and slivered or finely grated\n\n3 garlic cloves, finely chopped\n\n2 serrano chiles, or to taste, finely chopped\n\n1 pound fresh English peas, shucked (about 1 cup), or 1 cup frozen peas (optional)\n\n2 or 3 scallions, slivered\n\nCilantro sprigs for garnish\n\n1. Put a large sauté pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ghee, and when it is hot, add the cauliflower. Stir occasionally as the cauliflower begins to color, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and continue stirring until the cauliflower is half-cooked, about 5 minutes; lower the heat if necessary to keep it from browning too quickly.\n\n2. Tilt the pan to expose a small pool of hot ghee and add the cumin, mustard seeds, turmeric, and kaffir lime leaves, if you have them. When they begin to sizzle in the oil, add the ginger, garlic, and chiles, stir well, and then add the peas, if using, along with a sprinkle of salt. Cover to let the cauliflower (and peas) steam until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\n3. Transfer the cauliflower to a serving bowl, sprinkle with the slivered scallions and cilantro, and serve.\n\n1. To make the dough, pour the water into a medium bowl and stir in the yeast. Stir in 1/4 cup of the flour and let the mixture get bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes. (You can made the dough with a stand mixer if you like.)\n\n2. Add the salt, melted butter, and the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and stir until the dough forms a rough ball. Then turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (Or transfer the dough to a zippered plastic bag and let rise in the refrigerator for several hours, or overnight.)\n\n3. To make the topping, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Stir in the caraway seeds and garlic and cook for 2 minutes more. Let cool to room temperature.\n\n4. Put the bacon in a small pan and cover with 1 inch of water. Simmer for 2 minutes, then drain and cool. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Punch down the dough, transfer to a lightly floured surface, and knead into a smooth ball. Let relax for a few minutes.\n\n5. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a 12-by-17-inch baking sheet lined with parchment. Stretch the dough to an elongated oval about 11 inches by 15 inches.\n\n6. Mix the ricotta with half the crème fraîche and dab spoonfuls of the mixture evenly over the dough. Spread the cooked onions over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around. Top with the bacon, scattering it evenly. Drizzle the tart with the remaining crème fraîche. (Beating the crème fraîche with a fork should loosen it enough for drizzling; otherwise, thin with a little milk.)\n\n7. Bake the tart for 30 to 35 minutes, turning the baking sheet around if necessary for even cooking, until the crust is well browned. Cool on a rack for a few minutes and serve warm, or let cool and serve at room temperature.\n\n1 garlic clove, grated or minced\n\n3 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\n6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Salt and pepper\n\n2 ounces thick-cut bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide lardons\n\n2 bunches young dandelion greens (about 3/4 pound), stems trimmed\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n4 soft-center hard-cooked eggs\n\nShavings of gruyère cheese\n\nSpinach\n\n1. To make the vinaigrette, put the garlic, vinegar, and mustard in a small bowl. Whisk in the olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\n2. Fry the lardons gently in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat for about five minutes, until golden-they should be crisp but with some give. Blot on paper towels.\n\n3. Put the greens in a large salad bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper. Dress with half the vinaigrette, tossing to coat, then add more as needed. Arrange the greens on individual plates and distribute the bacon among the salads. Cut the eggs in halves or quarters and season with salt and pepper, then garnish each salad with a halved egg. Add shavings of gruyère, if using.",

David and Louise Turpin faced a judge, mostly as a procedural update of the case's status ahead of their preliminary hearing on May 14.\n\nFor the first time since their arrests in January, the Turpins appeared in court without shackles on their hands or feet.\n\nDuring the brief, five-minute hearing, the Riverside County Counsel, which represents the couple's 13 children, handed over two boxes of evidence that contain information about the seven adult children and six juveniles. The information was submitted under seal.\n\nLouise Turpin's sister Liz Flores attended the hearing but refused to answer any questions from CBS Los Angeles.\n\nThe station has confirmed that the seven adult children have been released from the hospital and are living together under supervision. They are mostly confined to the property and must be accompanied if they leave the premises.\n\nAs for the six minors, sources not authorized to speak on the record told CBS Los Angeles they have also been released from the hospital and are living in two separate foster homes, seeing each other often.\n\nIn January, the couple's 17-year-old daughter escaped from the home, telling authorities about the conditions under which she and her 12 siblings were being held.\n\nInvestigators arrived at the home and discovered the couple's children had, in fact, been shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks.\n\nThe Turpin children, who range in age from 2 to 29, were so malnourished, police initially believed some adults were minors.\n\nThe parents have since been charged with more than 40 counts, including torture, false imprisonment, abuse of a dependent adult and child abuse. In February, they each faced three additional charges of child abuse. Louise was charge with another count of felony assault.\n\nThey have both pleaded not guilty to all the charges, including one count of lewd conduct with a minor against David.\n\nEarlier this month, YouTube videos of the 17-year-old girl who escaped the home surfaced. In them, she performs made-up songs that include the lyrics \"You blame me for eveything / I don't understand\" in what appears to be the Perris house.\n\nDavid and Louise Turpin are being held on $12 million each.",

                "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Demonstrators broke at least one car window, doused a bystander with drinks, and blocked busy downtown Sacramento thoroughfares in a second day of protests over the fatal officer-involved shooting of an unarmed black man. The Sacramento Bee reports Friday's protests grew unruly and sometimes violent.\n\nAbout 200 protesters confronted drivers in traffic, breaking the rear window of one car as it made its way through the throng.\n\nOne video shows a protester jumping on an SUV's hood and the vehicle starting to drive off with him on top. The man jumped off, and the SUV sped away.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol blocked ramps to Interstate 5 from protesters trying to disrupt traffic for a second day.\n\nPolice fatally shot 22-year-old Stephon Alonzo Clark in the darkened backyard of his grandparents' home. He was shot while holding a cellphone that police said they thought was a gun, CBS News' John Blackstone reported.\n\nDirected by a law enforcement helicopter, two officers came to a corner, saw a man holding something and fired 20 shots in his direction. A sheriff's helicopter with a heat detecting camera was searching for a burglary suspect breaking windows.\n\n\"He just broke the window, running south, to the south,\" an officer said in the chopper video.\n\nAs Clark jumped backyard fences, two patrol officers joined the chase.\n\n\"Hey! Show me your hands! Stop! Stop!\" officers could be heard shouting.\n\nFearing Clark had a gun, they opened fire. Clark was killed holding a cellphone.\n\n\"Show me your hands! Gun, gun, gun!\" the officers said as gunshots rang out. \"Shots fired, suspect down!\"\n\nFor demonstrators, the video is proof police acted too quickly with lethal force. On Thursday night, protesters blocked a major freeway then surrounded the arena where the NBA's Sacramento Kings were playing, keeping most fans out of the game.\n\nIn a news conference late Friday afternoon, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said while the investigation is far from complete, regardless of the outcome, this is wrong.",

                "title": "Organizers hope to draw half a million to the March for Our Lives​ rally",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Thousands are gathering in Washington Saturday for a protest that organizers claim will be a defining moment in the long-simmering national debate over gun-control legislation. Organizers of the March for Our Lives rally are hoping to draw 500,000 protesters; that would match last year's women's march and make this one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam era. It would also bolster claims that the nation is ready to enact sweeping changes to its gun control laws.\n\nMore than 800 marches are planned in cities across America and dozens of locations overseas to be held at roughly the same time.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering has prompted more attention and speculation than usual. Police are bracing for the hundreds of thousands expected to gather for the rally, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reports. Washington officials say they are prepared to handle the crowds -- more prepared than they were for the women's march, which far exceeded the organizers' official predictions of 300,000.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the students have tapped into a powerful current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years. They have also partnered with well-funded liberal groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group founded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings. A recent CBS News poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans support stricter laws on gun sales, including an increasing number of Republicans. Sixty-five percent of Americans said as of late February that laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter -- an eight-point increase from December.\n\nAlso, a new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. The CBS News poll found that most Americans who support such stricter gun laws -- 59 percent -- are pessimistic about the prospect of the president and Congress enacting them in the near future. A third are optimistic.\n\nAmong the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate its one-day event Saturday -- regardless of turnout -- into meaningful legislative change. One way is by channeling the current energy into mid-term congressional elections this fall. Students in Florida have focused on youth voter registration and there will be a registration booth at the Saturday rally.",

                "body": "TREBES, France -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage died of his injuries, raising the death toll in the attack to four. The officer was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday.\n\nBeltrame, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nHis death raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\nAnnouncing the police officer's death on Twitter, Interior Minister Gérard Collomb said: \"He died for his country.\"\n\n\"France will never forget his heroism, his bravery, his sacrifice,\" Collomb said, the BBC reports.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, Beltrame joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nBeltrame's brother, Cedric Beltrame, told RTL radio Saturday his sibling died \"a hero.\" He added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\"\n\nPeople were placing flowers in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in Carcassone to pay tribute to Col. Beltrame.\n\nMacron has said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live.\n\nTwo people were detained over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and one friend of his, a 17-year-old male, Paris prosecutor office said.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury wasn't serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for God is great -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nThe manager of the supermarket said she felt \"helpless.\" The woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, said that she was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"How am I? I am devastated,\" she said \"What we went through yesterday was a tragedy. What else would you have me say? You feel utterly helpless .\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" she said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.",

                "body": "BOSTON -- Villanova's 3-point party rolled past the intense pressure of West Virginia to bring the Wildcats to the doorstep of another Final Four two seasons after winning a national championship. The top-seeded Wildcats continued their outside feast in the NCAA Tournament, downing the fifth-seeded Mountaineers 90-78 on Friday night to earn their second trip to the regional finals in three seasons.\n\nJalen Brunson led Villanova with 27 points and Omari Spellman had 18 with eight rebounds as Villanova overcame the West Virginia press by hitting 13 of 24 shots from 3-point range.\n\nDaxter Miles had 16 points to lead West Virginia. Jevon Carter and Sagaba Konate added 12 each.\n\nVillanova (33-4) has now made 47 3-pointers for the tournament. The outside barrage helped the Wildcats overcome 16 turnovers and played into their Sweet 16 plan for the team nicknamed \"Press Virginia\": Attack the stifling defense head-on.\n\n\"What a game, man. I hope that looked as good as it did from the bench, man,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \"That was the most physically demanding, mentally draining 40 minutes we've played in a long time. They are so relentless.\"\n\nThe Wildcats struggled at times, especially in the first half, but dug out of a six-point hole in the second half with an 11-0 run.\n\nThe Mountaineers (26-11) stayed close throughout, ramping up the pressure and making Villanova play faster than it wanted to early. But foul trouble throughout the second half was too much for West Virginia to overcome after it gave up the lead.\n\nCarter was called for his third with 17:33 left in the game. That was followed by Miles being whistled for his third and fourth fouls over a two minute stretch that sent him to the bench with 15 minutes remaining.\n\nCoach Bob Huggins said the fouls \"absolutely\" stifled the Mountaineers' ability to keep pressure on Villanova.\n\n\"When the whistle keeps blowing it really takes away your aggression,\" he said.\n\nWest Virginia adjusted for a while, taking advantage of a more than three-minute Villanova scoring drought to take a 60-54 edge with just over 11 minutes left.\n\nBut Villanova heated up again. Its 11-point run was capped by a thunderous block and dunk on the other end by Omari Spellman that pushed the Wildcats back in front 65-60.\n\nThe Wildcats kept the momentum going, stretching the lead to 76-66 on a 3-pointer by Brunson.\n\n\"The deeper you go, the better the teams are going to be,\" Brunson said. \"For us, most importantly, nothing changes no matter who we play, where we play, what time we play. We play every game like it's our last.\"\n\nWest Virginia never got closer than 4 points the rest of the way.\n\n\"I felt like we gave it everything we had,\" Carter said. \"We just didn't make shots tonight and Villanova did.\"\n\nVillanova led 44-42 at the half after a fast-paced opening 20 minutes. Brunson led all scorers with 16 points in the half, with West Virginia getting 11 points from Daxter Miles.\n\nThe Wildcats came out firing, connecting on their first seven field goals. They handled the Mountaineers' pressure well early. But the Wildcats had three turnovers over a 65-second stretch during an 8-0 Mountaineers run that put them in front 33-30.\n\nWright said he never lost faith in his team.\n\n\"I just looked at Jalen, Mikal (Bridges) and Phil (Booth) and I could see in their eyes we were good,\" he said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWest Virginia: It's a tough loss for the Mountaineers, but it doesn't diminish the incredible effort by a senior class that reached the Sweet 16 three times in four years.\n\nVillanova: The Wildcats are primed for another title run with their talent led by player of the year contender Brunson, the experience of the 2016 title and the lessons learned from early tournament departures in several years, including a second-round loss to Wisconsin last year.\n\nMILESTONE WATCH\n\nThe Wildcats' 13 3-pointers give them 432 for the season, putting them 11 away from a Division I record. VMI hit 442 3-pointers in 2006-07.\n\nNO REGRETS\n\nDespite the outcome, Carter said he is proud of his classmates' four-year run. Friday's game marked the 10th career NCAA Tournament game for Carter and Miles - tying them for the most in school history.\n\nCarter said the tournament will always mean a lot to both of them.\n\n\"It's everything. Everybody is in tune with March Madness. I feel like it's bigger than the NBA playoffs,\" he said. \"Anything can happen in March. ... Unfortunately we lost in the Sweet 16.\"",

                "body": "ROSEVILLE, Calif. -- Investigators said Friday that they are stumped as to why a man who emigrated 25 years ago from India drove a flaming minivan full of propane tanks and gasoline cans through the main gate of a major Northern California Air Force Base this week, but see no evidence of terrorism. FBI Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan on Friday said the driver, Hafiz Kazi, was dead when authorities reached the wreck, CBS Sacremento reports.\n\nKazi, 51, no known links to terrorism, did not leave behind a manifesto or any threats or explanation, and a video found on a cellphone provided no clue.\n\n\"Why did this individual end up at the front gate of Travis Air Base on fire and now deceased? We don't have the answers to that,\" Ragan said. Investigators know of no one else associated with the incident nor any threats to air base or the community.\n\nAir Force gate personnel initially thought they were dealing with a vehicle accident when Kazi crashed and they realized he was on fire. No shots were fired as he entered the base, and it was only after the fire was out and they broke through the locked minivan doors to aid Kazi that they realized it was loaded with five propane tanks, three gallon-size gasoline cans and several cigarette lighters, Ragan said. Also found was a gym bag with personal effects and three cellphones.\n\nKazi's body was so badly burned that he had to be identified by fingerprints. Ragan said he is a native of India who has lived in the United States since 1993 and was a permanent legal resident. Kazi never served in the military and has no known ties to the air base, he said.\n\n\"We know what happened,\" Ragan said. \"Now the question is why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don't know the answers to that, quite frankly. So the investigation that we're doing right now is trying to piece together his life, trying to piece together what led up to this event, and attempt to determine why he was there and why he had those items in his vehicle ... They will continue at it until we get the answers.\"\n\nRagan said they have been unable to find any of Kazi's family living in the United States. A family member in India has been notified of Kazi's death, Ragan said. He said Kazi appeared to work as a cab driver in the past, but that investigators haven't determined if he was currently employed. It's not clear if he owned the minivan.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence of any religious affiliation or anything at this point,\" Ragan said. \"As of right now, we know of no other associates.\"\n\nInvestigators have interviewed some of Kazi's acquaintances and are working on some search warrants, he said. They also are scouring social media, so far without result.\n\nCalls to several numbers associated with Kazi were not returned Friday.",

                "body": "It's tax season, aka the season of complaining. In an Instagram video that went viral, reality TV star and \"Bodak Yellow\" rapper Cardi B went on a rant asking where her money is going.\n\n\"So you know the government is taking 40 percent of my taxes,\" Cardi B said. \"And, Uncle Sam, I want to know what you're doing with my f***ing tax money. Because, you know what I'm saying? When you donate, when you donate to a kid from a foreign country, they give you updates of what they're doing with your donation.\"\n\nCardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, notes that she is from New York City and \"the streets are always dirty.\"\n\n\"What are y'all doing?\" Cardi B asked. \"There's still rats on the damn trains. I know you're not spending it in no damn prison because y'all be giving [people] two underwear, one jumpsuit for five months. So what are y'all doing with my f***ing money? What is y'all doing with my f***ing money? I want to know. I want receipts.\"\n\nAt The Washington Post, national correspondent Philip Bump broke down where her tax money is probably going. Bump called her question a \"good question\" and said everyone should ask it. The White House estimates it will collect $3.34 trillion dollars but it will spend $4.17 trillion, Bump writes.\n\nIt's likely that over 50 percent of her tax money goes to social services, such as Social Security and the Medicare. Another 14 percent probably goes to the military and about 7 percent goes toward paying off interest on the national debt.\n\nAs for the two things Cardi B. mentioned, prisons get a small amount of federal tax dollars and New York City's streets are \"New York City's problem,\" Bump notes. But her rant is part of a larger frustration, Bump said, that many people feel what they pay in taxes is not reflected in services.\n\n\"While we see a lot of evidence of things that are not working really well, the government doesn't spend a lot of money of those things,\" Bump said. \"What the government mostly spends money is people.\"",

                "title": "White House announces ban on most transgender service members",
                "body": "The White House announced Friday that the Trump administration would implement its ban on all transgender service in the military \"except under certain limited circumstances.\" It would also stop all use of Defense Department or Homeland Security resources to fund new sex reassignment surgeries, except to protect the health of individuals who have already begun treatment to reassign his or her sex. The announcement was expected, since it was part of President Trump's executive memo in August 2017 renewing a former transgender military service.\n\nAccording to the White House memo, \"transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.\"\n\nThe memo further states \"the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\"\n\nIn July 2017, Mr. Trump had relayed his sudden decision to ban transgender military service in a series of tweets: \"After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow......Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming.........victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\"\n\nHe had caught Pentagon leadership off guard with the tweets, but the policy has been blocked by several legal challenges, so as those lawsuits progress through the courts, the Pentagon began allowing transgender recruits to seek enlistment on Jan. 1. The president gave Defense Secretary James Mattis six months to develop proposals for transgender individuals currently serving, and Mattis submitted his recommendations last month, but those recommendations have not been revealed.\n\nA federal judge in Seattle said Mr. Trump has failed to provide evidence related to his claim that he made the decision after \"consultation with my generals and military experts.\"\n\nIn June 2016, the Obama administration lifted the longstanding ban on transgender individuals in the military, allowing them to serve openly for the first time. Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter had given the armed services until July 1, 2017 to come up with plans to allow transgender people to join the military, and Defense Secretary James Mattis extended that period until the end of 2017.\n\nIt's not known how many transgender troops are serving -- estimates vary widely. An oft-cited Rand Corp. study said roughly 2,500 transgender personnel may be serving in active duty, and 1,500 in the reserves. It estimated only 30 to 130 active-duty troops out of a force of 1.3 million would seek transition-related health care each year. Costs could be $2.4 million to $8.4 million, it estimated.",

                "body": "Ahead of the \"March for Our Lives\" rally in support of gun control, five student journalists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan about struggles covering a deadly shooting at their own school.\n\nSeveral of the students described hiding in the photography closet during the shooting. After the students evacuated, some of the students on the high school's newspaper, The Eagle Eye, began reporting.\n\n\"I had to be there as a journalist to take photos, and in a way, it helped me escape from the reality of it,\" said Kevin Trejos, a photographer for the paper.\n\nTheir reporting was featured in the latest memorial edition of the publication, where all 17 victims of the shooting were honored with in-depth profiles.\n\n\"Everybody knows the victims were nice people, and that they were good, and they had this one thing they liked that they were passionate about, but nobody knows what makes them, them,\" said Rebecca Schneid, the paper's co-editor-in-chief.\n\nThe students said the paper will focus on the \"Never Again\" movement created by their classmates in the wake of the shooting.\n\n\"Until there's a [legislative change), we want the spotlight to be on the activism...\"said editor Nikhita Nookala.\n\nToday the paper released a \"manifesto\" in The Guardian which lists nine key changes the students would like to see in the country. This manifesto includes banning semi-automatic weapons that \"fire high-velocity rounds,\" establishing a \"database of gun sales and universal background checks\" and raising the firearm purchase age to 21.\"\n\nWhile these issues may be debated by politicians, the paper's staff said they remain cognizant of the differing opinions within the school.\n\n\"In our paper, we attempt to remain as nonpartisan as possible,\" Schneid says.\n\nOne item the student reporters said they refuse to print is the name of the shooter, Nikolas Cruz. \"There is not one of us on this publication that believes that he deserves any more publicity than he's already getting and we don't want to contribute to that,\" Schneid said.\n\nThe debate over arming teachers was also addressed by the students.\n\nDuring the shooting, photographer Emma Dowd said \"I felt safe in that situation having a teacher than can console me and calm me down and reiterate that I'm safe. I wouldn't feel safer if the advisor I was with had a gun.\"\n\nDuring tomorrow's march, the students said they will both report and take action.\n\n\"I haven't realized that this march might end up becoming a historic march that's remembered in the history books,\" Trejos said.",

                "title": "France terror attack leaves 4 dead, including suspect",
                "body": "TREBES, France -- A gun-wielding extremist went on a rampage Friday in a quiet corner of southern France, killing three people as he hijacked a car, opened fire on police and took hostages in a supermarket, where panicked shoppers hid in a meat locker or ran through the aisles. After an hours-long standoff, the 25-year-old attacker was killed as elite police forces stormed the market.\n\nThey were aided by a heroic police officer who had offered himself up in a hostage swap and suffered life-threatening wounds as a result -- one of 16 people injured in the day's violence.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack near Carcassonne, a medieval city beloved by tourists, and the town of Trebes. It was the deadliest attack in France since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nThe officer who volunteered to take the place a female hostage was identified as Col. Arnaud Beltrame. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it.\n\nA police official who was not authorized to be publicly identified confirmed the officer's identity to The Associated Press.\n\n\"He saved lives,\" Macron said.\n\nMacron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon, and how he became radicalized.\n\nSince January 2015, France has suffered a spate of jihadist attacks that have claimed more than 240 lives in total, according to BBC News. Five people remain in custody after an apparent failed bombing attempt in a chic Paris neighborhood in October, and that same month ISIS claimed a deadly stabbing in Marseille by a man who used multiple aliases. His motives remain unclear, and ISIS has often claimed responsibility for attacks in which it had no direct role.\n\nCBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reported that if, as it appeared, Friday's attack was the work of a lone gunman with little or no help from any coordinated terror cell, it may not prompt a change in France's already heightened security posture.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug-dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called \"Fiche S\" list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an extremist attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her.\n\nPresident Trump was briefed on the incident, but \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan reports that the White House had not yet determined whether it was part of a broader ISIS plot, or the work of a single actor. Once French officials provide the name of the suspect to their U.S. counterparts they will be run through U.S. databases to see if they match any American intelligence files. Brennan said the U.S. government was likely to offer its assistance.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar! (God is great)\" and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nGuibbert said he led his wife and sister-in-law and nearby customers into the meat locker. Then he went back to see where the assailant was and called police to describe the situation.\n\n\"At that moment, he (the gunman) ran after me. Of course I left, I lost him and when I turned around he wasn't there anymore. I took an emergency door and saw the police arrive,\" Guibbert said.\n\nAnother witness, an employee of the supermarket's butcher department identified only by his first name, Jacky, told Europe 1 radio he \"heard people shouting and a big 'boom.'\"\n\n\"It was a gunshot,\" he said. \"Then a second gunshot. After that, my colleagues came toward me saying: 'Come on Jacky, we need to leave! There's someone who's firing shots, he's shouting \"Allahu akbar,\" and he's shot people and he's shooting at everything.'\"\n\nHe said they left using an emergency exit behind the butcher's stall and they ran across the courtyard.\n\n\"We also helped people get out,\" he said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nAbdeslam was recently transported back to Belgium to face charges there. He is believed to have provided key logistical support for the Paris attackers, and either decided not to blow himself up and abandoned his explosive vest, or had it malfunction on him. As CBS News Radio correspondent Elaine Cobbe reports, as the lone surviving suspect in the Paris attacks, Abdeslam has become something of a poster boy for ISIS supporters.\n\nThe ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nBoth Interior Minister Gerard Collomb and Molins praised Beltrame, who Molins said \"at the risk of his life took the choice to take the place of the hostages.\"\n\nThe gunman shot Beltrame several times after threatening to blow up the supermarket if police entered, Molins added.\n\nBFM television said Beltrame recently took part in a training exercise simulating a terrorist attack.\n\nAs the supermarket standoff reached a crescendo about 2:20 p.m., police heard gunshots inside the building and decided that elite forces had to storm it. Lakdim was killed and two other officers were wounded during the assault, Collomb said.\n\n\"He acted alone, there was no one else but him,\" he added.\n\nMacron rushed back from an EU summit in Brussels to Paris, where counterterrorism investigators took over the investigation. While France hasn't had an attack in several months, \"the threat remains high,\" Macron said, describing ongoing risks from \"several individuals who radicalized themselves.\"\n\nMacron pushed through a tough counterterrorism law last year that gives police extra powers to conduct searches and hold people under house arrest.\n\nIn Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared with Macron and said, \"When it comes to terrorist threats, we stand by France.\"\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the Eiffel Tower would turn its lights off at midnight in tribute to the victims.\n\nAt the national stadium outside Paris, 80,000 soccer fans and the national teams of France and Colombia observed a minute of silence Friday night to honor those killed in the attacks earlier in the day. Poignantly, the stadium itself was the site of bloodshed in the deadly Paris attacks in 2015.",

Launched in the wake of the deadly Florida school shooting, organizers hope the event will reach the historic proportions of protests not seen since the Vietnam era and re-energize already fading legislative vigor behind measures to address mass shootings.\n\nAlso this week, shakeups in the president's inner circle continued with the departures of John Dowd, the former lead lawyer for the president in the special counsel's Russia probe, and H.R. McMaster, the former National Security Advisor.\n\nThe replacement of Dowd with former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova raised questions of a change in strategy. Former key Trump aide Steve Bannon said diGenova was a sign the president was \"going to war.\" And, the replacement of McMaster with hawkish former U.N. ambassador John Bolton raised fears of more hard-line policies. Bolton once floated the possibility of a U.S. first strike against North Korea and Iran.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the focus of the controversy over Cambridge Analytica's misuse of data from millions of Facebook users shifted to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

                "title": "Neighborhood policing program builds relationships to cut crime",
                "body": "In 2017, New York City saw some of its lowest violent crime numbers in decades. The nation's largest city police department reported historic reductions in crime last year, including the first time the number of shooting incidents fell below 800 and the number of murders below 300 -- the city's lowest per-capita murder rate in almost 70 years. Other reductions were seen in the number of robberies and burglaries in the city.\n\nWith those benchmarks in mind, the NYPD now faces the challenges of sustaining, and attempting to surpass, that progress in 2018. The police force kicked off the year with some key internal promotions including the appointment of Rodney Harrison as Chief of Patrol. At the core of their approach to crime reduction is a concept called neighborhood policing.\n\n\"We have more police officers on the streets who are in the process of building relationships,\" said Harrison. \"Having that shared responsibility with the residents of the city of New York, that's a great way of being able to maintain violence at a low level.\"\n\nThat concept of \"shared responsibility\" is often reiterated by NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill. In order to build a sense of unity, the NYPD is training neighborhood coordination officers through the Neighborhood Policing Program to deepen community relationships and make cops accessible to residents, not just in times of distress but as an integral part of their daily lives.\n\nOfficers John Buchanan and Robert Bramble are neighborhood coordination officers at the 79th Precinct, focusing on the people and issues of their Brooklyn community.\n\n\"The policing module is changing the way the community and police interact,\" said Buchanan. \"It's taking officers that are generally scattered throughout the precinct everyday and assigning them to the same areas consistently so that if they have an issue, a problem in that area, that they're aware of it and they respond.... A person doesn't have to re-explain their problem over and over. It provides a sense of consistency for the officer and person knowing who's gonna show up when they call 911.\"\n\nModern technology also helps make them more accessible. All 36,000 officers in the department have cellphones and many use them as ways to be contacted by their local residents.\n\n\"Have you ever had a personal issue like if you had an ailment you had to go see a doctor? You always go see the same doctor,\" said Chief Harrison. \"Well, it's kind of the same thing now. You have police officers in your neighborhood that are always assigned to you and you have access to them and you'll be able to call them when you need them and you'll be able to email them and there's always dialogue going back and forth.\"\n\nThis focus on developing more meaningful connections with neighborhood residents comes amid a tense time in modern policing. Individual cases of police brutality -- often caught on video and circulated on social media -- have fueled public outrage and heightened scrutiny of the actions of police officers.\n\nTracie Keesee, PhD, is the Deputy Commissioner of Equity and Inclusion at the NYPD and formerly served as the Deputy Commissioner of Training. In addition to her leadership and work with the NYPD, Keesee also has a doctorate in human and intercultural communications. In her thesis she focused on racial profiling and the interactions \"through the car window\" between law enforcement and members of the African-American community. That deep understanding of the complex societal dynamics shines through in her work.\n\n\"You'll hear a lot of conversations around unconscious bias or implicit bias, and so we're human,\" said Keesee of the officer's perspective. \"With the person on the other side of that window -- the driver, African-American, male -- you're coming with a history of interactions with law enforcement hoping that it will go well, that you have everything you need for that interaction.\"\n\nBut some in the community say the reality has yet to live up to the promise.\n\nTerrell J. Starr is a senior reporter for The Root and a resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, one of the neighborhoods patrolled by neighborhood coordination officers like Buchanan and Bramble. Starr argues that policing is inherently an adversarial role and putting more police officers into an area can actually increase tension with community members, especially minorities.\n\n\"The average young black male in New York City, they're not engaging with police officers at that level. The only time they're engaged with a police officer is normally in handcuffs,\" said Starr.\n\nHe remains concerned with how easily police encounters can escalate into the use of deadly force -- and dismayed by the justifications that are often given when that happens.\n\n\"That's all it takes for a police officer to shoot you or to attack or to apply force: 'I felt.' That's something that Trayvon Martin's mother said when she was talking about policing, 'I felt.' And I hope that a black cop, or even a Latino cop when they look at me, they're not going to have that 'I felt' something or 'I fear for my life,'\" said Starr.\n\nStarr's skepticism also comes from a belief among some residents that cops, even if diverse, have more of a loyalty to their uniform than to the community -- considering themselves \"blue\" before any other color.\n\nOfficer Bramble, both a cop and an African-American, disputed this notion.\n\n\"As police officers you have the responsibility to police each other, too. We don't just police the street and turn a blind eye to each other,\" said Bramble. \"When people refer to the blue line, I think it's misunderstood. The blue line is a sense of camaraderie.... If you're a police officer and you're going through a hardship -- whether it's maybe work-based, it could be emotional, it could be something going on at home -- like, you have people that have your back. It's not a cops vs. the community thing.\"\n\nBut police departments have also come under fire for a perceived lack of accountability in the tense atmosphere surrounding police brutality and the use of force in disputed circumstances.\n\n\"The problem comes in when a police officer engages in egregious activity and they're not held accountable, that's something that has not been touched at all. That's not an NYPD issue, that's not even a state of New York issue, that's an America issue,\" said Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League and former mayor of New Orleans.\n\nLack of accountability is also a key concern for Starr.\n\n\"I don't think we need more contact with police, I think we need less -- and more accountability,\" he said.\n\nIn many high-profile incidents where black men died at the hands of police, officers were not charged or were eventually acquitted. In the 2014 death of Eric Garner, the New York City cop who was caught on camera choking him, Daniel Pantaleo, did not face charges. The officers who shot and killed Alton Sterling in Louisiana in 2016 did not face charges either. The same was true of Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the Cleveland officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice.\n\nThe officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a Minnesota traffic stop was was acquitted. In the case of Freddie Gray's death in Baltimore, three cops were acquitted, one mistrial was declared and two cops had charges dropped against them.\n\nThe NYPD's training programs aim to address situations that could escalate to violence and prevent the situation from ever reaching the point of an unnecessary fatality.\n\nBy putting officers into high-pressure simulations before sending them into the field, the NYPD hopes to prepare officers for difficult situations, such as dealing with someone with mental health issues.\n\n\"We do the best that we can to have officers understand that some of these things you can control and some of them will happen so fast that you will have to do and react in a way that you might not find yourself normally doing. And I think that it's important, though, for us to find that balance to make sure they understand the dangers of the job,\" said Keesee.\n\n\"I think what we want to make sure we do here is that we not only have that understanding that safety is an issue but that you also are here to serve and to serve that community. [That] means that you need to learn that balance and that interaction and understand who you're serving.\"\n\nBy focusing on programs that increase community relations and diversity in the force, the NYPD hopes to rebuild some of the trust between city residents and law enforcement.\n\nThe NYPD is not the first big city police department to turn to a neighborhood policing strategy. In the 1990s, New Orleans saw a 60 percent drop in violent crime after the mayor at the time, Marc Morial, implemented a combination of community policing and community-oriented development programs. Morial recounted that they went from being a city with one of the highest number of FBI complaints for police brutality and misconduct to having just a handful per year.\n\nMorial called the NYPD's efforts \"an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking,\" but emphasized, \"time will tell\" if it's fully successful.\n\nHe stressed that police strategies alone are not enough: community-oriented programs, such as youth and economic development initiatives, must be coupled with an effort like neighborhood policing to truly have an impact.\n\n\"Certainly you've got incredible...reductions in violence in New York. I think the numbers have come down significantly. But it's important that people do not assign all the blame nor all the credit for what the situation is with public safety and crime to law enforcement. It's a wide variety of factors that goes into issues of public safety,\" said Morial.\n\nThrough the difficulties and complexities of policing in the modern era, the NYPD wants their force to connect and be connected with their communities.\n\n\"There's a human side of us. We're not a moving force of army,\" said Chief Harrison. \"We're here to serve and protect, and once they see the human side of us, they begin to have a better idea and sense.... They may even want to think about becoming police officers down the road.\"\n\nMorial seems cautiously optimistic about the changes taking place in New York.\n\n\"Now it's still early to be able to evaluate whether this strategy is indeed going to pay long-term dividends, and I caution against reading too much too soon, but I do think that it is the right direction,\" he said.",

                "body": "BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Every week, 14-year-old Jamarion Styles set himself up for disappointment. Every week, he came to a community center in Boca Raton, Florida, hoping to play basketball with the other kids, and every week, he was rejected.\n\n\"They would start picking teams and I would be the only one left out,\" Jamarion said. \"Then they would tell me just go home. You can break someone's heart like that.\"\n\nAs we first reported last year, the problem was obvious to everyone but Jamarion. He lost his hands and most of his arms as an infant due to a rare bacterial infection. But he insisted that was no reason to give up his hoop dreams.\n\nWe asked why doesn't he play soccer.\n\n\"You would think that I'd be good at soccer,\" he replied. \"I'm really not. I'm horrible.\"\n\nWhich is why on the first day of 8th grade at Eagles Landing Middle School, Jamarion took his case to basketball coach Darian Williams, saying he wanted to be on the team.\n\n\"I said, 'OK, great, just make sure you try out,'\" Darian said.\n\nBut what he was thinking was a little bit more complicated.\n\n\"This man has no arms, how is he going to play basketball? But man, he told me, 'Mr. Williams, I've never been on a team before. Even if I don't play, I just want to be on the team,' and how could I say no to that,\" Darian said.\n\nThat's how the Eagles got their first, armless basketball player. Jamarion, number two, quickly earned a reputation as the hardest worker on the squad.\n\n\"He was usually the first one in the gym and usually the last one to leave,\" said Darian.\n\nStill, he sat on the bench most of the season, until one day the coach put him in the game with about six minutes left. When he eventually got the ball on the far side of court, everyone yelled, \"Shoot it.\" So he did, and sank a 3-pointer.\n\nIf you didn't quite see that, don't worry, because shortly after, he got the ball again -- this time on the near side for another 3-pointer, at the buzzer.\n\nJamarion Styles, the kid no one would pick, was now everyone's hero.\n\nSince that story first aired, Jamarion went on to play freshman basketball, still number two, and he has every intention of making varsity one day.\n\nBut here's the best part: Since hitting those threes, Jamarion can now play all he wants at the community center. He's picked all the time. The only thing he won't play, is the victim.\n\nWhen we asked if he would want his arms back if he could, he said \"I don't need them.\" Who needs hands, when you've got this kind of touch?",

But some accuse the sheriff of turning the jail into his personal piggy bank.\n\n\"Me, my family, my office, the citizens of Etowah County have been targets of miscellaneous fake news stories,\" Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin said.\n\nHe's proud of his jail food, the meal trays served to inmates every day. But critics say he has mostly fed himself.\n\n\"This is a jail, this is not a bed and breakfast,\" Entrekin said. \"If you're used to eating grandma's fried chicken, ordering pizza several times a week, you're not going to be happy.\"\n\nHe told CBS News he \"can't change the optics\" of the scandal in Etowah County.\n\nIn September, Entrekin and his wife bought this $740,000 beach house along Alabama's Gulf Coast.\n\nBecause a Depression-era state law makes Alabama sheriffs personally responsible for feeding inmates, the performance bonus Entrekin gave himself is legal.\n\n\"I haven't done anything wrong,\" Entrekin said. \"If it's wrong, then somebody needs to change the law.\"\n\nHe could have donated it to charity so there would be no question about it, but Entrekin said \"it's just like anybody else -- anybody else who gets out here at the end of the day, you make a profit, it's yours.\"\n\nAlthough this is public service, Entrekin said he asked to be sheriff \"and it comes with that job and so I'm not going to make you happy. I promise you.\"\n\nTaxpayers are paying for this, and in Etowah County, the median income is $40,000. His bonus is the talk of the county and the running joke now is \"I want to be sheriff.\"",

Show me your hands! Stop! Stop!\" officers could be heard shouting.\n\nFearing Clark had a gun, they opened fire. Clark was killed holding a cellphone\n\n\"Show me your hands! Gun, gun, gun!\" the officers said as gunshots rang out. \"Shots fired, suspect down!\"\n\nFor demonstrators, the video is proof police acted too quickly with lethal force.\n\nIn a news conference late Friday afternoon, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said while the investigation is far from complete, regardless of the outcome, this is wrong.",

According to Temple police spokeswoman Ellen Morton, the 4-year-old is in the custody of Child Protective Services.\n\nPolice said they received a 911 call from a woman at 2:30 p.m. Thursday reporting a shooting.\n\n\"We believe it was the mother of either one or both of the kids, she was the only adult that was in the house at the time,\" police spokeswoman Shawana Neely said.\n\nThe station reports that Morton said when officers arrived two minutes later, they found the infant the 4-year-old had apparently shot accidentally.\n\nNeely said it was too early in the investigation to be sure of all of the circumstances surrounding the situation, including what weapon was used or how the little boy got a hold of it, but she reportedly said the shooting happened inside the house.\n\nPolice didn't provide details about the infant's injuries and condition as of Thursday night.\n\nA family member who spoke to KWTX, however, said \"it looked like everything was going to be okay\" with the baby boy.\n\nAccording to the station, a mechanic with Smith's Family Automotive Care who was outside working on a jeep across the street said he saw the f4-year-old playing in the front yard while his mom was mowing, then later heard sirens and saw the infant being taken out in a diaper.\n\n\"The officer was carrying it in his hands, it wasn't moving or anything,\" said Bradley Martin. \"You could see blood and stuff on it ya know, my heart sank when I saw it, it really did.\"\n\n\"If you're going to own guns lock it up, that's all I can say,\" he said.\n\nNext-door neighbor Marta Guillen told the station the family are good neighbors.\n\n\"The woman is good people, a good mother, a stay at home mom who doesn't work and stays home with her children,\" Guillen said via a Spanish translator.\n\nGuillen and her husband also told KWTX the family had surveillance cameras overlooking the front and back yard so they could watch the children outside.",

A bump stock device was used in last year's deadly Las Vegas shooting.\n\nSpecifically, the DOJ is looking to change the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulations to clarify that bump stocks do actually fall under the definition of \"machinegun.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he would ban the devices. Mr. Trump announced that the regulations were being crafted last month.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted about this step in banning bump stocks on Marine One, on his way to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn announced the proposed regulation change, Sessions said the proposed rule is a \"critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence.\"\n\n\"Since the day he took office, President Trump has had no higher priority than the safety of each and every American,\" Sessions said in a statement. \"That is why today the Department of Justice is publishing for public comment a proposed rule-making that would define 'machinegun' to include bump stock-type devices under federal law -- effectively banning them. After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress. I look forward to working with the president's School Safety Commission to identify other ways to keep our country and our children safe, and I thank the President for his courageous leadership on this issue.\"\n\nThe proposed rule comes a day before thousands are expected to march on Washington, D.C., and cities across the country to protest gun violence, after the Parkland, Fla., shooting that left 17 dead.",

                "body": "NEW YORK -- A New York City man was convicted Friday of first-degree murder for the broad daylight killings of a Muslim cleric and his assistant. A state supreme court jury convicted Oscar Morel, 37, in the fatal shootings of Imam Maulana Akonjee and Thara Uddin, his friend and assistant. The men were shot as they walked home following prayers on Aug. 13, 2016.\n\nRichard A. Brown, district attorney of the borough of Queens, called the killings \"a senseless act of gun violence in the middle of the afternoon and carried out in a close-knit neighborhood filled with families and children.\"\n\nBrown said in a statement that he hopes the verdict \"will bring some closure to the family and many friends of the two men killed.\"\n\nMorel, of Brooklyn, was convicted following a nearly three-week-long trial. Jurors deliberated for about a day and found Morel guilty of one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and one count of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nHe faces life in prison without the possibility of parole when he is sentenced April 18.\n\nSome in New York City's Muslim community called the attack on the two Bangladeshi immigrants a hate crime, but prosecutors said the killer's motive was unclear.\n\nAfaf Nasher, the executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, released a statement on behalf of the victims' families expressing gratitude for the conviction.\n\n\"Maulana and Thara came to this country in search of a better life, instead they found Mr. Morel's hatred,\" the statement said. \"Nothing can ever replace what Mr. Morel took from us, but this verdict helps show that this city will never accept this sort of heartbreaking violence.\"\n\nProsecutors said Morel approached 55-year-old Akonjee and 64-year-old Uddin from behind as they left the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid mosque and shot them both in the head. The victims were rushed to a hospital, where they died.\n\nMorel was arrested the following day after police connected him to a hit-and-run crash near the shooting scene.\n\nProsecutors said the police ballistics lab linked a .38-caliber revolver recovered from Morel's basement to the shootings.\n\nMorel denied involvement in the killings.\n\nThe New York Post reported that defense lawyer Michael Schwed told jurors during the trial that police had planted the murder weapon in Morel's home. Justice Gregory Lasak instructed jurors to disregard Schwed's remark.\n\nSchwed did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday.",

                "title": "Trade war with China could hurt these U.S. businesses most",
                "body": "It is how trade wars catch flame. President Donald Trump has proposed tariffs on aerospace, machinery, and information and communications technology products imported from China. Beijing swiftly replied with its own tariffs on U.S. fruits, wine, steel pipe and pork, among other goods.\n\nHere at home, some industries are particularly at risk. That's because companies in these sectors not only import parts and materials from China, but also often export finished products there as well.\n\nThere are three primary mechanisms by which U.S. tariffs on China could hurt American companies. Tariffs on Chinese imports would increase the cost of raw materials for U.S. businesses, forcing them to pay more to make the same goods, whether cars, appliances or electronics. China's reciprocal tariffs make U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese consumers, hurting the many businesses trying their luck in the world's largest market.\n\nFinally, China could make it hard for American companies to do business using other methods, such as increasing regulations on U.S. companies in China or slowing down deals.\n\n\"The retaliation could turn into dissuading Chinese consumers and Chinese businesses from buying U.S. products and brands,\" Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's lots of things that can be done, if trade tensions were to escalate, whether it's influencing purchasing decisions or making exports to the U.S. more difficult.\"\n\nU.S. technology companies rank particularly high on the list of potential losers because many of them are exposed in multiple ways: They rely on Chinese suppliers, and they sell to Chinese companies. UBS, which compiled a list of public companies with significant sales in China, noted that cell phones, computer equipment, semiconductors and clothing were potentially the most vulnerable products if Beijing chooses to hit back.\n\n\"All iPhones come out of China,\" said Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. \"And other U.S. companies, even if their R&D and development is here in the U.S., they're still making their parts and assembly in China.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) is exposed to China in several ways: It relies on Chinese factories for assembly; China has an effective lock on the rare-earth minerals essential for Apple products; and China's fast-growing middle class is increasingly important for Apple's consumer strategy. Some 20 percent of Apple's sales last year were in China.\n\n\"China is the biggest market to over 100 countries. It's hard to find another country with that kind of demand,\" said Ann Lee, a former professor at Peking University and author of \"Why China's Economy Collapsed.\" \"If the U.S. goes forward, you could see blowback that could hurt companies and workers.\"\n\nApple competitor Samsung could potentially win big in a tariff scenario. While it assembles some of its parts in China, most of its manufacturing takes place in South Korea, said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. If Chinese or U.S. tariffs made Apple products more expensive, consumers would likely shift to Samsung products. \"People just won't be willing to lay out 20 percent more on their iPhone,\" he said.\n\nBoeing (BA) stock, which plunged when the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs in February, continued to drop Wednesday, reflecting the company's vulnerability to international tensions.\n\nChina has unique leverage because it buys so many of Boeing's planes. It signed a deal to buy 300 Boeing planes during Mr. Trump's fall visit to the country. Over the next two decades, China is projected to order around $1 trillion worth of aircraft, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAfter the U.S., \"China is the largest market for Boeing aircraft in the world; it's about 20-25 percent of aircraft deliveries every year,\" said Chris Higgins, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \"They don't really need to enact tariffs to retaliate on Boeing; all they need to do is shift purchases to Airbus.\"\n\n\"If they announce a large order for Airbus aircraft tomorrow, that would send a message,\" he added.\n\nA lesser risk is the rising cost of metal itself. Because aircraft are made primarily of steel and aluminum, an increase in those costs would ding its profit margins. Aluminum, which makes up nearly 80 percent of an airplane's body weight, is set to get 10 percent pricier after the tariffs.\n\nBut the industry is relatively used to volatile commodity prices, said Higgins -- aluminum prices rose nearly 25 percent last year with \"hardly a peep\" from the aerospace industry. (Steel, while it's subject to heavier 25 percent tariffs, makes up only about 10 percent of an airplane's weight.)\n\nSome of the fiercest opposition to tariffs is coming from a sector that has, so far, been spared retaliation: soybeans. Soybean farmers sent $14 billion of crops to China last year and see themselves as a prime target for countermeasures.\n\n\"We're very concerned about the type of retaliation we might get,\" said Wayne Fredericks, who grows soybeans and corn on 750 acres in northern Iowa. \"The soybean industry is sitting in the bull's eye of Chinese retaliatory efforts.\"\n\nChina is the biggest customer for U.S. soybeans, buying one-third of our soybean crop last year. That number, which has increased exponentially over the last 15 years, is driven by the Chinese middle class' growing appetite for meat. The soybeans are pressed and used for animal feed and, to a lesser degree, for cooking oil.\n\n\"As income levels have risen in China, diets have shifted more and more to meat consumption,\" said Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \"They've modernized their pork and poultry production, so it looks a lot like the U.S., and they feed them much like we do in the U.S.\" -- that is to say, with soybeans and corn. Sorghum and barley have also benefited from this growth to a lesser degree.\n\nFor its part, China has accused the U.S. government of unfairly subsidizing the soybean industry to flood the markets (the very same tactic of which Mr. Trump accuses the Chinese.)\n\n\"Certainly these issues are not new,\" said Kirk Leeds, director of business development for the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA). \"What appears to be different is the Trump administration is taking what appears to be a much more aggressive position. That makes many of us nervous.\"\n\nLeeds, who is leading an ISA delegation on a two-week trip to China, spoke to CBS News from a high-speed train between Beijing and Wuhan. His group had just met with the U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, who is also Iowa's former governor.\n\n\"I think the next couple weeks could be critical,\" he said. \"Everyone is aware over here, everyone's paying attention to us and most [people] are hoping that there will be a firm resolution.\"\n\nIn October, China loosened regulations on foreign ownership of Chinese banks, a step the U.S. finance industry lauded as historic. With the U.S. contemplating tariffs -- not to mention knocking down Chinese ownership of U.S. companies -- observers worry China could reverse its steps.\n\n\"That was a huge offer from the Chinese, and that could completely go down the drain with these kinds of tariffs,\" said Lee. \"The Chinese will say, 'Why should we be bending over backwards when you don't want to establish a stronger relationship?'\"\n\nIn nearly all other sectors, Chinese rules on foreign companies remain famously strict (a fact that Mr. Trump highlighted on Thursday).\n\n\"U.S. companies, tech companies and high-value-add companies are in essence forced to partner with a domestic producer in China. That's one area where policymakers could tighten the screws,\" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo.\n\nWith higher barriers to ownership, U.S. companies could conclude it's easier to sell their share of an enterprise and essentially exit the Chinese market.\n\nGiven the potential of tariffs to hurt hundreds of U.S. businesses, many analysts are choosing to see Thursday's announcement not as the last word, but rather as an opening gambit aimed at bringing China to the bargaining table.\n\n\"For now this seems to be about renegotiating trade deals,\" said Donisanu, citing the examples of steel and aluminum tariffs, which were watered down significantly before they even came into effect.\n\nBut even if the final tariffs are small numerically, a prolonged negotiation between the U.S. and China could have other consequences. Decisions about supply chains, factories, hiring and firing can take years to fully play out. In the meantime, American industry has two weeks to press the case for particular tariffs -- and to fret about the results.\n\n\"Maybe in a few years we can look back and say, as convoluted as this strategy is, it was beneficial for the U.S.,\" said Fredericks, the soybean farmer. \"But the process is pretty painful.\"",

Will do.\"\n\nAnd he did. As of Friday morning the SpaceX Facebook page was gone, as was the one for Tesla.\n\nMusk has tussled with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over artificial intelligence.\n\nThe backlash from the misuse of Facebook data has prompted a sharp drop in Facebook shares and drawn regulatory scrutiny.\n\nEven Brian Acton, a co-founder of WhatsApp -- purchased by Facebook for $16 billion in 2014 -- advised his followers to delete their accounts.\n\nAlso taking a stand, albeit a more temporary one, is Sonos. The maker of smart-speakers said on Friday that it was yanking advertising for a week from Facebook, along with Google, YouTube and Twitter. It said it would donate the money it would have spent to the digital-rights conference RightsCon.\n\n\"We will also go dark on our Facebook and Instagram social accounts next week in solidarity with those seeking to build a healthier, more consumer-friendly tech ecosystem,\" Sonos said in a blog post.\n\nMozilla made a similar move earlier in the week, saying it was \"pressing pause\" on its Facebook advertising.\n\nOn Tuesday, Singer Cher also pulled the plug on her Facebook account, saying she's found multiple apps that she doesn't need.\n\nThe entertainer followed in the footsteps of other celebrities who've also deleted their Facebook accounts, with the list including Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni and Adam McKay.\n\nCarrey made his move at the start of February, saying the social media company had \"profited from Russian interference in our elections.\" After the Cambridge Analytica data scandal broke, he tweeted a painting bashing Zuckerberg.\n\nEven actors without Facebook accounts weighed in. \"The Big Sick\" Oscar nominee Kumail Nanjiani recently tweeted: \"I don't know how anybody can continue using Facebook.\"",

The resignation this week of John Dowd, the president's lead attorney, was taken as a sign that Mr. Trump may become more aggressive with Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's election interference.\n\nOther reports have suggested Mr. Trump is considering the return of attorney Marc Kasowitz, which could usher in a more combative relationship with Mueller.\n\nAny threat that could shorten or otherwise jeopardize Mr. Trump's term -- such as if the president tries to end Mueller's probe early -- worries investors and traders.\n\nPresident Trump this week unveiled plans to put a 25 percent tariff on an estimated $50 billion in Chinese imports, a move that spooked investors over fears of a global trade war.\n\nThe tariffs could be wide-reaching, with the White House identifying 1,500 product categories that will be covered by the tariffs. The administration is reportedly considering a second phase of penalties including restrictions on visas and investments.\n\nIf China retaliates, a trade war could sap global growth, push up import prices and cause other instabilities including sending interest rates higher. According to Capital Economics, agriculture is one of America's most vulnerable industries, since nearly a quarter of U.S. exports are shipped to China, including 60 percent of soybean exports.\n\nUnder new Chairman Jerome Powell, the Fed this week raised interest rates by another quarter point. While the move was expected, Fed officials also increased their interest rate projections for 2019 and beyond.\n\nSome investors believe the new projections signal a \"hawkish\" stance. The futures market now prices in the odds of three additional rate hikes this year at nearly 40 percent versus 26 percent back in February.\n\nThe bad news continues to pour in for Facebook (FB). The fallout from a data-privacy scandal has spawned the #DeleteFacebook movement on social media and increased the risk that Facebook will face new regulations on the sale and use of user information.\n\nFacebook's stock has declined more than 15 percent from its early February high, while other tech stocks have also slipped amid regulatory concerns. That's come as a shock to some investors, since technology shares had recently outperformed the broad market -- until Facebook's data issues came to light.\n\nPressure from all these factors is also causing weakness in the corporate bond market. Debt-funded corporate share buybacks are an important source of demand for the equity market. Measures of investment-grade credit risk -- that is, the risk of default or bankruptcy -- have increased to six-month highs.\n\nThat could increase funding costs for businesses that want to buy back their own shares. If businesses react by hoarding their extra cash instead of buying back their shares on the open market, a major source of buying power could leave the stock market at a critical time.",

Michael Bennett, a three-time Pro Bowl defensive end, was indicted on one felony count of injury to the elderly, the Harris County District Attorney's Office announced Friday.\n\nThe charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nAuthorities said Bennett, 32, was a spectator at the game in Houston when he tried to get onto the field immediately after the game to see his brother, a tight end for the Patriots at the time. Prosecutors said he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old disabled woman who had told him to use a different entrance to access the field. Medical records show that the woman suffered a sprained shoulder, police said.\n\nCBS affiliate KHOU reports that the injured worker has been with security management Contemporary Services since 2013. The company said she's an \"excellent\" employee\" and they are \"proud to have her.\"\n\nA warrant has been issued for Bennett's arrest, and prosecutors are working with his lawyers to plan his surrender.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles earlier this month acquired Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks. The Eagles released the following statement on the alleged incident:\n\n\"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"",

With commander Oleg Artemyev monitoring an automated approach, the Soyuz MS-08/54S spacecraft docked at the station's upper Poisk module at 3:40 p.m. ET as the two spacecraft sailed 254 miles above Serbia in orbital darkness.\n\nAfter residual motion damped out, hooks and latches in the docking mechanism engaged, pulling the Soyuz in for a firm \"hard mate,\" which kicked off a lengthy series of leak checks to verify an airtight, structurally sound seal.\n\nHatches were expected to be opened about two hours after docking when Artemyev, Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold were to be welcomed aboard by Expedition 55 commander Anton Shkaplerov, Scott Tingle and Japanese astronaut Norishige Kanai.\n\nAll six crew members then planned to float into the Russian Zvezda module for a traditional video conference with senior space managers and family members gathered at the Russian mission control center near Moscow.\n\nAfter a safety briefing, the newly arrived crew members looked forward to a day off Saturday.\n\nArtemyev, Feustel and Arnold are each making their second visits to the space station. Artemyev spent 169 days aboard the station in 2014, participating in two spacewalks. Arnold flew a single mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 2009 and logged two spacewalks helping install one of the station's main solar array truss segments.\n\nFeustel participated in two shuttle missions, one in 2009 to service the Hubble Space Telescope and another in 2011 to help finish construction of the space station. He carried out three station spacewalks and three working on Hubble.\n\nFeustel and Arnold will put their spacewalking experience to use next Thursday when they venture outside the space station to install wireless communications gear that will be used by an external payload and, eventually, by approaching commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX.\n\nThey also plan to swap out a high-definition camera and remove suspect hoses in the station's ammonia coolant system. Two more NASA spacewalks are expected in late May, followed by a Russian excursion in August.\n\nShkaplerov, Tingle and Kanai were launched to the station in December and plan to return to Earth on June 3 to close out a 167-day mission. Artemyev, Feustel and Arnold expect to remain in space for 159 days, returning to a landing in Kazakhstan on Aug. 28.",

                "body": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A former executive for a water park company was charged Friday with involuntary manslaughter in the death of a 10-year-old boy who was decapitated on a giant waterslide at a Kansas water park. Tyler Austin Miles, 29, a former operations director of Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts, pleaded not guilty Friday during a brief court appearance.\n\nHe is the first person criminally charged in the Aug. 7, 2016 death of Caleb Schwab, the son of Kansas Rep. Scott Schwab, at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas City, Kansas. He was on a raft with two women on the 17-story \"Verruckt\" waterslide -- billed as the world's tallest waterslide -- when the raft went airborne, hitting a pole and netting designed to keep riders from being thrown from the ride.\n\nMiles has also been charged with 12 counts of aggravated battery, five counts of aggravated endangerment of a child and two counts of interfering with law enforcement, The Kansas City Star reported. Involuntary manslaughter is defined in Kansas as the reckless killing of a human being.\n\nHis attorneys asked that his bond be reduced to $15,000 from $50,000 but that request was denied. A trial was scheduled for Sept. 10.\n\nSchlitterbahn, which is based in Texas, said in a statement Friday that it was \"deeply disappointed to learn any individual is being personally charged for the terrible accident on Verruckt.\n\n\"Our review of the facts and circumstances of the accident has never shown any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of anyone,\" spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said.\n\nScott Schwab and his attorney, Mike Rader, didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nMiles' attorney, Tricia Bath, said during Friday's hearing that Miles started at Schlitterbahn as a lifeguard and worked his way up to operations manager. She said Schwab's death was a \"horrible tragedy.\"\n\nVerruckt -- German for \"insane\" -- included multi-person rafts that made a 17-story drop at speeds of up to 70 mph, followed by a surge up a hump and a 50-foot descent to a finishing pool. It received national publicity when it opened at the park in 2014.\n\nThe waterslide has been closed since Caleb's death. Schlitterbahn has said it will dismantle the ride when the investigation into the boy's death is complete.\n\nCaleb Schwab's family reached settlements of nearly $20 million with Schlitterbahn and various companies associated with the design and construction of the waterslide. The two women who rode with Caleb suffered serious injuries and settled claims with Schlitterbahn for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBefore the boy's death, Kansas law allowed parks to conduct their own annual inspections of rides. Lawmakers last year nearly unanimously approved stricter, annual inspection requirements for amusement park rides that set qualifications for the inspectors and required parks to report injuries and deaths to the state.\n\nBut only weeks later, lawmakers passed a follow-up bill delaying the enforcement of criminal penalties for operating a ride without a state permit until this year. And this year, the Senate and a House committee have approved legislation to lessen regulation for \"limited use\" rides at events like county fairs and exempt some amusements, such as hay rides, from regulation.",

                "body": "SAN DIEGO -- The defense team for a Marine accused in the fatal stabbing of a fellow serviceman on a California Marine Corps base argued Thursday that the death was a tragic accident and the two friends were playing around with a knife.\n\nPfc. Raymond W. Begay faces charges of murder and obstruction of justice in the death of 18-year-old Pfc. Ethan Barclay-Weberpal, who died the morning of Jan. 16 after being stabbed while sitting in formation with a platoon of Marines at the School of Infantry at Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego.\n\nSeveral troops testifying for the defense said the death was an accident at a preliminary hearing Thursday at Camp Pendleton, according to the Orange County Register. The hearing -- known as an Article 32 in the Uniform Code of Military Justice -- allows the defense and prosecution to introduce evidence and arguments. Both sides must submit written arguments as well. The convening authority will then determine what level of court martial is ordered.\n\nBegay immediately admitted to training instructors that he stabbed Barclay-Weberpal, witnesses testified. Defense attorneys say Begay should be charged with involuntary manslaughter not murder.\n\n\"This was just dumb kids doing dumb things,\" testified defense witness Pfc. Rhett Glubka. \"I don't think he (Begay) thought about what could have happened.\"\n\nThe family of Barclay-Weberpal, of Janesville, Wisconsin, listened via teleconference.\n\nLance Cpl. Gavin Shorter testified that he was behind Begay when the stabbing occurred. \"No one thought he was seriously wounded,\" Shorter said. \"There was no scream or anything.\"\n\nShorter testified that he saw Begay reach over Barclay-Weberpal's right shoulder and place the knife into the left side of his chest but \"I don't believe it was intentional, sir,\" he told Maj. Nelson Candelario, one of three members of Begay's defense team. \"There was no anger, no argument, no conflict. We were all good friends.\"\n\nHe said the other Marines saw blood coming from Barclay-Weberpal's chest and tried to tug at his shirt to cover it up, but \"we didn't think it was fatal and we didn't want to get into trouble. After we got out of formation, we were going to help him.\"\n\nShorter said Begay was known to play with knives and had made stabbing motions at inanimate objects such as mattresses and lockers. He described Begay as a level-headed kid -- a \"solid Marine.\" He also said Begay appeared pale and scared and \"just shook-up\" after the incident.\n\nShorter testified that Begay was playing around with a knife before he stabbed Barclay-Weberpal.\n\nMaj. Tanzania Jaysura, lead trial prosecutor, said she had testimony from at least three other Marines who said Begay was known to have threatened to stab other Marines and that some had told him to stop because it made them uncomfortable. She said she also had testimony showing Begay left the bleacher area after the stabbing to wash blood from his knife.\n\n\"The knife was not the type of knife that retracts and opens to the front and witnesses will say they saw him play with the knife before the stabbing and that words were exchanged and that he intentionally put the knife into Barclay-Weberpal's left chest, into his heart,\" Jaysura said.\n\nShe said the left ventricle of his heart was punctured with only one stab wound.\n\n\"It was a deep puncture wound,\" she said. \"Rather than getting help, he went to put the knife away -- that's where we believe we have obstruction of justice.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Earth is losing plants, animals and clean water at a dramatic rate, according to four new United Nations scientific reports that provide the most comprehensive and localized look at the state of biodiversity. Scientists meeting in Colombia issued four regional reports Friday on how well animal and plants are doing in the Americas; Europe and Central Asia; Africa; and the Asia-Pacific area.\n\nTheir conclusion after three years of study: Nowhere is doing well.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem was about more than just critters, said study team chairman Robert Watson. It is about keeping Earth livable for humans, because we rely on biodiversity for food, clean water and public health, the prominent British and U.S. scientist said.\n\n\"This is undermining well-being across the planet, threatening us long-term on food and water,\" Watson said in an interview.\n\nScientists pointed to this week's death of the last male northern white rhino in Africa, severe declines in the numbers of elephants, tigers and pangolins, but said those are only the most visible and charismatic of species that are in trouble.\n\nWhat's happening is a side effect of the world getting wealthier and more crowded with people, Watson said. Humans need more food, more clean water, more energy and more land. And the way society has tried to achieve that has cut down on biodiversity, he said.\n\nCrucial habitat has been cut apart, alien species have invaded places, chemicals have hurt plants and animals, wetlands and mangroves that clean up pollution are disappearing, and the world's waters are overfished, he said.\n\nMan-made climate change is getting worse, and global warming will soon hurt biodiversity as much as all the other problems combined, Watson said.\n\n\"We keep making choices to borrow from the future to live well today,\" said Jake Rice, Canada's chief government scientist for fisheries and oceans, who co-chaired the Americas report.\n\nDuke University conservationist Stuart Pimm, who wasn't part of the study team, said the reports make sense and are based on well-established scientific data: \"Are things pretty dire? Yes.\"\n\nAmong the regional findings:\n\nIf current trends continue, by the year 2050 the Americas will have 15 percent fewer plants and animals than now. That means there will be 40 percent fewer plants and animals in the Americas than in the early 1700s.\n\nNearly a quarter of the species that were fully measured are now threatened, Rice said.\n\nAnd when all of \"nature's contributions\" are taken into account, nearly two-thirds are declining and more than one-fifth are \"decreasing strongly,\" Rice said.\n\nIf trends continue, there will be no \"exploitable fish stocks\" for commercial fishing by 2048. Around that same, the region will lose 45 percent of its biodiversity and about 90 percent of its crucial corals, if nothing changes, said Asia co-chair Sonali Seneratna Sellamuttu, a senior researcher at the International Water Management Institute.\n\n\"All major ecosystems are threatened in the region,\" she said.\n\nEven though it is the region that Watson said may be doing the best, 28 percent of the species that only live in Europe are now threatened. In the last decade, 42 percent of the land plant and animal species have declined, said Europe co-chair Mark Rounsevell of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.\n\nWetlands have been cut in half since 1970.\n\nAfrica could lose half of some bird and mammal species by 2100. And more than 60 percent of the continent's people depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, said report co-chair Luthando Dziba of South African National Parks.\n\nAlready more than 20 percent of Africa's species are threatened, endangered or extinct.\n\nWhile scientists said government and society needs to change its ways, individuals can use less energy, less water and eat less red meat, Watson said.\n\n\"A balanced diet can really help,\" he said. There are \"lots of individual things you can do.\"\n\nThe outlook is bleak if society doesn't change, but it still can, Watson said.\n\n\"Some species are threatened with extinctions. Others, just pure numbers will go down,\" Watson said. \"It will be a lonelier place relative to our natural world. It's a moral issue. Do we humans have right to make them go extinct.\"",

                "body": "BELLEFONTE, Pa. - A forensic pathologist testified Friday that injuries that killed a Penn State fraternity pledge last year might not have been fatal if fraternity members had summoned help more quickly. Dr. Harry Kamerow took the stand in a preliminary hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence to proceed with charges against 11 members of Beta Theta Pi in the death of Tim Piazza of Lebanon, New Jersey.\n\nPiazza, 19, died of severe head and spleen and abdominal injuries from falling down basement stairs the night of a pledge bid acceptance ceremony, Kamerow said, adding that Piazza had also consumed a dangerous amount of alcohol, three or four times the legal limit for driving.\n\nHe said Piazza would have had a much better chance of surviving had help been called after he was brought upstairs. Instead, fraternity members were shown on camera taking half-hearted and even counterproductive steps to address his condition, and an ambulance was not called until the next morning.\n\n\"He has a much better shot at survival, if they brought him out of the basement, recognized what's going on,\" and called an ambulance, Kamerow testified. \"If he's very close to that period, he's got a good shot. As time passes on, his prognosis grows dimmer and dimmer and dimmer.\"\n\nThe defendants, among 26 young men accused of various crimes related to Piazza's death, were not in court for the preliminary hearing, which could stretch well into next week.\n\nPiazza's parents, Jim and Evelyn Piazza, were in the courtroom as Kamerow described their son's injuries, which included a fractured skull, brain bleeding, a shattered spleen and bruises.\n\nThe house's elaborate security camera system showed Piazza participating in a pledge drinking gauntlet, then being carried upstairs after a fall down the steps at about 11:20 p.m. He was ultimately left alone in the dimly lighted first-floor \"great room\" overnight.\n\nIn the morning, Piazza somehow ended up back in the basement, where fraternity members found him unconscious. They carried him upstairs and then waited 40 minutes to summon help. He died at a hospital less than a day later.\n\nFive of the 11 defendants are charged with involuntary manslaughter. Other charges include hazing, reckless endangerment, conspiracy and alcohol violations.\n\nThe attorney general's office has said its review of the case is ongoing and has not indicated its plans for other defendants.\n\nDuring a break in the hearing Friday, the Republican leader of the state Senate announced a proposal to make severe hazing a felony and allow for confiscation of fraternity houses where hazing occurs.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Jake Corman, who represents the area around Penn State, also would require schools to report all violations of the anti-hazing policies his bill would mandate.",

                "body": "A man has been arrested for allegedly threatening to murder Republican Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nA DOJ news release says court documents allege that 69-year-old Wallace Grove Godwin showed up at Taylor's Virginia Beach Office Thursday and, after apparently getting frustrated over a conversation on marijuana policy, threatened to come to one of Taylor's events with a gun. The man allegedly said, \"Scott is having an event this Saturday. I am going to get my shotgun and do something about this. I will just handle this myself.\" The court documents then allege Godwin pointed at two staffers and said, \"You two are next.\"\n\nCourt documents claim Godwin, a Virginia Beach resident, has showed up at Taylor's home and office in the past, and acted aggressively. The official charge he faces is threatening to murder and assault a U.S. official, which comes with a maximum penalty of 10 years, if convicted.\n\nTaylor favors leaving marijuana issues to the states instead of a blanket federal prohibition, although it's unclear what allegedly enraged Godwin. Taylor, a 38-year-old freshman congressman and former Navy SEAL and Iraq War veteran, serves on the House Appropriations Committee. He has increased his profile by becoming a regular television guest to discuss the GOP agenda and political news of the day.\n\nThe threat against Taylor comes after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice last year that seriously injured House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.",

                "body": "Even before Harry Belafonte won global fame as a performer, he saw himself as part of a grand tradition of artists who use their voices for change. His role model was Paul Robeson, the singer, actor and activist whose career was derailed by McCarthyism.\n\nThis week, the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress honored Belafonte by selecting his 1956 album \"Calypso\" for permanent preservation.\n\nCBS News' Vladimir Duthiers sat down with Belafonte, who drew a direct line from his years traveling the world with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., back to something Robeson told him when he was just starting out.\n\nHarry Belafonte: \"He said, artists are the gatekeepers of truth. He said only through the world of the arts do we know who and what we are in the history of civilization. Long before historians. Long before people ascribe themselves as the caretakers of life and culture. The song did that, and in the black community, it was our primary tool of communication. So I saw the song as having something far more than something to delight audiences and people could dance and sing. It had content, and I began to see this content of black protest music.\"\n\nVladimir Duthiers: \"It strikes me that you are willing to risk everything for your beliefs, and I wonder if - did you ever think about that, that you were risking it all? Somebody could say, you know, you have a record contract, you have a movie contract and if you, if you make the studio look bad, if you make RCA look bad, it could all go away.\"\n\nBelafonte: \"What happened was quite the contrary. I didn't make anything look bad, I made everything look great. So that even when the industry, films and everything abandoned me because my politics got in the way, I had an attitude, and I just said, I have a constituency without you, and the constituency gave me a sense of power.\"\n\nDuthiers: \"You've been talking about Dr. King. What specific impact did he have on you when you first met him, and you watched him and you followed him around the country?\"\n\nBelafonte: \"When I went and heard him speak, I was blown away. This guy was 24. I was 26. His moral sense was quite keen, and it drove his politics. Once he'd hit that stride, and that was going to be his base. He then began to reach out and become far more open to ideas and things. The more he relied on us, the more we found comfort supplying with whatever resources. Mine was to run my mouth and be propaganda. In following Martin, the path was very clear. What we were achieving was very obvious, and the more we saw achievement, the more we were enabled.\"\n\nDuthiers: \"Often times in his speeches, Dr. King said the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. Where are we as a society in that arc?\"\n\nBelafonte: \"Consumed by racism. Consumed by the greatest single fault in the cultural DNA of America. I realized early on that beyond my art and my other sets of platforms, nothing was ever going to remove me from the permanent struggle of race. Because America, in the beginning, they killed you with the Ku Klux Klan. Now they have cops in the streets of New York shooting down our kids with impunity. Bobby Kennedy got in on all of this, and he became a force with Dr. King, and had those men survived, we would be in a very different place. But they didn't. But they left us this legacy, and I will be a part of that legacy until the day I die.\"",

They cannot talk to us,\" Capt. Chris Major of the Indianapolis Fire Department told CBS affiliate WTTV.\n\nThe station recently took video of fire department crews responding to a call of an overdose. Medics found a man in the grass near a busy intersection. He was unresponsive and struggling to breathe after medics say he overdosed on the street drug called KD.\n\n\"Their movements are slow and lethargic, a lot of drooling and a loss of function. We find them with their clothes off, eating the grass, pulling dirt out of the ground and trying to put it in their mouth,\" Major said.\n\nKD is a mix of either marijuana, tobacco, or the synthetic marijuana known as Spice doused in a heavy-duty bug spray, like Raid. Users smoke the mixture.\n\n\"We find people passed out with it still in their hand. That is how fast it has an effect on them,\" Major said.\n\nHe says his team has had nearly a dozen KD overdose runs in one day, sometimes treating the same person multiple times a day.\n\n\"They do not know what is in this stuff or who has made it so they are all taking chance, which for some reason they are willing to do because we get the same people using over and over again,\" Major said.\n\nAuthorities say they are trying to find the source of the drug.\n\nIn a statement, Kelly M. Semrau, Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs, Communication and Sustainability at SC Johnson, which manufactures bug sprays such as Raid and OFF!, said the effects reported in recent news accounts are \"completely inaccurate.\"\n\n\"According to our scientific experts, exposure to the active ingredients in these products would not cause the reported effects,\" the statement reads. \"Global authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. EPA, for many decades have studied these active ingredients and they have not reported ill effects like this. Additionally, even if these active ingredients were intentionally overused, we would not expect these types of symptoms, nor would they last for 45 minutes.\"\n\n\"Our products are safe when used as directed,\" the company said.",

The St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Jaelynn Willey died at 11:34 p.m. Thursday. Earlier that night, her family said she would be taken off life support at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center. Melissa Willey told news reporters Thursday night that her daughter was brain dead and had \"no life left in her.\"\n\nThe mother, holding a young baby, said, \"On Tuesday ... our lives changed completely and totally forever. My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives.\"\n\nThe teen was shot Tuesday by 17-year-old Austin Rollins at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County.\n\nRollins died after shooting Willey. A school resource officer got there within a minute and fired a shot at Rollins, but it's not yet clear whether Rollins was killed by the officer's bullet or took his own life.\n\nThe sheriff's office said Wednesday that Rollins and the girl had been in a relationship that recently ended.\n\n\"All indications suggest the shooting was not a random act of violence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nWilley had been in critical condition at the hospital. A fundraising page to help her family has raised more than $77,000.\n\nWilley was one of nine siblings, her mother said, and a member of the swim team.\n\nThe shooting broke out just before classes were to begin Tuesday, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nA 14-year-old boy who was shot in the thigh during the encounter was released Wednesday from a hospital.\n\nIn an email Thursday to The Associated Press, his mother, Kimberly Dennis, said her family is \"eternally grateful\" that her son, Desmond Barnes, is \"alive, doing well and in good spirits.\"\n\nShe expressed sympathy for Willey and her family and added, \"We are also praying for the entire Great Mills High School family and young people around this country. As a community and nation, we must continue to work and fight for a world that is safe for our children.\"\n\nGreat Mills High School has about 1,600 students and is near the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, about 65 miles southeast of Washington.\n\nSheriff Tim Cameron credited Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill with preventing any more loss of life.\n\nCameron said Gaskill, a six-year veteran with SWAT team training, responded within a minute and fired his weapon simultaneously with a final shot fired by Rollins. The officer was unharmed.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said the Glock handgun used in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins' father. In Maryland it is illegal for anyone under age 21 to possess a handgun unless it is required for their employment.",

The policeman was among a group of officers who rushed to the scene after the attacker, who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group, stormed the store and fired on shoppers and staff before taking them hostage.\n\nThe suspect, identified as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, shot dead two people at the supermarket after earlier opening fire on passengers in a car, killing one of them, and injuring a police officer in nearby Carcassonne.\n\n\"Everything leads us to believe it is a terror attack,\" said French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nSpeaking at the scene, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said a police team immediately intervened after the start of the siege at around 11 a.m.\n\n\"They managed to get some of the people out,\" he said, but the attacker kept one hostage back as a human shield.\n\nA senior officer then offered to take the hostage's place and remained holed up with Lakdim while negotiations to end the standoff continued.\n\nCollomb said the officer \"left his telephone on the table,\" allowing police to listen in as they surrounded the building.\n\n\"When we heard shots the GIGN (an elite police force) intervened,\" the minister said, adding that the policeman was \"seriously injured.\"\n\nCollomb praised the officer for his \"courage\" and \"act of heroism.\"\n\nAn officer from the police SWAT team was also hurt in the operation. The gunman was killed.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said Lakdim was known as a petty criminal but had no previously known ties to terrorism. He was from Carcassonne, where the attacks started.\n\n\"He was known for petty crimes. We had monitored him and thought there was no radicalization,\" Collomb said.\n\nOver the course of his rampage Lakdim killed three people and injured at least three others, officials said. The injured included the driver of the hijacked car as well as a police officer who was shot and wounded while out jogging with colleagues in Carcassonne.",

Yoselyn Ortega, 55, is on trial for the stabbing deaths of Lucia, who went by Lulu, and Leo on October 25, 2012.\n\nAccording to the Daily News, Jesus Frias, 22, testified that on the day of the murders, his mother seemed depressed but kissed him goodbye before he left for high school as usual.\n\nOrtega had worked as a nanny for the family for several years. Frias reportedly told the jury that Ortega would put Lulu on the phone with him so the little girl could practice her Spanish, and that it was a \"lovely scene\" when the Krim family visited Ortega's family in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"They seemed like they loved my mom,\" he testified, according to the Daily News. \"She loved them back.\"\n\nFrias also reportedly testified that the Krims were good to him, gifting him an iPad and giving him a summer job. He also told the jury that the children's father, Kevin Krim, chatted with him about sports and his future.\n\n\"He was a busy man but he still made time for that, so it was something I appreciated,\" Frias testified, according to the paper.\n\n\"And they treated your mother even better, didn't they?\" Assistant District Attorney Stuart Silberg asked.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" Frias said.\n\nOrtega's lawyers don't dispute that she killed the children but say she's too mentally ill to be responsible for what she did. They have said the slayings were an act of madness.\n\nProsecutors allege Ortega planned the killings, waiting until she was alone in the apartment. She selected two knives from the kitchen and then killed Leo, who suffered five wounds, and Lulu, who fought back and was slashed and stabbed about 30 times, prosecutors said. Ortega also stabbed herself.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Courtney Groves told the jury early in the trial that it's possible Ortega's resentment and jealousy of the children's mother, Marina Krim, coupled with an inability to provide for her own son, sent her into a calculated rage.",

                "title": "Trump spending bill veto threat: How lawmakers are reacting",
                "body": "Nearing a deadline Friday to sign a bill to keep the government funded through the end of September, President Trump suggested he might veto the measure over the lack of full funding for his border wall and the failure to address the plight of \"Dreamers.\"\n\nIf he doesn't sign the bill or he vetoes it, the government would shut down at midnight. The House passed the spending bill Friday, and the Senate passed it early Friday morning. A few lawmakers -- such as fiscal conservatives Sens. Rand Paul and Bob Corker -- cheered on the president's threat, but others condemned it.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted Friday morning, \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, drew a comparison to one of Mr. Trump's books in response to news of the veto threat.\n\n\"It's like art of the deal wrecker -- that's my reaction,\" he told reporters Friday morning, adding, \"For the president to threaten to move us from certainty to more chaos and confusion is foolish.\"\n\nHe also addressed Mr. Trump's complaint about the lack of a solution for Dreamers and lack of funding for his border wall.\n\n\"We gave him a deal a month ago,\" Kaine said. \"One month ago I was the chief Democratic negotiator on a bipartisan bill in the Senate that provided protection for Dreamers, including a path to citizenship, cleaning up the problem he created...and giving the president 25 billions dollars over 10 years for border security the exact number he asked for.\"\n\nKaine told reporters, \"We gave him every penny he asked for for 10 years and fixed the Dreamer problem, and he said, 'No.' When he says today, 'Oh I'm unhappy there's not a solution here,' it's like, were you asleep last month?\"\n\nGeorgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, said, \"We have an indefensible position as the Congress, but we also have a responsibility as the Congress, and the responsibility is not to shut the government down.\"\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, called Mr. Trump, \"one of the worst negotiators I've ever seen.\"\n\nSen. Bob Corker, who has clashed with the president on other issues, is behind him in opposing this bill, though not for the reasons Mr. Trump cited. Nonetheless, he tweeted his support, and offered him a pen for the veto.\n\n\"Please do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen,\" his tweet read. \"The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the majority whip, accused Democrats of mucking up the bill-writing process, but nonetheless called on the president to sign it. \"[T]he benefits of Omnibus to national security, border security, opioid crisis, infrastructure, school safety and fixing gun background check system are important and will save lives,\" he wrote in a Tweet Friday.\n\nFlorida Rep. Carlos Curbelo voted against the bill and agreed with the president.\n\n\"The President is right. Congressional inaction on immigration is shameful and inexcusable,\" he said in a statement. \"While Republican leaders continued to waste time on dead-end legislation,Democratic leaders prefered to use the issue as a campaign weapon ‎rather than solve the problem for Dreamers. The House should have an open debate that allows for the consideration of multiple legislative solutions, including one that tracks the White House outline, whether it's now or immediately when we reconvene.\"\n\nIt's not entirely clear when the president changed his mind. He tweeted praise for the bill Thursday and called on Congress to pass it. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday he had briefed the president on the spending bill and said Mr. Trump's support for it was a certainty. \"Yes, he supports the bill. No two ways about it,\" Ryan said.",

                "title": "Excerpt: Jimmy Carter's \"Faith: A Journey for All\"",
                "body": "In this excerpt from his new book, \"Faith: A Journey for All,\" published by Simon & Schuster (A division of CBS), former President and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jimmy Carter writes about the importance of faith to help man meet today's challenges and evolve a future of peaceful coexistence.\n\nDon't miss Jane Pauley's interview with President Carter on \"Sunday Morning\" March 25!\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLiving faith always involves love. -- Richard Niebuhr\n\nFaith without works is not faith at all, but a simple lack of obedience to God. -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer\n\nThe only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. -- Galatians 5:6\n\nThe issue of faith arises in almost every area of human existence, so it is important to understand its multiple meanings. For many of us, a question that needs to be answered is \"Am I a person of faith?\" The answer is almost always affirmative. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. I also emphasize the religious aspects of faith since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my own faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God. Faith, in both its religious and broader dimensions, influences our individual and communal lives, our lives in religion, and our lives in government and in secular affairs.\n\nThe most important element of faith ever imposed on me, and on another person simultaneously, involved the threat of the total elimination of human life on earth by a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. My ultimate responsibility as President of the United States was to defend my country against a military attack, and I learned soon after my election that we and the Soviets had enough atomic weapons in our arsenals to destroy each other and that the resulting radiation and other collateral damage would kill most of the rest of the world's population. This was a constant haunting realization that dominated my conscious hours during my term in office -- and I shared the responsibility with Leonid Brezhnev, President of the Soviet Union. Our common goal, of course, was to avoid a nuclear war. Brezhnev and I had to have faith in ourselves, and in each other. Every decision I made was affected by this threat, and it still exists, as the same responsibility is passed on from one president to the next.\n\nWe face many issues within which religion, politics, and private matters tend to mix, sometimes explosively, creating sharp divisions among us, in our private and public lives and between and within religious denominations. It is increasingly difficult to keep issues of religion and government separate, as even the purely religious issues are routinely addressed by politicians -- and vice versa. I have confronted the separation of government and religion from both directions. I think often of the strong reaction of our visiting revival preacher in my mother's home when I decided to run for the state senate back in 1962. He asked me, \"How can you, as a Christian, a deacon, and a Sunday School teacher, become involved in the dirty business of politics?\" Without thinking, I gave him a smart-aleck response: \"I will have 75,000 people in my senate district. How would you like to have a congregation that big?\"\n\nI believe now, more than then, that Christians are called to plunge into the life of the world, and to inject the moral and ethical values of our faith into the processes of governing. At the same time, there must be an absolute prohibition against granting any control by government over our religious freedoms. More recently, since our years in the White House, I have tended to move away from politics and toward religion, but the two are still related. There is no doubt that my having been a national political leader is what attracts most visitors to my Bible classes, and it is clear to me that many of these worshippers are eager to help shape our nation's political agenda.\n\nIn a speech to my fellow Baptists in 1978, I tried to explain the duality of my personal responsibilities as a president and a Christian:\n\nThomas Jefferson, in the original days of our country, said he was fearful that the church might influence the state to take away human liberty. Roger Williams, who created the first Baptist church in America, was afraid that the church might be corrupted by the state. These concerns led to our Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the establishment of any official state religion and, in the same sentence, prohibits the passing of any laws that might interfere with religious freedom.\n\nSeparation is specified in the law, but for a religious person, there is nothing wrong with bringing these two together, because you can't divorce religious beliefs from public service. At the same time, of course, in public office you cannot impose your own religious beliefs on others.\n\nIn my office at the White House I have to deal with many domestic and international problems: peace, freedom, nuclear explosives, the sale of weapons, terrorism, rapidly expanding populations without adequate food. But this is more than a list of political problems. These are also moral problems for you and me, because they violate the very precepts of God in which we believe.\n\nI want our country to be strong enough in all elements, military and otherwise, so we never have to prove we are strong.\n\nReinhold Niebuhr, in his book Moral Man and Immoral Society, pointed out the difference between a society and a people. The expectations from a person are a much higher standard. A person should have as our goal complete agape (self-sacrificial love). The most we can expect from a society is to institute simple justice.\n\nSo, we as people have to do better, particularly if we are blessed with the opportunity to demonstrate our worth. Leaders also must be careful not to be too timid. ...\n\nA country will have authority and influence because of moral factors, not its military strength; because it can be humble and not blatant and arrogant; because our people and our country want to serve others and not dominate others. And a nation without morality will soon lose its influence around the world.\n\nWhat are the goals of a person or a denomination or a country? They are all remarkably the same: a desire for peace; a need for humility, for examining one's faults and turning away from them; a commitment to human rights in the broadest sense of the words, based on a moral society concerned with the alleviation of suffering because of deprivation or hatred or hunger or physical affliction; and a willingness, even an eagerness, to share one's ideals, one's faith with others, to translate love in a person to justice.\n\nI was brought up in a family that was stable, cohesive, and remarkably isolated from the outside world, except for the small community of Plains, Georgia. Home was our unchangeable haven, in times of pain or pleasure. There was no doubt that my father made the final decisions, but we all knew that Mama's influence and opinions were always major factors in the management of our family. There were certain aspects of life, particularly in the running of the household and the raising of my sisters, that were almost exclusively my mother's purview. Together, our parents were dominant, and we children respected and obeyed them. In fact, I never deliberately disobeyed either of them. It was my mother, then my father, in whom I had absolute faith.\n\nNowadays, most Americans move around frequently and are exposed to many influences, and our environments and customs are multifaceted. But for me as a child, there were just a few sources of knowledge about myself or any other people. Our contacts with the world beyond our community were limited. We didn't have running water or electricity in our house, so time on the battery radio was restricted, even on the rare evenings when we stayed up after dark. On special nights, keeping our eyes fixed on the radio, we listened as a family to The Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie, Fibber McGee and Molly, and Amos 'n' Andy. My parents would sometimes let me stay up until 8:00 p.m. to hear Glenn Miller's band playing the current musical hits for fifteen minutes. That was all the outside world I knew. In addition to my family and our close neighbors, all African-American, I encountered other people just through school and the church in Plains. Our prom parties, which parents would support for entertainment and primarily to let boys and girls get acquainted in preparation for future marriages, were orchestrated by the church.\n\nSunday mornings were for Sunday School and preaching at Plains Baptist Church, where Daddy was a teacher and a deacon. I remember vividly that after church we always had the best meal of the week, usually fried chicken, mashed potatoes, hot biscuits, and vegetables from our big garden, followed by pies made from sweet potatoes or fruits of the season. Afterward, our activities were severely limited. There were no stores open, movies in the county seat were out of the question, and shooting a gun or playing cards was prohibited. Fishing in the nearby creek or pond was a close call, but eventually it came to be permitted if done discreetly. It would not have been appropriate, however, to walk down a public road with a fishing pole. My mother and father played cards, mostly bridge, but certainly not on Sunday. At the age of twelve, when I was deemed old enough to drive a car by myself, my sisters and I went back to the church on Sunday evenings for meetings of the Baptist Young People's Union (BYPU). This was very important, because it was the BYPU that sponsored most of the teenage social events. I need not go on, since the picture is fairly clear. It was a simple, family-centered, deeply religious, working existence, with interracial labor and play on the farm with my black neighbors. All the farmwork was done by humans or mules, and we grew corn as the common fuel for both. I imagine that, except for the radio, automobile, and a hand-cranked telephone, our lives were quite similar to those of our great- grandparents.\n\nDuring those early years, I witnessed the racial discrimination that still survived almost a hundred years after the end of the Civil War. Mandatory segregation of black and white citizens was supported and enforced, at least in the Southeastern United States, by state and federal laws, and was not questioned by anyone of influence that I knew. The only person who paid no attention to these racial customs was my mother, and she treated everyone the same because, I presumed, she was a registered nurse and a member of the medical profession. When I was a child, all my friends and playmates were African- American, and the one who was preeminent at any time was whoever had caught the biggest fish, killed the most rabbits, or could run faster, jump higher, or pick the most cotton in a day. When I rode to our county seat with one of my playmates, we always sat in different railroad cars and at separate levels in the movie theater, attended different schools and churches, and I knew that white students rode in buses and black students walked to and from school. I do not remember knowing that only white adults were permitted to vote and to serve on juries.\n\nMy first awareness of how segregation affected me and my friends was when my playmates and I were about twelve years old, when we were leaving the field and approaching the barn through what we called the \"pasture gate.\" The two black boys stood back to let me pass, and I presumed there was a trip wire there or some other reason for them to want me to go through first. Only much later did I realize that their parents had probably told them it was time for them to defer to me in some way. In a poem I wrote as an adult, I said,\n\nWe only saw it vaguely then,\n\nbut we were transformed at that place.\n\nA silent line was drawn between\n\nfriend and friend, race and race.\n\nThe next event that affected me directly was when I was a submarine officer and President Harry Truman ordained as commander in chief that all our military forces and the U.S. Civil Service end racial segregation. There was no trouble in implementing this command, and all of us on the ship saw the advantages gained by both black and white members of the crew. When our family returned home from the navy in 1953, this commitment to racial equality had become a part of our lives.\n\nMy father taught me that there should be a strict divide between religion and politics, and he also resented very deeply any intrusion of state or federal laws into our private affairs. I remember that Daddy opposed changing our clocks from \"God's sun time\" to \"daylight saving time,\" and although a staunch Democrat in other elections, he never voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt after 1932, because the New Deal agricultural program provided, to stabilize farm prices, that half-grown pigs (shoats) should be slaughtered and that part of our growing crops of cotton and peanuts had to be plowed up. For many years afterward, Daddy recalled how difficult it was to force a trained mule to walk on top of a planted row to plow it up instead of in the middle to cultivate. I guess that today he would be known as a libertarian.\n\nWhen I look back on my life, I can see how startling the changes have been. Eric Hoffer (1902-1983), the self-educated longshoreman and philosopher, described the years during my childhood as a time of hope, and the time of my adulthood as a time of desire. I knew the Great Depression years to be a time of hope, when the economic situation in America was so bad that everyone believed it could only improve; when things became plentiful, we tended to want not only what we already had but also what everyone else had.\n\nBoth at my presidential inauguration and when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, I quoted my favorite teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, who summarized her advice on how to accommodate the uncertainties in our future: \"We must welcome changing times, but cling to principles that never change.\" I would say that \"cling to\" meant \"have faith in.\" I have thought often about Miss Julia's advice over the years, and especially during some of the most trying times of my life, when I had to decide which enduring principles should be applied to a particular event or situation, and sometimes I use it in my church and college classes and in counseling people who are distressed about current crises that we have to face.\n\nToday, of course, family life even in the small Plains community is quite different. Some activities that were once strictly concealed in our \"proper\" society are probably no more prevalent but are now out in the open. Divorce has become acceptable, even for active church members. Without trying to analyze it too deeply, I see that one of the most significant changes is the relationship between young people and their parents. My siblings and I had an intimate and subservient relationship with our parents until we left home, but now the ties are substantially broken during the early teen years, no matter how much parents want to retain a strong influence over their growing children. The outside world is a much more powerful factor in life, with the availability of rapid transportation, television, social media, and particularly a broader circle of friends (and possibly rivals or adversaries), whose influence often exceeds that of immediate families. But perhaps just as many in today's world would still like to have certain faith in a core of principles that do not change. Where do we turn now when there is a moral question to be answered? What things in the twenty-first century are the same as they were eighty years ago? We still need a permanent foundation on which our lives can be fashioned. Without a central core of beliefs or standards in which to have faith and by which to live, we may never experience the challenge and excitement of seeking a greater life. We will have ceased to grow, like Jesus, \"strong; he was, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him\" (Luke 2:40).\n\nWe must accommodate life's challenges, some welcome and others quite painful, but we don't want the verities of our lives to change. We need to have something unshakable in which to have faith, like a mother's love -- something that can't be changed or destroyed by war, political events, the loss of a loved one, lack of success in business, a serious illness, or failure to realize our own ambitions. We need some foundation on which we can build a predictable and dependable existence.\n\nThis cannot always be found in either our nation's laws or our social customs. I would like to say as an American who has been president that the cherished values of our country are constant, but they are not. There are always powerful forces that work against the idealistic principles of peace, truthfulness, equality, justice, and even hospitality, freedom, and friendship. There is a lot of secret maneuvering that is never understood or even known by the public, and a great deal of unpublicized change in the interpretation of laws or the passage of new ones. Some laws violate what seem to be accepted principles and create serious divisions within our society. Also, almost every major religious faith -- Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Islamic -- is divided over controversial secular issues like abortion, gay rights, the role of women in society, or even female clothing. But despite the confusion and controversy in secular affairs and among religious organizations, the basic principles I've just mentioned have never changed. These are the foundation for our faith.\n\nPeople have always tried to improve their own lives, through communal living and the evolution of secular laws and rules considered to be beneficial, at least to a dominant portion of them. So far as I know, a concerted worldwide effort to encapsulate high ideals into a common agreement has been made only once, and included the nations who had been victorious, or at least neutral, in World War II. This common agreement is known as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I remember that I followed the United Nations proceedings in San Francisco very closely as a member of the U.S. Navy, either as a midshipman at Annapolis or from a battleship in the Atlantic Ocean. The key nations that founded the U.N. in October 1945 were the \"Big Four\" -- China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States -- and they were joined by forty-seven others. The overriding objective was to prevent further armed conflicts after more than 60 million people had been killed in the war, and to agree on a set of peace incentives that could prevent warfare among future potential disputants. For many complex reasons, the United Nations's primary goal of preserving peace has not been reached.\n\nSince that time, the military forces of our own country have been involved in conflict with more than twenty other nations, in wars that cost the lives of 10 million people, and the potential for further military engagements remains. As of November 2017, the United States military forces were actively engaged in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Niger, Somalia, Jordan, and Thailand. Andrew Bacevich, a retired colonel who lost a son in Iraq, made an accurate comment: \"A collective indifference to war has become an emblem of contemporary America.\" One major reason for our citizens' lack of concern about warfare is that most families are not directly affected by these conflicts, since the burden of combat now falls on just the 1 percent of Americans who serve in the military.\n\nTo live in peace is only one of the key human rights, and in December 1948, when the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it described these principles in thirty brief articles. To the best of their ability, those who drafted this declaration extracted the highest moral and ethical ideals of the world's great religions and expressed them in secular terms that could be understood by lawmakers and private citizens of all nations. The Universal Declaration promised to all people the economic, social, political, cultural, and civic rights that underpin a life free from discrimination, want, and fear. As with the United Nations's promise of sustained peace, these promises of human rights have not been realized. It seems that there is a steady reduction in the number of things in which we can have faith.\n\nWe know that evolution is a global process, usually progressive, that results from the adaptation of living organisms to natural selection and sudden mutations. I believe it has been God's plan to evolve human beings, and that after thousands of centuries we now find ourselves uniquely endowed with an understanding of who and what we are and have the knowledge and freedom to help shape our own destiny. This freedom to help in affecting our future evolution is a great challenge and opportunity, and it is our inherited duty to contribute to moral and spiritual advancement.\n\nIt is sobering to realize that the average human intelligence has probably not changed appreciably during the last ten thousand years. In fact, the total capacity of the brains of Neanderthals has been found to be greater than that of modern humans. We also know that the process of learning has greatly accelerated during recent times with our improved ability to share information rapidly. For the first time, we have become aware that our own existence is threatened by things such as nuclear weapons and global warming. These recognized threats are, perhaps, already an ongoing test of our human intelligence, our freedom, and our ability to shape our own destiny. The human challenge now is to survive by having sustained faith in each other and in the highest common moral principles that we have spasmodically evolved, and through mutual understanding and peaceful cooperation in addressing the discerned challenges to our common existence.\n\nIt is urgent that humans take a new look at the rapidly growing need for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Koran, or the teachings of Jesus Christ and to see if these visions of improved human interrelationships might be used to meet the challenges of the present moment and evolve a future of peaceful coexistence, based on faith in each other.",

                "body": "ATLANTA - Jurors hearing the case of a prominent Atlanta attorney who shot and killed his wife got to hear from the suspect Thursday via video of a police interview that took place two days after the shooting, reports CBS affiliate WGCL. Claude \"Tex\" McIver, 75, is accused of intentionally shooting his wife, Diane, while they both rode in a car driven by a friend.\n\nDiane, 64, was in the front passenger seat and Tex was sitting in the back when the shooting took place in September 2016.\n\nProsecutors argue that McIver shot his wife intentionally, while his defense attorneys say the shooting was an accident.\n\nDuring the police interview shown to jurors on Thursday, McIver, who was accompanied by two attorneys, told police he fell asleep in the car on the way back to Atlanta. He said he woke up when he felt the car going downhill and told police he asked Diane for his gun because \"every turn we made seemed like the road was getting darker and darker, and more and more people were out,\" McIver added. He said it made the hair on the back of his neck raise.\n\nMcIver then told police he must have drifted back to sleep, and then the friend who was driving, Dani Jo Carter, came to a stop.\n\n\"Dani Jo came to a stop, and I was handling the gun. I didn't realize it was in my lap and it went off,\" he said in the video interview.\n\nMcIver told police that after the gun went off, he yelled, \"Is everyone all right?\" but that's inconsistent with what Carter told the jury in previous testimony.\n\nCarter said McIver didn't say anything. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported earlier this week that when Carter testified she said that after they brought Diane to the hospital, Tex McIver called his lawyer and asked Carter to change her version of events.\n\n\"'I don't trust these guys. Dani Jo, I hate to see you get wrapped up in this,'\" Carter testified Tex McIver said. \"'I've seen how these things can go down ...You just need to say you came down here as a friend of the family.'\"\n\nCarter reportedly said she replied, \"Tex, I just drove you into the emergency room.\"\n\n\"He looked at me and said, 'Well, they don't know that,'\" Carter said, reports the AJC. \"That took my breath away. I said, 'I can't lie.'\"\n\nIn the video interview, McIver also told police that he only had a few sips of wine at dinner. But Carter told the jury he had wine on the way to the restaurant, wine at the restaurant bar and a glass of wine at dinner.\n\nAccording to WGCL, police said that at one point during the interview, McIver said, \"I think I'm about to cry,\" but a detective testified he never actually saw McIver cry before or after he made that comment.\n\nThe AJC reports that on Friday morning, Jay Grover, one of Diane's co-workers, testified that in the days after his wife's death, McIver seemed preoccupied with money and asked him whether he knew how he could collect Diane's Social Security.",

                "body": "Dropbox's market debut could bring a much-needed ray of light to the technology sector. Shares of the cloud-storage company began trading under the ticker symbol DBX (DBX) on Friday, jumping 47 percent in early trading.\n\nAbout 36 million shares of Dropbox on Thursday sold for $21 a piece, above the $18-to-$20 range foreseen by its investment bankers and reportedly giving it a market value of about $8.2 billion to $9.2 billion. Its stock traded at $30.94 at noon on Friday, an increase of nearly $10 or 46 percent.\n\nDropbox's foray into the public market comes at a turbulent time on Wall Street and especially for tech stocks, after Facebook's data scandal wiped nearly $60 billion off the company's market cap. On Thursday, benchmark indexes plummeted more than 2 percent on worries about a potential trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nFounded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology students, the San Francisco startup offers a subscription service that allows for online filing sharing and collaboration.\n\nDropbox has not yet tallied an annual profit, but it did cut losses to $112 million in 2017 from $326 million the year before, while notching 30 percent-plus sales growth, according to the New York Times. The company up until this week has been supported by private investors including Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners.\n\nThe company's IPO could open the door for other so-called unicorns -- start-ups valued at more than a billion dollars. Demand for its shares is an indication that investors aren't overly worried about rival providers of clod-storage services, including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN).",

                "title": "What are the limits of at-home genetic tests?",
                "body": "Earlier this month, the FDA approved the first direct-to-consumer test in the U.S. that's designed to find three gene mutations linked to breast cancer without a doctor's prescription. It's the latest in a growing number of cheaper and easier genetic tests that can reveal information about your ancestors, risks for certain diseases, or even why you're sensitive to bitter tastes.\n\nCBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus joined \"CBS This Morning\" to discuss the pros and cons of the cheaper and easier genetic tests, some of which cost less than $100.\n\n\"There are other at-home tests that require a doctor to sign off on it, but you can do it at home - you spit into a tube, you send it in - that could look for all the mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene which is risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Remember, when Angelina Jolie heroically announced 'I have this gene' five years ago, it was $4,000 for the test. Now it's been democratized for less than $100,\" he said.\n\nBut it's important to note that the newly approved test from 23andMe only covers three of more than 1,000 mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer. Agus said he worries people who test negative for those three mutations will wrongly assume that they're not at risk at all.\n\nWhile these tests provide some useful knowledge, he recommends that anyone considering at-home genetic testing involve a doctor who can help interpret the results.\n\n\"This is serious stuff and I want to make sure you really understand as the consumer what's going on, because big decisions have to be made in either direction,\" he said.\n\nUsing his own experience as an example, Agus explained why it's important for people to keep in mind that genetic test results are not \"binary.\"\n\n\"I took [a] test myself. My results were on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and I was higher risk for heart disease. It didn't mean I was going to get it, it's just the national risk factor was 38 percent for a male my age. I was in the high 40s. I mean, it changed what I did and I really paid attention, but it's not a yes/no answer. So you really need somebody who understands it to explain it.\"\n\nDespite his concerns, Agus maintains that these tests can provide more knowledge and, ultimately, \"knowledge is power.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. prosecutors said Thursday they have dismissed all criminal charges against seven of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's bodyguards stemming from a brawl in Washington last year in which protesters were beaten. The charges were dropped last month just a day ahead of a meeting between Erdogan and now-outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but the State Department said the timing was coincidental.\n\nProsecutors said they dropped the charges against the seven on Feb. 14 after dropping charges against four others in November. Assault charges are still pending against four other members of Erdogan's security detail as well as two Canadian citizens accused in the May 2017 altercation outside the Turkish ambassador's Washington home during a visit by Erdogan. The incident sparked outrage in Washington and elsewhere and was condemned by the State Department and local officials.\n\nTurkey has said the demonstrators were outlawed Kurdish militants and loudly complained when charges were announced against 19 people, including some of Erdogan's bodyguards. Two Americans pleaded guilty in December to assault in the matter and are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\nThe case badly damaged U.S.-Turkish relations and tensions between the NATO allies have increased further because of differences over military operations in Syria.\n\nA day after the charges were dropped, Tillerson met with Erdogan in Ankara in a bid to ease the strained ties but the State Department said it was not involved in the decision.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's office in Washington declined to comment on the reason for the dismissals.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the action, said Tillerson told Turkish officials that the cases was an example of how the U.S. had addressed Erdogan's grievances.\n\nHowever, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Thursday that Tillerson had only mentioned the dismissals as an indication of the independence of the American judiciary.\n\n\"He noted that the timing was coincidental, but he also noted it was a good example of how we have an independent judiciary in our country, and that the Department of Justice made those decisions,\" she told reporters. \"The secretary did not discuss this issue with President Erdogan as any type of a quid pro quo.\"\n\nTillerson's discussion with Erdogan at which they agreed to try to improve relations raised some eyebrows at the time because he did not bring any other U.S. officials into the three-hour meeting. The only other person in the room was Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who translated for the two men.",

                "body": "John Bolton, the famously hawkish former Ambassador to the United Nations, will be President Trump's new national security adviser.\n\nThe U.N. job was Bolton's highest-profile position, making him a household name during President George W. Bush's second term. Bush's decision to send Bolton to the U.N. was controversial in 2005 because Bolton was already known as a fierce critic of the organization.\n\nHe had by that time been a veteran of the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and was in charge of the State Department's non-proliferation efforts. Bolton had successfully helped keep the U.S. out of the International Criminal Court, and was said to frequently spar with his boss at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n\nBolton once argued that if the U.N. building in Manhattan \"lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\" He had also said that, \"there is no United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interests.\"\n\nHis Senate approval hearings for the U.N. post were contentious, and his confirmation was filibustered by Democrats with the help of several Republicans. Bush eventually sent Bolton to the U.N. through a recess appointment later that year.\n\nAfter resigning from the Bush administration, Bolton joined the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. He also became a fixture on Fox News, where he would frequently argue for the U.S. military force to resolve crises abroad, and publicly flirted with running for president.\n\nBolton is particularly hawkish when it comes to North Korea and Iran, and has argued for preemptive American attacks on both countries. As recently as last month, he was arguing that the U.S. had a legal basis to attack North Korea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.\n\nBolton has also been a fierce critic of the Iran nuclear deal. The deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, appears to be in jeopardy now that Bolton is joining the White House.\n\n\"Not only does the entire agreement reflect appeasement, but President Obama's diplomacy produced weak, ambiguous and confusing language in many specific provisions,\" Bolton wrote about the deal last year. \"These drafting failures created huge loopholes, and Iran is now driving its missile and nuclear programs straight through them.\"\n\nHowever, Bolton and Mr. Trump do not always see eye to eye. For example, Bolton is a reflexive defender of the Iraq War, which Mr. Trump frequently criticized on the campaign trail. And Bolton is also wary of Russia and has called for a more aggressive stance towards Moscow, while Mr. Trump has emphasized the necessity of good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

                "title": "Trump's China tariffs leave room to negotiate, but investors fret",
                "body": "The Trump administration's tough talk on China may leave enough wiggle room to avoid an all-out trade war.\n\nAlthough the plan proposes tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports and to limit Chinese investment in the U.S., it leaves room for input from a wide swath of U.S. industries that have voiced opposition to the trade measures. It also includes a willingness to rely on the World Trade Organization to help mediate parts of the disputes, surprising some experts who thought Mr. Trump might go it alone.\n\n\"Trump left enough flexibility in how that $50 billion is calculated that he has room to make some headway with China even if the U.S. ultimately does impose some tariffs,\" said Height Capital analyst Clayton Allen in an email.\n\nU.S. businesses seem happy that there's a pause, albeit brief, for them to weigh in. \"It's encouraging -- we would like to participate in a process that helps educate the administration on potential downstream harms of the tariffs,\" said David French, the chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which was among a group of 45 trade associations that is urging Mr. Trump to refrain from imposing tariffs.\n\nBy contrast, investors are signaling a bad outcome: Stock markets tanked after Mr. Trump outlined the trade measures.\n\nSome observers see the proposals as a way to force China to the table faster.\n\n\"We're looking at the [proposals] as a way to get China to the table now,\" said Peter Donisanu, a Wells Fargo investment strategy analyst, in an interview. \"We would get concerned if the tariffs started being blanket, and larger, but for now this seems to be about renegotiating trade deals.\"\n\nMr. Trump is using a Cold War-era weapon to punish China: Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, under which he can unilaterally impose tariffs. It was meant for a world in which large swaths of global commerce were not covered by trade agreements as a way to open markets to U.S. goods, Chad Brown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a recent blog. Once the World Trade Organization began moderating global trade in 1995, use of Section 301 virtually disappeared.\n\nBy including the WTO in its framework, the Trump administration is still working through established channels. China was admitted to the WTO in 2001.\n\n\"If they, the administration, are moving in the direction that goes through the WTO that are not tariffs, that are done with key partners like the EU and Japan, we think that's really encouraging and that's the direction the conversation should go,\" said Josh Kallmer, the Information Technology Industry Council's senior vice president of global policy, in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration already poked China in January with tariffs on imported solar panels. Next came steel and aluminum tariffs, prompting an outcry from trading partners and criticism that those tariffs will have only a small impact on China. The metal tariffs have since been softened by the U.S. with multiple exemptions for Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, South Korea and Germany, which account for more than half of all imports.\n\nIf the latest proposed tariffs appear measured compared to Mr. Trump's initial rhetoric, how far China is willing to go to defend itself is hard to predict. China typically responds to trade salvos proportionally, which economists call a tit-for-tat response.\n\nChinese officials wasted no time in responding to the U.S. trade actions by imposing $3 billion in reciprocal tariffs on pork, fruits, nuts, wine, steel pipe and recycled aluminum. And China is already eyeing American farmers, perhaps aiming at Mr. Trump's rural base of voters in places like Iowa and Ohio.\n\nAnother concern remains how Chinese President Xi Jinping himself will respond as he consolidates power. He has shown few signs of acquiescing to U.S. pressure.\n\nChina is America's largest trading partner, and Mr. Trump points to America's trade deficit of about $375 billion as a sign that the trade relationship is unbalanced. He has publicly called on China to shave $100 billion off that figure.\n\nMr. Xi \"has spent the past few years cultivating the image of a strongman, and it would be very surprising if he were not to retaliate,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a client note. \"Nothing rallies support at home more effectively than being seen to face down an external threat, even one whose actions, arguably, you have provoked.\"\n\nLate Thursday, China issued a response through its U.S. embassy: \"China does not want a trade war with anyone,\" the statement said. \"But China is not afraid of, and will not recoil from, a trade war. ...If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.\"",

                "body": "Behold, the most coveted wedding invitation of the century -- or at least since the one from Prince William and Duchess Kate's wedding seven years ago. On Thursday, Kensington Palace announced the official wedding invitations of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are in the mail.\n\nFor 600 lucky guests, just receiving that golden ticket will be an event in itself, CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports.\n\nThe gilded invites are printed in American ink on English paper, in keeping with the transatlantic spirit of their union. They're handmade by the delightfully named apprentice, Lottie Small.\n\n\"The worst thing is keeping it from my mum, not being able to tell my mum, because anything else she'd be the first person I'd have called,\" Small said.\n\nBut secrets remain: who is on the invitation list, and who's not?\n\n\"Do you think President Trump or any of the family is going to be invited?\" D'Agata asked.\n\n\"No, President Trump won't be invited, and he was never expected to be invited. This is not a state occasion. It's not a state wedding,\" royal correspondent Roya Nikkhah said.\n\nThe invitation also reveals a traditional dress code. For men, a uniform, morning coat or lounge suit. For ladies, a day dress with hat.\n\nWhether Harry, now general captain of the Royal Marines, will don full military dress as he did for his brother's wedding, or opt for a slightly dressed-down morning suit is anybody's guess.\n\nAbout 600 people are being invited to the wedding service, but there is an even more exclusive list: only 200 guests made the cut for the private reception that night at Frogmore House.\n\n\"Very close family and friends. I think they're doing that so that everyone gets to see and hang out with them and also so it stays very private and probably isn't splashed on social media everywhere, Nikkhah said.\n\nFrogmore House served as a kind of hideout when the couple's romance was on the down low and became the location of their first official engagement shoot.\n\nThe guest list is multi-tiered, kind of like a wedding cake. You've got the 200 at the reception, 600 at the church service, and then there will be another 2,600 members of the public, some affiliated with the couple's charities, who will be welcomed inside the grounds of Windsor Castle to witness the arrival and the carriage and the wedding dress up close.",

                "title": "U.S. stocks stabilize after Thursday's tailspin",
                "body": "U.S. stocks regained their footing after plunging on Thursday amid fears of a U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 140.35 points, or less than 1 percent, to 24,098.24 after the opening bell on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index also rose slightly in early trading.\n\nWorries about a trade war sent stocks into a tailspin on Thursday -- with the Dow dropping more than 700 points -- after President Donald Trump announced $50 billion in new tariffs on Chinese goods, a move experts fear could spark further retaliatory trade measures by Beijing. Investors have become anxious about rising trade tensions after the administration announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earlier this year.\n\n\"The potential for further escalation remains in place especially given the likelihood of more US trade sanctions from the increasingly protectionist administration,\" Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities, wrote in a research report. \"In this respect, risk appetite is unlikely to improve significantly and markets will remain nervous in the weeks ahead, keeping volatility elevated.\"\n\nThe planned U.S. sanctions include tariffs on $48 billion worth of Chinese imports as well as restrictions on Chinese investments. Trump said he was acting in response to theft of American technology.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative identified 1,300 product lines as potential targets, including aerospace, information and communication technology, and machinery. A more complete list is due soon, to be followed by a 30-day comment period.\n\nConcern that trade conflicts could wreak havoc on the world economy deepened as China responded to Trump's recent tariff hikes on steel and aluminum by warning it could order higher import duties on U.S. goods including pork, apples and steel pipe.\n\n\"If the tariffs go ahead as planned, then we believe China will retaliate. It is impossible to imagine that they cannot. And then we expect the U.S. to retaliate further,\" said Rob Carnell, ING's chief Asia economist. \"This can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly.\"\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry urged Washington to negotiate a settlement, saying tariffs undermine the global trading system.\n\n\"Everbody's pushing each other around to do some negotiating,\" said David Collins, chief operations officer at CMC China Manufacturing Consultants, which advises companies on setting up factories in China. \"Trump is negotiating. He's pushing back on the Chinese, and the Chinese will push back.\"\n\nPeter Donisanu, an investment strategy analyst for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said the risk of a damaging trade war is still low because the Trump administration is targeting specific goods that aren't central to China's economy. That could change if it puts tariffs on products like electronics or appliances imported from China.\n\n\"If the Trump administration really wanted to hurt China and start a trade war, then they would go after those larger sectors,\" he said.\n\nThe risk of a U.S-China trade war is a regional concern, given the myriad supply chains and other ties across Asia. For example, South Korea's largest trading partner is China. The U.S. is its second biggest.\n\n\"I'm worried that it would affect the national economy,\" said S. E. Kim, an employee at a construction company in Seoul. \"If the U.S. imposes tariffs on China like that, I think there would be some damage on us in the long term as well.\"\n\nConcern over higher U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum eased somewhat when the Trump administration said some countries will be exempt. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Thursday that the tariffs won't apply to the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Australia.\n\nJapan's trade minister described the U.S. decision not to exclude Japanese exports as \"extremely regrettable.\"\n\n\"We will continue our effort patiently to persuade the U.S. to remove Japan from the list,\" Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko told reporters.\n\nA traditional \"safe haven\" from risk, the Japanese yen touched a 17-month high against the U.S. dollar in response to the jitters over trade.\n\nIn Asia, markets ended sharply lower after a stomach-churning ride. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 4.5 percent to 20,617.86, its second-biggest daily decline in a year, and South Korea's Kospi tumbled 3.2 percent to 2,416.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 2.5 percent to 30,309.29 and the Shanghai Composite in mainland China sank 3.4 percent to 3,152.76. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 skidded 2 percent to 5,820.70. Benchmarks in Taiwan, Southeast Asia and India also posted sizeable losses.\n\nThe dollar fell to 104.87 yen from 105.28 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro rose to $1.2337 from $1.2302.\n\nOil futures rallied. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 48 cents to $64.77 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 87 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $64.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 33 cents to $68.71 a barrel in London.",

The fire broke out around 11 p.m. on a movie set in the basement of an unoccupied residential building, New York Fire Department Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters in an early morning briefing.\n\nIt was in a long-closed club, the St. Nick's Jazz Pub, in a building designated as a landmark by New York City, CBS New York says.\n\nThe movie, \"Motherless Brooklyn,\" was set for release next year and stars Bruce Willis, Willem Dafoe and Alec Baldwin. Edward Norton is director / screenwriter and is also listed as an actor.\n\nThe film's producers issued a statement saying, \"Our deepest condolences to the family of Michael R. Davidson. A fire broke out tonight in the building where we were shooting our film. Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us. As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.\n\n\"To our great sorrow, we now know that a NYC firefighter lost his life battling the blaze that grew, and our hearts ache in solidarity with his family. New York City firefighters truly are the bravest in the world. We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading, putting their lives on the line as they do every day. The FDNY are real life super-heroes and have our boundless admiration and gratitude.\"\n\nEric Phillips, press secretary for NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, announced the death on Twitter:\n\nThe firefighter who lost his life was identified as Michael R. Davidson, 37, a 15 year veteran of the New York Fire Department, and husband and father of four:\n\nTwo other firefighters were injured -- with burns -- and were in serious condition, Nigro said. In addition, three minor injuries to civilians were reported.\n\nSome 200 NYPD were there.\n\nNew York City Council member Mark Levine tweeted about it:\n\nLevine retweeted images of the flames:\n\nThe fire was declared under control about 2:30 a.m. Friday.\n\nThe building, constructed in 1920, wasn't fire-resistant and the flames spread quickly, Nigro said. The cause of the blaze was under investigation.",

                "body": "Erin Moriarty is a \"48 Hours\" correspondent. She investigated the death of 31-year-old Nicole Vander Heyden for the episode, \"The FitBit Alibi.\" The all-new episode airs Saturday at 10 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.\n\nMillions of people wear a Fitbit or some kind of physical tracking device to log their exercise and sleep habits, but when a Wisconsin man began wearing one in 2016, he never guessed that it would provide an alibi and save him from murder charges in the brutal death of his girlfriend.\n\nThe case, that went on trial this past February in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is one of the first of many to come where high tech devices will not only provide crucial evidence in criminal trials, but may prevent wrongful convictions.\n\nOn May 21, 2016, Doug Detrie's girlfriend and mother of his infant son, 31-year-old Nicole Vander Heyden, was found beaten and strangled to death in a field a little over three miles from the home they shared. Detrie, 35 at the time, had been with her just hours earlier. They had attended a Steel Panther concert, followed by drinking and dancing.\n\nWhen the couple became separated, Vander Heyden went on to a local bar called the Sardine Can, expecting Detrie to follow. When Detrie failed to show, Vander Heyden began sending angry texts accusing him of flirting with other woman. At around 12:30 a.m., Vander Heyden, now drunk and angry, walked out of the bar and was never seen alive by her friends again.\n\nDetrie and a friend drove around searching for Vander Heyden, then went home, smoked some marijuana and, as he later told police, went to sleep. He waited until 4:30 that afternoon to report her missing, hours after her body had been found in that field.\n\nBrown County Sheriff's detectives interviewed Detrie and later obtained a search warrant for the couple's home. Blood was found on the garage floor and in Vander Heyden's car, leaving investigators wondering if the missing woman had actually come home and had been killed by Detrie, who then used her car to transport the body to the field.\n\nSuspicions deepened a day later when a neighbor across the street found a pool of blood and a cord that investigators believed may have been used to strangle the victim. Lead detective Sergeant Brian Slinger wondered if \"there was some sort of argument between her and Doug, maybe, when she got home and that...somehow ended up out in the street.\"\n\nAt that point, Detrie was the logical suspect, although he denied killing Vander Heyden. He was arrested and jailed, but investigators wanted to wait on the results of lab tests before charging him with murder.\n\nThose charges never came.\n\nLess than three weeks later, Detrie was released from jail after test results show the blood in the car wasn't the victim's, the blood on the floor wasn't human and a partial DNA of an unidentified man was found on her clothes and the cord.\n\nWhat's more, Detrie appeared to have an unconventional alibi \"witness\": the Fitbit he was wearing when Vander Heyden went missing. Sergeant Slinger said that he and others had noticed that Detrie had been wearing the personal tracking device on his left wrist when first questioned by police at home. When the data on that device was downloaded and examined, it seemed to clear Detrie.\n\n\"He had a few footsteps throughout the night,\" said Sergeant Slinger, \"...getting up to go to the bathroom, check on the baby, whatever. His story that he told us was absolutely, 100 percent true.\"\n\nThere was yet another device that seemed to support Detrie's innocence as well: an insurance company tracking device known as a \"Snapshot\" that was installed on Vander Heyden's car. The information downloaded from the \"Snapshot\" indicated that her car had not been driven that night.\n\nBut if Doug Detrie didn't kill Nicole Vander Heyden, who did? Whose DNA was left on her clothing and the cord used to kill her? As it turns out, 21st century technology would help answer those questions as well.\n\nIn August 2016, investigators were able to recover enough of the unidentified male DNA from one of the victim's socks to send to the national database and soon they had a name: George Steven Burch.\n\nAnd as Brown County sheriff investigators would soon discover, in the early morning hours that Nicole Vander Heyden was murdered, Burch had been carrying a phone with him that contained a treasure trove of incriminating information.\n\nOn his phone is a program known as Google Dashboard. The Dashboard collects, not just cell phone tower data, but also tracks every Wi-Fi hotspot the phone encounters, as well as GPS coordinates. The information on Burch's phone showed that on May 21, 2016, he was everywhere or very close to where Vander Heyden had been.\n\nHe started the night at a bar a half mile from where she was last seen. He was at her home eight miles away for an hour, he was then at the field where her body was found and even at a location on the highway where some of her possessions had been discarded.\n\nSergeant Slinger was sure he had his man, and in September 2016, George Burch was charged with the intentional homicide of Nicole Vander Heyden.\n\nIt would still be a long, winding road to justice. At his February trial, George Burch and his attorneys raised serious questions about the reliability of the Fitbit and the other devices, arguing that prosecutors were relying too much on untested technology. What's more, while Burch admits these devices might show that he was with Nicole, they don't show who actually killed her.\n\nAnd he says the killer is Doug Detrie, the same man police initially suspected.\n\nWith all the new technology used in this case, justice for Nicole Vander Heyden will still be determined the old-fashioned way, by the jury.",

Jennifer Withers told The Associated Press that her 26-year-old son, Collin Thomas, was walking from work Tuesday night in Pflugerville to the house he and another man shared with Conditt when a group of officers \"flew at him.\"\n\nWithers, who spoke during an interview Thursday, said Thomas, who is black, was handcuffed, taken into custody by SWAT officers and questioned about the bombings.\n\nShe said he was held overnight but that none of his family was notified about where he was.\n\nConditt died early Wednesday after detonating a bomb as police were about to arrest him. Thomas was eventually released.\n\nPolice said earlier Thursday that they'd released Conditt's other roommate. They refused to name him, saying he wasn't currently under arrest.\n\nAustin police spokeswoman Anna Sabana said neither roommate has been charged. She said she did not know why Thomas was detained forcibly in the way his mother described.\n\nWithers said Thomas lived with Conditt for more than three months in a home Conditt was renovating with his father. She said her son was close to a family at the Christian church he attended, and that they introduced him to Conditt's family who were also Christian.\n\nShe said her son and the 23-year-old Conditt, who was white, \"seemed to get along fine.\"\n\n\"Collin said they all would sit around and chat and talk,\" Withers said.\n\nShe said her son didn't know anything about the bombs and that she never got to meet Conditt.\n\nConditt's first two bombs killed and injured black victims, leading to speculation that they were hate crimes - though investigators backed off those theories somewhat when subsequent victims were Hispanic and white.\n\nThey now say they don't know what motivated him.\n\nConditt made a 25-minute cellphone recording before his death. It was recovered after he detonated one of his own bombs along the side of Interstate 35 just outside of Austin as a SWAT team moved in.\n\nBut investigators say the recording provides few clues as to Conditt's motives - and they've refused to release it publicly, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nConditt built bombs planted in different parts of Austin that killed two people and severely wounded four others over three weeks starting on March 2. He began by placing explosives in packages left overnight on doorsteps, then rigged an explosive to a tripwire along a public trail. Finally, he sent two parcels with bombs via FedEx.\n\nAs fear grew, Conditt eventually was tracked down through store surveillance video, cellphone signals and witness accounts of a customer shipping FedEx packages in a disguise that included a blond wig and gloves.\n\nPolice found him early Wednesday at a hotel. And when his car moved, they followed and forced him off the road, setting up the confrontation that ended in an explosion.\n\nAustin Mayor Steve Adler praised police officers for stopping Conditt's sport utility vehicle before he could get onto the highway, even though they were aware he likely had explosive devices inside and they did not have as much backup as planned.\n\n\"We hear about folks who run into danger to keep us safe and we had one of those moments in very graphic and specific detail,\" Adler said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nNAACP Austin President Nelson Linder said the manhunt's end was a relief but that the public needs answers on what motivated Conditt, including whether the first two victims were targeted because they are from prominent black families.\n\n\"I don't think it's random at this point,\" Linder said. \"We're going to withhold our judgment and keep searching for information and why he killed those people.\"\n\nInvestigators have released few details about Conditt, who was unemployed, home-schooled and attended Austin Community College until 2012 but didn't graduate.\n\nThe Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday that a bomb Conditt made and shipped via FedEx had been addressed to an employee at a downtown Austin spa. It was intercepted at a processing center without exploding.\n\nAnita Ward works at Austin Med Spa and says that police and federal agents told her that her daughter, who also works there, was meant to be the recipient of the unexploded package.\n\nWard declined to name her daughter, who she said doesn't know Conditt. Police haven't commented.",

                "body": "Police surrounded a supermarket in southern France on Friday as a deadly hostage-taking situation played out after an attack on police officers. Witnesses told French media that a man holding people in the store claimed he was loyal to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nBFMTV said four French police from Marseilles first came under fire from at least one gunman in a vehicle in the town of Carcassone. The car then proceeded several miles east to Trebes, where a suspect went into a \"Super U\" store, taking a number of shoppers hostage.\n\nFrance's Interior Ministry confirmed that two people were killed in the store, and said the situation was ongoing.\n\nNot long after the standoff at the grocery store began, officials told French television that most, if not all of the civilians who had been trapped inside the store were out safely. The gunman was said to be inside the store, possibly along with a police officer. It was unclear if any civilians remained inside the store.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe said the information available suggested it \"seems to be a terrorist act.\"\n\nOne officer shot in Carcassone was seriously wounded.\n\nBFMTV said, according to a witness, that the the hostage-taker declared himself, \"a soldier of the Islamic State,\" and the mayor of Trebes told another channel that the suspect had entered the store screaming, \"Allahu Akbar, (God is the greatest) I'll kill you all.\"\n\nAccording to BFMTV and other outlets, the suspect had been identified by French law enforcement and was known to them. Media reports said the gunman, believed to be of Moroccan descent, was demanding the release of Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving member of the group accused of attacking a concert venue and other locations in Paris in the November 2015 attacks which left 130 people dead. French officials have not confirmed that the suspect has made any demands.\n\nAbdeslam was recently transported back to Belgium to face charges there. He is believed to have provided key logistical support for the Paris attackers, and may have either decided not to blow himself up and abandoned an explosive vest, or had it malfunction on him. As CBS News Radio correspondent Elaine Cobbe reports, as the lone surviving suspect in the Paris attacks, Abdeslam has become something of a poster boy for ISIS supporters.\n\nAs CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports, the French police were unlikely to spend much time trying to talk down a suspected terrorist, so while the incident remained officially underway, it was unlikely to drag on for long.\n\nFrance's elite counterterrorism police were responding to the situation and several helicopters were flying overhead. Witnesses said hundreds of officers had swarmed the area, which was being cordoned off.\n\nSince January 2015 France has suffered a spate of jihadist attacks that have claimed more than 240 lives in total, according to the BBC. Five people remain in custody after an apparent failed bombing attempt in a chic Paris neighborhood in October, and that same month ISIS claimed a deadly stabbing in Marseille by a man who used multiple aliases. His motives remain unclear, and ISIS has often claimed responsibility for attacks in which it had no direct role.\n\nPalmer reported that, if as it appeared, Friday's attack was the work of a lone gunman, it may not alter the national level of alert in France.\n\nPresident Trump was briefed on the incident, but \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan reported that the White House had not yet determined whether it was part of a broader ISIS plot, or the work of a single actor. Once French officials provide the name or names of the suspects to their U.S. counterparts they will be run through U.S. databases to see if they match any American intelligence files. Brennan said the U.S. government was likely to offer its assistance.",

The president's veto threat suddenly makes a government shutdown, which seemed to be a crisis averted early Friday morning, much more likely.\n\nGovernment funding runs out at midnight.\n\nThe White House insisted repeatedly Thursday that even though the legislation didn't fund Mr. Trump's border wall -- the president has requested $25 billion and the legislation only provides about $1.6 billion -- that the president still supported the bill. On Thursday afternoon, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Mr. Trump would sign the bill.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump had indicated his support earlier this week, too.",

                "title": "How one tweet offering a home to gun protesters started a movement",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- It started with a rare tweet by a woman who had -- \"maybe\" -- 28 followers on Twitter.\n\nElizabeth Andrews, a D.C. attorney and mother of a high schooler, was moved by the poise and eloquence of students from Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after the deadly Feb. 14 shooting. So four days after the shooting, she tweeted an offer to host young protesters coming to Washington for the newly announced March For Our Lives rally in support of stronger gun control measures.\n\nWithin hours, her tweet had taken on a life of its own, with thousands of likes and retweets. Now Andrews, who said she's never been an activist, finds herself running an ad-hoc volunteer network that includes more than 1,500 families willing to host demonstrators and provide logistical support for Saturday's rally. It's all part of the intense preparation and speculation ahead of the most anticipated Washington protest since last year's massive women's march.\n\n\"It's been crazy, but crazy in a good way,\" she said. \"People want to find some way to actively participate. Everyone wants to help.\"\n\nBesides the offers to host young demonstrators, Andrews received proposals to help her organize a grassroots movement that she never intended to launch. A group called DC Local Ambassadors, formed after the women's march to provide support for liberal protests, offered to help create a website to field both host families and demonstrators in need of lodging. Marjory Stoneman Douglas' alumni association, organized as a support network the day after the Feb. 14 shootings, has been sending hundreds of prospective demonstrators her way.\n\nThe website went live on Feb. 28 and \"48 hours later, we had 300 host families signed up,\" Andrews said. That number is now around 1,620, exceeding the number of demonstrators who have requested lodging.\n\nAnne Tumlinson said volunteering her D.C. home was \"a no-brainer\" as soon as she heard about the initiative. A Florida native who grew up in Gainesville, Tumlinson was matched up with a group of 18-year-olds from Jacksonville. The vetting process consisted of chatting briefly with the parents of one of the teens.\n\n\"It already feels like it's just a bunch of friends or family members coming to town, like of course I would want them to stay with me,\" she said.\n\nAndrews has been so busy with her network, she's not hosting anyone herself. She said she's now in the \"unintended second phase of our work\" -- channeling the energy of those volunteers into other avenues.\n\nAspiring host families without guests are being asked to prepare brownbag lunches or pick up demonstrators from the airport. Others have offered to buy Metro subway cards for the protesters. The MSD Alumni Association came up with a wish list of protester needs -- things like rain ponchos, safety vests and energy bars. Every item had been purchased by Wednesday.\n\nUp to 1,000 young protesters have been matched with host families, although it's unclear how many will come since many of them were still frantically fundraising for the trip. At least 1,000 people -- students, parents and faculty -- are expected to come up from MSD High School, but most will be flying straight back to Florida and not staying overnight.\n\nExactly how many protesters will actually gather Saturday has become a local guessing game. Organizers predicted up to 500,000 demonstrators in their National Park Service permit -- which would approximately match the women's march and place it among the largest protests in Washington since the Vietnam era.\n\n\"A lot of parents are looking at what these kids are doing and thinking that they might actually be able to make a difference at this moment in history,\" Andrews said. \"Maybe they can succeed in actually changing the country's gun laws in a way that their parents and previous generations failed.\"",

                "title": "Suburban discontent may be Democrats' path to House majority",
                "body": "From the old steel communities around Pittsburgh to the lakefront communities of Chicagoland, Republicans are facing an increasingly clear reality: They've got trouble in the suburbs.\n\nIn the last two weeks, Democrats scored an upset in southwest Pennsylvania and dominated the voting in the Republican suburbs outside Chicago. President Trump, who never won over suburbia, continues to get poor marks from the educated, upper-income Americans who often call it home. After Democratic victories in state legislative contests in Virginia and special elections across the country -- even a stunning Senate election in Republican-dominated Alabama -- Republicans have plenty of reason to worry that commuter country may be their undoing in the fight for control of the House in November's midterm elections.\n\n\"Across the board, every single indicator points to one thing: a Republican bloodbath,\" said Republican strategist Terry Sullivan.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up 23 seats to take the majority -- a task made particularly challenging by the way House districts currently are drawn to favor Republicans. Still, any House majority is built on suburban success.\n\nRepublicans control most rural and small-town districts, where Mr. Trump finds his strongest political support. Democrats dominate districts anchored in big cities, where Trump opposition is fiercest. The party in charge will be the one that wins the battle in between, where the electorate often is the sort of ideological and demographic mix that defines a two-party battleground.\n\nIn 2014, when Republicans successfully defended their House majority, GOP nominees won 52 percent of the suburban vote, according to exit polls. Recent polling suggests that support is slipping. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted earlier this month found just 43 percent of suburban residents prefer a Republican-run Congress to a Democratic majority.\n\nDemocrats' target list starts with nearly two dozen Republican-held seats where Hillary Clinton bested Mr. Trump in 2016. The list is heavy on seats in California and the northeast -- suburbs outside Philadelphia and New York -- corners of Democratic-leaning states where Mr. Trump didn't win over wealthier, moderate Republicans. Now the GOP fears that those weaknesses are spreading further from big-city centers and also into suburban districts around mid-size and smaller metropolitan areas.\n\nDemocrat Conor Lamb is the nightmare. He won in a Pittsburgh-area district where Mr. Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. The Allegheny County portion of the district, the most populated portion just outside of Pittsburgh, had gone to Mr. Trump by just 4 points. Lamb won there by 17 percentage points.\n\nThe race demonstrated that suburban Republicans, even those who voted for Mr. Trump, will vote for a Democrat, in the right circumstances. Lamb was strong candidate who stayed focused on economic issues, and didn't focus on talking down the president. That formula combined with anti-Trump fueled enthusiasm on the left, could mean trouble for the GOP.\n\n\"President Trump isn't on the ballot for us, but he is on the ballot for them,\" said Georgia Republican Chip Lake, a veteran of congressional campaigns across the South. \"The president has good numbers with his base, but not with independents and swing voters, and they live in the suburbs.\"\n\nIn Illinois primary elections on Tuesday, the five counties that wrap around Chicago's Cook County saw Democrats cast almost five times as many ballots as they did four years ago, ahead of a midterm romp for the GOP. Republicans, meanwhile, saw their turnout drop by almost a quarter of what it was in 2014.\n\nThe national Republican money machine is focusing heavily on defending the suburbs. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee aligned with Speaker Paul Ryan, has opened field offices in 30 Republican-held districts, with plans eventually to spend more than $100 million in as many as three dozen.\n\nThe group's first wave of offices overlapped heavily with the Clinton-GOP districts. But they've effectively acknowledge the creep of the suburban with their expansion into places like Rep. Andy Barr's Kentucky district that includes Lexington -- population 318,000 -- and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n\"We're not going to get the benefit of the doubt in this environment,\" says the group's director Corry Bliss.\n\nThere's no consensus on how many of the districts will end up truly competitive. National Democrats tout dozens of challengers who outraised Republican incumbents in recent months, putting them in position to wage serious campaigns.\n\nTo be sure, all Republicans aren't so dour in their outlook.\n\nTexas Republicans set their own primary turnout records earlier this month alongside strong Democratic turnout. Bliss insists Republicans can sell the new tax law. Many economic indicators, including consumer confidence, are on a consistent upswing.\n\nMr. Trump himself seems insistent on making himself a regular part of the campaign this year -- even after suffering the embarrassing defeat in Pennsylvania three days after appearing alongside the Republican nominee.\n\n\"We have a record of accomplishment, we just have to sell it,\" said North Carolina Republican Dee Stewart, a longtime adviser to Rep. Patrick McHenry, whose district includes the suburbs of Charlotte.\n\nAnd some Democrats still limit their forecasts to cautious optimism, citing everything from gerrymandered districts to Mr. Trump's volatile approval ratings.\n\n\"Democrats have to avoid overconfidence,\" said Dave Hamrick, who helped the party recruit challengers ahead of the 2006 midterms, the last time Democrats flipped House control from Republicans. \"There's a lot of moving parts.\"\n\n----\n\nAssociated Press reporter Steve Peoples contributed to this report.",

                "title": "How a failing Atlanta school cut its student turnover rate by nearly half",
                "body": "Our continuing series, What's Working, looks at the innovations that are paying off in America, from education to infrastructure and more. Research finds that when students change schools they're more likely to be less engaged, which could lower their grades and increase the risk they will drop out of high school. Students generally lose about three months of reading and math with each transfer. A promising new program for low-income students and their families at an Atlanta school has cut the student turnover rate by nearly half.\n\nWhen Nicole Evans Jones became principal at Thomasville Heights Elementary School two years ago, she inherited a crisis. The Atlanta school, at times, has been the worst performing elementary school in all of Georgia - and one of its poorest.\n\n\"I have students that have been in four or five schools by second grade or so,\" Jones told CBS News' Mark Strassmann. \"Like 40 percent of the kids in that class might not be there at the end of the year.\"\n\nMichael Lucas helps lead the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, a group that gets attorneys to fight for free on behalf of low-income tenants.\n\n\"They knew they had to address that problem. And we thought we had a solution,\" Lucas said.\n\nHe traced the Thomasville Heights turnover problem right across the street to the Forest Cove Apartments where 95 percent of the school's students live. It's Section 8, subsidized housing.\n\nFamilies kept moving in and out of there because they had no choice, a combination of wrongful evictions, or deplorable conditions that never seemed to get fixed. The solution? Embed a tenant rights lawyer inside the school's front office, a free walk-in resource for parents\n\n\"I get to be a lawyer in a school helping parents and families stay in the school zone to get the benefit of the school,\" lawyer Ayanna Jones-Lightsy said.\n\nShe says right away, new clients kept walking in the door.\n\n\"It's more a question of what kind of issues aren't they having....'My ceiling fell in this weekend from a leak that I've been telling my landlord about for months, My oven doesn't work, hasn't worked for weeks,'\" she said.\n\nPeople are coming to her with problems that violate the law. They need a lawyer to fight them, but can't afford it.\n\nLolita Evans and her four kids live at Forest Cove. They kept missing school, sick from the mold that grew inside their apartment. Her complaints went nowhere - until she showed up with her new lawyer.\n\n\"I had a whole SWAT team come to my door,\" Evans said. \"They came right in and went to work and fixed everything in one day.\"\n\nBefore that? Evans said she'd been waiting for about a year. Ayanna Jones-Lightsy was her lawyer.\n\n\"I think it's still an adjustment and these tenants don't just have me. They have lawyers from the top law firms in Atlanta,\" Jones-Lightsy said. \"One of my tenants says 'Ayanna don't play'. That's her phrase for it.\"\n\nLast year, the program's first year there, the lawyers stopped 20 evictions. They took on more than 80 cases involving conflicts with the complex management.\n\n\"I've had tenants cry in court because they knew they had a story. And they knew they had a right. But they didn't think they would be able to articulate it and win,\" Jones-Lightsy said.\n\nPrincipal Jones says student turnover at Thomasville Heights dropped from 40 to 25 percent.\n\n\"It's huge,\" she said. \"I mean we still have a long way to go obviously but it's a great start and first year.\"\n\n\"There's some far-reaching really human impacts of this affordable housing crisis and I hope that other communities will take a closer look at those impacts,\" said Lucas of the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation.\n\nLolita Evans can tell you about the impact. Her kids Ja'ona, a fourth grader, and Robert, a second grader, received awards as students of the month.\n\nIn the first year of the program, standardized test scores went up 50 percent. No one is calling it a miracle turnaround but it's a solid start.",

On Saturday, Dowd said it's time to \"end\" the Russia probe.\n\nIt also comes just days after the Trump legal team added a new lawyer, former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, who has accused FBI officials of being involved in a \"brazen plot\" to exonerate Hillary Clinton in the email investigation and to \"frame\" Mr. Trump for nonexistent crimes.\n\nBut Mr. Trump indicated on Thursday that he still wants to testify before special counsel Robert Mueller's team. Mr. Trump said he \"would like to\" testify, in a brief exchange with reporters.\n\nSpeaking in New York Thursday, former chief Trump strategist Steve Bannon said he thinks his old boss will be going to \"war\" over the Russia probe.\n\n\"I think President Trump's going to war,\" Bannon said, noting that Mr. Trump is bringing in more aggressive lawyers.",

                "title": "Stories about Trump replacing McMaster were \"fake news\"  --  until they weren't",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't true, it wasn't true -- until it was.\n\nThursday's announcement that National Security Adviser H.R McMaster will be the latest top aide to leave the White House, replaced by John Bolton, spotlights President Trump's mercurial decision-making when it comes to staffing the top ranks of government.\n\nMr. Trump will discuss. Consider. Float. Leak. But nothing's decided until it's decided.\n\nHis personnel moves materialize in fits and starts -- at once both glacial and impulsive. In the White House, they're called \"long-term snap decisions.\" Bolton told Fox News Thursday night he didn't know the announcement would come that afternoon.\n\nMcMaster showed up to work Thursday the same way he had for months: His days in the West Wing were numbered, but not even Trump knew how long he'd keep his aide around. Hours later, in a phone call between the two, it became clear that McMaster's time was up.\n\nMr. Trump had mused to advisers and outside allies about McMaster's ouster for months -- the pair had never formed a strong rapport -- and rumors of his replacement had swirled in Washington for months.\n\nJust last week, it had appeared McMaster's departure was imminent -- but White House officials insisted the speculation was false.\n\n\"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster -- contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted a week ago.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump called reports that McMaster was on his way out \"fake news.\"\n\nSome White House staff rejected suggestions they had misled the public about McMaster's status. At the same time, they maintained the decision to remove him had been long in coming and was not a response to Tuesday's leak of briefing papers related to Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a disclosure that had generated considerable criticism and fresh speculation that McMaster was in trouble.\n\nThey also insisted Sanders' tweeted assurances about McMaster were true -- that even as Mr. Trump considered ousting McMaster, the president hadn't made the final call.\n\nThe timing of McMaster's departure in part had been complicated by efforts on the part of the president and Chief of Staff John Kelly to find a suitable landing pad for the three-star general, but one never materialized.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump went ahead with the personnel change nonetheless. Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, had been in conversations with Mr. Trump for weeks about taking the job, but had no indication he'd receive the offer Thursday until he was invited to the White House.\n\nIt was a familiar scenario after the firing last week of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: His eventual departure had been viewed as a certainty ever since he was reported to have called the president a \"moron\" after a meeting on Afghanistan strategy last July. White House aides denied for months that a shakeup was afoot, even though Kelly had drawn up plans last fall to replace Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nIt also fit the pattern set with other high-profile departures, including Trump's first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and press secretary Sean Spicer. Each was long rumored to be leaving -- but hung on and on until, suddenly, he was out.\n\nAs Mr. Trump takes a more active role in reshaping his White House, the same assertive decision-making style is beginning to surface on matters of policy. Trump grew frustrated by what he considered to be stalling on the part of the more moderate forces in his administration who opposed his calls for more protectionist trade policies. One day, with almost no warning, he cut them out of the loop and decided to pursue tough tariffs on global trading partners.\n\nIt's clear that the turmoil isn't subsiding.\n\nThough the timing is, as ever, uncertain, Kelly is viewed to be one of the next to exit -- and Cabinet secretaries like Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Veterans Affairs' David Shulkin are increasingly on thin ice. Current and former White House officials have maintained that once the president begins considering replacing one of his aides, the staffer is playing on borrowed time.\n\nOne White House official characterized the president's decision-making process in more literary terms, referencing Ernest Hemingway's quip on how one goes bankrupt: \"Gradually, then suddenly.\"",

                "body": "The Federal Communications and Trade Commissions are holding a joint forum Friday morning to address the sharp rise in unwanted robocalls. Consumers received more than 18 billion unwanted calls in 2017, according to the tech company Hiya -- a 76 percent increase from the year before. Robocalls are the No. 1 complaint consumers make to the government.\n\nMore than four million people have taken the time to complain to the federal government about robocalls since just last year. There are now fines and new tech aimed at stopping them, but some consumer groups say the government is not doing enough, reports CBS News' Anna Werner.\n\nVirginia real estate agent Jim Duncan says he gets about seven to 10 robocalls a week and for someone whose business is built on getting new clients, it's not just a \"massive annoyance,\" it's something he said interferes with his business. Duncan no longer answers calls from unknown numbers and wants the robocalls to stop.\n\n\"I'd like to have the confidence and the trust that when my phone rings it's not going to be a robocaller and it's not going to be a political ad and it's not going to be a spoofed phone number,\" Duncan said.\n\nRobocalls can range from pesky telemarketers to threatening scammers. Last month alone, tech company YouMail found consumers received 2.7 billion of those calls.\n\nFCC chairman Ajit Pai says the agency has been working hard to stop the calls from coming.\n\n\"Both private sector companies and the public sector agencies like the FCC and FTC I think are on the same page in terms of the priority it deserves and the level of seriousness that we need to address the problem with,\" Pai said.\n\nIn the past year the FCC proposed more than $200 million in fines against illegal spoofing by telemarketers and the commission recently adopted new rules allowing phone companies to block calls that are likely to be fraudulent, like calls from area codes that do not exist. Tech company Hiya says it has partnered with AT&T to begin doing just that.\n\n\"We apply machine learning and advanced algorithms to look for patterns with which to identify spammers and robocallers,\" said Hiya CEO Alex Algard.\n\nTelecommunications trade group CTIA says all of the national wireless carriers now offer robocall prevention options. T-Mobile launched scam ID where the screen indicates \"scam likely\" for suspected fraudulent calls, Verizon says it has \"spam alert\" which warns customers about identified robocalls, and Sprint has premium caller ID which shows callers names that are not in your contact list. There are also over 500 apps customers can use to arm themselves.\n\nBut consumer groups like the National Consumer Law Center say even with those steps, consumers still get far too many robocalls. They want to see technologies that authenticate, or verify, that a number is valid.\n\n\"If the commission really wants to protect consumers quickly, they should put deadlines on the implementation of the authentication requirements and they should mandate that they be implemented as soon as possible,\" Margot Saunders, senior counsel at the NCLC, said.\n\n\"We would encourage that as strongly as we can and work with industry and with other federal agencies as strongly as we can, but in the meantime we want to take as much action as we can within the authority to stop this scourge,\" Pai said.\n\nSaunders is also concerned about a recent federal ruling she says rolled back some regulations that protect consumers from autodial services, like telemarketers. It is now up to the FCC whether to uphold those regulations. Chairman Pai says they have made no decisions yet.",

                "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Newly-released surveillance video shows Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock in the days before he opened fire from his Mandalay Bay hotel room, killing 58 people. MGM Resorts said it released the video because it wanted to provide greater context around Paddock's actions leading up to the shooting. The hotel said the images show that Paddock gave no outward indications of the massacre he was planning to carry out.\n\nIn the series of security videos, Paddock appears like any other guest. He checks into his suite on the 32nd floor, plays video poker and buys snacks at the gift shop - all the while interacting with hotel staff.\n\n\"He's so calm,\" CBS News correspondent Carter Evans noted, watching the videos.\n\n\"And that is the true mark of a sociopath,\" said Randy Sutton, a retired lieutenant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n\"He's going about his business, he's tipping the guys,\" Sutton said. \"A guy who can order lunch knowing that he's going to kill people... that's not normal.\"\n\nPaddock can be seen coming and going from the hotel wheeling luggage to his room, sometimes by himself and other times with a bellhop through this service elevator. Over seven days, he brought in 23 guns in at least 22 pieces of luggage.\n\n\"Should that have set off any alarm bells or red flags?\" Carter asked.\n\n\"Not really, I mean, you can see that he plotted this very well,\" Sutton said. \"He used different bell people every time he came in... so there wasn't one bell guy, 'Hmm, geez, why is this guy bringing in, you know, 4,000 pieces of luggage?'\"\n\nThe security video tracks Paddock right up to the day of the shooting. He gambled into the early morning hours. That night, he would carry out the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nHe killed 58 people and wounded more than 500. In January, investigators released a preliminary report saying police and the FBI believed Paddock acted alone. But nearly six months later, they still don't have a motive.\n\n\"Why would a guy who supposedly has a fairly happy, successful life... has plenty of money, has a home, has a girlfriend... what goes on inside a brain like that that suddenly triggers a mass murder?\" Sutton said. \"Will we ever know it? I think if we don't know now, we never will.\"\n\nPaddock's girlfriend Marilou Danley was initially named in search warrants in connection with the case, as police reportedly looked into her social media accounts for any clues. But she is no longer considered a person of interest.",

He was on the island for a rugby tournament.\n\nPolice say the teen's brothers, along with investigators, later found him in a moat at the base of a 35-foot cliff at Fort Prospect.\n\nIn the midst of tragedy, the community is finding comfort in sharing their positive memories of Dombroski using the hashtag #LoveForTheDombroskis.\n\n\"In coming together, it's been a healing process together.

Bush, is seen as heralding a rightward shift in Mr. Trump's foreign policy and an embrace of more hard-line policies.\n\nHis appointment also raised questions over policy toward North Korea following Mr. Trump's acceptance of an offer for direct talks, possibly before May.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the importance of China-U.S. relations outweighed personnel matters.\n\n\"No matter who takes the post of any kind, the significance of China-U.S. relations needs no further explanation, and it will never change,\" Hua said at a regularly scheduled news briefing.\n\n\"To strengthen cooperation and uphold the principles of mutual respect and benefit is in line with the two sides' interests and meets the expectation of the international community,\" Hua said.\n\nChina also hopes the U.S. will stick with the Iran nuclear agreement, a deal both Bolton and Mr. Trump have harshly criticized.\n\nIn Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he was \"a bit surprised\" by Bolton's appointment, but said he didn't anticipate any major changes in U.S. policy on North Korea.\n\n\"During my recent visit to the U.S., members of the Trump administration seem to fully share consensus on policies. So I believe there is no major change to their stance,\" Kono said.\n\nBolton's approach to North Korea appears to be everything China has warned against, including supporting the possibility of a pre-emptive military strike and dismissing direct negotiations that Beijing says are vital to jump-starting the denuclearization process.\n\nLike Mr. Trump, Bolton has also been highly critical of the U.S trade deficit with China, which Washington says hit a record of $375.2 billion last year.\n\nIn an interview Thursday with Fox Business News, Bolton accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property and pursuing \"mercantilist policies in what is supposed to be a free-trade environment.\"\n\n\"I don't buy it. I am a free trader, but I don't think that means just getting pounded into the ground when another country doesn't abide by the commitments it's made,\" Bolton said.\n\nBolton said China cheats by providing subsidies to exports and discriminating against foreign entities, including through the legal system, while enjoying the benefits of WTO membership. Chinese government subsidies allow Americans to buy goods cheaper to the detriment of the Chinese worker, he said.\n\n\"The reality is, China just doesn't have the same concern for its citizen's welfare that we do in this country,\" Bolton said. \"And even beyond that, there's simply no excuse for the stealing of intellectual property, forced technology transfers it's sometimes called.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Washington Free Beacon newspaper in February 2017, Bolton criticized America's \"One-China\" policy, under which it does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, and called for increased arms sales to the island.\n\n\"The One-China policy is inherently ambiguous,\" Bolton said. \"China thinks it means one thing, we think it means another.\"\n\nBolton's appointment was loudly cheered by one of the administration's chief China hawks, trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro, author of the book \"Death by China: Confronting the Dragon - a Global Call to Action.\"\n\n\"I've gotten to know him over the years, and he'll be a great replacement. So what we are seeing here is a president who has great judge of talent,\" Navarro told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThough Mr. Trump ultimately follows his own instincts, Bolton \"will have a sort of influence on Trump's foreign diplomacy because they share a similar view on matters such as ideology, threats to U.S. national security and values,\" said Yu Wanli, professor at the Peking University's School of International Relations in Beijing.\n\n\"Trump now has a faithful implementer of his policies,\" Yu said. \"Bolton will surely contribute to the tension in China-U.S. relations.\"",

                "title": "Trade war with China could hurt these U.S. businesses most",
                "body": "It is how trade wars catch flame. President Donald Trump has proposed tariffs on aerospace, machinery, and information and communications technology products imported from China. Beijing swiftly replied with its own tariffs on U.S. fruits, wine, steel pipe and pork, among other goods.\n\nHere at home, some industries are particularly at risk. That's because companies in these sectors not only import parts and materials from China, but also often export finished products there as well.\n\nThere are three primary mechanisms by which U.S. tariffs on China could hurt American companies. Tariffs on Chinese imports would increase the cost of raw materials for U.S. businesses, forcing them to pay more to make the same goods, whether cars, appliances or electronics. China's reciprocal tariffs make U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese consumers, hurting the many businesses trying their luck in the world's largest market.\n\nFinally, China could make it hard for American companies to do business using other methods, such as increasing regulations on U.S. companies in China or slowing down deals.\n\n\"The retaliation could turn into dissuading Chinese consumers and Chinese businesses from buying U.S. products and brands,\" Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's lots of things that can be done, if trade tensions were to escalate, whether it's influencing purchasing decisions or making exports to the U.S. more difficult.\"\n\nU.S. technology companies rank particularly high on the list of potential losers because many of them are exposed in multiple ways: They rely on Chinese suppliers, and they sell to Chinese companies. UBS, which compiled a list of public companies with significant sales in China, noted that cell phones, computer equipment, semiconductors and clothing were potentially the most vulnerable products if Beijing chooses to hit back.\n\n\"All iPhones come out of China,\" said Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. \"And other U.S. companies, even if their R&D and development is here in the U.S., they're still making their parts and assembly in China.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) is exposed to China in several ways: It relies on Chinese factories for assembly; China has an effective lock on the rare-earth minerals essential for Apple products; and China's fast-growing middle class is increasingly important for Apple's consumer strategy. Some 20 percent of Apple's sales last year were in China.\n\n\"China is the biggest market to over 100 countries. It's hard to find another country with that kind of demand,\" said Ann Lee, a former professor at Peking University and author of \"Why China's Economy Collapsed.\" \"If the U.S. goes forward, you could see blowback that could hurt companies and workers.\"\n\nBoeing (BA) stock, which plunged when the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs in February, continued to drop Wednesday, reflecting the company's vulnerability to international tensions.\n\nChina has unique leverage because it buys so many of Boeing's planes. It signed a deal to buy 300 Boeing planes during Mr. Trump's fall visit to the country. Over the next two decades, China is projected to order around $1 trillion worth of aircraft, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAfter the U.S., \"China is the largest market for Boeing aircraft in the world; it's about 20-25 percent of aircraft deliveries every year,\" said Chris Higgins, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \"They don't really need to enact tariffs to retaliate on Boeing; all they need to do is shift purchases to Airbus.\"\n\n\"If they announce a large order for Airbus aircraft tomorrow, that would send a message,\" he added.\n\nA lesser risk is the rising cost of metal itself. Because aircraft are made primarily of steel and aluminum, an increase in those costs would ding its profit margins. Aluminum, which makes up nearly 80 percent of an airplane's body weight, is set to get 10 percent pricier after the tariffs.\n\nBut the industry is relatively used to volatile commodity prices, said Higgins -- aluminum prices rose nearly 25 percent last year with \"hardly a peep\" from the aerospace industry. (Steel, while it's subject to heavier 25 percent tariffs, makes up only about 10 percent of an airplane's weight.)\n\nSome of the fiercest opposition to tariffs is coming from a sector that has, so far, been spared retaliation: soybeans. Soybean farmers sent $14 billion of crops to China last year and see themselves as a prime target for countermeasures.\n\n\"We're very concerned about the type of retaliation we might get,\" said Wayne Fredericks, who grows soybeans and corn on 750 acres in northern Iowa. \"The soybean industry is sitting in the bull's eye of Chinese retaliatory efforts.\"\n\nChina is the biggest customer for U.S. soybeans, buying one-third of our soybean crop last year. That number, which has increased exponentially over the last 15 years, is driven by the Chinese middle class' growing appetite for meat. The soybeans are pressed and used for animal feed and, to a lesser degree, for cooking oil.\n\n\"As income levels have risen in China, diets have shifted more and more to meat consumption,\" said Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \"They've modernized their pork and poultry production, so it looks a lot like the U.S., and they feed them much like we do in the U.S.\" -- that is to say, with soybeans and corn. Sorghum and barley have also benefited from this growth to a lesser degree.\n\nFor its part, China has accused the U.S. government of unfairly subsidizing the soybean industry to flood the markets (the very same tactic of which Mr. Trump accuses the Chinese.)\n\n\"Certainly these issues are not new,\" said Kirk Leeds, director of business development for the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA). \"What appears to be different is the Trump administration is taking what appears to be a much more aggressive position. That makes many of us nervous.\"\n\nLeeds, who is leading an ISA delegation on a two-week trip to China, spoke to CBS News from a high-speed train between Beijing and Wuhan. His group had just met with the U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, who is also Iowa's former governor.\n\n\"I think the next couple weeks could be critical,\" he said. \"Everyone is aware over here, everyone's paying attention to us and most [people] are hoping that there will be a firm resolution.\"\n\nIn October, China loosened regulations on foreign ownership of Chinese banks, a step the U.S. finance industry lauded as historic. With the U.S. contemplating tariffs -- not to mention knocking down Chinese ownership of U.S. companies -- observers worry China could reverse its steps.\n\n\"That was a huge offer from the Chinese, and that could completely go down the drain with these kinds of tariffs,\" said Lee. \"The Chinese will say, 'Why should we be bending over backwards when you don't want to establish a stronger relationship?'\"\n\nIn nearly all other sectors, Chinese rules on foreign companies remain famously strict (a fact that Mr. Trump highlighted on Thursday).\n\n\"U.S. companies, tech companies and high-value-add companies are in essence forced to partner with a domestic producer in China. That's one area where policymakers could tighten the screws,\" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo.\n\nWith higher barriers to ownership, U.S. companies could conclude it's easier to sell their share of an enterprise and essentially exit the Chinese market.\n\nGiven the potential of tariffs to hurt hundreds of U.S. businesses, many analysts are choosing to see Thursday's announcement not as the last word, but rather as an opening gambit aimed at bringing China to the bargaining table.\n\n\"For now this seems to be about renegotiating trade deals,\" said Donisanu, citing the examples of steel and aluminum tariffs, which were watered down significantly before they even came into effect.\n\nBut even if the final tariffs are small numerically, a prolonged negotiation between the U.S. and China could have other consequences. Decisions about supply chains, factories, hiring and firing can take years to fully play out. In the meantime, American industry has two weeks to press the case for particular tariffs -- and to fret about the results.\n\n\"Maybe in a few years we can look back and say, as convoluted as this strategy is, it was beneficial for the U.S.,\" said Fredericks, the soybean farmer. \"But the process is pretty painful.\"",

                "body": "Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Committee, believes President Trump's lawyers are not doing him any favors by \"allowing\" the investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election \"to be framed as an investigation into collusion, and collusion only.\"\n\n\"I think his lawyers have done a disservice to him, frankly,\" the South Carolina Republican told CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett on the latest episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast.\n\nPresident Trump and his lawyers have consistently maintained his campaign did not collude with Russians to win the election. Gowdy thinks the focus should be directed elsewhere.\n\nOver breakfast at District Taco in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, Gowdy pointed to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's original statement on the appointment of Robert Mueller to be special counsel last May. The statement said Mueller would \"serve as Special Counsel to oversee the previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\"\n\n\"So from my standpoint, the foundational inquiry is, what did Russia do with respect to the 2016 election process? And if there's criminality, of course we expect him to find it. But the notion that he was hired to only go look for criminality I think does a disservice to him,\" Gowdy explained.\n\nGowdy said he stands by his public advice to President Trump Sunday: If he is innocent, he should act like it.\n\n\"There's a certain level of frustration that comes from anyone who is, quote, under investigation,\" he explained. \"If you believe you've done nothing wrong, you want the investigation concluded as quickly as possible. It is beyond argument that this has cast a pall over the first part of his presidency.\"\n\n\"If you're the investigator, you're saying, you know what? I have an obligation to run out all the witnesses and access all the documents and give you the definitive word and we're not on a time schedule, so there's tension.\"\n\nGowdy, who served for six years as a federal prosecutor, said President Trump has a unique attitude for someone in his position.\n\n\"The president talks more than any target of any investigation that I've ever participated in,\" he observed, noting that he's never met President Trump or had a conversation with him. \"I mean, for the most part you have a hard time getting the target to talk at all.\"\n\nBut Gowdy doesn't believe Mr. Trump will end up firing special counsel Robert Mueller, despite his heated Twitter rhetoric on the matter last weekend.",

There's no way to know.\n\nBut the mini-movement -- which now includes Cher -- raises another question: If you do delete your Facebook account, what happens to your personal information?\n\nFacebook says it keeps \"backup copies for a reasonable period of time\" after a deletion, and it says that can be as long as three months.\n\nIt also says it may retain copies of \"some material\" from deleted accounts, but removes personal identifiers.\n\nFacebook has two types of databases of user content, according to Paul-Olivier Dehaye, co-founder of PersonalData.IO, a service that helps consumers track their data.\n\nOne collects user-generated content, such as status updates and photos.\n\nThe other is for log data -- a record of what a user does, such as when they log in, click on a Facebook group or post a comment.\n\n\"When you delete your account, all the user generated content is normally erased (although there are small exceptions), while all the log data is preserved - forever.\" The preserved log data won't have your name attached to it.\n\nOne catch: Data about consumers posted by friends and family members will remain with the service as long as they remain on the social-media service, according to Facebook's Help Center. \"Keep in mind that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted when you delete your account,\" Facebook says in its data policy.\n\nFor example, messages you've sent to a friend on Facebook would remain stored on Facebook's computers, the company said.\n\nThe after-life of data, it seems, isn't as clear-cut as consumers might hope.\n\nAt the same time, consumers have plenty of questions about what happened to the data harvested by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday pledged a \"full forensic audit\" to ensure all data had been deleted.\n\nHe also said he would limit the data available to developers. \"For example, we will remove developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\nNevertheless, it's unclear how much control Facebook has over user data once a company like Cambridge Analytica acquires it.\n\nFacebook's rules say that developers must delete data if a consumer asks them. However, many consumers may be unaware they need to take this additional step after deleting their Facebook accounts. And it's unclear how that policy is enforced.\n\nIn a 2015 speech, Carol Davidsen -- a former Obama campaign official -- talked about harvesting data from Facebook users about their friends.\n\n\"We were able to ingest the entire social network of the U.S. on Facebook, which is most of the U.S.,\" she said. \"The data is out there. You can't take it back. The Democrats have this information, so when they look at a voter file, they can say, 'Here are all the people they know.'\"\n\nBefore deleting your account, you can download your personal data and save it on your own computer. The data includes your Facebook personal messages, photos, status updates and which advertisers have your contact info, among other data points.\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook will add a tool at the top of users' news feed that shows them which apps have access to their data, and how to revoke those permissions.\n\n\"I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.\"",

                "title": "March Madness: Loyola upsets Nevada, Kansas State holds off Kentucky",
                "body": "ATLANTA --There were two upsets Thursday in the NCAA tournament: Loyola-Chicago continued their Cinderella run with a win over Nevada and Kansas State overtook Kentucky 68-51. It's the first time a No. 9 seed (Kansas State) will face a No. 11 seed (Loyola) in the Elite Eight.\n\nWith Loyola-Chicago's captivating NCAA Tournament run hanging in the balance, it was Marques Townes' turn to deliver another memorable finish.\n\nTownes had scored only a combined 15 points in Loyola's first two NCAA Tournament games, but that didn't concern Ramblers coach Porter Moser. Townes had the ball in front of the Loyola bench in the final seconds Thursday night and the shot clock about to expire.\n\nWith Loyola clinging to a one-point lead and only 6.3 seconds remaining, Townes nailed the decisive 3-pointer to help clinch a 69-68 win over Nevada in the NCAA South Regional semifinal.\n\n\"He was a warrior,\" Moser said.\n\nTownes, who had 18 points, charged down the court, pumping his fist, following the shot.\n\n\"I'll probably remember it for the rest of my life,\" Townes said. \"I mean, it doesn't really get any better than that.\"\n\nFollowing a timeout, Nevada's Caleb Martin answered with a 3, but this time the Wolf Pack couldn't extend their string of second-half comebacks in the tournament.\n\n\"Got to give so much credit to Nevada, they never quit,\" Moser said. \"Those guys keep coming at you, coming at you. ... I was blessed we made a couple of plays at the end, got a couple of stops.\"\n\nThe win leaves the No. 11th-seeded Ramblers, the biggest surprise in a regional that has lost its top four seeds, one victory from a Final Four appearance. Loyola (31-5), which has won three tournament games by a combined four points, awaits the winner of the Kansas State-Kentucky game in Saturday's regional final.\n\nNot bad for a program that hadn't been in the Sweet 16 in 33 years.\n\nOn a team that shares the spotlight, this was Townes' moment. He made each of his two 3s and led Loyola with five assists. He said he was fine after banging knees with Nevada's Jordan Caroline at the end of the game.\n\n\"I think Marques Townes is the best player on the court tonight,\" said Loyola guard Clayton Custer. \"I don't even think it was close, either. ... This is unbelievable. Feels like a dream.\"\n\nMartin led Nevada (29-8) with 21 points. Twin brother Cody Martin had 16. Jordan Carolina added 19.\n\n\"We get a stop on the 3 they shot at the buzzer and maybe we're sitting up here with a win,\" said Nevada coach Eric Musselman.\n\nCaleb Martin bemoaned his missed defensive opportunity before Townes' big 3.\n\n\"I should have denied the catch,\" Martin said of Loyola's pass to Townes. \"I just got lost and it was costly.\"\n\nLoyola trailed by 12 points, at 20-8, midway through the first half but stormed back to lead 28-24 at halftime. Loyola closed the half with a 20-4 run as Nevada didn't score in the final 7:55 before the break.\n\nLoyola pushed the ball in the paint on almost every possession. The Ramblers' first 10 points came on layups.\n\nLoyola's relentless attack on the basket continued as it stretched its lead, one layup at a time, in the second half.\n\nKentucky's latest group of fabulous freshman is all done.\n\nGritty Kansas State made sure of that Thursday night.\n\nDemeaned by many pundits as the worst team still alive in the NCAA Tournament, ninth-seeded K-State got 22 points from Xavier Sneed and gave the South Regional one more upset with a 61-58 semifinal victory over Kentucky.\n\nNext up in the bracket-busting South: the regional final against No. 11 seed Loyola, which continued its stunning run in the tournament with a 69-68 victory over Nevada.\n\nYep, its 9 vs. 11 in the Elite Eight for the first time in tournament history with a trip to the Final Four on the line.\n\nJust the way it should be in a regional that became the first in NCAA history to have the top four seeds knocked out on very first weekend, including No. 1-ranked Virginia.\n\nSneed wasn't around at the end - he was among three Kansas State players who fouled out - but Barry Brown Jr. came through with the shot of the game to seat it for the Big 12 school.\n\nBrown darted into the lane with the shot clock running down, seemingly blowing by every Kentucky player to get to the basket, and banked one in with 18 seconds remaining to put K-State up 60-58.\n\nKentucky's Quade Green put up an airball from beyond the arc and Kansas State rebounded, drawing a foul that sent Amaad Wainright to the line for two free throws that could've sealed it. He made only one, giving Kentucky one more chance to force overtime.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander got a decent look at the basket, but his shot rimmed out as the horn sounded.\n\nBrown wasn't done. In the raucous celebration, he leaped over the press table like Superman and sprinted into the arms of the purple-clad Kansas State fan section.\n\nJohn Calipari was denied a shot at his fifth Final Four in nine seasons as Kentucky's coach. Fears that his young players would \"drink the poison\" - the belief that they had an easy path to San Antonio thanks to all the upsets - turned out to be well founded.",

                "body": "The Senate has passed a massive \"omnibus\" spending package that will fund the government and avert a looming government shutdown. The legislation, which narrowly passed the House on Thursday, spends $1.3 trillion to keep the government open through the end of September.\n\nIt passed the Senated with 65 yeas to 32 nays.\n\nIt raises both military and domestic spending, leading to support from Republicans and Democrats alike. According to Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney, President Trump supports the legislation and will sign it into law should it pass the Senate.\n\nThe bill had its critics, too, though. Sen. Rand Paul objected to the amount of money that the bill spends, what it spends that money on, and the process used to draft the legislation. Numerous House Republicans had similar objections on Thursday, with many of them protesting that they were voting on a bill they had not yet had time to read.\n\nOther senators were also critical of the bill, including Tennessee's Bob Corker, a Republican. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he called it a \"grotesque piece of legislation\" that increases deficit spending despite GOP control of the government.",

Only a few hundred fans made it into the Golden1 Center before police decided to not allow anyone else to enter and several of those who did get in moved down into the lower bowl of the arena, leaving the upper deck empty.\n\nBlack Lives Matter organized Thursday's protest after the fatal shooting of Stephon Clark, who was unarmed and in the backyard of his grandparents' house Sunday night when he was shot by police 20 times. Officers said they thought he had a gun, but he was holding a cellphone.\n\nThe protesters earlier marched from Sacramento City Hall and onto a nearby freeway, disrupting rush hour traffic and holding signs with messages like \"Sac PD: Stop killing us!\"\n\nThe police \"will pay for this,\" Clark's brother Stevante told CBS News' John Blackstone on Wednesday. \"You're going to know his name forever ... You're going to remember it like how you know Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. You're going to know him. You're going to remember this.\"\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg questioned police policies for providing medical aid after a police shooting, but said he can't second-guess the split-second decisions of the officers.\n\nHe praised Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn, the city's first black police chief, for releasing the videos and other information promptly. Hahn has promised transparency and to work for better community relations since he took over as head of the department last year.\n\nSteinberg said the department has improved its policies since the fatal shooting of a mentally ill black man in 2016, and said the council will address questions including the department's use of force policies and training at a meeting April 10.\n\nThe shooting has ignited questions by relatives, activists and others.\n\nSalena Manni, who identified herself as Clark's fiancee, said he was the father of her two sons, ages 1 and 3.\n\n\"He would never want to leave his kids,\" Manni said in an interview with ABC's Sacramento affiliate. \"I just tell them daddy's always going to be with us, daddy's in our hearts, always and forever. He's always going to be with us. Don't forget that.\"\n\nClark routinely helped care for his grandparents at their home in south Sacramento, his cousin, Sonia Lewis, told Capitol Public Radio.\n\nThe department said the two officers have been with Sacramento police for two and four years, but each has four years' previous experience with other law enforcement agencies. Both are on paid administrative leave.",

                "body": "GREAT MILLS, Md. -- A teenage girl who was shot when a classmate opened fire inside their Maryland high school is brain dead and is being removed from life support, her mother said Thursday. Melissa Willey told news reporters Thursday night that her daughter, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey has \"no life left in her.\" She said Jaelynn would be removed from life support during the evening, by the family's decision.\n\nThe mother, holding a young baby, said, \"On Tuesday ... our lives changed completely and totally forever. My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives.\"\n\nThe teen was shot Tuesday by 17-year-old Austin Rollins at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County.\n\nRollins died after shooting Willey. A school resource officer got there within a minute and fired a shot at Rollins, but it's not yet clear whether Rollins was killed by the officer's bullet or took his own life.\n\nThe St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday Rollins and the girl had been in a relationship that recently ended.\n\n\"All indications suggest the shooting was not a random act of violence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nWilley had been in critical condition at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center. A fundraising page to help her family has raised more than $59,000.\n\nJaelynn was one of nine siblings, her mother said, and a member of the swim team.\n\nThe shooting broke out just before classes were to begin Tuesday, according to the sheriff's office, which said the gun used belonged to Rollins' father.\n\nA 14-year-old boy who was shot in the thigh during the encounter was released Wednesday from a hospital.\n\nIn an email Thursday to The Associated Press, his mother, Kimberly Dennis, said her family is \"eternally grateful\" that her son, Desmond Barnes, is \"alive, doing well and in good spirits.\"\n\nShe expressed sympathy for Willey and her family and added, \"We are also praying for the entire Great Mills High School family and young people around this country. As a community and nation, we must continue to work and fight for a world that is safe for our children.\n\nGreat Mills High School has about 1,600 students and is near the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, about 65 miles southeast of Washington.\n\nInvestigators said that they have video of the shooting and that will help them figure out exactly what happened, CBS News justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.\n\nSt. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron credited Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill with preventing any more loss of life.\n\nCameron said Gaskill, a six-year veteran with SWAT team training, responded within a minute and fired his weapon simultaneously with a final shot fired by Rollins. The officer was unharmed.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said the Glock handgun used in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins' father. In Maryland it is illegal for anyone under age 21 to possess a handgun unless it is required for their employment.\n\nPeople who knew Rollins were trying to make some kind of sense of the hometown horror.\n\n\"Never in a million years could I have imagined he would do something like this,\" said Adlai Traver, 18, who attended Great Mills and knew all three kids involved in the shooting. He recalled playing cards with Rollins during band class when the fellow percussionists had a little down time during class. \"I was in the car when I heard it was him. I pulled over and almost puked.\"\n\nNo motive has been determined yet and Cameron says it might never be found out since the suspect is dead.",

                "body": "DALLAS -- A passenger mutiny onboard a Greyhound bus bound for Dallas forced a driver out from behind the wheel. Terrified passengers say that driver was falling asleep and it led to a confrontation caught on video, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports.\n\nThree of the passengers who were on the bus arrived in Dallas seven hours late from Phoenix.\n\nSome said they weren't so sure they'd make it in one piece after they caught the driver pinching her cheeks with tweezers just to stay awake. At this point in the bus trip from Phoenix to Dallas, passengers had had enough.\n\n\"We politely asked her four times to pull over,\" said Jasmine McLellan, who said she was among as many as 60 people who were on board a Greyhound bus who noticed their driver falling asleep behind the wheel.\n\n\"I got to the point where we saw her going like this and just dozing off,\" said McLellan.\n\n\"The bus was leaning little and that's when people started to really worry,\" said passenger Philip Hurd. \"She was using techniques to try and stay awake and I think that was the initial concern ... We would go over the white line and everybody would be like wake up and she had tweezers she was poking herself with tweezers to keep herself awake it was awful. It got to the point where we had to raise our voice pull over we have children on this bus pull over.\"\n\nA confrontation happened while passengers said the bus was still moving and the driver stood up to argue with them.\n\nPassengers said they got a Border Patrol escort to a safe location where Greyhound replaced the driver.\n\nThe incident raises serious questions about whether a nationwide shortage of bus drivers is pushing current ones to drive without proper rest.\n\nDallas-based Greyhound responded with a statement from Senior Communications Specialist Lanesha Gipson:\n\nOur schedules are now running on time and we're back on schedule. However, we were experiencing delays at the Dallas station earlier today as we waited for drivers to become available once they completed their federally mandated rest. With resources as tight as they have been, any delay that occurs elsewhere can create a domino effect, which can have an impact on a driver's hours of service. We work diligently to accommodate our customers with the limited resources we have available, and we've been actively hiring drivers in order to meet the increasing demand for our service so these types of delays are minimized. All delayed customers have departed the station are now en route to their destinations.\n\nRegarding the specific incident on the bus headed to Dallas, Gipson issued this statement:\n\nWe are currently looking into these allegations, as we take the issue of driver fatigue very seriously. Because safety is the cornerstone of our business, we take necessary precautions to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving and we make it easy for drivers to be reassigned if they do feel fatigued or don't feel confident that they can operate the bus safely for any reason. Our drivers are in regular contact with our dispatch office, and if they state they are feeling tired or fatigued, they are immediately removed from the schedule for at least 12 hours to allow them to get some rest. Once they feel alert and able to return to work, they may do so.\n\nSome of these passengers said they paid more than $200 for their tickets and would like a refund.\n\nGreyhound has promised a refund after this potentially dangerous incident, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports.",

                "body": "Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who allegedly had an affair with President Trump in 2006 and is now claiming in a lawsuit that his allies colluded against her to keep her silent, says that Mr. Trump attempted to pay her after they were intimate.\n\n\"Well after we had been intimate, he tried to pay me,\" McDougal told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview airing Thursday night. \"And I actually did not take that.\"\n\nMcDougal is suing American Media Inc., which owns several tabloids including the National Enquirer, claiming AMI attempted to stifle her from speaking out about the affair. McDougal purportedly accepted $150,000 from AMI. She sold her story, and in return, expected chances to write and model. But AMI never published anything about the alleged affair.\n\nAsked to reiterate her claim that Mr. Trump attempted to pay her, McDougal reemphasized that to Cooper.\n\n\"He did,\" she said. \"And I said, I just had this look, I just, I don't even know how to describe the look on my face, it must have been so sad, because I never have been offered money like that number one, and number two, does he think I'm in this for money, and that's why I'm here tonight?\n\nOr is this a normal thing. I don't know. But I looked at him and said, that's not me, I'm not that kind of girl. And he looked at me and said oh, and he said you're really special. And I said thank you. So I left, and I got into the car...and started crying. I was really sad. It really hurt me, but I went back.\"\n\nMcDougal told CBS News in a statement earlier this week that AMI \"lied\" to her.\n\n\"AMI lied to me, made empty promises, and repeatedly intimidated and manipulated me. I just want the opportunity to set the record straight and move on with my life, free from this company, its executives, and its lawyers,\" McDougal said.\n\nAdult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, also has filed a lawsuit relating to an alleged 2006 relationship with Mr. Trump. She has filed a lawsuit against the president and his personal lawyer over what she believes is an invalid non-disclosure agreement for her silence. She will appear on CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" Sunday night at 7 p.m. ET.",

                "body": "ELGIN, Ill. -- Police have released video of a standoff on an Illinois highway that ended with a 34-year-old woman dead.\n\nCBS Chicago reports an officer shot and killed DeCynthia Clements on March 12 after she allegedly fled a traffic stop, and then stopped her SUV on the Jane Addams Tollway in Elgin, about 40 miles northwest of Chicago.\n\nThe 20-minute video ends with police yelling at Clements to drop a knife, before three shots are fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nThe video begins with a police pursuit that is then aborted. The video resumes when officers find her car pulled onto the shoulder with significant damage. They are seen repeatedly trying to convince Clements to get out of the car, but she attempts to drive away several times.\n\nWARNING: Disturbing video\n\nIn the video released Thursday, Elgin Police Chief Jeffrey Swoboda said his officers attempted to resolve the situation peacefully for about an hour before the fatal shooting. Officers in the video are seen shutting down lanes of traffic, talking about concerns that Clements was suicidal and discussing plans to use rubber bullets and a Taser should she threaten them.\n\nClements at one point apparently lights a fire in her car, causing officers to approach. They order her to come out and hold her hands up. Clements can then be seen running out of the burning car, holding a knife in her hand.\n\nThat's when an officer opens fire. Clements was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n\nSwodoba said he hasn't spoken to the officer who fired at Clements, and doesn't know why he didn't use the less-lethal tactics. He said the Indiana State Police is conducting the investigation.\n\nPolice first showed the video to Clements' family and their attorneys, who have said they plan to file a lawsuit, before releasing it publicly Thursday afternoon.\n\nHer family described her as a \"loving, caring mom,\" reports CBS Chicago. They also said she was very small, and not a threat to officers trained in deadly force and equipped with shields and body armor.\n\n\"The video of the fatal shooting of DeCynthia Clements released today by the Elgin Police Department raises questions about the unnecessary use of deadly force by an Elgin Police Officer,\" Antonio Romanucci, the Clements' lawyer, said in a statement released to the station. \"This situation did not have to escalate to such a degree that cost a young woman her life. As we move forward with this lawsuit, those responsible for DeCynthia's death must be held accountable.\"",

                "body": "SPRINGFIELD, Va. -- The sweet and playful golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in America, with a special talent for getting even so-called grown-ups to join in the fun. But, as Kris Campesi has learned through painful experience, they also rate high on another scale.\n\n\"Goldens have a high probability for cancer,\" she explained.\n\nThat rate is about 60 percent, one of the highest in the dog world. Campesi recently lost one golden to cancer and now 7-year-old Malachi has a brain tumor.\n\n\"They're such a part of your life, and when it's time for them to go it's hard,\" Campesi said.\n\nLooking for answers, she entered 3-year-old Nicodemus, who's perfectly healthy, into a national study of nearly 3,000 golden retrievers. The goal is to understand why the cancer rate is so high.\n\n\"I have to keep track of everything they eat, the water they drink, the chemicals I use around the house,\" Campesi said.\n\nNicodemus even has something called a \"whistle\" that stays with him all the time so it can record his activity and sleep.\n\nVeterinarian Laney Rhymes takes samples of his hair and nails during frequent medical exams.\n\n\"They're looking for environmental stuff that the dogs might be exposed to that would concentrate in the nails,\" Rhymes said.\n\nEven while he's giving blood, that tail keeps on wagging. Campesi hopes the study will eventually help all dogs including hers to live longer lives. She's not the only one who hopes that will be the case -- Nicodemus is also a therapy dog for special needs children, and they're counting on him to live a long and healthy life.",

                "body": "Former chief Trump strategist Steve Bannon spoke publicly for the first time Thursday about the data analytics company that is now under fire for allegedly exploiting the personal data of roughly 50 million Facebook users.\n\nBannon once helped run the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which President Trump's campaign worked with during the 2016 presidential campaign. The information sharing of millions of voters has roiled lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who are demanding answers from Facebook executives and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAsked about suspended Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix at the Financial Times' Future of News conference in New York Thursday, Bannon declined to comment.\n\n\"I'd rather not comment,\" Bannon said.\n\nBut he was happy to talk about Facebook's role in acquiring people's data.\n\n\"The data from Facebook is just about the cost of it,\" Bannon said. \"That data's out there, there's a marketplace for your data. It's bought and sold every day.\"\n\nWhen the interviewer pointed out that people were unaware their information was being sold, Bannon said, that's an \"issue between Cambridge, the professor [who collected the information] and Facebook.\"\n\nBannon claimed he \"didn't even know about the Facebook mining.\"\n\nBannon also spoke critically of chief of staff John Kelly and the order he's tired to impose on the White House, saying that if Kelly leaves, there won't be another chief of staff.\n\nThe former Breitbart News chief also expressed doubt that Mr. Trump will actually meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as Mr. Trump has said he will do by the end of May.\n\nBannon claimed that Republican Roy Moore, whom he campaigned for, only lost in the Alabama special Senate election because Republicans came up with allegations that he had touched young girls. Multiple women accused Moore of inappropriate relationships with them when they were teens and he was in his 30s.\n\nAfter living a relatively secluded existence since leaving the White House last year, Bannon has been on a speaking binge lately.\n\nEarlier this month in France, he made headlines when he suggested people who identify with his nationalist agenda should embrace accusations of racism and wear them like a \"badge of honor.\"\n\n\"History is on our side,\" Bannon told France's far-right political leaders. \"And the biggest reason -- the globalists have no answers to freedom. Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativist. Wear it as a badge of honor,\" Bannon said, applause erupting from the audience. \"Because every day, we get stronger, and they get weaker.\"\n\nBannon was ousted from the White House in August, and disavowed by the president in January after he reportedly claimed Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer was \"treasonous.\" In January, Bannon was also ousted from his position as chairman of Breitbart News, the right-wing news site credited with energizing Mr. Trump's base during the 2016 election.",

The video, first published by the New York Times, begins six days before the shooting on Sept. 25, 2017, while Paddock checks into his suite on the 32nd floor.\n\nWhat follows is a haunting collection of surveillance images capturing Paddock getting on and off elevators, playing video poker, eating alone in the hotel's sushi restaurant, interacting with hotel and casino staff and transporting his arsenal of 23 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition in nearly 12 suitcases and containers.\n\nPaddock is last seen gambling all night in a high-limit slot area before returning to his room at 7:37 a.m. on the day of the shooting. At 12:15 p.m., he makes one more trip to the parking garage, returning with two more suitcases. A few seconds before 12:30 p.m., he gets off the elevator.\n\nAbout nine hours later, the singer Jason Aldean would start playing at a music festival across the street. And 25 minutes after that, the shooting would begin.\n\nNearly six months later, we may now know more about what Paddock was doing, but still nothing about why.\n\nThirty-one million dollars was raised to help victims of the shooting. That money should be distributed by the end of March. Families of the 58 people who were killed will each get $275,000. Another 10 people who suffered brain damage or paralyzation will get the same amount.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump took the first step toward slapping as much as $60 billion in tariffs on products imported from China in a memorandum he signed Thursday. That raised fears of a trade war on Wall Street as the Dow Jones plunged more than 700 points -- nearly 3 percent.\n\nMr. Trump talked about China and a trade deficit of more than $375 billion, driven by low-cost labor and trade policies that he says unfairly favor Beijing.\n\n\"It is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It's out of control,\" the president said.\n\nMr. Trump set in motion billions in tariffs on certain Chinese imports.\n\n\"It could be about $60 billion, but that's really just a fraction of what we're talking about,\" he said.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross weighed in on the developments.\n\n\"We will end up negotiating over these things rather than fighting over them,\" Ross said.\n\nThe Chinese embassy accused the president of \"ignoring rational voices,\" adding \"China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war.\"\n\nFears of exactly that led to the dramatic sell off on Wall Street. CBS business analyst Jill Schlesinger said the tariff was the big trigger.\n\n\"A tit-for-tat trade war would be bad for both sides,\" Schlesinger said.\n\nThursday's tariff announcement fulfills a long-standing Trump campaign promise.\n\nThe president has been mentioning China and trade for awhile: \"When was the last time you said, 'Oh gee, we beat China?' ... We can beat China. We can win! ... They're killing us ... We can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing.\"\n\nOne of the president's concerns? Chinese firms stealing U.S. technology patents and making similar products for less.\n\nChina also holds the largest portion of America's $21 trillion national debt. That leverage and fears of retaliation created anxiety among Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"I would advise our people in the executive branch from the president on down to be very cautious in how you approach it,\" said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nThe Trump administration has 15 days to identify which Chinese imports will face new tariffs. It will be at least 30 days after that before any tariffs take effect. That gives the U.S. and China time to find another way.",

LOUIS -- Four days before a Kansas State University graduate was due in court on charges that he sexually assaulted an unconscious man at a campus fraternity last fall, he sexually assaulted a University of Missouri-St. Louis student at gunpoint in an on-campus apartment, prosecutors allege.\n\nDevonta Bagley, 23, of Belton, Missouri, is jailed on $500,000 bond on charges of sodomy, armed criminal action and burglary in the Missouri case, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. He faces similar charges in Riley County, Kansas, where prosecutors say he sexually assaulted a 20-year-old inside the Sigma Chi fraternity house on Sept. 9 while the man was \"unconscious or physically powerless.\"\n\nMissouri court records didn't list an attorney for Bagley on Thursday and the Riley County prosecutor didn't immediately respond to a phone call seeking the name of Bagley's lawyer in the Kansas case.\n\nBagley was arrested in Kansas on Sept. 23 and posted $100,000 bail that day, according to court documents. As a condition of his bail, he was ordered not to have any contact with his alleged victim for 90 days and he was forbidden from the Sigma Chi fraternity property.\n\nHe was scheduled for a preliminary hearing in that case on March 15. But St. Louis County police say Bagley sexually assaulted an 18-year-old male UMSL student whom he didn't know on March 11 and was arrested two days later.\n\nBagley graduated from Kansas State with a sociology degree in the spring of 2017, university records show. Officials say Bagley was a graduate student at UMSL but was expelled in October after a student conduct hearing. A UMSL spokesman, Bob Samples, said he couldn't discuss the details of what led to Bagley's expulsion.\n\nIn a news release, Samples thanked law enforcement and said the \"entire university family is sympathetic toward and supportive of the student who was the victim of this tragic crime.\"",

                "title": "Lawyer: $500K bond excessive for Parkland gunman's brother in school trespassing",
                "body": "PARKLAND, Fla. -- An attorney for the brother of Florida school gunman Nikolas Cruz said in court papers Thursday that a $500,000 bond for trespassing at the school is excessive and that the brother should be released from jail. Lawyer Joseph Kimok said in the documents that 18-year-old Zachary Cruz already paid the standard $25 bond for a misdemeanor and should not be kept in custody.\n\n\"Zachary Cruz did not kill 17 people on a high school campus. He should not be treated as if he did,\" Kimok wrote. \"There is no justice where the government seeks to hang a man for the crimes of his brother.\"\n\nZachary Cruz was arrested Monday while skateboarding on the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where authorities say his brother killed 17 people and wounded 17 others in the Valentine's Day massacre. Zachary Cruz had been warned not to visit the campus, but did so three times, authorities say.\n\nKimok also objected to several of the bond conditions imposed by a judge, including forcing Zachary Cruz to undergo a psychological evaluation, prohibiting him from visiting Broward County, putting him on house arrest with an ankle monitor if he is released, having the home he is living in searched for weapons and having no contact with Nikolas Cruz.\n\n\"To take away that familial connection is inhumane,\" Kimok wrote.\n\nSecurity at Stoneman Douglas High, already heightened, was bolstered Thursday with Gov. Rick Scott ordering eight highway patrol troopers to help secure the grounds. The move came after Zachary Cruz was arrested, two students were caught carrying knives and another made online threats.\n\nAlso, Stoneman Douglas students will be given transparent backpacks they'll be required to use when they return from spring break on April 2. Broward County school district Superintendent Robert Runcie told parents in a two-page letter that metal detectors also may be installed soon, and he outlined other security upgrades including student ID badges and a district-wide effort to require all school visitors to enter through a single door.\n\nThe troopers will be stationed at the school indefinitely, along with Broward County deputies, leaving an armed guard at every campus entrance point, Scott said in a statement. Before the shooting, the school was patrolled by one armed deputy and unarmed guards. An unspecified number of deputies, some armed with rifles, were added after the school reopened.\n\n\"Parents, students and teachers have recently endured one of the worst tragedies in Florida history,\" Scott said. \"They must be assured that every necessary step is being taken to increase safety and ensure no unauthorized people are allowed on campus.\"\n\nZachary and Nikolas, 19, both attended Stoneman Douglas. They shared the same biological mother but had different fathers. Both were adopted at very young ages by Roger and Lynda Cruz. Lynda Cruz died in November and their father died some years earlier.\n\nNickolas Cruz will plead guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder if prosecutors will waive the death penalty, his attorney has said. They have refused to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, a judge rejected an attempt to remove Broward County prosecutors and its public defender from the Nikolas Cruz criminal case.\n\nCircuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer said in an order dated Wednesday that attorney Alex Arreaza lacks legal standing to make such a motion. Arreaza represents 15-year-old Anthony Borges, who was shot five times in the Valentine's Day massacre.\n\nArreaza had claimed the two offices have a conflict because both signed a 2016 agreement along with county school and law enforcement officials aimed at handling school disciplinary issues without involving law enforcement.\n\nMollica separately imposed a $12,500 bail Wednesday on a Stoneman Douglas student who officials say pulled a small knife on a boy she accused of harassing her and a friend. The SunSentinel reports that her lawyer, Brian Reidy said everyone has \"hit the fear button\" and that he doesn't \"blame a kid for taking a weapon to school, quite frankly, these days.\"",

                "body": "\"Alien\" skeleton found in Chile actually human fetus with rare bone disorder\n\nPuzzling skeletal remains found in Chile 15 years ago -- and rumored to be \"alien\" -- are, in fact, from a human fetus with rare bone anomalies, researchers say.\n\nThe findings may or may not put to rest any internet-driven alien theories.\n\nBut the researchers said their discoveries could potentially aid in diagnosing rare bone disorders. They were able to identify several previously unknown genetic mutations behind the fetus's bone abnormalities.\n\n\"DNA differences like this are useful to help us diagnose children and adults with 'undiagnosed' disorders,\" said Dr. Atul Butte, one of the researchers on the work.\n\n\"More and more children's hospitals are able to study patients and better understand what differences in their DNA might be leading to their conditions or disorders,\" explained Butte, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\"And the ones we learned here can get added to the catalogues for future reference,\" he said.\n\nThe story goes back to 2003, when scientists discovered a mysterious mummified skeleton in Chile's Atacama Desert.\n\nNicknamed \"Ata,\" the skeleton stood just 6 inches tall, with a cone-shaped head and slanted eye sockets, and 10 pairs of ribs -- versus the normal 12 in humans. Beyond that, despite the skeleton's tiny size, it had the bone composition of a 6-year-old.\n\nThe unusual array of features triggered online rumors of an alien discovery.\n\nAnd Ata does seem unique -- but definitely earthly, according to the new analysis.\n\nThe skeleton was most likely a fetus, the researchers noted, and it had severe mutations in seven genes that regulate bone development.\n\nMany of the mutations were already known, and related to disorders like dwarfism and various bone deformities and facial malformations. But several mutations have never been recognized, Butte and his colleagues reported.\n\nThe investigators found four mutations in genes that are known to contribute to bone diseases, and two mutations in genes that help produce collagen -- a structural protein in the body's connective tissue.\n\nSome of Ata's individual anomalies have been seen before, Butte said, such as the abnormal number of ribs and short stature.\n\n\"It's just that this particular girl seemed to have many of these anomalies at the same time, and of a more severe nature,\" he explained.\n\nThe findings were published online March 22 in Genome Research.\n\nThe researchers made their discoveries after extracting a small amount of DNA from Ata's ribs and analyzing the entire genome -- the complete set of genetic material.\n\nAlmost all of Ata's DNA was \"matchable\" to human DNA, said Garry Nolan, a researcher at Stanford University who also worked on the study.\n\nThere is a simple explanation for the small amount that wasn't pinpointed as human, Nolan said in a Stanford news release: The sample was simply too degraded.\n\nAnd while the skeleton was once hypothesized to be ancient, it is actually about 40 years old, the findings showed.\n\nEven though Ata was discovered 15 years ago, it's only in recent years that this kind of genome analysis -- done on the researchers' own time -- has become feasible, Butte said.\n\n\"Every year the cost to sequence genomes continues to drop, with the current price around $1,000,\" he said. \"At a certain point, the price and availability of sequencing reached the right amount, making it possible to sequence the Ata mummy genome.\"\n\nAccording to Butte, there is a wider lesson to learn from Ata's genome analysis.\n\n\"Sometimes there might actually be more than one major DNA difference involved in explaining a particularly hard-to-explain patient,\" Butte said. \"We shouldn't stop a search when we've found the first relevant mutation. Indeed, there might be many others also involved.\"\n\nGetting such a \"full explanation\" will become increasingly important, Butte added, as researchers develop gene therapies aimed at correcting some of these rare disorders.",

                "body": "LAGOS, Nigeria -- The mother of the only Nigerian schoolgirl still in Boko Haram captivity after the extremists released 104 classmates said Thursday her daughter was blocked from boarding the vehicle to freedom and told to convert to Islam. Fifteen-year-old Leah refused, Rebecca Sharibu told The Associated Press.\n\n\"She was about to board the vehicle that was to bring them back. Then Boko Haram said she should convert,\" the mother said.\n\n\"Her friends said they tried to convince her but she said she will not convert to Islam. Boko Haram said since she will not convert to Islam she should remain behind. That was how they left her. She is alone.\"\n\nLeah Sharibu asked her departing Muslim classmates to pray for her.\n\nCBS News' Debora Patta said similar cases have been seen before. In the kidnapping of the Chibok girls several years ago, \"some of them did refuse to renounce their Christianity, they refused to wear Muslim attire, to chant Muslim prayers, as was shown over and over again in those 'proof of life' videos,\" Patta said.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari confirmed that Sharibu was the only schoolgirl still held by Boko Haram after the extraordinary release of the girls on Wednesday and vowed that she \"will not be abandoned.\"\n\nBuhari, himself a Muslim, said \"true followers of Islam all over the world respect the injunction that there is no compulsion in religion.\" He added that he looked forward to meeting with the girls who were freed.\n\nThe president's statement had no word on the five girls still unaccounted for.\n\nAlso Thursday, the father of one of the five girls said he has been told his daughter and the others are dead.\n\nInuwa Garba told the AP that friends of his daughter who were freed told him the 16-year-old died from injuries in the frightened stampede that occurred during the mass abduction in Dapchi a month ago.\n\n\"They told me five of the girls died and my daughter, who was among them, was the first to die\" the day the girls were seized, Garba said. The survivors told him the bodies were buried in the bush.\n\n\"I believe what the girls told me because they were all together and saw what happened,\" he said.\n\nThe freed girls have been taken to the capital, Abuja, where they are expected to meet Buhari on Friday.\n\nThe Boko Haram extremists brought back the girls they had kidnapped from a boarding school, dropping them off with a warning: \"Don't ever put your daughters in school again.\" Boko Haram means \"Western education is forbidden\" in the Hausa language.\n\nThe abductions in Dapchi have evoked painful memories of the tragedy in Chibok, where 276 girls were kidnapped from their boarding school. Nearly four years later, about 100 of them have never returned home. Many had been forced to marry their captors and had children fathered by them.\n\nThe Nigerian government denies that it paid a ransom or made a prisoner swap in exchange for the Dapchi girls' freedom. Both occurred before the largest release of Chibok schoolgirls last year.\n\nThe latest mass abduction is thought to have been carried out by a Boko Haram splinter group aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) that has criticized the leader of the main Boko Haram organization for targeting civilians and has focused instead on military and Western targets.\n\nNigeria's government under Buhari has repeatedly claimed victory over Boko Haram in recent months but the extremists continue to carry out deadly suicide bombings in the north, often using young women who have been abducted and indoctrinated.\n\nThe Dapchi mass abduction has caused a fresh round of outrage, especially about the protection of schools in a region where Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of people over nearly a decade.\n\nThe release of the girls came a day after an Amnesty International report accused the Nigerian military of failing to heed several warnings of the imminent attack on Feb. 19 during which the girls were seized.\n\n\"The Nigerian authorities must investigate the inexcusable security lapses that allowed this abduction to take place without any tangible attempt to prevent it,\" Osai Ojigho, Amnesty International's Nigeria director, said in the report, which the military called an \"outright falsehood.\"",

We will be ok and we have each other's backs.\"\n\nFollowing the news of their departures earlier this month, Capshaw and Drew released their own statements.\n\n\"I know you're sad. I'm sad too. I haven't really had the time to process this information. I've been with it for less than 48 hours, so I'm not ready to say my thank yous and give an all-encompassing statement about my 9 years here. That will come later,\" Drew wrote. \"For now, I'd like to say: I love you, and I love April, and her story isn't over yet.\"\n\nCapshaw issued a similarly sentimental statement, writing, \"I am sad to see [Arizona] go, but I am consoled by the idea that she will continue to live on and on in all of our consciences and our imaginations.\"",

                "body": "After 50 years on the air, retiring radio broadcaster Don Imus ranks himself and long-time rival Howard Stern among the top-five best ever, in an interview with Anthony Mason for CBS' \"Sunday Morning,\" to be broadcast March 25.\n\nIn his farewell to radio, Imus signs off in an interview with Mason that includes some parting shots, regrets, thoughts about the future, and his relationship with Stern.\n\nStern and Imus have been on-air sparring mates for decades, dating back to when they each worked for the same New York City radio station. Their \"feuds\" at the time were legendary and transcended radio. Since then, Imus has been occasional fodder for Stern's radio commentary.\n\n\"I would put Stern in there,\" Imus tells Mason when asked for his picks for best ever.\n\nAsked if he thought people would be surprised he included Stern in the list, Imus said it was Stern who had issues. \"He had a big problem with me,\" Imus said. \"I didn't with him.\"\n\nIn a career that spans decades, Imus has long been considered one of the most outrageous and influential broadcasters of his time. He's been fired several times along the way, too, most notably in 2007 when he called the Rutgers women's basketball team a racist slur. It cost him a CBS syndicated radio show and a show on MSNBC. Imus said he regrets the comments.\n\n\"It did change my feeling about making fun of some people who didn't deserve to be made fun of, and didn't have a mechanism to defend themselves,\" Imus said of the Rutgers incident.\n\nNext week he says goodbye to the current version of his radio show, which he broadcasts from his ranch in Texas. Imus admits he's going to miss that connection to the listeners, and gets emotional about it when pressed by Mason.\n\n\"I always had it in my head I was talking to one person,\" Imus said. \"I felt that when I walked in there and sat down and turned the mike on, that I was talking to you.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna miss that,\" he added.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning program, hosted by Jane Pauley, is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET. Executive producer is Rand Morrison.",

                "body": "A 55-year-old woman in Spain died after undergoing a \"bee acupuncture\" treatment and suffering an allergic reaction that left her in a coma. The alternative medicine procedure involves injecting bee sting venom into the body rather than the needles used in traditional acupuncture. It's typically performed by non-medical practitioners in private treatment centers.\n\nAccording to a report written by her doctors and published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the woman had been attending these sessions every four weeks for two years without any sign of a reaction.\n\n\"Bee therapy,\" or apitherapy, is the medicinal use of products made by honeybees, including bee venom, honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis, and beeswax, according to the American Apitherapy Society.\n\n\"Therapies involving the honeybee have existed for thousands of years and some may be as old as human medicine itself,\" the group's website states. Some people turn to it for conditions such as arthritis, pain, gout, burns, and tendonitis, even though many of those claims are unproven and studies have shown serious risks.\n\nThe woman in this case decided to undergo apitherapy due to \"muscular contractures and stress.\" Her doctors reported that she had no record of other diseases, including heart disease or asthma, and had not had any previous allergic reactions to the treatment until her last visit.\n\n\"During an apitherapy session, she developed wheezing, dyspnea [difficulty breathing], and sudden loss of consciousness immediately after a live bee sting,\" authors Paula Vazquez-Revuelta and Ricardo Madrigal-Burgaleta of the Ramon y Cajal University Hospital in Spain, wrote.\n\nStaff members at the apitherapy clinic called an ambulance but it took 30 minutes to arrive. The patient was hospitalized and her blood pressure dropped, causing \"a massive watershed stroke and permanent coma.\"\n\nThe woman died of multiorgan failure several weeks later.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of death by bee venom apitherapy due to complications of severe anaphylaxis,\" the doctors wrote. Anaphylaxis is a sudden, severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs in the body, which can be fatal.\n\n\"Previous tolerance to bee stings does not prevent hypersensitivity reaction,\" they wrote; in fact, \"repeated exposure to the allergen was found to carry a greater risk of severe allergic reactions.\"\n\nResearch on apitherapy is limited but a 2015 review published in PLOS One found that in 145 studies, nearly 29 percent of people who underwent bee venom therapy experienced adverse events ranging from \"trivial skin reactions\" that went away on their own, to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\n\"Adverse events related to bee venom therapy are frequent; therefore, practitioners of bee venom therapy should be cautious when applying it in daily clinical practice, and the practitioner's education and qualifications regarding the use of bee venom therapy should be ensured,\" that report warned.\n\nVazquez-Revuelta and Madrigal-Burgaleta call for apitherapy practitioners to be trained in managing severe reactions in case they occur, and to have have adequate facilities for managing anaphylaxis and rapid access to treatment.\n\nHowever, even those precautions wouldn't necessarily be enough to make the unproven treatment safe.\n\n\"The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable,\" they write.",

They explain why art therapy and abolishing human trafficking are important causes for them, and they also respond to comedian John Oliver releasing a parody children's book.",

The intimate, solo show takes place at the Walter Kerr Theater, which seats just 960 people. The show features Springsteen not just performing music, but also reading excerpts from his autobiography, \"Born to Run.\"\n\nThe show has been extended several times, first to Feb. 3, then June 30 and now to Dec. 15, which Springsteen says will be the \"final show.\" Because of the show's massive popularity, Springsteen says that only those who previously registered to purchase tickets but did not have the chance to buy them will be eligible to receive an invitation to the sale. Eligible fans will receive information on Monday on how to buy the tickets.\n\nWhen Springsteen first announced the show, he said, \"I wanted to do some shows that were as personal and as intimate as possible.\"\n\n\"My show is just me, the guitar, the piano and the words and music,\" he continued. \"Some of the show is spoken, some of it is sung. It loosely follows the arc of my life and my work. All of it together is in pursuit of my constant goal to provide an entertaining evening and to communicate something of value.\"\n\nThe show's ticket sales have generated some complaints from fans, who were upset to see them on StubHub for sky-high prices.",

                "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Community members and activists are gathering at Sacramento City Hall on Thursday to protest the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by police.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Sacramento is organizing the rally in honor of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old who was shot Sunday night in his grandparents' backyard, where he was staying.\n\nThe two officers yelled that they thought he had a gun in the moments before they shot him, according to audio from body camera footage released Wednesday by Sacramento police. But Clark was only holding a cellphone.\n\nFootage from body cameras and an overhead helicopter does not clearly depict what Clark was doing just before police opened fire. Officers did not find a gun at the scene.\n\nThe Sacramento Police Department said they were responding to reports of a man seen breaking into at least three vehicles and later into a neighbor's home. The break-ins were first reported by a 911 call also released by the police.\n\nThe police said deputies in the helicopter saw Clark break a neighbor's sliding glass door before jumping a fence. The helicopter video does not show the alleged break-in. It picks up as he is running through a backyard and climbing over a fence into a neighboring property. It shows him looking into a truck in the driveway.\n\nThe helicopter, flying over the house, then loses sight of the man. It briefly shows him in the backyard as the police are running up the driveway along the side of the house.\n\n\"Show me your hands -- gun!\" one officer yells, according to the body camera footage released Wednesday. It is dark outside and a flashlight from one body camera briefly shows the backyard, but the man is not visible. \"Gun, gun, gun,\" one of the officers yells before they begin shooting.\n\nThe helicopter footage shows Clark collapsing as they shoot. It's unclear from the helicopter and body camera video exactly how many shots were fired. Police previously said the officers fired 20 shots.\n\nThe department had said he advanced toward the officers holding an object extended in front of him. The officers thought he was pointing a handgun, police said.\n\nAfter the shooting, the footage shows the officers taking turns reloading and keeping their guns trained on the man from a distance while they await backup.\n\nWhen backup arrives, one of the officers who fired says, \"We can't see his left hand.\" Someone suggests getting a nonlethal weapon before approaching.\n\n\"Let's hit him a couple of times with that before we uh--\" the officer says, though it appears the suggestion was heeded.\n\n\"What'd he have on him?\" someone asks.\n\n\"Something in his hands, it looked like a gun from our perspective,\" one officer says.\n\nAs several officers approach, the man is seen lying face down with a cellphone near his head. He's handcuffed and the officers discuss performing CPR.\n\nThe officers who fired are taken to the street, where someone says \"Hey mute\" and the audio cuts out. The video continues without sound for about two minutes as the officers talk.\n\n\"Based on the videos alone, I cannot second guess the split-second decisions of our officers and I'm not going to do that,\" Mayor Darrell Steinberg said in a statement. \"The investigation must be completed. We need more information in addition to the video before we can render any final conclusions.\"\n\nSteinberg said appropriate questions have been raised about the protocols for using force and rendering emergency aid during police shootings and they must be answered in the investigation.\n\nThe shooting has ignited questions by relatives, activists and others after it turned out he was holding only a cellphone.\n\nSalena Manni, who identified herself as Clark's fiancee, said he was the father of her two sons, ages 1 and 3.\n\n\"He would never want to leave his kids,\" Manni said in an interview with ABC10. \"I just tell them daddy's always going to be with us, daddy's in our hearts, always and forever. He's always going to be with us. Don't forget that.\"\n\nClark routinely helped care for his grandparents at their home in south Sacramento, his cousin, Sonia Lewis, told Capitol Public Radio.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Sacramento called it a police murder and demanded answers. City Councilman Larry Carr decried the loss of life and said police must provide timely information.\n\nThe department said the two officers have been with Sacramento police for two and four years, but each has four years' previous experience with other law enforcement agencies. Both are on paid administrative leave.\n\nCBS Sacramento reports that Clark's relatives are determined to make sure Stephon is not forgotten, and that the family has hired civil rights attorney John Burris to represent them in any potential legal challenges in the case.\n\n\"They will pay for this,\" said Stevante Clark, \"like how you know Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice -- you're going to know. You're going to know him. You're going to remember this.\"",

                "body": "It's well known that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg prioritizes staying in shape. \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert learned just how intense the 85-year-old's fitness routine really is.\n\nColbert took a trip to Washington, D.C., to get his heart rate up with Ginsburg, but he quickly learned that Ginsburg is not in the gym to goof off. Ginsburg, the oldest member of the court, rocked a sweatshirt that said \"Super Diva\" for her workout, while Colbert wore a shirt and tie (with shorts).\n\nBefore getting down to business, Colbert and Ginsburg chatted and discussed whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich. Ginsburg also revealed that she typically listens to opera music when she works out, and was not amused when Colbert turned on \"Everybody Dance Now.\"\n\n\"I would never, ever exercise to that noise,\" she said, as Colbert danced next to her. \"Let's shut it off.\"\n\nColbert and Ginsburg cycled through the treadmill, resistance bands, planks and weights.\n\n\"I don't think Paul Ryan could do this,\" remarked Colbert.\n\nLater, Colbert admitted that the workout was getting intense for him.\n\n\"I'm cramping,\" he said. \"And I'm working out with an 85-year-old woman.\"\n\nColbert was not able to keep up with Ginsburg's full pushups. Watch the video to see Colbert's stab at Ginsburg's routine.\n\nIn October, Ginsburg's trainer, Bryant Johnson, released a book called \"The RBG Workout: How She Stays Strong ... and You Can Too!\" which outlines the justice's hour-long fitness routine.\n\nGinsburg originally started working out with Johnson twice a week to rebuild her strength after being treated for colorectal cancer, but has kept up the practice for nearly 20 years. The workouts also helped in her recovery process after she was treated for pancreatic cancer in 2009.\n\n\"I said push-ups -- she looked at me,\" Johnson told CBS News, referring to Ginsburg. \"Kind of gave me the side eye, one eyebrow sort of went up. But as classy as she is as a woman, she did not say a word. But that body language was to me, like, 'Really?'\"\n\nGinsburg does not modify the workout positions, doing full-strength planks, push-ups, chest and shoulder presses, bicep and leg curls, one-legged squats and knee raises, among other exercises.\n\nJohnson works as the records manager at a federal court in Washington and is also an Army reservist and trainer. He's also trained with Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Stephen Breyer.",

                "title": "Toxic algae leads Ohio to designate western Lake Erie as \"impaired\"",
                "body": "TOLEDO, Ohio -- Ohio is designating -- for the first time -- the entire western end of Lake Erie as an impaired waterway because of the toxic algae that has fouled drinking water and closed beaches in recent years, officials said Thursday. The shallowest of the Great Lakes has seen its largest algae blooms on record over the past decade, fueled mainly by farm fertilizers washing into the lake.\n\nUntil now, Ohio has resisted calls by environmental groups and some political leaders to issue an impairment declaration, saying federal regulators didn't have standards to trigger such a decision for the lake's open waters. Officials within Ohio Gov. John Kasich's administration also have been worried that calling the lake impaired would wrongly give the impression that it's no longer safe as a drinking water source or for boaters and swimmers.\n\nOhio's Environmental Protection Agency worked with university researchers to come up with a measurement standard and determined that water samples show the western part of Lake Erie aren't meeting water quality standards, state EPA Director Craig Butler said.\n\n\"We have taken unprecedented steps in recent years to put Lake Erie on a better trajectory -- including investing more than $3 billion to improve its water quality,\" Butler said, CBS affiliate WTOL reports. \"While designating the open waters of the western basin as impaired does not provide a magic bullet to improve the lake, the State remains committed to our obligations under the Clean Water Act and to examine emerging science and practices that we can put in place to help improve it.\"\n\nToledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said he is \"pleased\" the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and Kasich decided to declare Ohio's portion of Lake Erie's open waters impaired.\n\n\"The step announced today is the most significant policy development in Ohio since the Toledo water crisis of 2014,\" he said.\n\nThe algae bloom in 2014 left more than 400,000 people around Toledo unable to drink their tap water for two days. The following year's outbreak was the largest yet. Blooms also have been blamed for fish kills and can sicken swimmers.\n\nThe new designation comes as a federal judge is considering a lawsuit filed by environmental groups who want the lake classified impaired, hoping it would pave the way for increased pollution regulations.\n\nWhether stiffer rules will be mandated isn't clear. Butler said he doesn't expect the EPA to order any new regulations because Ohio already has a federally approved plan in place to combat the algae that now turns the lake's blue waters into unsightly shades of green most summers.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the U.S. EPA called for increased efforts to reduce the phosphorus that feeds the algae but didn't recommend any new regulations.\n\nInstead, the federal strategy relies on existing state and local programs and voluntary actions by farmers to prevent fertilizers, manure and sewage from flowing into waterways. It said some tougher rules might be needed but leaves those decisions to the states.\n\nEnvironmental groups that have become frustrated by the pace and depth of those efforts applauded Ohio's move, but they said tougher and enforceable regulations throughout the western Lake Erie region are still needed.\n\n\"Voluntary efforts haven't been enough,\" said Howard Learner of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, which brought the lawsuit seeking the impairment designation. \"To be clear, this is a first step and not the ending.\"\n\nPeter Bucher of the Ohio Environmental Council said that without a plan reducing the pollutants, Lake Erie will be \"inundated by yearly large-scale algal blooms for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nOhio officials say the impairment designation doesn't mean that the western end of the lake isn't safe or that it should be avoided when there are no algae blooms in the water.\n\nThe worry, though, is that it will cause people to think twice about visiting the lake, Butler said.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about the negative consequences this could bring for our tourism and fishing industries for very little environmental gain,\" he said.\n\nOhio's impairment designation covers an area of the lake that stretches roughly 60 miles -- from Toledo to Marblehead -- and is popular with boaters and anglers.\n\nUntil now, the state had designated only shoreline waters and a small area near Toledo's water intake pipe as impaired.\n\nThe impairment designation is part of a two-year evaluation of all state waterways that's mandated by the Clean Water Act.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea are among the nations that will get an initial exemption from looming steel and aluminum tariffs from the Trump administration, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is planning to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum -- trade penalties aimed at China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum.\n\nLighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee that there are countries involved in various stages of trade talks with the U.S., and that Trump decided \"to pause\" the tariffs for those countries.\n\nThe trade official also mentioned Canada and Mexico in his list. The U.S. is in consultations with the two countries in an effort to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. If all those countries are exempted, that would mean the top four countries exporting steel to the U.S. -- Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico -- would be exempted from the tariffs, as well as Germany, which is eighth on the list of the top 10 steel exporters to the U.S. Turkey, Japan, Russia, Taiwan and China would remain on the list -- together they make up 24 percent of U.S. steel imports.\n\nTrump moved on a separate trade front Thursday, paving the way for tariffs on China as punishment for what he said is the theft of American technology. He told reporters that the threat of the steel and aluminum tariffs was already having an impact.\n\n\"Many countries are calling to negotiate better trade deals because they don't want to have to pay the steel and aluminum tariffs,\" Trump said.\n\nLighthizer identified the countries initially exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs in response to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who said lawmakers wanted more consultation from the administration on trade.\n\n\"There are countries with whom we're negotiating, and then the question becomes the obvious one that you think, as a matter of business, how does this work?\" Lighthizer said. \"So what he has decided to do is to pause the imposition of the tariffs with respect to those countries.\"\n\nBefore Lighthizer's congressional testimony, Germany's economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said he had found officials in Washington \"open to our arguments\" during a recent visit with the EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom.\n\nAltmaier told Germany's parliament \"it is a question of fundamental significance: whether we all stand for open and fair world markets in the future.\"\n\nTrump campaigned on promises to bring down America's trade deficit, which stood at $566 billion last year, by rewriting trade agreements and cracking down on what he called abusive commercial practices by U.S. trading partners. But Trump was slow to turn rhetoric to action. In January, he imposed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. Then he announced the steel and aluminum tariffs, saying reliance on imported metals jeopardizes U.S. national security.\n\nLighthizer said the nation's trade deficit indicates that the global rules on trade sometimes make it hard for U.S. companies to export.\n\nThe administration \"is seeking to build a better, fairer system of global markets that will lead to higher living standards for all Americans,\" Lighthizer said.\n\nGOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee chairman, said he was \"deeply disappointed in the decision to impose global tariffs to address a problem caused by China.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said he was troubled to hear that South Korea would be initially exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\n\"I was not expecting that,\" Brown said. \"Korea has unfairly dumped steel and other products in our country.\"",

Today, Giannis Antetokounmpo is far from poor but still has that childhood persistence propelling him to NBA stardom.

He's averaging 27 points a game and earned the most all-star votes from his NBA peers. In the public all-star voting, the only player to finish ahead of Antetokounmpo was the NBA's reigning king, LeBron James.\n\nHe tells Kroft his success comes from his dogged persistence honed as a child street hawker. \"I was the best [salesman]. I was really good at it.\" It was out of necessity. He and his brother sold items like glasses and watches on the streets to help their parents, who as Nigerian immigrants, had no papers and could not get work. \"I didn't give up,\" he tells Kroft, adding that being young and cute helped.\n\nAsked if he was still like that, Antetokounmpo replies, \"Persistent in life? I think yes. I am. I'm going to do something until I get it right,\" he says.\n\nAntetokounmpo is still trying to get it right, despite the spectacular plays he makes and the fat stats he's putting up. Asked if he thinks he's going to get even better, he replies, \"I have to. There's not a choice. I'm really scared of failing. So I've got to get better.\"",

They set out to let the world know immediate change is needed to save lives. The documentary captures students' raw emotions as they grieve and work around the clock in an effort to change the gun laws of this country.\n\n\"We're trying to get people to stop dying,\" says student Emma González.\n\nJournalists were also embedded with Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the shooting. Pollack's searing and powerful speech at the White House has made him one of the most visible of the victims' parents.\n\n\"It should've been one school shooting and we should have fixed it,\" Pollack told President Donald Trump that day. \"And I'm pissed, because my daughter I'm not going to see again.\"\n\nPollack says the focus should be on tightening school safety, not changing gun laws.\n\n\"It's great that the kids are out there together and that they have a voice,\" Pollack says. \"I would tell them to focus their energy on something that's achievable that we could accomplish right now.

                "body": "One of the largest subway construction projects in the country is providing a window into Los Angeles' ancient past. Archaeologists have been unearthing the bones of prehistoric mammals and recently uncovered a whole new treasure trove of fossils. CBS News' Carter Evans first met paleontologist Dr. Ashley Leger last summer, 40 feet underground, where she leads a group of archaeologists in one of the most unusual digs in the country.\n\nLeger is still deep in the dig.\n\n\"We've got mammoths and mastodons on one end. We're finding horses over here. It's been really fun,\" Leger said.\n\nThe discoveries paint a picture of what Los Angeles looked like tens of thousands of years ago.\n\n\"This treasure trove is coming out of an area where you don't usually get to dig a giant 80-foot-deep pit,\" Leger said.\n\nFirst they found bones of Columbian mammoths that roamed in herds during the Ice Age. They uncovered a three-foot section of tusk and a rare nearly complete skull.\n\n\"This is the bucket list you always want to find at some point in your career and then it's one of the first things we found here,\" Leger said.\n\nOne of the first but certainly not the last. They just made another unusual discovery: a bone from a giant sloth.\n\n\"You think sloth, you think slow-moving, small, cuddly ... These are huge. They're taller than I am,\" Leger said.\n\nLast summer, Leger was expecting to see a dramatic increase in fossils as construction approached the tar pits. The prehistoric black ooze that still seeps from the ground was a sticky death trap for the massive mammals that once roamed here.\n\nBut for months, nothing materialized. Then, suddenly, new discoveries exploded as the digging moved into Beverly Hills. Leger said she can barely keep up and, in fact, hasn't even had a chance to identify them all. People are bringing her bones almost every single day. Inside the museum's collection room, Leger has a new bounty of bones to catalogue.\n\n\"I can take a field trip, spend an afternoon in the collection, and try to figure out what it looks like, what it matches up to, and at the end of the day say, 'Ah-ha. It's this animal. See?'\"\n\nOther new unique finds were an arm bone from an ancient sea otter -- and whale bones.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, but about 25 feet below the shops of Beverly Hills, mammoths and bison roamed tens of thousands of years ago. But 80 feet down, hundreds of thousands years earlier, Los Angeles was underwater.\n\n\"I see the history of Los Angeles ... Hundreds of thousands of years ago, animals like whales were swimming in the ocean that was in that exact same area,\" Leger said. \"Yes, it's mind blowing to think about, but really exciting.\"\n\nSubway construction will continue for several more years -- building the future while Leger's team works to preserve L.A.'s prehistoric past.\n\n\"Fossils are always rare. We estimate that less than 1 percent of life on Earth actually fossilizes. So the fact that we get anything is incredible,\" Leger said.",

                "body": "There are still 285 days left on the 2018 calendar, but the House will only be in session for 88 of those days and the Senate for 126 days. That might seem like plenty of time to get things done, but don't expect it to be filled with much legislating. After the $1.3 trillion spending bill being voted on this week, which includes some modest measures on tough issues like guns, there is little motivation to take further action before November's midterm elections.\n\nThat's true despite members of both parties calling for urgent action on an array of issues, reports CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman.\n\n\"We're going to pass the STOP School Violence [Act],\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said earlier this month.\n\n\"The key thing at this point is not just protecting our elections from future Russian intrusion, it's protecting our elections period,\" Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said this week.\n\n\"Ban bump stocks, make it a crime to possess or manufacture them,\" Alabama Sen. Doug Jones said Wednesday.\n\n\"I hope we can do an infrastructure bill,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nBut it's unlikely they'll be able to tick through their wish list before Americans go to the polls in November. All 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot.\n\n\"It's harder to get bipartisan consensus these days and get those bills that everyone kind of agrees are a good idea passed because of the level of vitriol,\" said Michael Steel, who was spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nHe said whenever it passes, the spending bill will likely be the last major legislative action this year.\n\n\"Given the lack of harmony and bipartisanship in Washington these days, there aren't a lot of other opportunities for big bipartisan bills,\" Steel said.\n\nThe midterm elections are on the minds of many, with upwards of 50 competitive races. Democrats would need to pick up 24 seats in the House and two in the Senate to take a majority in both chambers. And despite a major victory on taxes, Republicans will face challengers who decry inaction in Washington, a sentiment echoed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins who this week warned against not moving on legislation to lower health care premiums.\n\n\"The focus is on scoring partisan, political points that can be used in the fall elections,\" Collins said.\n\nLawmakers are about to leave for a two-week recess. Typically we see this kind of slowdown until August of an election year, but the schedule is a bit of whack this year because of the way Congress has been passing short term, smaller spending bills.",

Police say Paddock, 64, opened fire on attendees of the Route 91 Harvest country music festival from his 32nd-floor suite that night.\n\nHe killed himself just before authorities stormed his room. His motive remains a mystery.\n\nIn the video clips obtained by the Times, Paddock is seen leaving the hotel multiple times for his home in Mesquite -- about 80 miles away -- returning in a minivan filled with suitcases and chatting with bellhops as they stack the luggage on carts and help him transport it upstairs.\n\nAccording to the Times, he transported 21 bags over the course of seven days - inside were the arsenal of weapons he used to carry out the massacre.\n\nPaddock is unassuming in the video, riding the elevator, gambling, eating and tipping staff. The hotel's parent company has previously said the multiple interactions Paddock had with staff -- including a room service delivery and a call with housekeeping on the day of the shooting -- were \"normal in nature.\"\n\nThe video shows how Paddock was able to blend in among hotel guests while at the same time apparently meticulously planning the mass shooting, the deadliest in U.S. history.\n\nThe New York Times obtained the video from Mandalay Bay's parent company, MGM Resorts.",

Miami-Dade Police released 15 calls made to 911 dispatchers in the moments after the collapse on March 15.\n\nSirens could be heard blaring behind several frantic callers moments after the 950-ton structure fell into traffic.\n\n\"Oh, my gosh. A lot of cars are under the bridge,\" one woman told a 911 dispatcher.\n\nShe started crying and added, \"Hurry up, please,\" before realizing police had arrived at the scene.\n\nAnother woman said in a shaken voice that she was driving to work when the bridge fell in front of her.\n\n\"There are dead people,\" she said in Spanish to the dispatcher.\n\nA male caller told a dispatcher the bridge had collapsed across the whole eight-lane roadway.\n\n\"They just put it up, they were working on it, and it collapsed into the middle of the road. We've got a big, big deal here,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a big, big, mess,\" he said, adding the police were already at the scene.\n\nThe bridge was intended to span a busy roadway between Florida International University and the neighboring city of Sweetwater. The collapse killed six people.\n\nThe family of one of the victims filed a wrongful death lawsuit Thursday in state court. The lawsuit filed on behalf of the son and wife of victim Rolando Fraga seeks unspecified damages from Munilla Construction Management and FIGG Bridge Engineers, the two main entities involved in the bridge construction.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the two companies were negligent because they had warning that a public safety hazard existed and the flow of traffic beneath the bridge should have been shut down while work was being performed.\n\nSeveral other lawsuits also have been filed since the collapse.",

                "body": "NEW YORK -- A sprawling mass of garbage located in waters between California and Hawaii -- and known as the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch,\" or GPGP -- is rapidly collecting more plastic, according to research published Thursday in Scientific Reports. Researchers estimate that at least 79,000 tons of ocean plastic are floating in an area spanning 1.6 million square kilometers, or about 618,000 square miles -- \"four to sixteen times higher than previously reported,\" the study says.\n\n\"Our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters,\" the authors write.\n\nTo understand the scope of the patch, a team of scientists affiliated with The Ocean Cleanup Foundation, half a dozen universities and an aerial sensor company conducted a mapping initiative over three years. They found that microplastics -- pieces smaller than 5 mm -- accounted for a whopping 94 percent of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the area, but only 8 percent of the whole mass.\n\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Julia Reisser, chief scientist of the expeditions, said in a news release from the The Ocean Cleanup. \"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\n\nLaurent Lebreton, lead author of the study and an oceanographer, said \"it was depressing to see,\" The Guardian reported.\n\n\"There were things you just wondered how they made it into the ocean,\" Lebreton said.",

                "title": "Hurricane Harvey's toxic impact deeper than public told",
                "body": "HOUSTON -- A toxic onslaught from the nation's petrochemical hub was largely overshadowed by the record-shattering deluge of Hurricane Harvey as residents and first responders struggled to save lives and property.\n\nMore than a half-year after floodwaters swamped America's fourth-largest city, the extent of this environmental assault is beginning to surface, while questions about the long-term consequences for human health remain unanswered.\n\nCounty, state and federal records pieced together by The Associated Press and The Houston Chronicle reveal a far more widespread toxic impact than authorities publicly reported after the storm slammed into the Texas coast in late August and then stalled over the Houston area.\n\nSome 500 chemical plants, 10 refineries and more than 6,670 miles of intertwined oil, gas and chemical pipelines line the nation's largest energy corridor.\n\nNearly half a billion gallons of industrial wastewater mixed with storm water surged out of just one chemical plant in Baytown, east of Houston on the upper shores of Galveston Bay.\n\nBenzene, vinyl chloride, butadiene and other known human carcinogens were among the dozens of tons of industrial toxins released into surrounding neighborhoods and waterways following Harvey's torrential rains.\n\nIn all, reporters catalogued more than 100 Harvey-related toxic releases -- on land, in water and in the air. Most were never publicized, and in the case of two of the biggest ones, the extent or potential toxicity of the releases was initially understated.\n\nOnly a handful of the industrial spills have been investigated by federal regulators, reporters found.\n\nTexas regulators say they have investigated 89 incidents, but have yet to announce any enforcement actions.\n\nTesting by state and federal regulators of soil and water for contaminants was largely limited to Superfund toxic waste sites.\n\nBased on widespread air monitoring, including flyovers, officials repeatedly assured the public that post-Harvey air pollution posed no health threat. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official in charge now says these general assessments did not necessarily reflect local \"hotspots\" with potential risk to people.\n\nRegulators alerted the public to dangers from just two, well-publicized toxic disasters: the Arkema chemical plant northeast of Houston that exploded and burned for days, and a nearby dioxin-laden federal Superfund site whose protective cap was damaged by the raging San Jacinto River.\n\nSamuel Coleman, who was the EPA's acting regional administrator during Harvey, said the priority in the immediate aftermath was \"addressing any environmental harms as quickly as possible as opposed to making announcements about what the problem was.\"\n\nIn hindsight, he said, it might not have been a bad idea to inform the public about the worst of \"dozens of spills.\"\n\nLocal officials say the state's industry-friendly approach has weakened efforts by the city of Houston and surrounding Harris County to build cases against and force cleanup by the companies, many of them repeat environmental offenders.\n\n\"The public will probably never know the extent of what happened to the environment after Harvey. But the individual companies of course know,\" said Rock Owens, supervising environmental attorney for Harris County, home to Houston and 4.7 million residents.\n\nThe chairman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Bryan Shaw, declined when asked by lawmakers in January to identify the worst spills and their locations. He told a legislative subcommittee hearing he could not publicly discuss spills until his staff completed a review.\n\nThe amount of post-Harvey government testing contrasts sharply with what happened after two other major Gulf Coast hurricanes. After Hurricane Ike hit Texas in 2008, state regulators collected 85 sediment samples to measure the contamination; more than a dozen violations were identified and cleanups were carried out, according to a state review.\n\nIn Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters ravaged New Orleans in 2005, the EPA and Louisiana officials examined about 1,800 soil samples over 10 months, EPA records showed.\n\n\"Now the response is completely different,\" said Scott Frickel, an environmental sociologist formerly at Tulane University in New Orleans.\n\nFrickel, now at Brown University, called the Harvey response \"unconscionable\" given Houston's exponentially larger industrial footprint.\n\nReporters covered some environmental crises as they happened, such as AP's exclusive on the flooding of toxic waste sites and the Chronicle's Arkema warnings before fires broke out. But the sheer quantity of spills was impossible to document in real time.\n\nAcademic researchers are now trying to fill in the gaps in environmental monitoring, helped by grants from the National Science Foundation and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. One project, a Harvey-related public health registry for Houston, was funded just this month but is not yet underway.\n\n\"People are left in a state of limbo of not knowing if they were exposed or not -- or if they were, what the implications are for their health,\" said Dr. Nicole Lurie, who oversaw federal public health responses to the Superstorm Sandy and Deepwater Horizon disasters while at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nScientists say the paucity of data also could hamstring efforts to prepare for and mitigate damage from future violent weather events that climatologists predict will happen with increasing frequency.\n\nWhen it meets moisture, hydrogen chloride gas becomes hydrochloric acid, which can burn, suffocate and kill.\n\nBetween lulls in Harvey's pounding torrents on Aug. 28, an 18-inch pipeline leak at Williams Midstream Services Inc. unleashed a plume of the chemical near the intersection of two major highways in La Porte, southeast of Houston, where the San Jacinto River meets the 50-mile ship channel. It's the petrochemical corridor's main artery that empties into Galveston Bay.\n\nA toxic cloud spread about a quarter-mile in an industrial sector as firefighters and police rushed to shut down roads, blared neighborhood sirens and robo-dispatched phone and text messages warning people to stay indoors.\n\nTwo hours ticked by before a county hazardous materials response unit -- lucky to find a road not under water -- arrived and ended the danger with the help of a crew from a nearby plant.\n\nThe spill was among dozens barely noticed at the time, records show. A county pollution control inspector, Johnathan Martin, wrote in his report that he could not safely monitor the toxic plume but believed it did not reach homes less than a mile away. There were no reports of injuries.\n\nOn land, the deluge -- five feet of rain in some spots -- appears to have scoured the top soil, according to separate testing efforts by scientists from Texas A&M and Rice universities.\n\nThe Texas A&M collection of 24 samples -- taken in September from lawns mainly in a neighborhood near Valero Energy Corp.'s refinery -- turned up only low traces of petroleum and petrochemical-related compounds.\n\n\"As expected the rains washed most things out,\" said Texas A&M research leader Anthony Knap.\n\nRice researchers tested soil at a school and park in Baytown, east across Upper Galveston Bay, where residents said floodwaters rushed in from the 3,400-acre ExxonMobil refinery and chemical plant. They also sampled in Galena Park, a community of 11,000 hemmed in by heavy industry along the ship channel, just east of downtown.\n\nOnly one of the nine samples collected by Rice researchers showed elevated levels of petroleum-related toxins, according to an independent chemical analysis funded by the AP-Chronicle collaboration. Collected in Galena Park, it showed the presence of benzo(a)pyrene, a known carcinogen, at levels just above what the EPA deems a cancer risk.\n\nJessica Chastain lives a block away.\n\nDuring Harvey's three-day downpour, the nearby Panther Creek swallowed Chastain's home, forcing the 36-year-old mother and four of her children to swim across the street to the safety of her parents' two-story house, through slimy brownish-black water that smelled like a \"rotten sewer,\" said Chastain. \"It had a coat of film over it. I'm not sure what it was. It was probably oil.\"\n\nHer children -- 15, 11, 9 and 6 -- all developed skin infections and strep throat, she said.\n\nHer youngest still \"cries when it rains hard,\" she said. \"'Is it going to flood?' he asks.\"\n\nThe creek, which empties into the nearby ship channel, had backed up from flooded chemical plants and tank farms.\n\nA number of Harvey-related spills occurred near Chastain's home, including the 460,000-gallon gasoline spill at a Magellan Midstream Partners tank farm and nearly 52,000 pounds of crude oil from a Seaway Crude Pipeline Inc. tank.\n\nSamples taken in October at a Houston park upstream of the ship channel showed elevated levels of dioxins, PCBs and hazardous chemicals typically created in the burning of oil, coal and gas, said Jennifer Horney, an A&M epidemiology professor who conducted testing for the city.\n\nBenzo(a)pyrene was among the chemicals found in sediment on the banks of Brays Bayou at the park, a popular recreation site with baseball diamonds, soccer pitches and bicycle pathways.\n\n\"It's coal tar and it's a known carcinogen and mostly you find it in industrial settings,\" said Horney. \"We know the ship channel -- or the bayou -- was (up) in that park.\"\n\nWhile worrisome, the levels at the park were not high enough to trigger a cleanup under EPA standards, she said. Neither Houston nor Texas A&M officials have publicly released those test results, which the city health department's chief environmental science officer, Loren Raun, said showed \"nothing of concern for human health risk.\"\n\nThe surface soil scrubbing that scientists believe occurred during Harvey means contaminants likely migrated downstream, said Hanadi Rifai. The head of the University of Houston's environmental engineering program, she has been studying pollution in the watershed for more than two decades.\n\n\"That soil ended up somewhere,\" Rifai said. \"The net result on Galveston Bay is going to be nothing short of catastrophic.\"\n\nResidents of the tidy, mostly Latino neighborhood off Old Industrial Road in Galena Park are accustomed to the foul odors that wind shifts can bring.\n\nBut no one told them about the gasoline spill at the Magellan terminal a mile away -- one of more than a dozen Harvey-related releases in a two-mile radius. The release was initially reported to the Coast Guard at 42,000 gallons -- and residents would only learn of it a week later through news reports. Not until 11 days after the spill did Magellan report that it was actually more than 10 times bigger.\n\nAsked about the discrepancy, Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine said floodwaters prevented the company from accessing the ruptured tanks until Sept. 5. He said the company later removed 15 dump trucks of tainted soil.\n\nThe spill was reported to the Coast Guard on Thursday, Aug. 31 at 11:35 p.m. -- six days after Harvey made landfall.\n\nAn explosion risk prompted workers to evacuate upwind as the nearly half-million gallons of gasoline gushed out failed storage tanks, state environmental and Coast Guard records show. The spill ranked as Texas' largest reported Harvey-related venting of air pollutants, at 1,143 tons.\n\nThe local fire department put down foam to suppress the fumes, records revealed, and a police report described \"a vapor cloud.\"\n\nClaudia Mendez, a 42-year-old housewife, said she later saw foam by the side of the road and wondered about its origin.\n\nThe fumes were so strong, Mendez said, \"I thought my husband had brought the lawnmower gas can inside.\"\n\nMagellan has been cited for 11 environmental violations since 2002 by Texas regulators and fined more than $190,000, more than half in August 2012 for a single violation of air quality standards.\n\nIts spill is among at least three post-Harvey releases about which Harris County officials have withheld information, saying they remain under investigation.\n\nThe second involves W&P Development Corp., owner of an industrial park where about 100,000 gallons of oily wastewater were reported to have spilled into the San Jacinto from Aug. 29 to Aug. 31. The site was formerly Champion Paper Mill and a landfill there received wastes including turpentine- and lead-contaminated soil and mercury until 2008. For most of 2015 and 2016, the property was in violation of federal anti-pollution laws, EPA records show.\n\nA spokesman for W&P Development, Dennis Winkler, said the company later determined that a smaller amount -- 30,000 gallons -- had escaped from a water treatment plant when the river overtopped a berm.\n\nThe third site is Channel Biorefinery & Terminals, where some 80,000 gallons of methanol spilled from a tank rupture into Greens Bayou, which enters the ship channel just downstream of the Magellan terminal. Highly flammable and explosive, methanol can cause brain lesions and other disorders.\n\nThe property, once the site of the nation's largest biofuels refinery, was in violation of federal hazardous waste-management rules the first half of 2017. Texas cited the property's owners for failing to prove they could manage licensed wastes, including oily sludge and petroleum distillates, records show.\n\nDennis Frost, the on-site manager for Gulf Coast Energy, the tenant of Channel Biorefinery, said he and co-workers did their best to prevent the spills.\n\n\"They were impossible to contain,\" he said. \"The water here down by our facility was up over 20 feet.\"\n\nCompanies are required under federal law to report spills to the state and federal government but not to counties, which are the first line of defense against industrial pollution.\n\nHarris County pollution control investigators queried more than 150 plants on Harvey-related spills, but many did not provide estimates.\n\n\"Spill information is provided as a courtesy,\" said Latrice Babin, deputy director of the county's pollution control office. \"Likewise, there is no requirement of notification of evacuation.\"\n\nThe largest spill, by far, was at ExxonMobil Corp.'s Olefins Plant in Baytown, east of the ship channel. Two days after Harvey hit, some 457 million gallons of stormwater mixed with untreated wastewater, including oil and grease, surged into an adjacent creek.\n\nThe spill was not reported to the public. In a water quality report filed with the county and obtained through an open records request, ExxonMobil said \"available information does not indicate any potential danger to human health or safety or the environment.\"\n\nIt did not include results of third-party water testing that the company said had been done. The plant has a history of federal air pollution violations and reported emitting 228 tons of airborne pollutants during Harvey.\n\nOther large spills found in official records include:\n\n-- More than 3,000 pounds of benzene from Royal Dutch Shell PLC's Deer Park complex on the ship channel's south bank. Initially, the company reported a half ton of phenol, which can burn skin and be potentially fatal, was spilled. It later revised that downward to just two pounds.\n\n-- About 34,000 pounds of sodium hydroxide, or lye, which can cause severe chemical burns, and unpermitted airborne emissions, including 28,000 pounds of benzene, from the Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. plant in Baytown, near where thousands of residents live along Cedar Bayou. A spokesman, Bryce Hallowell, said a containment pond kept about 38 percent of the lye from escaping the facility.\n\n-- About 60,000 tons of what Dow Chemical Co. called \"non-hazardous biosolids\" at the company's plant in Deer Park. The company now says that roughly 50 tons of that consisted of biosolids and that the rest was \"primarily\" stormwater.\n\nYvette Arellano of the advocacy group Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services surveyed the area by helicopter on Sept. 4.\n\nShe reported seeing flooded tank farms, fluorescent liquid streaming from Exxon's outfalls, and refineries and chemical plants flaring gas intensely like giant candles.\n\n\"The entire skyscape looked like a birthday cake,\" Arellano said.\n\nAs Harvey bore down on Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott's administration decreed that storm-related pollution would be forgiven as \"acts of God.\" Days later, he suspended many environmental regulations.\n\nOn Sept. 1, just as residents in some areas of Houston started dragging soggy belongings to the curb, the city experienced Texas' worst ozone pollution of the year.\n\nA top city health official emailed the EPA on Sept. 1 with a request marked \"urgent,\" asking for help in determining whether spills and leaks at industrial and Superfund sites threatened the public. Three days later, after getting no response, she emailed again, records obtained in a public information act request show.\n\n\"We are finding alarming levels of benzene in the neighborhood next to Valero . Should EPA evacuate the residents?\"\n\nThere was no record of an EPA email response, though the agency did send a mobile air-monitoring van on Sept. 5.\n\nBy then, Houston had done its own air monitoring, recording a high benzene level of 324 parts per billion -- more than three times the level at which federal worker safety guidelines recommend special breathing equipment. The city was aided by the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, which dispatched a mobile van from California to track the toxic benzene plume.\n\nOn Sept. 7, state investigators took air samples near Valero and reported suffering headaches and dizziness, though they said they found pollutants \"below levels of short-term health and/or welfare concern,\" according to a state report.\n\nThe EPA said it also conducted 28 flights over 12 days beginning Aug. 31 using a plane equipped to evaluate \"unreported or undetected\" chemical releases. It flew over nearly 700 industrial sites, municipal wastewater treatment plants and other facilities, and EPA said it found no pollution exceeding state-permitted levels.\n\nIn at least seven \"status reports\" the EPA and TCEQ posted online from Sept. 3 and Oct. 6, they said all measurements \"were well below levels of health concern.\"\n\nColeman, who retired in January after 29 years with EPA, said he was comfortable with the advisories, saying they were general assessments. \"Were there hotspots? Absolutely,\" he said in a recent interview. \"But on any given day, within some isolated area, there could be a problem.\"\n\nAP and Chronicle reporters asked the EPA and state regulators for a detailed accounting of any soil and water testing they did after Harvey, along with any investigations or sanctions.\n\nThe responses mostly cited online bulletins, in which the EPA said it had assessed all 43 Superfund cleanup sites in the hurricane-affected area and cleared all but one -- the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, which was leaking dioxins. An examination of the 17 state Superfund sites found \"no major issues,\" regulators said.\n\nState officials said they didn't test any sediment that may have been deposited elsewhere by floodwaters. The EPA tested water at an unspecified number of industrial sites but did not disclose results.\n\nWithout elaborating, the state said it had a number of open investigations. The EPA refused to discuss whom it might be investigating, beyond Valero and Arkema.\n\nWith a few exceptions, companies with spills did not call local emergency responders, meaning the public was not informed in real time. Instead, the companies handled the spills in-house, the Chronicle and AP found in surveying local and county fire officials.\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office, which handles countywide emergency response and routinely dispatches a special investigator to major spills, said it was not alerted to 22 of 23 spills that reporters asked about, based on size and potential toxicity.\n\nThe Arkema plant was the exception. Impossible to go unnoticed, its containers of liquid organic peroxides exploded after floodwaters disabled backup generators. Sickened first responders have filed suit, as have Harris and Liberty counties, which claim the company violated numerous environmental and safety regulations.\n\nBob Royall, emergency operations chief for the county's Fire Marshal office, said his agency was alerted to Arkema and the Williams' hydrochloric acid leak but no one informed it at the time of the nearly half-million-gallon Magellan spill.\n\nLike spills on land, unpermitted releases of air toxins are self-reported in Texas -- a state that has long been friendly to heavy industry. As attorney general, prior to being elected governor, Abbott had sued the federal government more than a dozen times to challenge environmental regulations that he deemed over-reaching.\n\nThe governor's Harvey disaster declaration suspended environmental reporting and record-keeping rules as well as liability for unauthorized emissions for the duration of the disaster declaration, which was most recently renewed on March 16. A spokesman for the state environmental agency said the suspensions only apply when rules would hinder disaster response.\n\nAn attorney for the nonprofit Austin-based Environmental Integrity Project said that while federal environmental laws remained in effect, the governor's action essentially put state regulators on the sidelines and made it more difficult to hold polluters accountable. \"The state tied its own hands before it knew the scope or the magnitude or any of the effects of the storm,\" said attorney Ilan Levin.\n\nThe TCEQ itself has a long track record of industry tolerance. State auditors in 2003 found it was late in ordering and collecting fines, giving polluters $25 million a year in discounts. A study by Levin's group found the agency penalized only 3 percent of air pollution incidents reported by all companies statewide from 2011 to 2016.\n\nTwo Texas laws enacted since mid-2015 have weakened counties' ability to police polluters. The first caps at $2.15 million what they can collect from polluters in lawsuits. The rest must go to the state. The second law took effect Sept. 1. It obliges counties to give the state right of first refusal on any pollution enforcement cases, which local officials say could mean less punitive action.\n\n\"Every time we've been able to make something -- you get a large judgment against one of these companies, get some significant process-changing injunctive relief -- they come back around behind us to the legislature,\" said Owens. \"And they have clipped our wings.\"",

                "body": "Singer Harry Belafonte's 1956 album \"Calypso\" is such a classic it's now been inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry. On Wednesday it was one of 25 audio recordings marked for preservation as a representative of America's artistic, cultural and historic treasures. But Belafonte says he never expected it to become such a runaway success.\n\nBelafonte talked to CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers about the honor and what \"Calypso\" means to him.\n\n\"I did it as part of what would become a larger display of the music of various cultures around the world,\" he explained. \"I had had a deep interest in Africa and a deep interest in Latin America, but I got only to 'Calypso' and then the world stopped. I woke up one day and everyone was singing 'Day-O.'\"\n\nIt became the first LP to sell a million copies.\n\nThe irony that \"Banana Boat Song,\" which depicts the daily struggle of Jamaican laborers, became a cheery, crowd-pleasing hit is not lost on Belafonte. The song has special meaning for him.\n\n\"Most of my family in the Caribbean, in Jamaica, were plant workers and harvesting bananas and sugarcane and all the crops,\" he said. \"That was our mainstay and as a kid everybody sang the 'Banana Boat.' Singing was a big part of the culture. It helped with the tediousness of working in the sun all day long.\"\n\nBelafonte was born in New York City, but his parents were immigrants from the Caribbean. Belafonte told CBS \"Sunday Morning\" in 2012 that his family was so poor that his mother sent him and his brother to live for years in her home country of Jamaica, which inspired the Caribbean influence on Belafonte's music.\n\nHe says with fame came responsibility.\n\n\"I wasn't quite prepared for its impact and I sang the song of the laborer coming out of Jamaica,\" he said. \"I wrote a couple songs myself. The first thought was not so much the intensity of the success of the material but I understood the power of it. It's a lot of people listening, but when I saw the power of it, the big question of it for me was, 'What do you do with this platform?'\"\n\nThe success of \"Calypso\" came amidst the Jim Crow era, and Belafonte became a civil rights activist. He met Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on King's historic visit to New York in the early 1950s and the two became close friends. Belafonte worked with King during the civil rights movement, helping organize the 1963 March on Washington.",

I would like to.\" He made the remark while departing a signing ceremony for a memorandum directing the U.S. Trade Representative to impose an estimated $50 billion in tariffs on China.\n\nHis comment also came shortly after news that John Dowd -- a top attorney on Mr. Trump's personal legal team who said it's time for the Russia collusion probe to end -- resigned from the president's personal legal team, CBS News confirmed.\n\n\"I love the president and wish him well,\" Dowd told CBS News.\n\nOn Saturday, Dowd made news when he said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should \"bring an end\" to Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,\" Dowd wrote to CBS News.\n\n\"Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,\" he added.\n\nDowd's departure comes just days after Mr. Trump brought on Joe dieGenova, a former criminal lawyer and federal prosecutor who regularly appears on Fox News, to his personal legal team.\n\nMueller is looking into contacts between Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia and Russian meddling in the presidential election. Mr. Trump has long been frustrated by the lengthy and intensifying probe, and insists his 2016 presidential campaign did not collude with Russia to influence the election in his favor. The president has repeatedly disparaged the special counsel's probe, claiming the investigation may be biased against him.\n\nThe White House has since denied rumors that the president was considering firing Mueller. White House lawyer Ty Cobb said in a statement last week, \"the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.\"",

                "body": "By \"Sunday Morning\" contributing videographer Judy Lehmberg.\n\nOne of the last things I expected to see on my trip to Honduras was a Prothonotary Warbler.\n\nBut on our first full day of our visit, there he was, flitting between bushes at the lodge, looking for insects.\n\nProthonotary warblers are one of the many warblers who migrate from South America to nest in North America. They have nested on our land in southeast Texas, but I most commonly see them at High Island, a small town on the northern Texas coast world renowned among bird watchers as a great spot for spring migrants. There he was, a bird I could easily see at home.\n\nInstead of being disappointed, I was thrilled to see that half-ounce bird on his way to my back yard! The amount of energy he has to expend to travel approximately one thousand miles is amazing, not to mention all the dangers he faces along the way, from wind turbines to loss of habitat.\n\nCentral American hummingbirds are amazingly colorful and acrobatic. We spent one day at a lodge with dozens of hummingbird feeders.\n\nAlthough they are beautiful they are also quite aggressive as they defend their food sources. Several times one hummingbird literally knocked another out of the air, leaving it on the ground apparently unconscious for several moments. All of the victims did eventually wake up and fly off to continue their participation in the hummingbird wars. I've always thought if they weighed 5 pounds, we would all be scared to death of them.\n\nThe white-headed capuchin monkey sometimes rubs plants, ants or millipedes on its hair and skin, possibly as a protection from insects, ticks and parasites. They also use tools, such as sticks to hit snakes who try to catch their babies. One even used a squirrel monkey as a projectile by throwing it at a human. The one we photographed was quietly eating flowers.\n\nA classic rain forest shot of an anole lizard silhouetted on a large leaf.\n\nThe fer-de-lance (French for lance head) is a snake with a nasty reputation. They are poisonous and do account for many snake bites in Central and northern South America, but they are only trying to protect themselves from a much larger threat: us.\n\nI would like to say a huge thank you to Elmer Escoto, our gentle, endearing Honduran guide, and all of the lovely people at the lodge. We did miss a couple of animals I was hoping to see on this trip. That is just another excuse to go back to the wonderful country of Honduras.\n\nJudy Lehmberg is a former college biology teacher who now shoots nature videos.",

For those that choose to opt out, Citi will \"work with them to transition their business away from Citi,\" said Corbat.\n\nCiti has \"few relationships\" with companies that make firearms, and Citi plans a conversation with them to ensure they only sell to retailers that adhere to the new policy.\n\nAnother change in policy targeting gun violence was announced this week by YouTube.\n\nStarting in April, it will prohibit content that promotes the sale of firearms and accessories such as bump stocks. It will also ban videos offering instructions on how to put together guns or outfit the weapons to make them deadlier.\n\nCiti and YouTube made their moves days before the March for Our Lives rally, which is set for Saturday and organized by survivors of the Florida high school shooting on Feb. 14.",

                "body": "U.S. stocks fell sharply on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nPresident Trump signed a memorandum directing the U.S. Trade Representative to impose an estimated $50 billion in tariffs on China, which will take at least 45 days. Investors have worried about rising trade tensions after the administration announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 450 points, or 2 percent, to 24,189, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq index slid 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.\n\nWall Street is also waiting to see how China would respond to any proposed tariffs, and what that might mean for U.S. companies.\n\n\"We think that China's response to the U.S. continuing to take a tougher line on trade might well involve a range of arbitrary non-tariff measures designed to put pressure directly on U.S. firms. These might include implementing much stricter regulatory and compliance checks, or directly instructing Chinese firms to cut orders from the US,\" analysts at Capital Economics said in a note. \"This would directly affect some of the largest firms in the S&P 500, who either produce their goods in, or sell a significant proportion of them to, China.\"\n\nFacebook (FB) shares, which had seen a brief reprieve on Wednesday, were again under pressure in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nThe company is under increasing scrutiny from the government, as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for Facebook's management to testify about the incident.",

                "body": "GREAT MILLS, Md. -- Tuesday's school shooting in southern Maryland that left the shooter dead and two students wounded increasingly appears to be the action of a lovesick teenager. Authorities on Wednesday released a few additional details into the shooting at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County.\n\nAustin Wyatt Rollins, 17, was killed after shooting a schoolmate, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey. A school resource officer got there within a minute and fired a shot at Rollins, but it's not yet clear whether he was killed by the officer's bullet or took his own life.\n\nInvestigators said that they have video of the shooting and that will help them figure out exactly what happened, CBS News justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.\n\nA 14-year-old boy who was shot in the thigh during the encounter was released Wednesday from a hospital.\n\nThe St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday that Rollins and the girl had been in a relationship that recently ended. Authorities had previously only said that the two had had a relationship of some sorts.\n\n\"All indications suggest the shooting was not a random act of violence,\" police said in a statement.\n\nSt. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron said earlier that a precise determination of Rollins' motive may be impossible now that he is dead.\n\nThe girl was still fighting for her life at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center. A fundraising page to help Willey's family has raised more than $54,000.\n\nHospital spokesman Michael Schwartzberg said in an email Wednesday night that she remained in critical condition.\n\nAttempts to reach Rollins' family were unsuccessful.\n\nA day after the eruption of gun violence in one of the sleepy community's schools, the few residents who ventured out amid a snowstorm blanketing the East Coast praised the school resource officer who responded, Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill.\n\n\"He did a very, very good job,\" said Sharon Eglinton, manager of a cafe in nearby Leonardtown.\n\nEglinton, herself a Great Mills alumna, noted that Rollins was by all accounts a good student who had not shown any warning signs. She said she thinks the best way to prevent future school shootings is to install metal detectors at schools.\n\n\"I have no problem paying for it,\" she said. \"If you can protect people getting on a plane with metal detectors, you can protect people in schools.\"\n\nWhile investigators are still determining whether Rollins took his own life or was killed by the officer's bullet, Cameron credited Gaskill with preventing any more loss of life.\n\nCameron said Gaskill, a six-year veteran with SWAT team training, responded within a minute and fired his weapon simultaneously with a final shot fired by Rollins. The officer was unharmed.\n\nGaskill was praised a couple of years ago for his handling of a confrontation with an armed suspect.\n\nA Maryland man was charged in 2016 after he was accused of confronting Gaskill with a gun at an apartment in an incident captured on body camera video. Gaskill can be heard in the video giving several commands to drop the gun before the man eventually complies.\n\nThe Enterprise, a local newspaper, reports Cameron said at the time that Gaskill had \"used exemplary judgment.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said the Glock handgun used in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins' father. In Maryland it is illegal for anyone under age 21 to possess a handgun unless it is required for their employment.\n\nPeople who knew Rollins were trying to make some kind of sense of Tuesday's hometown horror.\n\n\"Never in a million years could I have imagined he would do something like this,\" said Adlai Traver, 18, who attended Great Mills and knew all three kids involved in the shooting. He recalled playing cards with Rollins during band class when the fellow percussionists had a little down time during class. \"I was in the car when I heard it was him. I pulled over and almost puked.\"",

                "body": "House lawmakers have passed a sweeping spending bill in an effort to avoid yet another government shutdown as funding is due to run out midnight on Friday. The bill, passed in a 256-167 vote, will now be sent to the Senate. The omnibus package aims to fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe first major hurdle for the House was passing a procedural measure, which allowed them to vote on the actual text of the omnibus bill. Republican members cheered as it passed in a 211-207 vote, which was closed after there was a narrow majority in support.\n\nNegotiators worked late into Wednesday to hash out any remaining details before the final 2,322-page text of the bill was released. Many members were reluctant to support the procedural vote because the bill was released just 14 hours beforehand, meaning that few would get a chance to actually read the legislation before they began voting for it.\n\nHouse Minority leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to her colleagues urging them to vote no after she made a last-ditch attempt to get the GOP leadership to agree to a vote on immigration legislation, which was not included in the final text of the bill.\n\nRyan said of the measure, \"No bill of this size is perfect, but this legislation addresses important priorities and makes us stronger at home and abroad.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican leadership urged members to voice their support after President Trump signaled he would be willing to back the legislation. Republicans have been pushing for increases in funding for the nation's military and the president's long-promised border wall. Mr. Trump himself suggested he had to \"waste money\" on some Democratic priorities in order to gain wins for his own party in a tweet late Wednesday.\n\nRyan assured reporters ahead of the final vote that \"the president supports this bill - there's no two ways about it.\"\n\n\"I think he liked it,\" added Ryan. \"I think he liked it because the administration asked us for 1.6 billion dollars for the border, for the wall and we got it so he was happy with that.\"",

                "title": "Alabama to execute convicted mail bomber nearly 30 years after crimes",
                "body": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Judge Robert S. Vance was at his kitchen table on Dec. 16, 1989, when he opened a package that had been mailed to his home. The bomb hidden inside exploded with brutal force, killing Vance instantly and severely injuring his wife.\n\nTwo days later, a similar device killed an attorney in Georgia. Two other mail bombs were later intercepted and defused, one at a federal courthouse in Atlanta and the other at an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThe bombings created a wave of terror across the South. Now, nearly 30 years later, Alabama is preparing to execute the man convicted in Vance's killing, Walter Leroy Moody Jr. of Rex, Georgia. Moody is set for lethal injection next month.\n\nThe long-delayed resolution to the old crime comes as Texas officials grapple with a deadly spate of bombings over three weeks that ended Wednesday when the suspect blew himself up.\n\nThe complex investigation that led to Moody's prosecution is a reflection of how difficult it can be to get to the bottom of sporadic bombings like the ones in Texas. And it is also a testament to the lingering effects that such a crime can have.\n\nTom Thurman, who retired from the FBI's crime laboratory after handling cases including the Vance assassination, said bombings are \"more complicated in many aspects\" than other crimes.\n\n\"On the investigative side it's so different from other crimes that involve personal contact,\" he said. \"An individual is there to stab, hit or shoot somebody ... and a lot of times law enforcement is fortune to have someone who was there. In most bombing cases, the person who sets the device or sends it is not there. They've got some anonymity.\"\n\nVance's son, Robert Vance Jr., said he is thankful Moody is in prison, and he feels for the victims in Texas, where two people were killed and four were badly injured by package bombs.\n\n\"I've been in the place of the families down in the Austin area going through this. It's just so frustrating because you don't know who is responsible or why,\" said Vance, now a Democratic state court judge seeking the office of chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.\n\nMoody has always maintained his innocence. Agents arrested him in July 1990 after what leaders called one of the largest federal investigations ever.\n\nRobert S. Vance was a member of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and prosecutors alleged Moody targeted him out of anger at the 11th Circuit's refusal to overturn a conviction that blocked Moody, who had attended law school, from ever practicing law.\n\nThe bomb that killed Robert E. Robinson, a black civil rights attorney from Savannah, Georgia, was meant to cast suspicion on the Ku Klux Klan, as was the bomb sent to the NAACP office, authorities said.\n\nBy reconstructing the two bombs that killed Vance and Robinson and disarming the two others, investigators determined they were wrapped in nearly identical packages and mailed using the same kind of stamps. There were also similarities between the materials used in the bombs, including improvised detonators and wiring methods, Thurman said.\n\nIt's the same with any bombing case, Thurman said: Investigators have to consider a multitude of factors, starting with the components of the device. In Moody's case, the bomb was manufactured in a way that led back to its maker, he said.\n\nAfter Vance's death, officials retrieved an intact bomb from the courthouse that housed 11th Circuit judges in Atlanta. Forensic chemist Lloyd Erwin of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recognized a unique element of its construction from a previous case: The ends of the pipe bomb were made of flat, welded pieces of metal rather than the screw caps most commonly used.\n\nThat tidbit led investigators to Moody, who had been convicted in a 1972 case involving a bomb with flat, welded end pieces.\n\nMoody's former wife testified that she purchased bomb-making materials at his direction, and evidence linked Moody to a manual typewriter with a misplaced \"a'' that experts said had been used to write a letter claiming responsibility for the bombs. One letter talked about a \"declaration of war\" against the judiciary and complained about the 11th Circuit's \"callous disregard for justice,\" court documents show.\n\nA prosecution team led by Louis Freeh, who later became FBI director, convinced a federal jury that Moody was to blame for the bombing wave, and a judge sentenced him to seven life sentences plus 400 years in August 1991.\n\nMoody was convicted on a state capital murder charge in 1996 in Vance's killing, and he has been on death row since 1997. Now 82, he is the oldest inmate awaiting execution in Alabama.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court has set Moody's lethal injection for April 19, but Moody has sent a letter to Vance's son and others claiming he is the innocent victim of a government conspiracy. A federal defender has asked a federal court to block the execution, arguing the state can't execute Moody because he's technically in federal custody. A judge has not yet ruled.\n\nVance said he feels peace \"that justice has been done\" in his father's case, and he doesn't plan to witness Moody's execution. But every new bombing, like the string of blasts in Texas, dredges up old feelings.\n\n\"Usually these days I get up and don't really think about what happened 30 years ago,\" Vance said. \"But when you see that in the media, you go back to December 1989.\"",

These figures, Emmons said, \"were disloyal\" to MBS and were \"agitating against his succession.\"\n\nAccording to The Intercept, Kushner had been briefed on this information in the Presidential Daily Brief before his security was downgraded, and the crown prince has been telling his confidants that Kushner passed on this information.\n\nIt is unclear, however, exactly what information may have been shared between Kushner and the crown prince, according to Emmons, but the two conversed on the secure messaging app WhatsApp.\n\nThe Intercept report comes about a month after Kushner's White House security clearance was downgraded. Emmons says Kushner and MBS' relationship suggests a United States' \"shift to back the new crown prince,\" who Emmons notes has favored aggressive action by the Kingdom against Yemen.\n\nEmmons says that the intelligence community is often left out of Kushner's efforts in international affairs.\n\n\"He's doing this on his own. And a big part of the concern, on the part of not just the State Department, but the U.S. intelligence community, is that they don't know what he's discussing with these foreign leaders.\"",

The statement did not given her mother's age or say where the death occurred. NJ.com reports Owens, a longtime New Jersey resident and teacher, was 69.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that I share the news my mother, Rita Owens, passed away today,\" Latifah said. \"Anyone that has ever met her knows what a bright light she was on this earth. She was gentle, but strong, sweet, but sassy, worldly but pragmatic, a woman of great faith and certainly the love of my life.\"\n\nOwens was diagnosed with heart trouble in 2004. In 2016, Latifah talked about her mother's health issues and said she was shocked when she found out her mother suffered from heart failure. Owens was only in her 50s when she was diagnosed.\n\nLike many, Owens had missed the early symptoms of the disorder, including shortness of breath and unusual fatigue. Latifah said she \"might have caught it sooner\" if she had known what to look for. The experience inspired Latifah to speak out about the illness and work with the American Heart Association to help educate the public about heart disease.\n\nOn Monday, Latifah had asked fans to pray for her mother's recovery.\n\nQueen Latifah, whose real name is Dana Owens, says her mom was \"the love of my life.\"\n\nShe described her mother, who worked as a high school teacher for many years, as gentle, strong, sweet and sassy.\n\nThere was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.",

A notice and comment period will then open up for stakeholder input.\n\nThe Treasury department has until 60 days from memorandum's signing to submit recommendations for a final list of tariffs.\n\nThe tariffs, senior officials say, will be designed to offset \"the gains that the Chinese have received through unfair trade practices.\"\n\nThe memorandum will also direct the Treasury department to make recommendations on restrictions to Chinese investments to the President within 60 days. While the tariffs will be imposed unilaterally, Eissenstat also said that Trump will direct the World Trade organization to \"address China's discriminatory licensing practices.\"\n\nWhite House officials did not specify which products will be targeted by the tariffs but the stock market opened lower on on Thursday morning with investors worried that Trump's actions will trigger retaliatory actions from China.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that China is already preparing measures to hit back at the U.S. by targeting U.S. agricultural exports like soybeans and hogs.\n\nNavarro claimed the administration has tried \"very, very hard to work with the Chinese.\n\n\"Trump did his due diligence in inviting the Chinese to the Mar-a-Lago process and engaged and we went all the way to August trying to resolve these issues through dialogues,\" Navarro told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's, Best Buy and other major retailers released a letter urging the President not to impose tariffs on China arguing that they could \"punish American working families with higher prices on household basics like clothing, shoes, electronics, and home goods.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of commerce also pushed back back in a statement over the weekend to say that tariffs are \"damaging taxes on American consumers.\"\n\nA White House official said that while stakeholder input is \"important and valued,\" dialogue with the Chinese over the past 15 years has been fruitless.\n\n\"China has been well aware of these concerns for many many years so the president has decided that now is the time to take decisive actions,\" the official said.\n\nPresident Trump is reportedly considering aggressive new tariffs and trade restrictions on China, after already announcing stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month.\n\nMr. Trump is making a major announcement on the U.S. Trade Representative's Section 301 investigation, which reviewed whether China has violated U.S. intellectual property rights and technology development. Several media outlets have reported Mr. Trump will announce at least $30 billion in new tariffs on other Chinese imports.\n\nCritics of any new tariffs on Chinese imports fear that would raise the cost of everyday goods for Americans. Mr. Trump's decision to impose those earlier tariffs surfaced intense criticism from members of his own party, and were a contributing factor in the resignation of former chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. But Mr. Trump insists that \"trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" He isn't happy with the $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China.\n\nBut CBS News' Ben Tracy has reported China is already looking to retaliate. The Chinese media Global Times posted a video Thursday showing children talking about a trade war with the U.S. One child says, \"If they have an eye to us, we will cut out that eye.\"",

                "title": "Report: Coal not declining fast enough to meet goals of the Paris climate accord",
                "body": "BILLINGS, Mont. -- Declines in coal power plant construction in China, India and the U.S. are projected to push the heavily-polluting fuel over the edge -- but not fast enough to meet international climate change goals, environmental groups said Wednesday. Coal's dominance as the fuel of choice for generating electricity has been slipping as cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources challenge its decades-long reign.\n\nA joint report by the groups CoalSwarm, Sierra Club and Greenpeace projects that by 2022, retirements of older, more polluting coal plants will outpace new plant construction for the first time in the modern era. The findings are in line with data from the International Energy Agency, which recently declared coal was in a \"decade of stagnation\" with demand declining at a level last seen in the early 1990s.\n\nHaving fewer coal-fired plants would bolster international efforts to move away from the cheap and widely available fuel. Coal accounted for about 70 percent of worldwide power sector emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency estimates.\n\nYet the authors of Wednesday's report and independent analysts agree the pace of decline is still too slow to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord. The 2015 agreement was intended to fend off the worst effects of climate change by holding global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees centigrade (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\"There is no way that we see right now that you can hold to a two-degree centigrade limit like scientists want us to if coal is in the mix,\" said Andy Roberts, global coal research director for the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. \"The wild card in all that is the research dollars being spent in renewable energy...That could be a game changer.\"\n\nIn the U.S., President Donald Trump's vociferous promotion of coal has had at best a modest impact on the industry. Wednesday's report noted that the U.S. currently has no new coal plants under construction.\n\nIn India and China, coal project cancellations have been growing as the world's two most populous nations struggle to clear polluted skies that have had dramatic negative health impacts.\n\nCombined, they've shelved more than 500 gigawatts of coal projects that were once on the drawing board -- equivalent to more than 1,000 coal-burning power units, according to CoalSwarm director Ted Nace.\n\nStill, there are pockets of expected growth, according to Roberts and other observers, with new plants expected to go up in southeast Asia, Turkey and Pakistan.\n\nIn China -- by far the world's largest coal consumer -- the amount of coal that was mined increased about 3 percent in 2017 to reverse a dramatic drop the previous year, according to government figures. That reflects the stance by China's leaders that coal will remain a key piece of its ongoing economic expansion, even as the communist nation has become the world leader in renewable energy development.\n\nPointing to China's example, industry representatives stress that coal remains essential to balancing the global energy budget into the foreseeable future. Potential increases in India and southeast Asia \"will be the driving force of demand for coal in the decades to come,\" said Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association.\n\n\"To put in some context, even with the cancellation of some proposed plants, planned capacity additions in India are still more than three times greater than Germany, a major coal user,\" Sporton said in a statement released by the London-based organization in response to Wednesday's report.\n\nThe group did not directly dispute the claim that coal's growth in the power sector will peak by 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, finding money to build coal plants is getting harder, Roberts said. That's driven in part by some major investors such as pension funds and multinational insurance companies that have pledged to stay away from coal projects because of their air pollution and climate impacts.\n\nThe head of Storebrand Asset Management, Norway's largest private asset manager with more than $90 billion under management, Jan Erik Saugestad said coal investors \"are living on borrowed time\" as institutional money instead pours into solar and wind projects. Storebrand began divesting from coal in 2013.",

If Democrats submit their views, he went on to say, the report will include them. After the intelligence community vets the report and declassifies it, the committee will release a redacted version to the public.\n\nBut the ranking Democratic member of the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, dismissed the GOP's report as \"a fundamentally unserious effort.\"\n\n\"They have altered key findings in the report even within the last week,\" Schiff complained to reporters Thursday. \"It shows the fundamental unseriousness of their endeavor that some of the most important conclusions of the intelligence community and their own work product would change in a matter of days even after they were supposed to have concluded their investigation.\"\n\nSchiff also said that Democrats had a series of motions they wanted to offer, including holding former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt for his refusal \"to answer broad categories of questions.\" Democrats also had another dozen motions to require subpoenas for more documents and for witnesses who declined to answer questions, sometimes over claims of privilege.\n\nEarlier this month the committee officially wrapped up its interviews, and the GOP majority on the committee concluded that it had not found evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians, a finding that Democrats on the committee dispute.\n\nNonetheless, Schiff said that Democrats would submit their views to be included in the report. \"We will also be conducting additional interviews and obtaining additional documents and indeed, that work has never stopped,\" he said.",

Through Wednesday, Facebook shares have lost almost 9 percent from the closing price on Friday, before the data-privacy issues came to light.\n\nAn analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered his price target for Facebook from $265 to $230, saying Zuckerberg's comments aren't likely to fix the situation in the near-term, according to CNBC.\n\n\"There was nothing that could be said to appease the most vocal critics, mainstream backlash will persist as Cambridge Analytica remains in the headlines, and we would expect some impact to near-term platform usage,\" the analyst wrote, according to CNBC.\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote that there was a \"breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us.\"\n\nFacebook is no stranger to data-privacy issues, although investors are asking whether this controversy is different from its previous problems.

                "body": "NEW YORK -- A leading AIDS researcher will be the next director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal government's top public health agency. Dr. Robert Ray Redfield Jr., who rose to prominence in the 1980s as a top researcher into the emerging AIDS epidemic, was named to the post Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.\n\n\"Dr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients,\" Azar said in a statement. Redfield's appointment doesn't need Senate approval, and he'll start at the CDC on Monday.\n\nRedfield, 66, is a medical school professor at the University of Maryland, where he co-founded the Institute of Human Virology. He has extensive experience treating HIV patients as well as heroin addicts and has been praised for his work in Maryland on the opioid crisis.\n\nHis institute has worked on AIDS in Africa, getting $138 million from CDC for its work.\n\nBut Redfield also made headlines more than two decades ago, when he was scrutinized for overstating the effectiveness of an experimental AIDS vaccine. He also has been criticized for being out of step with the public health community on some issues.\n\nPublic health leaders who spoke to The Associated Press about his appointment all voiced hope that he will be able to protect CDC's budget and programs.\n\nRedfield didn't immediately comment on Wednesday's announcement.\n\nThe Atlanta-based CDC investigates disease outbreaks, researches the cause and frequency of health problems, and promotes prevention. Founded in 1946, it is the only federal agency headquartered outside of Washington, D.C., and has nearly 12,000 employees and 10,000 contractors worldwide.\n\nThe agency has total budget of about $12 billion. The Trump administration has proposed slashing that by about $1 billion in the next fiscal year, cutting a wide range of programs.\n\nRedfield will replace Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, a Trump administration appointee who resigned in January after about six months on the job. Fitzgerald, who had previously run Georgia's state health department, was embroiled in unresolved financial conflicts. HHS officials ultimately said her investments were affecting her ability to be involved in issues like cancer and the opioids crisis.\n\nIn the 1980s, Redfield was working at the Defense Department's Walter Reed Institute of Research when he became a leading AIDS researcher. He has been counted as among the first to demonstrate the AIDS virus could spread among heterosexuals, and argued early in the epidemic that AIDS wasn't a threat only to gay men and injection drug users.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Army and a Congressional committee investigated his research into an experimental AIDS vaccine and accusations that he misrepresented study data to make it seem like the vaccine worked. The Army found no evidence of scientific misconduct, but it criticized him for faulty analysis of study data and for an inappropriately close relationship with a conservative lobbying group.\n\nRedfield also drew criticism from public health leaders for endorsing the isolation of infected soldiers, and for calling for mandatory HIV testing of soldiers and health care workers -- even though the CDC and the U.S. surgeon general thought such measures could lead to discrimination and likely wouldn't halt spread of the disease.\n\nRedfield also held views at odds with the public health community regarding the value of condoms and needle exchange programs to stop the spread of the virus, Jon Cohen reported in his 2001 book about the search for an AIDS vaccine, \"Shots in the Dark.\" Cohen noted that in a forward to a 1990 book, Redfield wrote: \"It is time to reject the temptation of denial of the AIDS/HIV crisis; to reject false prophets who preach the quick-fix strategies of condoms and free needles; to reject those who preach prejudice; and to reject those who try to replace God as judge.\"\n\nJeff Levi, a George Washington University health policy expert who was deputy director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy in the mid-1990s, said it was unclear whether Redfield had changed his views.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, cited some of that history in a letter this week to President Donald J. Trump.\n\n\"I hope you will reconsider Dr. Redfield as a candidate for CDC Director and instead seek a candidate whose experience and positions lend credibility to the nation's critical public health work,\" Murray wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday before Dr. Redfield was named to the position, Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, released a statement saying the appointment \"would be disastrous.\"\n\n\"What one wants in a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a scientist of impeccable scientific integrity,\" Lurie wrote. \"What one would get in Robert Redfield is a sloppy scientist with a long history of scientific misconduct and an extreme religious agenda. We urge the administration not to appoint Dr. Redfield.\"\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University professor of global health and long-time HIV researcher, said Redfield has a record of strong scientific achievement. His interest and expertise in the opioid epidemic will be an asset as CDC works on the crisis, del Rio added.\n\n\"We need somebody there who's going to be defending the CDC. Someone who is going to be managing up, to manage the administration, to manage Congress, and to ensure there's adequate funding for CDC,\" del Rio said.\n\nJohn Auerbach, president of Trust for America's Health, a Washington, D.C. based public health research and advocacy organization, said: \"The most important thing is his ability to go into the agency, get up to speed, and make the case for CDC and its vitally important work. If he's able to do that, ultimately that's how his leadership will be judged.\"",

                "title": "\"Intimidating\": Friend describes Austin bombing suspect Mark Conditt",
                "body": "PFLUGERVILLE, Texas - A 23-year-old suspected of planting deadly bombs that struck fear across Austin was described Wednesday by his uncle as a smart and kind \"computer geek\" and a friend said he was an assertive person who would end up being \"kind of dominant and intimidating in conversation.\"\n\nNeither had any idea what might have motivated Mark Anthony Conditt, who authorities say died after detonating a bomb in his sport utility vehicle as officers moved in for an arrest near Austin. The attacks in the Texas capital and suburban San Antonio killed two people and wounded four others.\n\n\"I mean this is coming from nowhere. We just don't know what. I don't know how many ways to say it but everyone is caught off guard by this,\" Conditt's uncle, Mike Courtney of Lakewood, Colorado, told The Associated Press.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday evening, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said he considers a 25-minute recording on a cellphone found with Conditt a \"confession,\" in which Conditt talks in great detail about the differences among the bombs he built.\n\nBut Manley suggested that there might never be a clear motive, noting where the explosives were placed or addressed seems random. CBS affiliate KEYE reports that a package dropped off at FedEx by Conditt on Sunday was labeled as being sent by \"Kelly Killmore\" to an address in South Austin that does not exist. The package was found by law enforcement on Tuesday and did not explode.\n\nConditt grew up in Pflugerville, a suburb just northeast of Austin where he was still living just a few miles from his parents' home after moving out. On Wednesday, authorities recovered homemade explosives from inside the residence, which he shared with roommates.\n\nConditt's family said in a statement they had \"no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in.\"\n\nConditt was the oldest of four children who were all home-schooled.\n\nJeff Reeb, a neighbor of Conditt's parents in Pflugerville for about 17 years, said he watched Conditt grow up and that he always seemed \"smart\" and \"polite.\" Reeb, 75, said Conditt and his grandson played together into middle school and that Conditt regularly visited his parents, whom Reeb described as good neighbors.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Conditt's mother sent a text message to a friend on Wednesday asking her to pray for the family.\n\nConditt attended Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012 and was a business administration major, but he did not graduate, according to college spokeswoman Jessica Vess. She said records indicate that no disciplinary actions were made against Conditt.\n\nAlthough he worked for a time at an area manufacturing company, Gov. Greg Abbott told KXAN-TV in Austin that Conditt apparently was unemployed more recently and had no criminal record.\n\nConditt left little discernable trace on social media. Aside from a few photos of him on his family's Facebook pages, he addressed a range of topics in an online blog he created in 2012. Vess said he had created the blog as part of a U.S. government class project.\n\nIn the blog titled \"Defining my Stance\" he gives his opinion on several issues, often in response to commentary by someone else. Conditt wrote that gay marriage should be illegal, argued in favor of the death penalty and gave his thoughts on \"why we might want to consider\" eliminating sex offender registries.\n\nOf gay marriage, Conditt wrote: \"Homosexuality is not natural. Just look at the male and female bodies. They are obviously designed to couple.\"\n\nIn the \"about me\" section of the blog, Conditt wrote that he wasn't \"that politically inclined,\" saying he viewed himself as conservative but didn't think he had enough information \"to defend my stance as well as it should be defended.\" He said he hoped the class would help him do that.\n\nA friend of Conditt described him as smart, opinionated and often intimidating. Jeremiah Jensen, 24, told the Austin American-Statesman that he was close to Conditt in 2012 and 2013. Jensen said they were both home-schooled and he would often go to the Conditt home for lunch after church on Sundays and they attended Bible study and other activities together.\n\n\"I have no idea what caused him to make those bombs,\" Jensen told the newspaper .\n\nHe called Conditt a \"deep thinker.\"\n\n\"When I met Mark, he was really rough around the edges,\" Jensen said. \"He was a very assertive person and would ... end up being kind of dominant and intimidating in conversation. A lot of people didn't understand him and where he was coming from. He really just wanted to tell the truth. What I remember about him he would push back on you if you said something without thinking about it.\"\n\nHe said \"the kind of hate that he succumbed to\" was not what Conditt believed in during high school.\n\n\"I don't know what happened along the way,\" Jensen said.\n\nJensen said Conditt had attended regular church services at Austin Stone Community Church but he didn't know if Conditt \"held onto his faith.\" A spokesman for the church said no records of past engagement or past involvement by Conditt were found.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the suspect matched the FBI's initial profile suspicion that the bomber was likely a white male. But McCaul said a psychological profile probably won't be known until investigators go through Conditt's writings and social media postings.",

                "title": "Wired editor on his conversation with Zuckerberg and whether apology is enough",
                "body": "Wired editor-in-chief Nicholas Thompson has covered Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg extensively. For its March issue, the magazine featured a bloodied and bruised Zuckerberg on its cover along with a lengthy piece that goes inside the social media giant's effort to fix everything that's gone wrong over the last two years. So it's somewhat surprising that when Zuckerberg broke his silence on the company's latest disaster on Thursday - the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal - he decided to speak to Thompson.\n\n\"I think he thought that story was tough but fair. I don't know the internal conversations they had. All I know is that yesterday I got a note from Facebook saying we might have an executive available for you,\" Thompson told \"CBS This Morning\" Thursday.\n\nLater that afternoon he spoke to Zuckerberg via video conference. The CEO had not yet responded publicly to days of damaging reporting about how the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which has links to President Trump's 2016 campaign, acquired data on 50 million Facebook users from an app created by a third-party research firm.\n\nIn his conversation with Thompson, Zuckerberg admitted to two specific mistakes.\n\n\"When they learned about it in 2015, they should have run a forensic audit. Instead they asked for legal certification, which is basically like, 'Hey, did you guys delete it?' 'Yeah we deleted it, we'll sign a form.' They should have investigated and looked at all the computers. The second mistake...was the prioritization of portability over privacy,\" Thompson said.\n\nPortability of data, he explains, makes it easy to create more Facebook apps and features for users to enjoy.\n\nOn the other hand, \"If you prioritize privacy, there's much lower risk and much lower downside. The country hasn't really prioritized privacy over the last 10 years. It turns out though, [the] privacy line that America doesn't like to cross is when your data is used in politics,\" Thompson said.\n\nOne of the things Zuckerberg told Thompson was that he had underestimated the importance of privacy to the Facebook community over user experience.\n\nThompson said the public uproar over the Cambridge Analytica scandal caught Facebook off guard. It was only after the headlines persisted day after day that the company realized it had a disaster on its hands. That's when Zuckerberg finally admitted a \"breach of trust\" and announced steps the company is taking to try to regain trust.\n\n\"I thought his mea culpa was strong and I thought it was the right thing to do,\" Thompson said. \"Who knows whether they've done enough to undo the damage? And then there's the larger question of whether structurally Facebook can be changed in such a way that this doesn't happen again.\"",

Maybe, I could make the argument intellectually. But I don't have a visceral -- I'm not in love with that anymore.\"\n\nWhat he does love, he says, is writing, which he does in longhand, not on a computer.\n\n\"Bob Honey\" is about a septic tank salesman-turned-assassin who kills people with a mallet. Among his other actions, Honey sends a letter containing a veiled threat to a fictional president.\n\nDoes he worry people won't get the joke? \"You know, some people are gonna get this book and some people are not going to get this book,\" Penn said. \"Some people, I think, will really enjoy it, others will loathe it. And that really is what I'd like to say about me, you know?\"\n\nPenn also talks with Smith about his ongoing philanthropic efforts to help rebuild Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, and of personally going to New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.\n\nHe also discusses his infamous interview with then-escaped drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman; his legal battle with producer Lee Daniels; life after acting; and what advice he might give to his younger self.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning program, hosted by Jane Pauley, is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET.

                "body": "MIAMI -- The South Florida parents of a newborn baby girl are in the midst of a shocking custody battle after the baby, born to a Miccosukee mother and a white father, was taken from them at the hospital just two days after her birth, CBS Miami reports. Ingrid Ronan Johnson was born at Baptist Hospital in Kendall, Florida, on March 16 to Rebecca Saunders and Justin Johnson, who are both distraught over the series of events.\n\nSaunders mother, Betty Osceola, did not want Johnson to be a part of the child's life. The parents claim that Osceola got a Miccosukee tribal court judge to grant her custody of the baby without the parents' consent or knowledge.\n\nTwo days after the baby's birth, police detectives from the Miccosukee police force showed up at the hospital with a court order to remove the baby.\n\n\"A police officer and a few security guards came in the room, asking me if I knew what was going on and I said, 'I don't know what going on,'\" Saunders said. \"He told me I no longer have custody of my daughter.\"\n\nThe hospital allowed the baby to be taken without providing a copy of the court order, according to Saunders.\n\nNow, nobody knows where the baby and her grandmother are.\n\n\"This is a woman who numerous times has told Rebecca straight to her face 'I'll shoot that white man,'\" Johnson said of Osceola. \"But I didn't think she was evil enough to do something like this to her own daughter.\"\n\nSaunders said Osceola lives off the reservation, in Collier County. If the baby is on the Miccosukee reservation itself, the state has no power -- only federal authorities have jurisdiction there.\n\nThe parents have filed complaints with Miami-Dade police, state prosecutors and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n\"I'm still trying to wrap my head around how this has happened,\" Johnson, 36, said tearfully to CBS Miami's news partner, the Miami Herald. \"I can't even begin to explain how hard this has been. I don't see how people of the Miccosukee tribe can look me in the face and tell me this is OK.\"\n\n\"I feel like I have no rights,\" Saunders told the Herald. \"I thought the tribe was to protect its people, not use its own rulings to control its people.\"\n\nMiami-Dade Director Juan J. Perez said his department had initiated an immediate inquiry into what happened.\n\n\"Upon being made aware of this incident, I have directed the command staff of the involved districts to conduct an immediate inquiry into the matter. Once we have additional information, we can determine what, if any, additional steps are necessary. The Miami-Dade Police Department remains committed to the highest performance standards, ethical conduct, and truthfulness in all relationships,\" Perez wrote in a statement.\n\nLate Wednesday, Senator Marco Rubio tweeted, using the word \"kidnapping\" while issuing the tribe a warning.\n\nThe incident is the latest test of the legal authority of the court and police department with the sovereign Miccosukee tribe, which has clashed with state authorities for years over jurisdiction.\n\nInvestigators and the child's parents also have questions for Baptist Hospital, which allowed tribal police to remove the baby from her birth mother.\n\n\"For the hospital to hide behind, to say 'we saw an order from the tribal court' ... we're not on tribal property,\" attorney Brad Cohen said. \"A tribal police officer has no jurisdiction outside of tribal property. We don't know whether or not Miami-Dade escorted him or they came after the fact, but for the hospital to hide behind that is the most disgusting display that I've seen in a very long time.\"\n\nA hospital spokesman declined to comment because of federal patient privacy laws.\n\nOn Wednesday, Baptist Hospital gave the following statement to CBS Miami:\n\n\"On Sunday, March 18, at approximately 11 a.m., two Miami-Dade County Police officers arrived on our campus with officers from the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida to enforce a court order regarding a child's custody. We obeyed law enforcement. Baptist Hospital falls under the jurisdiction of the Miami-Dade County Police Department and complies with state and federal laws. It is our hospital's policy to cooperate with Miami-Dade law enforcement as they enforce court orders.\n\n\"Due to patient privacy laws, we cannot comment on the specific details of any patient care.\"\n\nNo one else involved in the case, including the tribe's legal adviser, and the office of Miccosukee chairman Billy Cypress, returned phone calls or emails seeking comment.\n\nMiami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle said her office is reviewing the case.\n\nSaunders has two other children, an 11-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter from a previous relationship who live on the Seminole reservation with her brother. Saunders said her mother was upset that Johnson was at the hospital during the birth of his daughter and claims Osceola threatened to take her kids away.\n\nOne day after Ingrid's birth, a nursing supervisor told Johnson \"they had received phone calls that it would be in their best interest to have me removed,\" Johnson told the Herald.\n\nHe did leave, then the next day, two Miccosukee police detectives walked in with hospital security and staff and told Saunders, 'Your baby is being taken. She is no longer in your custody. You are not the mother anymore,'\" Saunders recalled.\n\nShe identified the lead detective as Michael Gay, whom state records show has been with the tribal department since 2009. He could not be reached for comment. According to Sanders, he did not have a copy of the Miccosukee court order stripping her of custody of the newborn.\n\nHe also said if she went to the reservation, she would need to enter drug rehab. \"I asked him for what. I don't do drugs,\" Saunders said.\n\nThe detectives left. Within minutes, she said, hospital security and uniformed Miami-Dade police officers escorted her out of the hospital; it is unclear who called the county officers, or if they knew the specifics of the tribal conflict.\n\n\"Last time I saw my daughter was the last time I got to hold her and that was Saturday,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson picked up Saunders and the two immediately went to file a report at the Hammocks district police station.\n\nIt was not until Monday that the tribal court emailed Saunders a copy of the legal documents.\n\nA petition filed by Osceola alleged that Saunders' autistic son had suddenly revealed that the parents had struck him -- something both parents vehemently deny. The order stripping custody does not say Saunders did anything wrong, but stressed it is in the \"best interest\" of all three children that they remain in the custody of Osceola.\n\nFormer Miccosukee Police Chief Dave Ward, who is not involved in the case, said tribal court orders are not valid outside the reservation.\n\n\"In my opinion, the Miccosukee officers needed to present the tribal order to a state or federal judge in Dade, who would review it and issue an order allowing Miami-Dade police to follow through with removing the baby.\"\n\nWard also said he believed the hospital opened itself up to liability by allowing the child to be removed.",

                "title": "Justice Sotomayor instructed to avoid website of party involved in argument",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Justice Sonia Sotomayor was only following the lead of her chief during Tuesday's arguments over crisis pregnancy centers when she said she visited the website of one of the centers involved in the Supreme Court case.\n\nWhen Chief Justice John Roberts did something similar seven years ago, no one uttered a peep. But after Sotomayor's comment, Justice Anthony Kennedy piped up.\n\n\"Well, in this case I didn't go beyond the record to look on the internet because I don't think we should do that,\" Kennedy said.\n\nGoing beyond the record, in legal terms, refers to material that is not part of the court record and so untested by the adversarial process.\n\nBut sticking to the record in Supreme Court cases can sometimes be more of a notion than a hard-and-fast rule.\n\nIn a case on campaign contribution limits in 2011, Roberts said he consulted the website of one of the parties to the case that morning and asked a question about what he saw. During arguments in 2016 over a Texas law that restricted abortion clinics, Justice Samuel Alito made use of an article from the Huffington Post. Justice Stephen Breyer will sometimes begin a question by saying he had his clerks look something up.\n\nAnd even Supreme Court opinions sometimes go outside the record. In a 2012 opinion in an immigration dispute between Arizona and the Obama administration, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote about comments President Barack Obama made at a news conference discussing the just-unveiled plan to protect young immigrants from deportation.\n\nIn 2007, Kennedy himself cited anecdotal evidence in a supporting brief from 181 women who said they were injured by abortion in his opinion for the court upholding a federal ban on a procedure called partial-birth abortion by its opponents. \"While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow,\" Kennedy wrote, referencing the women's brief.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticized Kennedy for reaching a result that was not supported by the extensive record developed in the lower courts. She said the court was invoking \"an antiabortion shibboleth for which it concededly has no reliable evidence: Women who have abortions come to regret their choices, and consequently suffer from \"(s)evere depression and loss of esteem.\"\n\nThe justices can deal with an execution and a case related to abortion in the same day, as happened this week. But neither qualifies as the court's hardest topic, Breyer said.\n\n\"Family law is the most difficult subject I think there is. It's horrible, human, terrible,\" he said during arguments Monday in a divorce case. \"It's really difficult.\"\n\nThe justices were discussing the breakup of Minnesota residents Mark Sveen and Kaye Melin. When the two ended their 10-year marriage in 2007, a 16-page document spelled out how they'd divide up their assets. He got their Ford F350 truck and a 1997 Nissan pickup truck, for example. She got a 2004 Pontiac Grand Am, a snowmobile and an ATV.\n\nBut it's not clear what Sveen thought about one important question: Should Melin remain the beneficiary of his life insurance policy, now worth more than $180,000? The state of Minnesota thought it answered the question for the exes. A 2002 state law says that when a couple divorces, the ex-spouse is automatically removed as the life insurance beneficiary. About 30 states have similar statutes.\n\nSveen died in 2011 and never changed the primary beneficiary on his policy. Sveen's children from a previous marriage say Minnesota's law makes the money theirs. Melin says it's hers. The law can't apply to the policy because it was purchased before the law was written, she says.\n\nThe justices seemed inclined to side with Sveen's children.\n\nWednesday's Supreme Court arguments pulled back the curtain on another aspect of high court cases not often discussed in public: How the Justice Department decides which side to back.\n\nThe Solicitor General's office, which handles Supreme Court cases, basically auditions both sides, listening to and questioning their arguments before deciding whether to intervene and how.\n\nThe topic Wednesday was tribal sovereignty in the context of a property dispute between an Indian tribe and a couple in Skagit County, Washington, about 100 miles north of Seattle.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan credited the lawyer for the couple with presenting a new and perhaps stronger rationale for why his client should win.\n\nRoberts was willing to acknowledge the legal prowess of the couple's lawyer, Eric Miller. But Roberts, once the deputy solicitor general, said proper credit goes to the Justice Department, which first raised the argument Miller was making.\n\nMiller sensibly agreed with Roberts, but Kagan didn't. She served as solicitor general before joining the court.\n\n\"Did that happen because you had a conversation with the solicitor general in which the solicitor general knew which sort of arguments you were going to make?\" she asked amid laughter in the courtroom.\n\nApparently not one to contradict a justice, Miller again agreed: \"We had a conversation with the solicitor general.\"\n\nAs it turned out, the Justice Department is backing the tribe.",

Authorities say 21-year-old Christopher Barlow took photos of patients while volunteering with Easton EMS.\n\nHe is also suspected of placing a hidden camera inside a bathroom at the EMS building.\n\nPolice arrested the man Wednesday and charged him with two counts of voyeurism.\n\nAuthorities say Barlow is facing additional charges in connection with the theft of two firearms from a co-worker, providing a false statement on a firearm application and forging documents to present himself as an Easton police officer.\n\nBarlow was indicted on similar charges last year after police in Massachusetts said he falsely claimed to be a Homeland Security agent and stockpiled guns, ammunition and explosives.\n\nHe was released on bail on those charges on Feb. 16 after a judge denied a prosecutor's request that he be held for dangerousness, CBS Boston station WBZ-TV reports.\n\nBarlow was given a GPS tracking device and told not to leave a family member's home in Kingston, Massachusetts.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz announced that Barlow wasn't following orders. Barlow was leaving the family member's home and going to shopping centers and at least one school, Cruz said.\n\nA judge denied a prosecutor's request to revoke Barlow's bail.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barlow was released on $25,000 bond on the Connecticut charges and was scheduled be back in court next month, CBS Hartford affiliate WFSB-TV reports.",

                "body": "UNITED NATIONS - World Water Day is celebrated at the U.N. as a call to action to recognize that fresh water is not something to take for granted.\n\n\"More than 2 billion people lack access to safe water, and more than 4.5 billion people lack adequate sanitation services,\" Secretary General Antonio Guterres told member states at the launch of an event, \"Water for Sustainable Development.\"\n\n\"By 2050 at least one in four people will live in a country where the lack of fresh water is chronic or recurrent,\" Guterres said, adding that 40% of the world's population is affected by water scarcity, 80% of wastewater is discharged untreated into the environment, and 90% of disasters are water-related.\n\nThe events of World Water Day follow a new joint report by the World Bank and the U.N. that says that 40 percent of the world's population is affected by water scarcity.\n\nTo add to the calls for reform, the day at the U.N. is set to crescendo at dusk with an interactive art display by Daan Roosegaarde, called \"Waterlicht,\" with lights and video projected on the iconic U.N. plaza, designed to show a virtual flood.\n\nBut intense storms bring back difficult memories for some at the U.N.: During Hurricane Sandy, which occurred in October 2012, the historic U.N. Headquarters sustained flooding to the basement and air circulation system.\n\nAnd because of the fourth Nor'easter in three weeks, several speakers slated to appear for World Water Day were unable to attend, stuck in the flood of cancelled flights, an irony of climate-related problems not lost on the participants.\n\nThe President of the General Assembly, Miroslav Lajčák, is stranded in Bratislava, Slovakia. His flight was cancelled due to the snowy weather in New York City, Brenden Varma, Spokesperson for the General Assembly President said, adding that the President's statement was delivered by Mahmoud Saikal, Vice-President of the General Assembly and Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations.\n\nAnother cancellation because of the weather was rapper and record producer, Armando Christian Pérez, aka \"Pitbull,\" who was on the agenda as a water activist, but whose flight was cancelled, Varma said.\n\nBut, despite the difficulties related to climate, the show went on.\n\nLajčák's message on Thursday was a warning: \"We must grapple with the prospect that, very soon, there might not even be enough of it to go around. Because, our water resources are in grave danger.\"\n\nHe said that population growth is depleting supplies and that rainfall patterns are changing, \"not for the better.\"\n\n\"The damage we have done to the environment is affecting our climate, and intensifying water-related disasters - including famines, floods and droughts.\"\n\n\"There are a number of factors that are responsible for the shortage of drinking water: Climate change is one of them,\" Dan Shepard, information officer with the U.N. Department of Public Information, told CBS News, adding, \"The mismanagement, misuse and the failure to properly value water are others.\"\n\nThe main host of the U.N. events is the Mission of the Netherlands, where Special Water Envoy Henk Ovink and Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaag were on the agenda to speak about the Dutch experience.\n\n\"Worldwide, water is the connecting issue, the number one global risk and the opportunity for comprehensive cultural change,\" Ovink said.\n\nThe Office of the President of the General Assembly will be projecting water-related images and messages onto the U.N. building after the sun sets. \"The goal is to highlight how critical water is to sustainable development, to the health of our planet and to all of our lives,\" Varma said\n\n\"It is an issue with real security and development implications, and the Dutch have managed this well,\" Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.\n\nAlso introducing innovation in water is the Israel Mission to present the latest water solutions from the public and the private sectors in Israel. \"Israel is a country which overcame water-scarcity,\" Ambassador Danny Danon said.\n\nGuterres outlined a plan to improve the lack of water, that is, to transform the silo-based approach to water supply, sanitation, water management and disaster risk reduction in order to \"tackle water stress, combat climate change and enhance resilience.\"",

An announcement was also posted on his website.\n\nAvruch played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970, a clown character particularly popular in the U.S. in the 1960s because of widespread franchising in television.

                "body": "PARKLAND, Fla. -- When Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students return from spring break, they'll be required by the local school district to use clear backpacks and wear identification badges at all times. Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie told parents in a two-page letter about the security changes. It said the backpacks will be given to students at no cost when they return to school on April 2.\n\nRuncie also noted that metal detectors may soon be installed at the school in Parkland, Florida, where a teenager who carried an assault weapon in a large bag killed 17 people on Valentine's Day.\n\nParents district-wide were told reinforced safety protocols will include expediting \"single point entry\" measures for visitors, locking all classroom doors and upgrading surveillance systems.\n\nMeanwhile, already heightened security will be bolstered at the school on Thursday. Florida Gov. Rick Scott ordered eight highway patrol troopers to assist with securing the grounds -- a step that came after the shooting suspect's brother was arrested there, two students were caught carrying knives and another made online threats.\n\nThe troopers will be stationed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School indefinitely along with Broward County deputies, leaving an armed guard at every campus entrance point, Scott said in a statement. Before the shooting, the school was patrolled by one armed deputy and unarmed guards. An unspecified number of deputies, some armed with rifles, were added after the school reopened.\n\n\"Parents, students and teachers have recently endured one of the worst tragedies in Florida history,\" Scott said. \"They must be assured that every necessary step is being taken to increase safety and ensure no unauthorized people are allowed on campus.\"\n\nThe strengthened security comes three days after suspect Nikolas Cruz's younger brother, Zachary Cruz, was arrested on trespassing charges. Deputies said he was found Monday riding his skateboard on campus after dismissal after being told to stay away.\n\nZachary Cruz, 18, is being held on $500,000 bond and Broward County Judge Kim Theresa Mollica has approved a search of his home for weapons. The Broward Sheriff's Office wants him barred from possessing firearms and also involuntarily hospitalized for a mental health evaluation under a state law passed after the Feb. 14 shooting spree that killed 17.\n\nZachary and Nikolas, 19, both attended Stoneman Douglas. They shared the same biological mother but had different fathers. Both were adopted at very young ages by Roger and Lynda Cruz, who moved them into their Parkland home. Lynda Cruz died in November and their father died some years earlier.\n\nIn a separate case, Mollica imposed a $12,500 bail Wednesday on Jordan Salter, a Stoneman Douglas student who officials say pulled a small knife on a boy who she says was harassing her and a friend. The SunSentinel reports that Salter attorney Brian Reidy called the high bond \"out of control\" and \"ridiculous\" at a hearing and blamed it on fear from last month's rampage.\n\n\"I don't know when we all hit the fear button when everything is such an absolute emergency,\" Reidy told the judge.\n\nSalter, 18, was one of two students arrested recently for bringing a knife to school.\n\nIn another case, a 10th grader who was not identified \"was removed from class for posting pictures on Snapchat depicting a handgun in his waistband and numerous bullets.\" BSO said the student stated the picture was \"of a BB gun and the bullets were his father's.\" The student \"...goes by a gamer tag name he created called, 'NickCruz'. He uses this gamer tag in the game Fortnite.\" The student has been committed for a psychological evaluation.\n\nIn yet another incident, BSO announced this week that Deputy Moises Carotti was suspended with pay after a student notified the school he was asleep in his patrol unit.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida residents won't get a chance to vote this fall on adding gun control restrictions to the state constitution. A state panel on Wednesday rejected several proposed restrictions on procedural grounds. A majority of the Florida Constitution Revision Commission voted that the gun control measures were out of order and couldn't be considered under commission rules. The commission is allowed to propose changes to the state constitution.\n\nElsewhere, several media organizations including The Associated Press asked a judge to determine if additional surveillance video from the school shooting should be released. Last week, the Broward Sheriff's Office released a 27-minute video depicting ex-deputy Scot Peterson's actions remaining outside the building where the shooting took place.\n\nNickolas Cruz's attorney has said he will plead guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder if prosecutors will waive the death penalty, which they have refused to do.",

                "title": "Sen. John Kennedy calls Cambridge Analytica data mining the \"definition of creepy\"",
                "body": "Senator John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, is calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to sit down with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to provide insight into just what he knew about Cambridge Analytica's alleged misuse of data from Facebook's users. Kennedy told \"CBS This Morning\" that the harvesting of user data is \"getting into the foothills of creepy.\"\n\n\"I appreciate Mr. Zuckerberg finally saying something and I appreciate his apology but that's not enough. We need to sit down and visit. I'm not looking to regulate him to death, but I can tell you this, the issue isn't going away,\" said Kennedy.\n\nHe added, \"The issue is not whether Mr. Zuckerberg knew, the issue is whether he should have known. The issue is whether, and I'm not saying they were, whether the company was negligent or reckless, how serious are they taking data protection, how serious are they vetting their advertisers.\"\n\nWhile the Senate has previously heard social media representatives testify on how they are safeguarding user information in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Kennedy called the congressional hearing a \"waste of our time.\" He said lawyers for companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google \"dodged\" lawmakers' questions and provided few details into how they are preparing against future attempts of foreign actors abusing their sites in the hopes of sowing dissension and manipulating the U.S. election process.\n\n\"I would like to see Mr. Zuckerberg - not his lawyer, Mr. Zuckerberg in the flesh - come and talk with us,\" he said. \"Let me ask him a few questions. To what extent, if any, when we go on Facebook, are we living in a contrived world created by Facebook's algorithms? ... I would like to know to what extent has Facebook been a good steward of our data.\"\n\n\"And I guess the overarching question is how can we preserve the good things about Facebook, and there are good things, while at the same time stopping the corrosive effects.\"\n\nAs for politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz and President Trump using Cambridge Analytica in their campaigns, Kennedy noted that many candidates from both parties - including former President Obama, who pioneered the practice - have harnessed the power of Facebook to reach potential voters.\n\n\"Plenty of politicians use Facebook to articulate their message. Nothing wrong with that. And I'm not saying Cambridge Analytica did the right thing here, it certainly looks like they're part of the definition of creepy. But the issue is bigger than just one media consultant abusing Facebook. I want to know if there have been other cases of abuse. I want to know how they're protecting our data. I want to know how they're going to stop the Russians from interfering with our midterm elections.\"\n\nKennedy called Facebook a \"wonderful company\" that has grown into a virtual country with enormous power.\n\n\"Facebook does many good things, it does in some respects bring in us closer together, but in other respects we have discovered it pushes us apart, and particularly the data - the amount of data being collected, how the data is being used, whether its being used with our consent,\" he said.",

                "title": "Bratz toy maker's CEO wants to salvage Toys \"R\" Us",
                "body": "Isaac Larian, the CEO of the company that makes Bratz dolls, has a plan to save Toys \"R\" Us.\n\nHe and other investors have pledged a total of $200 million in financing and hope to raise four times that amount in crowdfunding in order to bid for up to 400 of the Toys \"R\" Us stores being liquidated in bankruptcy.\n\nThe unsolicited bid still faces many hurdles, including finding other deep-pocked investors and getting a bankruptcy judge to agree to it. But this is the first public plan to keep the cherished toy brand in existence in the United States.\n\nSuch a long-shot move would also greatly benefit Larian's primary business. He's CEO of Bratz doll-maker MGA Entertainment, which relies on Toys \"R\" Us for nearly 1 in every 5 sales.\n\nToys \"R\" Us fell prey to a crushing debt load of $5 billion stemming from its 2005 leveraged buyout by private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR (KKR), and real estate investor Vornado Realty Trust (VNO). The ill-timed deal saddled the retailer with loans as shoppers shifted their spending away from big-box stores to Amazon.com and other internet rivals.\n\nLarian says he and the other investors, which he declined to name, believe salvaging part of the Toys \"R\" Us business will be good for the toy industry, customers and workers. They're interested in more than half the 735 U.S. stores Toys \"R\" Us plans to liquidate, and want to be able to use the valuable brand name.\n\nAnd they're hoping the outpouring of affectionate nostalgia when Toys \"R\" Us announced its plans -- #SaveToysRUs has been a trend on social media -- translates into pledges toward their $1 billion goal.\n\nToys \"R\" Us sought court approval last week to liquidate its remaining U.S. stores, threatening the jobs of some 30,000 employees and spelling the end for a chain known to generations of children and parents for its sprawling stores, sing-along jingle and Geoffrey the giraffe mascot.\n\nThe store has an iconic place in American culture, said Larian. \"We can't just sit back and just let it disappear.\" Larian, who is a billionaire, is using his own money, not MGA funds, for the bid.\n\nWhy might Larian be successful with a retail chain struggling to stay relevant in the age of Amazon? For one thing, Larian wouldn't have the massive $5 billion in debt that hampered the current owner of Toys R Us. He also says the toy industry needs a big chain like Toys \"R\" Us, where children can touch and feel the toys and toymaker's can test new products.\n\nThe chain's liquidation will have a \"devastating effect\" on the toy industry, said Larian, who estimates that 130,000 jobs in the U.S. could be lost when you include layoffs at suppliers and logistic operations. He said a total Toys \"R\" Us liquidation could mean MGA would have to lay off workers at an Ohio plant that makes the Little Tikes toy vehicles. That brand accounts for 25 percent of MGA total sales, and Larian says only Toys \"R\" Us really had enough room to display the cars. It's harder to ship such bulky items on Amazon.\n\nThe Toys \"R\" Us troubles have hurt big toy makers like Mattel and Hasbro, which have been key suppliers to the chain. MGA, based in Van Nuys, California, is the world's largest privately held toy company. The planned liquidation would have a bigger impact on smaller toy makers that rely more on the chain for sales.\n\n\"People do not realize the hole that can't be filled by other retailers,\" said Larian, noting that Toys \"R\" Us accounts for 18 to 19 percent of MGA's worldwide sales. \"The pipeline is too big.\"\n\nLarian claims that if 400 U.S. Toys \"R\" Us stores are salvaged, he could save one-third of the 130,000 jobs.\n\nThe planned closure of the U.S. Toys \"R\" Us stores over the coming months will finalize the downfall of the chain that succumbed to heavy debt and relentless trends that undercut its business, from online shopping to mobile games.\n\nWhen the chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last fall, it pledged to stay open. But after what CEO David Brandon called a \"devastating\" holiday shopping season, Toys \"R\" Us announced in January it would close 182 stores, and then last week that it would liquidate.\n\nThe company said last week it's trying to bundle its Canadian business with about 200 U.S. stores and find a buyer. Larian has personally aligned with another investor in a separate bid for those operations, though he declined to specify the value of it.\n\nToys \"R\" Us is also likely to liquidate its businesses in Australia, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain. It's already shuttering its business in the United Kingdom. That would leave it with the stores in Canada, as well as in central Europe and Asia. It operates more than 700 stores outside the United States.",

                "title": "Chase rarely lends to minorities in one major U.S. city",
                "body": "Across the street from the White House is the U.S. capital's only outpost of the nation's largest bank -- tucked away on the ninth floor of a grey stone tower.\n\nThe bank's name, JPMorgan Chase & Co., appears on the directory in the building's lobby. According to the company's website, the office features \"a team of dedicated specialists\" who offer a \"comprehensive range of financing choices, including mortgages and lines of credit.\"\n\nBut the office is not open to the public. Stop by and security will turn you away. And while the bank has a team of professionals designed to serve the district's rich, it is not technically a branch. So, in Washington, Chase doesn't have to abide by the Community Reinvestment Act -- a 1977 law designed to reverse the legacy of redlining, or racial discrimination in lending. The law requires banks to lend in low- and moderate-income areas only if they have a branch in the area that takes deposits.\n\nAnd so, even though Chase rarely lends to low-income residents or people of color, who make up a majority of the region's population, it is not breaking the law.\n\nChase is one of the biggest lenders in the Washington area. Yet African Americans received just 23 of the 1,119 conventional home purchase loans Chase made in the metro area in 2015 and 2016, according to government lending data reviewed by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. Latino borrowers received 35 loans.\n\nAn analysis of tens of millions of mortgage records by Reveal found 61 metro areas where people of color were significantly more likely to be denied a conventional home purchase loan than whites, even when they made the same amount of money, sought the same loan size or tried to buy in the same neighborhood. The Washington area was the only one where Reveal's analysis found statistically significant disparities for all four ethnic groups studied: African Americans, Asians, Latinos and Native Americans.\n\nChase had one of the highest denial rates for African Americans and Latinos among major lenders in Washington. The bank turned away 26 percent of African Americans and 18 percent of Latinos who sought conventional home purchase loans in 2015 and 2016. It denied 7 percent of applications from white homebuyers.\n\nNot having branches in the district, advocates say, also skews Chase's applicant pool.\n\n\"Branches are really important,\" said John Taylor, president and CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy organization. \"They are not in a place where someone can be walking by and talk to a loan officer and get a mortgage. You're talking about a significant portion of people who want loans and excluding that option for them.\"\n\nChase officials would not grant an interview for this story, but in an email, company spokeswoman Keosha Burns said the bank is planning on \"expanding our footprint to new markets,\" including opening branches in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, which \"will give us more access to serve new communities.\"\n\nShe said Chase would comply with the Community Reinvestment Act in each of those cities once its branches are open.\n\nBryan Hubbard, spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, said Chase's lending patterns in Washington did not appear in his agency's most recent599-page assessment of the bank's community lending because the bank's office across the street from the White House is a \"limited service trust office.\"\n\n\"Trust offices by their nature are not deposit taking, do not meet the definition of a branch under CRA regulation, and are therefore excluded from the bank's assessment area under the regulation,\" he said.\n\nReveal's analysis of Chase's lending shows the bank made a much smaller percentage of loans in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the Washington area than the industry as a whole. Chase made 8 percent of its loans in those kinds of neighborhoods - where banks normally are required to solicit depositors and clients under the community lending law - compared with 20 percent for the mortgage lending industry as a whole.\n\nThe same pattern was present in Boston and Philadelphia, two other cities where Chase maintains a trust office that makes loans to the rich, but no retail branches that trigger enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act. In both cities, Chase made an overwhelming percentage of its loans to white borrowers. In Boston, it made 6 percent of its loans in low- and moderate-income areas. In Philadelphia, that number was 4 percent.\n\nChase's lending patterns in the Washington area were whiter and richer than the biggest banks with many area branches. In its headquarters city of New York, where Chase has more than 600 branches, the bank's share of lending to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods was almost twice as high as in Washington.\n\nIn the Washington area, Chase concentrated its lending in affluent white neighborhoods - such as the district's Chevy Chase, American University Park and the Rosemont section of Alexandria, Virginia. But Chase rarely made loans in higher-income African American neighborhoods, including middle-class Woodridge and Prince George's County, Maryland.\n\nThe comptroller gave Chase a satisfactory grade under the Community Reinvestment Act in its most recent assessment, released in 2013 . The bank was not unique in that regard. Over the past five years, the federal banking regulator has given 99 percent of banks satisfactory or outstanding reviews under the law.\n\nThe Trump administration has launched a review of the law, worrying consumer advocates, who say the changes most likely will lead to even more lax enforcement. Hubbard, the comptroller's spokesman, declined to comment on the changes, saying the office was still \"a couple of weeks away from being able to share any detail as that comes together.\"\n\nThe administration already has begunloosening regulations under the law. In October, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made it easier for banks to pass their Community Reinvestment Act assessments. Under the new rules, banks still comply with the law if their \"discriminatory or illegal credit practices\" are found to be \"limited, technical, or immaterial.\"\n\nThe website for Chase's Washington office includes pictures of five senior employees, representatives of its J.P. Morgan Private Bank brand, smiling in suits and ties - all of them white.\n\nManaging Director and Market Manager Jacqueline Young Perrins is said to lead \"a team of 50 professionals that oversee more than $20 billion in assets from local families, public and private foundations, and endowments.\"\n\n\"She and her team help high-net-worth clients grow and sustain their wealth across multiple generations,\" the website says.\n\nReveal sent emails to Perrins and three other employees at the office but received no response. When Reveal called a local phone number for that Chase office, the call was connected with an operator at a call center in Chicago.\n\n\"All they do is paperwork,\" said the operator, who would not give her name. \"It's not something you can walk into and do banking. The closest branch is in Trenton, New Jersey.\"",

Models PI2010 and PI9010 have been recalled due to a manufacturing defect that inhibits their ability to smell smoke.\n\nThe United States Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall on Wednesday. Head here for the details, or head to Kidde's site for help determining if your model is affected.\n\nIf your model doesn't have a pill shape across the front, you're not affected. If it does, take it off the wall and check the back to see if it matches either of the two model numbers above. If it matches, look inside the unit for a yellow cap. If you see one, head to Kidde's site to get a replacement. If not, your smoke detector isn't affected.\n\nThe affected units are dual-sensor alarms. According to the CPSC, roughly 452,000 have been sold in the US and 40,000 more were sold in Canada. All models were sold between September 2016 and January 2018.\n\nApparently, the problem stemmed from an oversight in the manufacturing process that left a yellow cap covering one of the two smoke sensors. Again, you can supposedly see this cap by looking inside your smoke detector. You shouldn't have to disassemble it.\n\nFortunately, no linked injuries have been reported. A Kidde representative offered the following statement over email: \"As customer safety is our first priority, Kidde has worked closely with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other relevant authorities to voluntarily initiate a recall and ensure that affected smoke alarms are replaced with different models as quickly as possible.\"",

                "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Although the first wave of a worrisome Pacific storm hasn't caused any major problems in California, forecasters say the worst is still to come, leaving authorities and disaster-weary residents on edge.\n\nRecord rain fell Wednesday in parts of Southern California where thousands of people have been evacuated because of the threat of debris flows and mudslides from wildfire burn areas.\n\nAlthough there were no major debris flows as feared, forecasters warned that disaster is still very possible as the rain picks up on Thursday.\n\n\"We're very concerned,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Sirard. \"We're hoping this isn't a cry-wolf scenario where people will pooh-pooh what we're saying.\"\n\nThe storm came ashore on the central coast and spread south into the Los Angeles region and north through San Francisco Bay, fed by a long plume of subtropical moisture called an atmospheric river.\n\nIt also moved eastward, bringing the threat of flooding to the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada, where winter storm warnings for new snow were in effect on the second day of spring.\n\nRecord rainfall was recorded in five spots including Santa Barbara, Palmdale and Oxnard, where nearly 1.8 inches had fallen by Wednesday evening. That's compared to the record of 1.3 inches set in 1937.\n\nNearly 5 inches of rain had fallen in northern San Luis Obispo County, while 2.7 inches fell in Santa Clarita, just north of Los Angeles and 2.6 inches was recorded at one spot in Santa Barbara County.\n\nAuthorities kept a close watch on Santa Barbara County, hoping there would not be a repeat of the massive January debris flows from a burn scar that ravaged the community of Montecito and killed 21 people.\n\nIn Montecito, following the deadly January mudslides in the area ravaged by the Thomas Fire, there was anxiety over whether basins and creeks will be able to handle the rainfall over the next few days, CBS Los Angeles reports.\n\nMud and rockslides closed several roads in the region, including Highway 1 at Ragged Point near Big Sur, not far from where the scenic coast route is still blocked by a massive landslide triggered by a storm last year.\n\nA large pine tree was felled in Los Angeles, landing across a residential street into a picket fence. No one was hurt.\n\nCarolyn Potter, 59, evacuated from her home in Casitas Springs in Ventura County on Wednesday - the fourth time since September - and plans to sleep in her car in a grocery store parking lot to avoid hotel costs and the bustle of an evacuation shelter.\n\nMeanwhile her husband Alan is staying home, just like he has the other three times Potter has evacuated because of fires or storms since September.\n\n\"It's OK because we're not fighting,\" Potter said. \"I get to leave and he stays. It's like, 'See you later.' We're both happy.\n\n\"I feel better not being under the cliff in my sleep,\" Potter said. \"If he feels OK that's his problem. If something happens maybe I'll zip on down and dig him out.\"\n\nWith the storm expected to last through Thursday, there was concern about the combination of rainfall rates and the long duration, said Suzanne Grimmesey, a spokeswoman for Santa Barbara County.\n\nWith the grim Montecito experience in recent memory, Santa Barbara County ordered evacuation of areas along its south coast near areas burned by several wildfires dating back to 2016.\n\n\"We actually do feel good about the evacuation order,\" Grimmesey said. \"Law enforcement was out in the extreme risk areas of Montecito yesterday knocking on doors. For those that were home, we had a very good cooperation rate with people leaving.\"\n\nMany residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, authorities canceled some planned mandatory evacuations because of a projected decrease in rainfall but kept others in place because of debris flows in one canyon area stripped bare by wildfire.",

                "body": "A target in a bizarre murder-for-hire plot in Texas broke her silence in court on Wednesday. Prosecutors believe Dr. Leon Jacob hired a hitman to kill his ex-girlfriend, Meghan Verikas, who had accused him of assault and stalking after their breakup - charges that threatened to end his medical career.\n\nVerikas described in startling detail what it was like to pose for photos meant to trick her ex-boyfriend Leon Jacob into thinking she had been kidnapped by the hitmen he allegedly hired, reports CBS News' Peter Van Sant.\n\n\"I sat in a chair in a warehouse and they zip-tied my hands and my feet and put duct tape around my mouth to make me look as if I had been kidnapped,\" Verikas said in court on Wednesday.\n\nMarion \"Mack\" McDaniel - whose wife was dating Jacob - was another alleged target. He also spoke publicly for the first time.\n\n\"What did you do for them?\" the prosecutor asked McDaniel, who responded, \"Stage my own death.\"\n\nProsecutors allege Leon Jacob, a surgeon, along with his girlfriend at the time, veterinarian Valerie McDaniel, offered two hitmen Cartier watches and $20,000 to carry out the murders. The discussions were captured on undercover police video.\n\nBut the men Jacob and McDaniel were speaking to last March were not killers for hire. They were undercover operatives including Motaz Azzeh, a decorated U.S. Army veteran recruited by Houston police. The other is an undercover officer we can only identify as \"Detective Javier.\"\n\n\"There was no doubt in my mind that Leon wanted Meghan killed,\" Javier said. \"She was under the belief that I was going to carjack him....And I was going to put a bullet in his head.\"\n\nAfter the fake hitmen said the targets were dead, police went to the couple's Houston high-rise apartment where the suspects appeared to act surprised. Officers later ended the charade and put Jacob and McDaniel in handcuffs.\n\n\"I'm innocent and as a human being and as a physician, that thought of killing somebody else is, just goes against everything in my nature,\" Jacob told Van Sant last year.\n\nThe prosecution is likely to wrap up its case Thursday. The defense is expected to argue Jacob was pressured by the undercover agents to order the murders and, in a dramatic twist, Jacob himself will take the stand to argue that point. Valerie McDaniel took her own life last year.",

                "body": "BEIRUT -- Syrian rebels and their families began to leave a besieged town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus on Thursday, BBC News reported, in an evacuation deal that will see the town handed over to the government following years of siege.\n\nRebels released 13 prisoners of war ahead of the evacuation.\n\nThe deal is the first such arrangement made for a town inside the beleaguered eastern Ghouta enclave, which has endured one month of relentless shelling and bombardment as the government, backed by its ally Russia, pushed to retake the area after seven years of revolt.\n\nThe agreement could serve as a blueprint for other towns in the enclave.\n\nState-affiliated al-Ikhbariya TV cast the deal as a victory for the country. Its correspondent Rabieh Dibeh said 10 buses had crossed into the town of Harasta to transport the \"terrorists\" - as the government refers to all armed opposition fighters - to a rebel-held province in north Syria. The camera showed dozens more buses waiting to enter Harasta.\n\nCritics say it is a formula for displacement that lets the state choose its citizenry - and expel those opposed to or fearful of President Bashar Assad's authoritarian rule.\n\nSome 6,000 civilians are expected to depart with the militants, some of them family members of the rebels and others activists, and other people afraid of the government's vindictive security services. An unknown number of others have already been forced out of their homes or killed in the government's ferocious campaigns against Harasta and eastern Ghouta leading up to the deal.\n\nThe United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross are not facilitating the evacuations; they are being done in conjunction with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.\n\nThe deal is modeled after others that have had rebels surrender swaths of territory around the capital and other major cities to the government. In all cases, the arrangements followed indiscriminate campaigns by the government against hospitals, markets, and other civilian targets, driving thousands of civilians out of their homes.\n\nHarasta appeared in ruins in a broadcast from al-Ikhbariya, and apartment blocks in the town looked gutted. Monther Fares, a spokesman for the rebel faction Ahrar al-Sham, confirmed that his group's fighters were preparing to depart.\n\nThe government-controlled Military Media Center said 1,500 rebels and 6,000 civilians would leave Harasta on Thursday.\n\nThe 13 men released by the Syrian rebels ahead of the evacuation identified themselves to the media as soldiers and civilians attached to the Syrian army, who were captured by rebels in the fighting for Harasta. In the TV footage, many cried in relief, thanking God, the Syrian army, and President Assad for their freedom.\n\nAl-Manar TV, which belongs to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, a key Assad ally, said the government released five \"terrorists\" to rebels, in exchange.\n\nFares said the rebels agreed to leave because of \"civilian pressure\" resulting from intensive airstrikes and \"warplanes that do not leave the sky,\" adding that residents of Harasta have spent the last three months inside shelters.\n\nRussia, a military backer of Assad, was the guarantor of the deal, he said.\n\nAlso Thursday, civilians streamed out of another part of the eastern Ghouta, continuing a trend that has seen close to 50,000 people flee across lines to the government for safety.\n\nThe Russian military said more than 1,000 civilians left rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday morning. Maj. Gen. Vladimir Zolotukhin told Russian news agencies in Syria the civilians left through the Wafideen crossing.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said some 4,000 people departed the besieged town of Douma in the last 24 hours.",

                "body": "BEIJING, China -- President Trump is expected to announce new tariffs and penalties against China today. They reportedly could total as much as $60 billion. The president wants to lower the $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China.\n\nMr. Trump is also looking to punish China for what he views as unfair trade practices including forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets to do business in China. If a trade war is brewing, China appears ready to fight back, reports CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy.\n\nA video posted Thursday by Chinese media Global Times shows kids talking about a trade war with the U.S. \"If they have an eye to us,\" one child says, \"we will cut out that eye.\" When it comes to retaliation, China is already eyeing American farmers - perhaps hoping to hit Mr. Trump's rural base of voters in places like Iowa and Ohio.\n\nGrant Kimberley, a 6th generation Iowa farmer, is visiting Beijing to meet with Chinese buyers and processors of soybeans. One in every four rows of soybeans planted in Iowa ends up in China, and he wants to assure them U.S. soybeans are still a reliable source for China's needs. Overall U.S. soybean exports to China are worth $12.4 billion. Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans would make them more expensive which could cost U.S. farmers' business.\n\n\"China buys about 30 to 33 percent of all the soybeans we grow in the entire United States... so it's very important to have a strong relationship,\" Kimberley said.\n\nBut it's not just farmers. Major U.S. companies such as Boeing, Apple and Ford could be hit if China retaliates, and the cost of Chinese imports - electronics, toys, clothing - could get more expensive for American consumers.\n\n\"Given that the government here keeps saying we don't want a trade war, is there any chance they just let this go?\" Tracy asked.\n\n\"I don't think they can let it go. Just looking at the domestic politics it will be showing weakness to just let it go,\" said Tianjun Wu, a Beijing-based economist. \"China will definitely want to retaliate somehow.\"\n\nChina could retaliate by making it harder for American companies to do business in the country. But the experts we have talked to say China is going to avoid a full-fledged trade war, which would likely be very damaging not only to the U.S. but also to China's economy.",

                "body": "Farmers, electronics retailers and other U.S. businesses are bracing for a backlash as President Donald Trump targets China for stealing American technology or pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over.\n\nThe administration is expected Thursday to slap trade sanctions on China, perhaps including restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese products.\n\nDozens of industry groups sent a letter last weekend to Trump warning that \"the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy, provoking retaliation; stifling U.S. agriculture, goods, and services exports; and raising costs for businesses and consumers.\"\n\nThe announcement will mark the end of a seven-month U.S. investigation into the hardball tactics China has used to challenge U.S. supremacy in technology, including dispatching hackers to steal commercial secrets and demanding that U.S. companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. The administration argues that years of negotiations with China have failed to produce results.\n\n\"It could be a watershed moment,\" said Stephen Ezell, vice president of global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank. \"The Trump administration's decision to go down this path is illustrative that previous strategies have not borne the hoped-for fruit.\"\n\nBusiness groups mostly agree that something needs to be done about China's aggressive push in technology -- but they worry that China will retaliate by targeting U.S. exports of aircraft, soybeans and other products and start a tit-for-tat trade war of escalating sanctions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\n\"The sanctions are a very big deal,\" says Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"The Chinese see them as a major threat and do not want a costly trade war.\"\n\nThe move against China comes just as the United States prepares to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum -- sanctions that are meant to hit China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum but will likely fall hardest on U.S. allies like South Korea and Brazil because they ship more of the metals to the United States.\n\nTrump campaigned on promises to bring down America's massive trade deficit -- $566 billion last year -- by rewriting trade agreements and cracking down on what he called abusive commercial practices by U.S. trading partners. But he was slow to turn rhetoric to action. In January, he imposed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. Then he unveiled the steel and aluminum tariffs, saying reliance on imported metals jeopardizes U.S. national security.\n\nTo target China, Trump has dusted off a Cold War weapon for trade disputes: Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which lets the president unilaterally impose tariffs. It was meant for a world in which large swaths of global commerce were not covered by trade agreements. With the arrival in 1995 of the World Trade Organization, which polices global trade, Section 301 fell largely into disuse.\n\nAt first it looked like Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were going to get along fine. They enjoyed an amiable summit nearly a year ago at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. But America's longstanding complaints about Chinese economic practices continued to simmer, and it became more and more apparent that the U.S. investigation into China technology policies was going to end in trade sanctions.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang this week urged Washington to act \"rationally\" and promised to open China up to more foreign products and investment. \"China has been trying to cool things down for weeks. They have offered concessions,\" Lovely says. \"Nothing seems to cool the fire. I fear they will take a hard line now that their efforts have been rebuffed. ... China cannot appear subservient to the U.S.\"",

                "body": "A report out Thursday morning shows thousands of children are injured or killed by furniture that tips over -- and the numbers are growing. After testing 24 different dresser models, Consumer Reports is calling for the furniture industry to adopt a mandatory safety standard.\n\nThere are voluntary standards for dressers but advocates wanted to know why were so many kids still being injured or killed? The Consumer Product Safety Commission says tip-over injuries for children under six rose by 33 percent from 2015 to 2016. Consumer Reports and parents who have lost children believe the voluntary standards that currently exist aren't enough.\n\n\"Just in this, like, little sliver of time, our lives had changed forever,\" Janet McGee told CBS News' Anna Werner.\n\nFor McGee, that change came on a Sunday afternoon in 2016 as she checked to see if her 22-month-old son Ted had woken up from his afternoon nap.\n\n\"I opened the door and right in front of me, his dresser I saw on the floor. It had fallen forward... In that split second I knew that he was under there,\" McGee said.\n\nThe toddler was buried under the dresser drawers. He had suffocated.\n\n\"His face was purple. His eyes were half opened. It was a horrible vision that unfortunately I'm still haunted by every single day,\" she said.\n\nGovernment data shows from 2014 to 2016, more than 15,000 children under 18 were injured in tip-overs. From 2000-2016 more than 150 children died from tip-overs of dressers, bureaus or with a TV on top.\n\nConsumer Reports conducted tip-over testing on 24 different dressers, subjecting each to progressively tougher tests, some more stringent than the current voluntary standard. The result: the group says the industry standard is \"inadequate\" because it still leaves too many children at risk.\n\nJames Dickerson, Consumer Reports' chief scientific officer, said it's \"extremely difficult\" for parents to figure out which dressers are safer than others.\n\n\"You cannot judge a dresser - whether it's going to be tippy or not - just by looking at it,\" Dickerson said.\n\nConsumer Reports is now calling for a mandatory standard to protect children. In a statement, the American Home Furnishings Alliance told \"CBS This Morning\" it is \"not opposed to mandatory product safety standards\" but said they \"cannot be easily revised or updated once passed.\" Consumer Reports says by the numbers, however, most dressers actually passed their toughest test.\n\n\"Some of them are doing a fantastic job.... it is possible, it is achievable, and it doesn't require extra cost,\" Dickerson said. \"You can make dressers that are very stable at all price points, at all shapes, all sizes, all heights, all weights.\"\n\nIf you want to see the results for specific manufacturers and see how they responded, you can check the entire report here. In the meantime, if you are a parent of young children, you can buy anchor kits for any furniture that could fall on a child. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says the kits cost as little as $5.",

                "title": "Hawaii state lawmaker resigns over sexual misconduct probe",
                "body": "A former speaker of the Hawaii House of Representatives will resign by next week to resolve sexual harassment allegations brought by several women, the latest case of an elected official being forced from office over misconduct.\n\nThe Hawaii State Ethics Commission on Wednesday announced the settlement in its investigation of state Rep. Joseph Souki of Maui, a Democrat. The investigation included allegations Souki, 86, sexually harassed multiple women by subjecting them to unwanted kissing, touching and sexual language.\n\nSexual misconduct allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in October have led women around the country to come forward with claims against powerful men in politics, entertainment, business and media.\n\nSince 2017, at least 23 state lawmakers have resigned or been expelled from office amid sexual misconduct or harassment allegations. That includes the 17 who left office since reports about Weinstein's misconduct.\n\nThe settlement calls for Souki to resign by March 30, issue a public apology, pay a $5,000 penalty and not seek office for two years.\n\nAccording to the settlement, Souki admitted he \"touched and kissed more than one woman in ways that were inappropriate and unwelcome. He admits that this physical contact exceeded the boundaries of the customary 'aloha kiss.'\"\n\nHe also admitted making \"sexual comments, including comments on the physical appearance of more than one woman, that were inappropriate and unwanted.\"\n\nBut Souki said Wednesday he has \"absolutely no memory of ever acting inappropriately with any women at any time, as a member of the House or in a private setting.\" He is saddened something he did was misunderstood to be inappropriate, he said.\n\n\"He's agreed to take responsibility for what they've accused him of, but frankly, doesn't remember the incidents,\" said Souki's attorney, Michael Green.\n\nThe commission found Souki likely violated the state's Fair Treatment Law, which says a lawmaker cannot use his or her position to obtain unwarranted benefits or to subject another person to unwarranted treatment, either favorable or unfavorable.\n\nThe investigation began when Rachael Wong, the former head of Hawaii's Department of Human Services, filed a sexual harassment complaint against Souki. The commission says similar allegations from other women followed.\n\nWong said in a statement Wednesday that Souki made inappropriate comments about her physical appearance and an inappropriate request for physical contact when she was human services director. She declined to provide more details.\n\nShe said she's heard from other women who suffered from the abuse of power at the Hawaii Legislature.\n\n\"Yet every single one of the local women with whom I've spoken share that they were not and still do not feel able to come forward publicly,\" Wong said. \"How can we be okay with that in our islands?\"\n\nSouki was first elected in 1982 and has served continuously since then. He was House speaker from 1993-99 and again from 2013-17.\n\nSouki said he hadn't planned to run for re-election so he would have been leaving the House later this year.\n\nThe report from the commission says when Souki was speaker, women were reticent to confront him or file a complaint regarding his conduct. It noted Wong was responsible for a budget of $3.3 billion.\n\n\"Challenging then-Speaker Souki's conduct could have jeopardized her agency's budget and legislation thereby impairing her advocacy efforts on behalf of Hawaii's children and families,\" the report said. \"She, like others, felt she had no choice but to remain silent in the face of Respondent Souki's behavior.\"\n\nSouki's official biography on the Legislature's website says he was born and raised on Maui. He is married with two children.\n\n\"I have made the difficult decision to avoid a media circus by stepping down without a public confrontation with my accusers,\" Souki said, adding that he doesn't want to put his family through public hearings.\n\nSouki said some people will conclude he did something wrong because he's resigning but he can't control that. Souki said it would take a long time and it would be expensive to fight the allegations. He said doing so would hurt his accusers, his family and his friends.\n\nGreen argued there was no way for his client to receive due process in the case, especially when some allegations were for conduct eight years ago. Green said that's a long enough ago that people wouldn't remember what happened.\n\nHe argued \"there's no way\" the ethics commission wouldn't find a violation if his client challenged the allegations under the current system. He said Souki's House colleagues would then be in the difficult position of voting on whether to expel Souki and face the wrath of voters if they voted against.\n\n\"You cannot win when this happens,\" Green said.\n\nDaniel Gluck, the ethics commission's executive director, told reporters anyone who is accused may have an open hearing if he or she believes the evidence doesn't justify the charges.\n\nThe current House speaker, Rep. Scott Saiki, said his chamber takes a \"zero tolerance approach\" to workplace harassment.\n\n\"It is regrettable that a legislative career that spanned 36 years is ending in such a manner,\" Saiki said.\n\nHawaii Gov. David Ige thanked the ethics commission for \"a fair and thorough investigation.\" He commended Wong for her \"courage and leadership in giving voice to harassment victims and increasing awareness across the state.\"",

                "title": "After late night finalizing, voting could begin Thursday on $1.3 trillion spending bill",
                "body": "Congressional leaders have finalized a sweeping $1.3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending but leaves behind young immigrant \"Dreamers,\" deprives President Donald Trump some of his border wall money and takes only incremental steps to address gun violence.\n\nAs negotiators stumbled toward an end-of-the-week deadline to fund the government or face a federal shutdown, House Speaker Paul Ryan dashed to the White House amid concerns Mr. Trump's support was wavering. Although some conservative Republicans balked at the size of the spending increases and the rush to pass the bill, the White House said the president backed the legislation.\n\nMr. Trump himself sounded less than enthused, tweeting late Wednesday: \"Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\"\n\nTalks had stretched into Wednesday evening before the 2,232-page text was finally released.\n\n\"No bill of this size is perfect,\" Ryan said. \"But this legislation addresses important priorities and makes us stronger at home and abroad.\"\n\nLeaders hoped to start voting as soon as Thursday. A stopgap measure may be needed to ensure federal offices aren't hit with a partial shutdown at midnight Friday when funding for the government expires.\n\nCBS News' Rebecca Kaplan reports that the first big hurdle for the House is passing a procedural measure that allows them to vote on the actual text of the omnibus.\n\nSome Republicans may vote against this procedural measure because they are unhappy about the tight time frame to pass the omnibus. If Republican leadership wants to get through this procedural hurdle and vote on Thursday, they may need Democratic votes. Democrats, in turn, could see this as a last-chance piece of try to get one more priority in on this bill.\n\nChief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, told reporters Wednesday night that he wasn't sure yet whether they would need Democratic votes. \"We can go faster or slower - it will be members who determine it,\" he said. In gauging support for the bill, he said the range of support was \"similar\" to the vote on the caps deal which set the topline spending numbers in February. That vote passed with 240 yes votes: 167 Republicans and 73 Democrats. 67 Republicans and 119 Democrats voted no.\n\nNegotiators have been working for days -- and nights -- on details of the bill, which is widely viewed as the last major piece of legislation likely to move through Congress in this election year. Lawmakers in both parties sought to attach their top priorities.\n\nTwo of the biggest remaining issues had been border wall funds and a legislative response to gun violence after the clamor for action following recent school shootings, including the one in Parkland, Florida.\n\nOn guns, leaders agreed to tuck in bipartisan provisions to bolster school safety funds and improve compliance with the criminal background check system for firearm purchases. The bill states that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do research on gun violence, though not advocacy, an idea Democrats pushed.\n\nBut there was no resolution for Dreamers, the young immigrants who have been living in the United States illegally since childhood but whose deportation protections are being challenged in court after Mr. Trump tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.\n\nAfter the omnibus was posted, the conservative House Freedom Caucus announced they would oppose the bill for a variety of reasons, including what they feel is insufficient funding for border security, a failure to block federal dollars to sanctuary cities, and allowing the Fix NICS bill to be included without also including concealed carry reciprocity. There are roughly 30 members of that group, many of whom often vote against these large spending bills anyway. With enough Democratic support, their no votes won't matter.\n\nDemocrats temporarily shut down the government earlier this year as they fought for that protection. But the issue only rose to a discussion item when Mr. Trump made a late-hour push for a deal in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funds.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump is now poised to win $1.6 billion for barriers along the border, but none of it for the new prototypes he recently visited in California. Less than half the nearly 95 miles of border construction, including levees along the Rio Grande in Texas, would be for new barriers, with the rest for repair of existing segments.\n\nIn one win for immigrant advocates, negotiators rejected Mr. Trump's plans to hire hundreds of new Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents.\n\n\"We are disappointed that we did not reach agreement on Dreamer protections that were worthy of these patriotic young people,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe emerging plan removes a much-debated earmark protecting money for a rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The item was a top priority of Mr. Trump's most powerful Democratic rival, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, but Mr. Trump vowed to veto the bill over the earmark. Under the legislation, the project would remain eligible for funding, however, and a Schumer aide said it was likely to win well more than half of the $900 million sought for the project this year.\n\nThe core purpose of the bill is to increase spending for military and domestic programs that have been sharply squeezed under a 2011 agreement that was supposed to cap spending. It gives Mr. Trump a huge budget increase for the military, while Democrats scored wins on infrastructure and other domestic programs that they failed to get under President Barack Obama.\n\nLeaving the chamber tonight, Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, summed up how many lawmakers see the next two days: \"The members know what is at stake. We have to pay our troops and support our president.\"\n\nThat largesse has drawn opposition from some fiscal conservatives and could make passage a potentially tricky process.\n\nLast month, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul triggered a brief government shutdown over his objections to the deficit spending. On Wednesday, he tweeted his opposition to the emerging legislation, known as an \"omnibus.\"\n\n\"It's a good thing we have Republican control of Congress or the Democrats might bust the budget caps, fund planned parenthood and Obamacare, and sneak gun control without due process into an Omni ... wait, what?\" Paul tweeted.\n\nMost essential was support from Mr. Trump, who has been known to threaten to veto legislation even when his team is involved in the negotiations.\n\nWord of Mr. Trump's discontent sent Ryan to the White House, where he was invited to a face-to-face with the president, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the phone.\n\nWhite House aides said the president's support was never in doubt, but one senior White House official said the president was concerned that details of the package weren't being presented as well as they could be, both to members of Congress and the public.\n\nThe group discussed how they could better sell the package, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conversation.\n\n\"The president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that it would fund Mr. Trump priorities such as wall construction, add money to combat the opioid crisis and provide new infrastructure spending.\n\nBoth parties touted $4.6 billion in total funding to fight the nation's opioid addiction epidemic, a $3 billion increase. More than $2 billion would go to strengthen school safety through grants for training, security measures and treatment for the mentally ill. Medical research at the National Institutes of Health, a longstanding bipartisan priority, would receive a record $3 billion increase to $37 billion. Funding was also included for election security ahead of the 2018 midterms.\n\nChild care and development block grants would receive a huge $2.4 billion increase to $5.2 billion. And an Obama-era transportation grant program known as TIGER would see its budget tripled to $1.5 billion. Head Start for preschoolers would get a $610 million boost, while an additional $2.4 billion would go for child care grants.",

                "title": "Will a revised Iran deal be sufficient enough for Trump?",
                "body": "Trump administration negotiators have a tough sales job as they pressure European allies to accept new restrictions to \"fix\" the Iran nuclear deal: Even if the Europeans agree, President Donald Trump may blow up the deal anyway.\n\nGiven a mid-May deadline by Mr. Trump, U.S. negotiators are working with Britain, France and Germany on a follow-on pact that would address Mr. Trump's three major complaints. First, Mr. Trump wants to penalize Iran for ballistic missiles, which weren't part of the original deal. He also wants to expand access for international nuclear inspectors and prolong the limits on Iran's nuclear activity, currently scheduled to expire in several years.\n\nBut beyond those broad strokes, Mr. Trump has refused to give the Europeans or even his own negotiators a clear litmus test for what will be good enough to keep him in the landmark 2015 accord. Brian Hook, the State Department policy chief who's running the negotiations, said if there's no agreement by May, Trump will certainly withdraw. If there is an agreement, Trump's advisers will present it to him.\n\n\"Then he will make a decision on whether he wants to remain in the deal,\" Hook said Wednesday.\n\nThe unusual ultimatum puts America's closest allies in Europe in the uncomfortable position of trying to predict what is likely to satisfy Mr. Trump, even as they resent his demand to tinker with the deal in the first place. The European nations only begrudgingly agreed after it became clear that placating the U.S. president was the only way to salvage the deal former President Barack Obama struck with Iran and world powers.\n\n\"This is really where the leverage falls through,\" said Heather Conley, the Europe director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The Europeans may go out on a limb and still have the president walk away. The Europeans have tried, but they don't know ultimately where he's going to come out on this.\"\n\nIt's far from clear that the U.S. and the Europeans can reach agreement anyway. In talks in European capitals, Hook's team and the Europeans have been haggling over complex sticking points such as what range of ballistic missiles should be penalized -- and how.\n\nHook, briefing reporters on a conference call, referred repeatedly to \"long-range\" missiles or \"ICBMs\" as one of Mr. Trump's primary concerns. However, congressional Republicans who opposed the agreement, along with some Democrats and other nations in Iran's neighborhood, have told Mr. Trump that excluding medium-range missiles leaves them at risk.\n\nAccording to one outside adviser briefed on the status of the talks, the negotiating team is currently working on a double-pronged \"fix\" that would separate Iran's missiles into two categories: nuclear-capable long-range, intercontinental ballistic missiles that can hit Europe, and shorter-range projectiles that could hit U.S. allies and friends, including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates as well as American military assets.\n\nSanctions could be imposed for both, but those for long-range missiles would likely be harsher and kick in more automatically if Iran tested or transferred them. Those sanctions could also target Iranian entities that were exempted from penalties under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe Iran deal's critics argue the restrictions must cover both long- and medium-range missile tests and transfers, and that the penalties for both should be just as tough. They also want all nuclear-capable missiles to be treated as part of Iran's banned nuclear program, rather than dealt with separately.\n\nRichard Goldberg, an Iran deal foe and former GOP congressional aide, said it was \"hard to believe\" that Mr. Trump would allow Iran more leniency for shorter-range missiles \"that can wipe out U.S. bases and allies like Israel.\"\n\n\"That's the kind of thing his predecessor would have done in negotiations,\" Goldberg said, referring to Obama.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have agreed in principle to punishing Tehran for long-range missiles. But they've been sympathetic to the argument that Iran -- which lacks a powerful air force -- needs shorter-range missiles for legitimate self-defense, according to European diplomats. It wasn't clear Wednesday whether the Europeans would accept the double-pronged approach on missiles, nor whether Mr. Trump himself would sign off on it.\n\nWith Iran and fellow deal members Russia and China unlikely to sign on to changes, the U.S. opted to start with the European nations, whose trade and investment Iran covets. The idea was that even if Iran doesn't formally join the add-on agreement, the sanctions relief Tehran is receiving would be incentive enough to get it to voluntarily comply with the new terms.",

                "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- A video of an infant smoking a small cigar set off outrage on social media that helped North Carolina authorities identify and arrest the mother. Police say the Raleigh mom had her baby smoke \"a marijuana blunt,\" according to arrest warrants obtained by CBS affiliate WNCN.\n\nA version of the video that's received 1.5 million views was posted by a user who urged the mother's arrest. The 10-second clip shows the hand of an adult off-screen holding what appears to be a cigarillo to the child's lips. The child then makes a cooing sound and appears to inhale before letting out a puff of smoke.\n\nThe Raleigh Police Department said Wednesday that the child was safe and the mother was in custody.\n\n\"Big thanks to everyone who posted information about the smoking mother and baby,\" department officials told their Facebook followers in a post. \"Thanks to your willingness to get involved, the child is now safe and the mother is in police custody.\"\n\nPolice spokeswoman Laura Hourigan confirmed in an email that officials were referring to the child seen in the video.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what substance the child was smoking, but the mother was charged with marijuana possession. Brianna Ashanti Lofton, 20, was also charged with two counts of felony child abuse, according to a police news release.\n\nThe baby was placed with the county's child protective services department. A phone listing for Lofton couldn't be found through a public records search.\n\n\"I was totally flabbergasted over the simple fact that I saw that baby smoking,\" neighbor Sean Price told WNCN. \"The bad thing about it is I've seen that baby, said hi to the baby, touched that baby, because I have a little daughter of my own, so I interacted with her.\"\n\nWhile police said multiple Facebook users alerted them to the video Wednesday morning, the account holder whose posting was seen by more than a million people said he's glad the child is now safe.\n\nThe user, who identified himself as Rasheed Martin of Rochester, New York, said he hasn't spoken directly with police, but he's satisfied that he helped raise awareness. His post prompted numerous comments by people worried about the child or upset with the mother.\n\nMartin said he doesn't know the mother and first found out about the video when a friend shared it online. He said he wanted the woman to be held responsible, so he reposted the video while urging his followers to help identify the woman.\n\n\"Once more and more people found out about this situation, they showed me a screenshot of her actual Facebook page,\" Martin said in in an online interview. \"Then I later added it to the post so everyone could know exactly who ... did that to the poor little girl.\"",

Airlines cancelled thousands of flights.\n\n\"We're supposed to be getting ready for Easter, not a nor'easter,\" said 46-year-old Raeme Dempsey, as her 6-year-old daughter, Jadalynn, pulled her toward a Philadelphia park so they could see the trees blanketed in freshly fallen snow.\n\nMajor cities along the Interstate 95 corridor saw moderate snow amounts. Downtown Philadelphia got 7 inches and New York City's Central Park recorded a little less than 7. Boston was expected to get even less:\n\nBut many inland areas got hit hard, Long Island among them:\n\nSome parts of Pennsylvania saw more than a foot of snow.\n\n\"It's time to move on to another season,\" said Pancho Ortega, who was clearing the sidewalk outside his soon-to-open restaurant in Philadelphia.\n\nAirlines canceled some 4,400 flights Wednesday, according to FlightAware.com. \" Airlines are finalizing their recovery plans and have cancelled 615 flights today as they work to recoup their schedules,\" the site added.\n\nOn the ground, Amtrak scaled back service on the Northeast corridor between Washington and Boston, and some states banned trucks from major highways. At least two traffic deaths were reported, in New Jersey and on Long Island.\n\nCBS New York reports platforms were clear at the Mineola station on Long Island, but riders were still dealing with snowy conditions. Some scattered weather-related delays were being reported.\n\nSome 86,000 homes and businesses were in the dark as of 6:00 a.m. Thursday.\n\nPatience was wearing thin as the fourth major storm in three weeks pounded the region.\n\n\"I want warm! I'm done with the cold,\" said Yana Damoiseau, a pedestrian in New York City.\n\nIn New Jersey, some streets were flooded along the shore, including one in Point Pleasant Beach, where a pair of ducks cruised back and forth through an intersection where a plastic garbage can bobbed in the waves.\n\nThe storm also unloaded snow on Virginia and West Virginia as it pushed into the Northeast. Virginia reported more 240 traffic accidents.\n\nBut not everyone was sick of the snow.\n\nIn Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania, about 90 miles outside Philadelphia, 10-year-old siblings Talia and Miles Broadhurst made their own fun on yet another day off from school, climbing onto the family SUV and sliding down the snow-slicked windshield and hood before plopping onto the snow.\n\n\"If the snow keeps me away from school, I'm fine with it,\" Miles said.",

                "title": "Teen Palestinian protester Ahed Tamimi gets 8 months in prison",
                "body": "OFER MILITARY PRISON, West Bank -- Palestinian teenage protest icon Ahed Tamimi on Wednesday was sentenced to eight months in prison for slapping and kicking a pair of Israeli soldiers outside her West Bank home, capping a case that sparked uproar in Israel, turned the 17-year-old girl into a Palestinian hero and attracted international attention.\n\nTamimi's Israeli lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said Tamimi agreed to the sentence as part of a plea deal with prosecutors that allowed her to avoid more serious charges that could have imprisoned her for years. Under the deal, she is due to be released in the summer. She is also being fined the equivalent of about $1,400.\n\nLasky called the legal proceedings a \"farce.\" She said \"they are trying to deter other Palestinian youth from resisting occupation as Ahed did.\"\n\nThe judge agreed to a similar plea deal for Tamimi's mother Nariman, who has been charged with incitement.\n\n\"This is injustice, this court is designed to oppress the Palestinians,\" her father Bassem said. He said they agreed to the deal because they had been threatened with three years in jail. Bassem had visited his daughter and wife for the first time in prison the day before. He said Ahed spends her time doing school work.\n\nAn Israeli supporter of Tamimi slapped a prosecutor after the ruling and was later arrested by police.\n\nTamimi was arrested in December after video surfaced of her kicking the soldiers outside her West Bank home. While some praised the soldiers for showing restraint, hard-line politicians criticized what they felt was a weak response and called for tough action against the girl, whose family has a long history of run-ins with the Israelis.\n\nBut the full-throttle prosecution of Tamimi, who turned 17 behind bars, has drawn widespread international criticism. An Israeli official's revelation that he had once had parliament investigate whether the blond, blue-eyed Tamimis are \"real\" Palestinians drew accusations of racism and helped stoke additional interest in the case.\n\nThe case touches on what constitutes legitimate resistance to Israel's rule over millions of Palestinians, now in its 51st year, in territories it captured in the 1967 war.\n\n\"No justice under occupation and we are in an illegal court,\" Tamimi said to reporters in court.\n\nAhed Tamimi's supporters see a brave girl who struck the soldiers in anger after having just learned that Israeli troops seriously wounded a 15-year-old cousin, shooting him in the head from close range with a rubber bullet during nearby stone-throwing clashes.\n\nIn Israel, she is seen either as a naive youth manipulated by her elders or a threat to Israel's military deterrence. The incident also sparked debate about the soldiers' refusal to act.\n\nIsrael has treated Tamimi's actions as a criminal offense, indicting her on charges of assault and incitement that carry up to 14 years in prison.\n\nSince 2009, residents of Tamimi's village of Nabi Salah have staged regular anti-occupation protests that often end with stone-throwing clashes. Ahed Tamimi has participated in such marches from a young age, and has had several highly publicized run-ins with soldiers.\n\nOne photo shows the then-12- year-old raising a clenched fist toward a soldier towering over her.\n\nFollowing her latest arrest, images of the girl became popular on posters in the West Bank. Some 1.7 million people worldwide have signed a petition calling for her release.\n\nThe case has drawn attention to Israel's military court system, which is used to try Palestinians in the West Bank. Israeli West Bank settlers, on the other hand, are tried under Israeli civilian courts.\n\nThe dueling justice systems have drawn criticism from international rights groups. The military courts have a near 100 percent conviction rate, in part because so many Palestinians agree to plea bargains. Critics say the system gives Palestinians few rights, and they are often coerced into plea deals. Hundreds of Palestinian minors are processed by the military court system each year.\n\n\"Ahed will be home in a few months, but Israel is putting this child behind bars for eight months for calling for protests and slapping a soldier, after threatening her with years in jail,\" said Human Rights Watch Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson.",

                "title": "A flood of lawsuits demand websites accommodate the disabled",
                "body": "Hundreds of companies are facing federal class actions filed in recent months alleging that their websites don't comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) because people with physical challenges have difficulties using them. Among those being sued are Nike (NKE), Burger King, Hershey (HSY), Lord & Taylor and Pandora (P).\n\nUnder Title III of the ADA, it's illegal to discriminate against disabled persons \"in the full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations.\" Applying that standard to websites is tricky because the 1990 ADA predated the Internet as a mass medium. U.S. Department of Justice officials announced in 2010 that they would provide guidance regarding the standards that websites would have to meet.\n\nThe expected 2016 release of the DOJ rule, however, was delayed by the Obama administration. Further, the Trump administration, which has made reducing government regulations a priority, withdrew the website proposal without explanation in January. Contradictory court rulings clouded the picture even further, according to attorneys.\n\n\"Website access lawsuits have been filed against defendants in almost every industry and market,\" emailed Kristen Perkins, an attorney with Hinshaw & Culbertson in Florida, which represents businesses targeted in these cases. \"While retail establishments have had the most filings, those in the health care industry, education, restaurant and nonprofit sectors, in addition to others, have had to defend these lawsuits.\"\n\nMore than 800 were filed in 2017, according to Minh Vu, an attorney with the law firm Seyfarth Shaw, which defends companies targeted in ADA litigation. Classaction.org, which tracks class actions, estimates that 256 ADA website-accessibility cases were filed in federal courts between Nov. 28 and Feb. 26, with no sign of a slowdown.\n\n\"Businesses have been put in a very difficult place,\" Vu said. \"You cannot wave a magic wand to make your website accessible. There aren't a lot of people who know how to do it correctly.\"\n\nAccording to William Goren, an attorney from Decatur, Georgia, who specializes in ADA issues, many designers didn't consider people with disabilities when they created websites, which makes it more challenging to fix them after they're online.\n\nCompanies often need to add code to pictures on their websites to enable special browsers to describe images for people with impaired vision. They also need to provide text for videos so people with hearing problems can understand them. The cost to address the issues can reach several thousand dollars depending on a site's complexity and the extent of the issues that need to be addressed.\n\nA bill pending in the U.S. House of Representatives would give companies with deficient handicap entrances and other architectural barriers six months to fix their problems before they can be sued. According to Perkins, owners of websites would benefit from similar consideration, but the proposed legislation currently doesn't offer any.\n\n\"This type of pre-suit requirement would be a very helpful way to avoid the unnecessary costs of litigation,\" wrote Perkins. \"Clients with offending websites generally want to put fixes in place quickly to make their sites accessible to all people, given both the public policy concerns and the obvious business advantages to having your website work for everyone. The defense of these suits only makes curing access barriers to the impaired public more expensive.\"\n\nNike declined to comment. A spokesman for Hershey said the candy company was \"committed to making our websites user-friendly,\" though he declined to discuss the ADA case. Officials from Burger King, which is part of Restaurant Brands (QSR); Lord & Taylor, which is part of Canada's Hudson's Bay; and Pandora didn't respond to a request for comment for this story.",

                "title": "Could Trump's tariffs affect the price tag for his border wall?",
                "body": "President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on steel imports, in keeping with his key campaign platform to make fair trade deals, may inadvertently hurt a promise even more central to his campaign -- his pledge to build a wall along the southern border.\n\n\"It's going to be made of hardened concrete, and it's going to be made out of rebar, and steel,\" Mr. Trump said of his border wall a plans at a December 2015 rally.\n\nThat was more than two years ago, and now, as federal officials look to \"build the wall,\" as the signature Trump rally chant goes, the border wall could very well face a new obstacle -- a higher price for materials. Earlier this month, surrounded by steel and aluminum workers, Mr. Trump signed proclamations imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, with temporary exemptions for Canada and Mexico. President Trump has requested at least $25 billion for his border wall in the past, although some estimates place the actual cost much higher. The current omnibus spending bill suggests he will only get a fraction of that. And experts are saying it's nearly impossible to see how the cost for the wall doesn't increase as a result of the tariffs -- it's just a matter of how much.\n\n\"I suppose the connection is that the wall would be made in large part of steel, the price of which is intended to rise by close to 25 percent,\" said Alan Deardorff, professor of international economics and economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. \"That's the purpose of the tariffs, since that is how it helps the U.S. steel industry, though Trump and his advisers like to suggest that the tariff can help them without raising prices. So, yes, the tariff will surely make the wall more costly.\"\n\nThere are currently eight prototypes for the wall, which Mr. Trump toured in San Diego earlier this month. The federal government has yet to decide which prototype and contractors will win out, but any of the designs -- even the concrete ones -- will inevitably entail steel. Four of the prototypes are made primarily from concrete and four from other materials, but even the concrete ones are reinforced, \"which means that the main ingredients are concrete and steel\" and steel would be a \"significant cost,\" said David Inserra, a policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation who specializes in homeland security issues.\n\n\"Looking at the designs that are currently out there, we know that steel will likely be a significant cost of any border barrier that is built,\" Inserra said.\n\n\"Tariffs are just taxes on imported goods,\" Inserra added. \"So in this case we have a tax on imported steel, which overall will cause the cost of steel to rise.\"\n\nOf course, it's possible some steel imports could come from the exempted Canada, the largest importer of steel to the United States. But the wall will almost certainly be built with American steel, because many federal contracts require American-made products, and the point of the tariffs was to allow U.S. steel prices to be protected -- and to climb, Inserra said.\n\nTommy Fisher, president and CEO of Fisher Sand & Gravel Co., is one of the contractors vying to help build the wall. Fisher said a concrete wall, such as his prototype, will require \"tons of steel\" to back up the concrete. He estimates a reinforced concrete wall, across 1,900 miles, will require about 4 billion pounds of rebar.\n\nHe and his company are already working on a 15-mile section of a concrete wall along the southern border, to better demonstrate what the wall might look like. That project requires about 30 million pounds of rebar, he said. Fisher's company creates its own steel. \"Everything we submit is 100 percent American made,\" he said.\n\nThe tariffs will likely increase the price tag for steel slightly, Fisher suggested, which is an outcome he likes. \"Even if the steel tariffs push the price up a little bit, I'm still all for it to protect the American steel industry,\" Fisher said. But the higher revenues for the steel companies will almost certainly mean a higher cost to U.S. taxpayers paying for the border wall (assuming Mexico stands by its promise not to pay for the wall).\n\nDeardorff shrugged off the idea that higher steel costs will have much of an impact. \"I'm not sure that matters,\" Deardorff said. \"Neither the advocates of the wall nor its opponents are much concerned about its cost.\"",

                "title": "Facebook's biggest fails",
                "body": "Mark Zuckerberg admits that Facebook \"made mistakes\" in allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest personal information for 50 million of its users. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is more emphatic, describing it as a \"major violation of people's trust.\"\n\nWhere the two are in agreement is that the world's biggest social network must do much better in protecting its members from prying eyes. That is a recurring theme over the company's short history, revealing a business forever pushing the boundaries of users' privacy and comfort while getting them to spend more time on its platform.\n\nOver the years, Facebook's responses to such flubs have ranged from contrite pledges to improve to blanket rejections of wrongdoing. Here's a look back at some of the past controversies that have dogged the social networking giant, along with how the company responded:\n\nIn 2007, Facebook rolled out a tracking program called Beacon. Beacon took information encompassing about 50 million Facebook users' purchases and activities on other websites -- like Travelocity, Fandango, The Knot and Overstock.com -- and posted it to their News Feed, without always clearly asking for the user's approval.\n\nSeveral weeks into Beacon's existence, tens of thousands of Facebook members had signed a petition to drop the feature. After a month, Facebook created an \"opt-out\" from the service, effectively ending its abbreviated life.\n\n\"We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize,\" founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in December of that year in commenting on Beacon. \"I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation, and I know we can do better.\"\n\nFacebook rolled out the ability to log in to other sites with your Facebook credentials in late 2008, and the tool, called OpenID, gradually began to spread across the web. This tool opened the door to Facebook's eventual dominance of the internet. The company soon made its \"like\" button available on other websites, opening the door to widespread tracking of individuals' web browsing history -- even those who weren't Facebook users.\n\n\"That was a big thing, because Facebook extended its ability to track you across websites,\" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for a Digital Democracy.\n\nA year after OpenID came out, Facebook changed its default privacy settings, making user profiles public by default. It took five years of user pushback for the company to change the default to be visible to users' friends.\n\nIn 2009, the Center for Digital Democracy and eight other groups filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission over Facebook's practices, and two year later, the FTC admonished Facebook for playing fast and loose with users' data. The company, which had nearly 900 million users at the end of that yeat, \"deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\" the agency charged. In particular, the consumer watchdog alleged that Facebook:\n\nIn a 2012 settlement with the FTC, Facebook agreed to implement a privacy program, ask users for permission before broadly sharing their information and get regular third-party privacy audits for the following 20 years. The settlement appeared designed to prevent the type of \"share first, ask later\" dust-up caused by the Beacon program.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged the flub. \"I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes,\" he wrote while lamenting that those errors \"overshadowed much of the good work we've done.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"[W]e can also always do better. I'm committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy.\"\n\nIn June 2013, Facebook notified about 6 million users that their contact information, including phone numbers and emails, had been inadvertently exposed.\n\nFor a platform with about 1 billion users at that point, the numbers were relatively small. But the breach -- which Facebook called a \"bug\" -- also revealed that Facebook had been quietly compiling fuller profiles of its users by merging their information with data submitted by their contacts -- data that Facebook itself acknowledged \"was not necessarily accurate.\"\n\nThe bug even affected people who didn't use Facebook and whose contact information may been uploaded by friends, which made many \"furious,\" ZDNet wrote at the time. \"The policy being that in this area, your data is not yours; it belongs to your friends, and by its rules your friends -- or merely people you know -- have more control over your data than you do.\"\n\nIn a blog post and messages to users, Facebook downplayed the breach. \"It's likely that anyone who saw this is not a stranger to you,\" the company said in a notification. Facebook also assured that \"all of us at Facebook take this issue very personally\" and that the company had taken steps to prevent future breaches -- though it hastened to add that \"no company can ensure 100 percent prevention of bugs.\"\n\nAfter several years of pushing video content on its platform, Facebook revealed that it had been miscalculating performance metrics in a way that inflated the average amount of time videos were viewed.\n\nThe average Facebook user isn't likely to care about video view time, but advertisers were upset because it potentially meant they had overpaid for ads.\n\nThough Facebook said the error had no effect on billing, it still said expressed regret. \"We sincerely apologize for the issues this has created for our clients,\" wrote David Fischer, the company's vice president of business and marketing partnerships.\n\nAfter accusations that it helped sow division during the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook cracks down on fake accounts. The site deletes tens of thousands of followers in the run-up to national elections in France and in Germany. In the U.S., Facebook nixes millions of fake \"likes\" and followers that had targeted news outlets, with USA Today losing nearly six million overnight.\n\nSix weeks after the purge, USA Today asked the FBI to investigate the \"swarm\" of fake accounts.\n\nShortly after the shock election of President Donald Trump in November 2016, news reports examined Facebook's role as an information publisher. BuzzFeed found that fake news reached more people than real news during the campaign season, and traced more than 100 pro-Trump accounts to a single town in Macedonia.\n\nMark Zuckerberg initially downplayed the findings, calling the possibility that fake news swayed the election \"pretty crazy,\" but later said he regretted being so dismissive.\n\nIn September, Facebook revealed that it had sold about $100,000 worth of ads to fake accounts linked to Russia during the U.S. presidential campaign. The ads reached as many as 126 million people, it estimated. Faced with the threat of legislation that would require it to disclose its advertisers, Facebook rolled out a tool that allows users to check who's behind the ads they are seeing.\n\nLast month, 13 Russian actors were indicted for their role in the campaign, accused of breaking U.S. laws to meddle in the elections via advertisements and groups on Facebook. \"We know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\" said the company, whose name appears 35 times in the indictment.\n\nPolitical intelligence firm Cambridge Analytica is the latest entity to be in hot water over misusing Facebook members' data. The firm, at one point run by former White House adviser Steve Bannon and tied to Republican donor Robert Mercer, acquired data on 50 million Facebook members that it used to develop \"psychographic\" profiles.\n\nThe tool worked through an app built by researcher Aleksandr Kogan. The app, titled \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" gave users a personality prediction, and asked to share their data for \"research purposes.\" But Kogan used it to effectively scrape profiles of users who signed up for the app -- as well as that of their friends -- amassing detailed information on tens of millions users. (Hillary Clinton did something similar in the 2016 campaign, and Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2011 used the same developer tool to target voters.)\n\nFacebook on Friday suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, and said it was launching a \"forensic audit\" into the events. The social network, however, disputed the characterization of the event. Cambridge Analytica has also suspended its CEO pending an investigation.\n\n\"The claim that this is a data breach is completely false,\" Facebook initially wrote. \"[E]veryone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\" Kogan only broke the platform's terms, Facebook said, when he handed over the information to a third party, and when he falsely certified to Facebook that he had destroyed the data.\n\nThe fact that a company party was able to gain access to such detailed information with minimal vetting, and without actually hacking Facebook's systems, was not lost on privacy activists. Many on Twitter criticized Facebook for the amount of data it controls and its ability to unilaterally exclude users.\n\nThe FTC on Tuesday reportedly began a probe into whether Facebook violated its 2012 agreement when it allowed \"thisisyourdigitallife\" to access information of friends of those who signed up, without informing them of the matter.\n\n\"We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday. It could be just the beginning. The attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York have launched an investigation into Facebook and its handling of the data Cambridge Analytica received. Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have spoken disapprovingly of Facebook's flub, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) calling for Zuckerberg to testify before Congress.",

                "body": "OAKLAND -- With more and more businesses looking to capitalize on California's legalization of recreational marijuana, a company is trying to market a new pot-infused soda as an alternative to drinking alcohol, reports CBS San Francisco. The Seven City Beverage Company claims the product includes the right amount of THC to produce a mild high.\n\nBut while creators and distributors are thinking green when it comes to profits, some medical professionals see plenty of red flags.\n\nThe new soda start-up calls its beverage California Dreamin'. The company aims for the drink to become an alternative to alcohol -- without the hangover. The company's motto: California Dream' is a \"cannabis-infused soda for a light social high.\"\n\n\"The market is ever-changing. There are so many products and options,\" explained Jennifer Jordan, Director of Operations for Oakland pot shop and delivery service Diamond Bonsai. \"On a busy day we have about 10 different vendors who call us and offer products.\"\n\nJordan's dispensary was one of the first to carry California Dreamin'.\n\n\"A lot of the drinks that are on the market are 100 milligrams and for people who smoke or who are used to THC,\" said Jordan. \"It's not only natural and has a delicious flavor, but it's 10 milligrams, so it's a low-dose. It's not intimidating to anyone, so you can casually drink it\"\n\nUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland pediatrician Noemi Spinazzi is concerned kids could easily mistake it for regular soda. She told CBS San Fransicso studies have proven marijuana isn't safe for the developing brain.\n\n\"It makes me worried that products that look so enticing can be so easily available in someone's home,\" said Spinazzi. \"They may not recognize the difference in the flavor and drinking as much or as little as they feel like drinking. And truly, we do see children in our emergency room come in with marijuana intoxication, typically because they got their hands on products that were left unsupervised.\"\n\nJordan understands the concern. She says there are California packaging and labeling requirements to make sure these products are childproof and don't get in the wrong hands.\n\nShe also said it is important for adults to drink the new soda responsibly.",

Pruitte knew she had to get to her daughter quickly, so she stopped in the middle of the street.\n\n\"I noticed she was choking on her milk out of her nose, so I put the hazards on and got out of the car and the police came out of nowhere and helped me with the back thrusts for her to breathe,\" she said.\n\nWhen Shaker Heights Police Officers Ryan Sidders and Alex Oklander spotted the stopped car, they had no idea what was wrong.\n\n\"We were thinking maybe the car broke down and needed a tow truck in route or something like that,\" Sidders said. \"Then we see the mother exit the car and run to the other side really, really quickly.\"\n\n\"The mom seemed kind of frantic and didn't really know what to do,\" said Oklander.\n\nThankfully, the officers did know what to do. They grabbed the baby and put their training into action. Before long, Tyra began breathing.\n\n\"Thank God, as soon as we heard that cough, we were both kind of the like, 'Phew!\"' Sidders said.\n\nIt was a sigh of relief for the officers and for Pruitte, who knows how lucky she is.\n\n\"It could've been my life and her life too today, because I had to stop in the middle of traffic,\" she said.\n\nIf your car is moving, pull to the shoulder immediately because time is of the essence.

                "body": "NEW YORK -- New York City's buildings regulator launched investigations at more than a dozen Kushner Cos. properties Wednesday following an Associated Press report that the real estate developer routinely filed false paperwork claiming it had zero rent-regulated tenants in its buildings across the city. The AP reported Sunday that Kushner Cos. stated in more than 80 permit applications that it had zero rent-regulated tenants in its buildings when it, in fact, had hundreds.\n\nThe Department of Buildings is investigating possible \"illegal activity\" involving applications that sought permission to begin construction work at 13 of the developer's buildings, according to public records maintained by the regulator.\n\nThe false filings were made while Kushner Cos. was run by Jared Kushner, now senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald Trump. The false filings were all signed by a Kushner employee, sometimes by its chief operating officer. None were signed by Jared Kushner himself.\n\nThe false documents allowed the Kushner Cos. to escape extra scrutiny during construction at 34 of its buildings, many which showed a sharp decline in rent-regulated units following the work. Housing Rights Initiative, a watchdog group that uncovered the false filings, says that made it easier for the Kushner Cos. to harass the low-paying, rent-regulated tenants so they would leave, freeing up apartments for higher-paying tenants.\n\nThe Kushner Cos. said Wednesday that it is the victim of \"politically motivated attacks.\" It said it values and respects its tenants and operates under \"the highest legal and ethical standards.\"\n\nIn earlier statements the company said it outsourced preparation of its permit applications to third parties, and described the wrong information as \"mistakes or typographical errors.\" It also said it corrected mistakes as soon as it spotted them.\n\nThe buildings department confirmed on Wednesday that its building marshal's office had launched investigations into possible false paperwork.\n\n\"Our building marshal is a key part of our Tenant Harassment Task Force,\" spokesman Joseph Soldevere said. \"And when they inspect a building they look into everything from the roof to the cellar to find illegal construction, and that's what they are doing.\"\n\nThe agency has disciplined a contractor involved in false filings at two Kushner buildings, he said.\n\nThe Kushners Cos. filed more than one permit application at many of the buildings under investigation. At least 10 of the 29 applications under investigation were filed by prior owners.\n\nOn Monday, the city council launched a joint investigation with Housing Rights Initiative into the false filings.\n\nThe heads of the joint investigations, Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, and Housing Rights Initiative founder Aaron Carr, said in a statement that they were encouraged by the buildings department probe, but that more needed to be done.\n\n\"The predatory practices of Kushner Companies is symptomatic of a systemic failure in DOB enforcement,\" it said.",

                "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- Video was released Wednesday of a deadly self-driving vehicle crash in suburban Phoenix that shows a pedestrian walking from a darkened area onto a street just moments before an Uber SUV strikes her. The video shows the human backup driver in the SUV looking down until seconds before the crash. The driver looked up and appeared startled during the last moment of the clip.\n\nThe 21.8-second video clip stops short of showing the impact and contains views from an exterior camera and an interior one, CBS Tucson affiliate KOLD-TV reports. The lights on the SUV didn't illuminate 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg on Sunday night until a second or two before impact, raising questions about whether the vehicle could have stopped in time.\n\nThe footage was provided by police and came a day after Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir told a newspaper that the SUV likely wouldn't be found at fault.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle quoted Moir saying that it would have been difficult to avoid the collision.\n\n\"I suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident, either,\" Moir told the Chronicle.\n\nThe Arizona Republic also quoted the police chief as saying the crash was \"unavoidable\" based on an initial investigation and a review of the video.\n\nMoir didn't respond to a call and email Wednesday from The Associated Press seeking comment. Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, declined to comment Wednesday on the chief's views on who is at fault in the crash.\n\nAt this point, it's not clear if any charges will be filed in connection with the crash, KOLD-TV reports. That will be up to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.\n\nThe crash Sunday night in Tempe was the first death involving a full autonomous test vehicle. The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck Herzberg, police said.\n\nUber immediately suspended all road-testing of such autos in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, which makes recommendations for preventing crashes, is investigating the crash.\n\n\"The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine's loved ones,\" said Uber spokesman Andrew Hasbun. \"Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.\"\n\nTempe police have identified the driver as 44-year-old Rafael Vasquez. It appears that Vasquez spent more than four years in prison for two felony convictions before starting work as an Uber driver. Local media have identified the driver as Rafaela Vasquez. The AP has not been able to reach Vasquez and authorities would not explain the discrepancy.\n\nElcock and the National Transportation Safety Board declined to say whether the Rafael Vasquez who was involved in the fatal crash is the same Rafael Vasquez who has two criminal convictions.\n\nStill, the birth dates of the person who did the prison stint and the driver in Sunday's crash were the same.\n\nIn 2000, Vasquez pleaded guilty to making false statements when obtaining unemployment benefits. Later that year, Vasquez pleaded guilty to attempted armed robbery for participating in a staged robbery, according to court records.\n\nThe robbery occurred when Vasquez, who at the time worked at a video rental store, and another store employee went to a Scottsdale bank at night to deposit $2,700. Although he appeared at first blush to be a victim, police say Vasquez had staged the robbery with a friend to pay off the friend's drug debt and give Vasquez a portion of the proceeds, according to court records.\n\nAttempts by the AP to contact Vasquez through phone numbers and social media on Wednesday afternoon weren't successful.\n\nThe fatality has raised questions about Uber is doing enough to screen its drivers.\n\nHasbun said Vasquez met the company's vetting requirements.\n\nThe company bans drivers who are convicted of violent crimes or any felony within the past seven years - which Vasquez would have passed given that records show the offenses occurred in 1999 and 2000.\n\nThe company's website lists its pre-screening policies for drivers that spell out what drivers can and cannot have on their record to work for Uber.\n\nTheir driving history can't have any DUI or drug-related driving offenses within the past seven years, for instance. They also can't have more than three non-fatal accidents or moving violations within the past three years.\n\nHasbun said the company doesn't use different background check requirements for autonomous vehicle operators compared to those who pick up passengers in their own vehicles.\n\nIn addition to going through the same background checks as standard Uber drivers, the company puts its autonomous vehicle drivers through a training program that includes heading out on public roads with experienced operators and written exams.\n\nHasbun confirmed that these requirements apply across the country, and that the company will also defer to states that have their own controlling laws.\n\nArizona has its own requirements for transportation network company drivers that prohibit registered sex offenders and those who have committed certain serious offenses within the past seven years.",

                "title": "Mark Zuckerberg: \"One of the biggest mistakes\" of Facebook is not digging deeper into Cambridge Analytica",
                "body": "Watch CBSN's exclusive interview with Wired's editor-in-chief in the video player above.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is speaking publicly for the first time since a whistleblower described how a data firm exploited a loophole to access to data from 50 million Facebook users. Hours after releasing a statement (on Facebook) Zuckerberg spoke to Wired editor-in-chief Nick Thompson about what he called \"one of our biggest mistakes.\"\n\nThompson spoke to CBSN about his interview with Zuckerberg, who revealed \"there are probably 15 changes\" it will take \"to further restrict data.\"\n\nBoth Zuckerberg and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg remained silent amid reports that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which has links to President Trump's 2016 campaign, exploited a loophole in Facebook that allowed it to access data using an app created by a third-party research firm. Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica last week, saying the firm had not deleted the data in 2015, as it had claimed to.\n\nFacebook (FB) learned about the Cambridge Analytica incident in late 2015 and had the firm sign a legal undertaking that the data would be deleted, Thompson wrote in his article. But this week's reports that cast doubt on that set of circumstances. Thompson questioned Zuckerberg about not digging deeper into Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"The first action that we now need to go take is to not just rely on certifications that we've gotten from developers, but actually need to go and do a full investigation of every single app that was operating before we had the more restrictive platform policies -- that had access to a lot of data -- and for any app that has any suspicious activity, we're going to go in and do a full forensic audit,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And any developer who won't sign up for that, we're going to kick off the [Facebook] platform.\"\n\nZuckerberg added: \"That's the step that I think we should have done for Cambridge Analytica ... we're now going to go do it for every developer who is on the platform who had access to a large amount of data before we locked things down in 2014.\"\n\nFacebook has come under increasing fire for failing to protect users' data early enough and strongly enough, and also for how it pushed back on the misuse of 50 million users' data, seemingly focusing on the semantics of whether or not it amounted to a \"data breach\" in the strictest sense.\n\n\"I think the feedback that we've gotten from our community and from the world is that privacy and having the data locked down is more important to people than maybe making it easier to bring more data and have different kinds of experiences,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg's earlier statement noted there was a \"breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us\" and said the company \"made mistakes\" on what he referred to as the \"Cambridge Analytica situation.\"\n\nZuckerberg said the company made changes in 2014 to restrict the amount of data app developers can access. He said Facebook will now take additional steps, such as removing developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in three months, and reducing the amount of personal information an app gets when you sign in. Other than via apps, Zuckerbeg's statements made no mention of dialling back the amount of data gathered on users, or giving the user any additional control over the amount of data they surrender to the platform.\n\nTo help users understand which third-party apps have access to their data, Zuckerberg said, \"In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.\"\n\nYou can read his full statement here:\n\nFacebook is facing a growing backlash on Capitol Hill as more lawmakers demand that Zuckerberg testify. Some are calling for increased regulations on big tech companies.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify under oath in public before the Judiciary Committee. He owes it to the American people who ought to be deeply disappointed by the conflicting and disparate explanations that have been offered,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, told reporters Monday. The former Connecticut attorney general warned, \"Zuckerberg ought to be subpoenaed to testify if he won't do it voluntarily.\"\n\nAfter Zuckerberg's statement on Wednesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said the committee still wants to question him. \"The steps Facebook has laid out to protect its user data are a start but Mark Zuckerberg still needs to come testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"In addition, Facebook should show good faith by supporting the Honest Ads Act and the company will have to deal with the FTC investigation and other legal proceedings as a result of this breach.\"",

Saccone has already announced he will run for Congress in another district.\n\n\"This afternoon, I spoke to Mr. Lamb, conceding the race in the Pennsylvania 18th Congressional District and congratulating him on his victory,\" Sacone said in a note provided to CBS News. \"While there are less than 800 votes separating us, the people of the 18th District deserve to have a voice representing them in Congress. I am honored and humbled to have worked with so many talented and committed supporters. Their tireless dedication to this campaign inspired and motivated me each and every day. While Yong and I are certainly disappointed with the outcome, I remain resolute in defending the voices of Southwestern Pennsylvania voters. I will continue this fight as a candidate in the 14th Congressional District.\"\n\nLamb was first to say Saccone had conceded.\n\nSaccone had declined to give up for days, even after the number of outstanding votes to be counted were fewer than he needed to win. Lamb won by just a few hundred votes, and Republicans turned to a possible recount or legal recourse. Ultimately, Saccone didn't pursue that option.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned for Saccone ahead of the special election, and on Tuesday called Saccone a \"good man\" at a fundraiser for the National Congressional Campaign Committee (NRCC). Mr. Trump reportedly told donors last week that Lamb won because he ran \"like Trump.\"\n\nNRCC Chairman Steve Stivers told CBS News Saccone was \"out-raised and outspent by a factor of five\" in that race.\n\n\"That means Conor Lamb, the Democrat, spent more on television in the last week than our candidate spent the entire campaign,\" Stivers said on \"The Takeout\" podcast with CBS News' Major Garrett this week.\n\nLamb, a 33-year-old former Marine and former federal prosecutor, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, addressing House Democrats.",

Manley said police recovered the cellphone at the scene.\n\n\"I would classify this as a confession,\" said Manley.\n\nManley said Conditt there is no mention of terrorism or hate in the video, describing the recording as \"the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life.\"\n\nPolice say they have recovered all of the devices, but still urge the public to remain aware of their surroundings.\n\n\"We still want our community to remain vigilant as we always should, given the day and time in which we live now,\" Manley said.\n\nThe Pflugerville resident blew himself up earlier Wednesday as police closed in on him. Authorities later removed homemade explosives from Conditt's home.\n\nIn total, two people were killed and four others were wounded in the series of bombings that rattled the community. Conditt's motive for constructing and distributing the explosive packages remains a mystery.",

According to CBS affiliate WBNS, the jury deliberated for seven hours on Tuesday and Wednesday before ultimately rejecting the death penalty.\n\nBefore the judge pronounced Golsby's sentence, Reagan's mother Lisa McCrary-Tokes gave a tearful statement to the court.\n\n\"Regardless of the outcome of today's verdict, it doesn't bring our daughter back,\" she said. \"It doesn't erase the night of terror that Reagan had to endure. It doesn't erase the graphic details and images that are forever burned into our minds.\"\n\n\"The terror and pain that she endured that night at the hands of evil -- she deserved better. And our loss and pain will never get better.\"\n\nGolsby had apologized in court and asked jurors for mercy. His lawyers argued his traumatic childhood shaped his actions and urged that his life be spared.\n\nThe prosecutor said Wednesday he was satisfied Golsby will no longer be a threat to society.\n\nTokes' body was found in 2017 at a park in Grove City, about 10 miles southwest of Columbus.",
