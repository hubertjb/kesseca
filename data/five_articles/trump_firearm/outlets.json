{"Breitbart": "Hagan: The America First Approach To Stopping School Shootings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tby Christina Hagan22 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t22 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t21 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn the wake of the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, pundits and politicians have proposed dozens of ideas to prevent the next school shooting that range from banning semi-automatic weapons to arming teachers. When elected to Congress in the fall, I will put forward a bill with an America First answer to this problem.\nSchools have become soft targets for individuals suffering from specific mental disorders; this unfortunate situation has become our new normal. However, that doesn\u2019t mean we have to ban guns or arm teachers to combat this issue. As the nation saw from the school shooting on Tuesday at Great Mills High School in Maryland, the best way to defend students from mass shootings is to have armed guards on school property.\n\nThe America First position is for our federal government to pay unemployed or retired military and police officers to arm our schools, tackling two issues at once: Creating jobs for veterans and retired police while keeping our schools safe.\n\nAs of 2014, according to The National Center for Educational Statistics, there are 131,890 public and private elementary and secondary schools in the U.S., all of which need some form of armed security given our current state of affairs.\n\nIf the federal government were to hire one to two armed guards per school, approximately 250,000 in total, it would cost taxpayers an estimated $10 to $12 billion annually.\n\nBy redirecting funds already misused overseas, we could ensure safety for America\u2019s children without adding to our national deficit or disarming law-abiding citizens. A report from 2017 by John Sopko, special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, found that the federal government is spending millions of dollars a year paying for the salaries of Afghanistan soldiers that don\u2019t even exist. According to Sopko, the U.S. pays the wages of about 320,000 Afghan police and soldiers, but only 120,000 actually exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans are paying for Afghan soldiers that don\u2019t exist while our children are vulnerable; this is unconscionable.\n\nAnother area where the federal government could redirect funds from is United State Agency for International Developments which will spend $15 million by 2019 to train cashiers for Walmart in Mexico, Kenya, India, and Spain, another $21 million to purchase motorbikes for Pakistani Dairy Farmers, and $98 million to promote tourism in Jordan.\n\nBy redirecting these funds to protect our schools, we will not only ensure the safety of our students but employment opportunities to veterans and retired police.\n\nAll school safety employees would need to meet a specific list of standards that include physical and mental well-being, proper training to deal with a school shooter, as well as an honorable discharge. This plan could be one of the most significant job creators for unemployed vets, especially to the 188,000 unemployed who served in Gulf War I and II, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis America First approach will protect our children, redirect wasted federal funds, and neither be a burden on the taxpayer or legal gun owners. It\u2019s a win for all Americans and will be one my first priorities when elected in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristina Hagan has represented District 50 in the Ohio State House since 2011. She\u2019s currently running for Congress in Ohio District 16 and is endorsed by Rep. Jim Jordan, Rep. Mark Meadows, Gov. Jan Brewer, Anthony Scaramucci, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Pastor Darrell Scott, and Ohio Value Voters.", "Fox News": "Vice President Mike Pence touted the Trump administration's first year in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C.\u00a0\n\nHe emphasized that the administration's immigration enforcement policies are working and said the border wall will be built.\u00a0\n\n\"President Trump promised to enforce our laws, secure our borders, and today illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut nearly in half and make no mistake about it, we're going to build that wall,\" he told the crowd, drawing raucous cheers.\u00a0\n\n\nHe said the president \"came through\" by appointing strong conservatives to the federal courts and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u00a0\n\nPence said the White House is committed to the safety of American schools as its \"top national priority\" and that \"strong action\" will be taken to keep schools safe after the Feb. 14 massacre in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\"We pray for God's wisdom that all of us in positions of authority might find a way to come together with American solutions to confront and end this evil in our time,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPence and Trump held a listening session on Wednesday with students, parents and teachers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, backing the idea of training teachers to use firearms.\n\nTrump is scheduled to address CPAC on Friday at 10:00am ET.\n\n\"I spoke to him this morning. He can't wait to get here!\" Pence told the crowd.", "The Blaze": "Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott put his A-plus rating with the National Rifle Association at risk by signing into law gun regulations that give both sides some of what they want while also leaving everyone wanting more.\n\nAbout the law\nThe law is called the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. Here\u2019s what it does:\n\n\nRaises the minimum age for firearm purchases to 21 from 18\nImposes a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases\nBans the sale or possession of bump stocks\nFunds a program to allow some teachers and school staff to carry guns after 132 hours of firearm training and 12 hours of diversity training\nMakes it easier for law enforcement to temporarily seize guns and ammo from people with mental health issues\nProvides additional funding for mental health services\nFunds the destruction and rebuilding of Douglas High School\u2019s freshman building\n\nScott\u2019s stance on the law\nScott said he opposed parts of the law, including the new waiting period and the program to arm teachers. Still, he touted it as a good solution and a conversation-starter.\n\n\u201cI am going to do what I think are common sense solutions,\u201d Scott said, according to The Washington Post. \u201cI think this is the beginning. There is now going to be a real conversation about how we make our schools safe.\u201d\n\nScott, who is eyeing a Senate bid against Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), criticized the federal government for failing to take any meaningful steps following the tragedy in Parkland.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the federal government, nothing seems to have happened there,\u201d Scott said. \u201cYou go elect people, you expect them to represent you, get things done.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s support of the bill contrasts with his comments on the Second Amendment, made at the NRA Annual Meeting in April.\n\n\u201cWe love tourists, new residents and the Second Amendment,\u201d Scott said in April, according to The Washington Post. \u201cWhat does \u2018shall not\u2019 infringe on the people\u2019s right to bear arms mean? It means shall not infringe. It\u2019s not really complicated.\u201d\n\nCriticism of the law\nThe law strikes a tenuous political middle ground, as Democrats and other gun control advocates would have preferred to see an assault weapons ban included, while many Republicans, the NRA and other gun rights advocates believe the restrictions in the law represent a violation of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe NRA attempted to mobilize citizens against the bill earlier in the week, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cYOU and every other law-abiding gun owner is being blamed for an atrocious act of premeditated murder,\u201d wrote NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer on Tuesday. \u201cNeither the 3-day waiting period on all rifles and shotguns, raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy any firearm, or the bump stock ban will have any effect on crime. Despite that fact, Senate leaders rammed through gun control as part of the bill.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Education Association opposed the funding to arm teachers, which Scott allowed in the law despite having the ability to use a line-item veto to reject it.", "CBN News": "President Donald Trump said Friday the Florida sheriff's deputy who failed to stop last week's mass shooting at a Parkland high school was a either a \"coward\" or just froze under extreme pressure.\n\n\"When it came time to get in there and do something, he didn't have the courage or something happened. But he certainly did a poor job. There's no question about that,\" Trump said. \"That's a case where somebody was outside, they're trained, they didn't act properly or under pressure or they were a coward. It was a real shock to the police department.\"\n\nTrump made the comments before speaking to the Conservative Political Action Committee in National Harbor, Maryland, where he reiterated his proposal to arm teachers, coaches and staff members who have experience with firearms either through military or law enforcement experience.\n\nDuring his speech, President Trump said, \"These teachers love their students. And these teachers are talented with weaponry and with guns. I'd rather have somebody who loves their students and wants to protect their students than someone standing outside who doesn't know anybody.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Thursday it made him sick to watch Deputy Scot Peterson remain outside the school building instead of attempting to stop the shooter.\n\nSheriff Isreal said Officer Peterson took up a position on the west side of Building 12, where most of the carnage happened, but did nothing.\n\n\"I think he remained outside for upwards of four minutes,\" Israel said Thursday in a news conference. The shooting, he said, lasted six minutes.\n\nThe sheriff came to that conclusion after watching surveillance video, talking to witnesses and getting a statement from Peterson.\n\nThe deputy has now resigned from the force.\n\nNikolas Cruz,19, is accused of killing 17 people, including students and teachers.\n\nThe president's speech at CPAC speech followed an address by National Rifle Association Vice President Wayne LaPierre on Thursday in which he accused gun control advocates of exploiting the school shooting for political gain.\n\nTrump conceded that his proposal to arm teachers was controversial, but emphasized that teachers would be well-trained.", "Townhall": "Do conservatives -- or non-leftists, for that matter -- appreciate just how terrific Donald Trump has been as president? And how lucky we are that he won the presidency?I don't know the answer. What I do know is that they ought to be deeply appreciative of him, and deeply grateful for luck or providence, and certainly for Trump himself, that he was elected president. First, it is unlikely that any other Republican would have defeated Hillary Clinton. Second, he has not only surpassed many of our expectations but also thus far governed in a manner more consistent with conservative principles than any president since Ronald Reagan, and arguably Calvin Coolidge.I say this as one who vigorously opposed him during the Republican contest for the nomination. I said from the beginning, in print and on my radio show, that I would support Trump if he became the nominee, but I dreaded his becoming the nominee. His comments about the size of his hands, Sen. John McCain as a prisoner of war and former President George W. Bush lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; his lack of any history as a conservative; and the seeming absence of a filter between his brain and his Twitter app made it difficult for me to imagine him as a serious president of the United States.Nevertheless, once he was nominated, I just as vigorously supported him on the simple and -- I still believe -- unanswerable grounds that while no one could be certain how Trump would govern, we were all certain about how Hillary Clinton would govern -- as a leftist. And I truly believed that another four years of left-wing rule would mean the end of America as it was founded to be.That is why I found the arguments of the conservatives who were Never-Trumpers, many of whom I work with, admire and count as friends, not just unpersuasive but incomprehensible. That a conservative could prefer Clinton -- which was the only upshot of a Never Trump position -- to any Republican could only mean that we have an entirely different understanding of the damage the left has done and would have done to America and the Western world if Clinton had won.I remember Never-Trumpers calling my radio show and asking me how I could possibly believe that, if elected president, Trump would honor his commitment to nominate to the Supreme Court one of the conservatives on the list of judges from which he promised to choose. He has honored that promise. And given the supreme importance of the Supreme Court, isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?He has repealed many of President Obama's energy regulations that would have strangled the American economy. He doesn't believe that carbon-induced warming of the planet will destroy the human race -- the greatest of the innumerable hysterias the left manufactures and then believes in. Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?He has appointed a woman who, as a billionaire, could have easily devoted her life to enjoying her wealth but instead has fought for American students and their parents to be able choose their schools just as the wealthy do. And he has taken on the teachers unions, the only group that has ever given American teachers a bad name. Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?He has appointed as ambassador to the United Nations a woman who is calling the U.N. the naked emperor that it is. And now, America is backing, rather than subverting, Israel in that benighted institution.Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?By building a wall along our southern border, he is reasserting the belief that America actually has borders. Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?And then there is tax reduction and simplification so that private citizens can keep more of their money and corporations can be far more productive.Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?And now, he has vowed, after decades of American obsequiousness, to confront the sociopathic North Korean regime.The American media -- most particularly, its elite -- no longer even feigns objective reporting. It is solely an arm of the left and the Democratic Party, its task being the delegitimization of the Trump presidency.If you live among liberals, it is not chic to express support for President Trump. But it is time more of us did. If people abandon you because you support this president, they weren't serious friends to begin with. And, sorry to say, they aren't worthy of you. Somehow, you have been able to look beyond their support for the America- and West-destroying left. But they can't look beyond your support for the first conservative president in a generation -- and the gutsiest perhaps ever.If the president's approval rating really is in the 30s, this makes overt support for him all the more imperative. Whether you like his tweets or not, his fate is our fate.", "ABC News": "President Donald Trump continued his calls to arm more teachers with guns to protect schools in a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Friday.\n\n\nHe predicted that congressional action will \"happen very quickly\" on improving the background check system and regulating bump stocks - devices that can be used to effectively turn a legal rifle into a machine gun. \n\n\nEarlier this week Trump directed the Justice Department to draft new regulations to ban bump stocks.\n\n\nHis comments echoed what he said Friday morning in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference where he repeated his calls to arm some teachers and provide more security to schools, as well as providing more mental health support.\n\n\nThis is a developing story. Please refresh for updates.", "ABC News Australia": "The head of the National Rifle Association (NRA) has lashed out at gun control advocates, saying Democratic elites are politicising the latest mass school shooting in the United States to try to erode constitutionally guaranteed gun rights.\n\nNRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre echoed President Donald Trump's call to arm teachers to prevent school shootings, and weighed into a long-running political and cultural divide over access to weapons that has been inflamed by last week's massacre at a Florida high school that killed 17 students and staff.\n\n\"Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment [of the constitution] and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.\"\n\nThe NRA is a politically influential lobby group that endorsed Mr Trump for president in 2016 and has close ties to conservative Republicans.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms.\n\nAt the White House, Mr Trump told local and state school officials he had been in touch with the NRA about his ideas to stem gun violence in schools and said \"there's a tremendous feeling that we want to get something done\".\n\nThe Valentine's Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida was the latest in a series of deadly shootings at US schools and has spurred unprecedented youth-led protests in cities across the country.\n\nMany of the teenagers and their parents taking part have called for more curbs on guns.\n\nMr LaPierre, speaking at the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference, portrayed the NRA as the true protector of the country's schoolchildren and offered free training to those who want to bear arms to protect schools.\n\n\"We must immediately harden our schools,\" he said.\n\n\"Every day, young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder.\"\n\nIt should not be easier to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewellery store, he added.\n\nMr LaPierre attacked Democrats by name including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Christopher Murphy, and also took a swipe at the FBI for failing to follow up on a tip about the alleged shooter in the Parkland massacre.\n\nA top FBI official has acknowledged that the nation's top law enforcement agency had lost public trust for failing to investigate the tip, a mistake he suggested was the result of bad judgment.\n\nDavid Bowdich, the FBI's acting deputy director, said he personally visited the FBI's West Virginia call centre this week as part of a review of why a warning that the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, had access to guns and a \"desire to kill\" was not referred to agents in Florida for further investigation.\n\n\"People make judgments out on the street every day,\" Mr Bowdich said, adding that the bureau is still trying to determine exactly what went wrong.\n\n\"Every now and then those judgments may not have been the best judgments based on the information they had at the time.\"\n\nDemocratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer condemned Mr LaPierre's comments and said the NRA was \"once again spewing pathetic, out of touch ideas, blaming everything but guns\".\n\nMr Trump reiterated his idea, first raised on Wednesday, of arming teachers.\n\nThe President called for teachers to be \"highly trained, gun adept\", saying gun-free schools are \"a magnet for bad people\".\n\nHe pushed for an offensive strategy, warning \"defence alone won't work\" and said armed teachers could \"solve the problem instantly, before police arrive\".", "Daily Beast": "President Trump will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday, May 16, the White House announced on Wednesday. \u201cThe two leaders will discuss how to further strengthen our bilateral relationship and deepen our cooperation to confront terrorism in all its forms,\u201d the White House statement read.

Dan Burke (D); Ram Villivilam\u2019s defeat of state Sen. Ira Silverstein (D); and Brandon Johnson\u2019s narrow defeat of Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin.\n\n\nIn addition, Alma Anaya was elected to fill the Cook County Board of Commissioners seat vacated by Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, who won his congressional race.\u00a0Delia Ramirez picked up an open Illinois House seat and Beatriz Frausto-Sandoval won her race for 14th Subcircuit judge.\n\n\n\u201cThe Chicago machine today is licking its wounds,\u201d said Clem Balanoff, a longtime progressive strategist and former state lawmaker who\u2019s now executive director of Our Revolution Illinois,\u00a0a local chapter of the legacy group of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a02016 campaign. \u201cThey could be the fatal wounds.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that change is in the air,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface, the issues that dominated these down-ballot races were often far removed from the national discussion. But upon closer examination, they track closely with the intra-Democratic debates taking place across the country, where progressive newcomers are challenging incumbents to do more to curb growing economic and racial inequality.\n\n\nIn the case of the Cook County assessor\u2019s race, there was also the factor of seemingly brazen corruption in Chicago. Berrios, who has spoken unapologetically about securing government jobs for family members, was under fire after an investigation revealed that he had systematically been over-assessing the property taxes of less valuable homes and under-assessing the homes of wealthier individuals. Between October and February, Berrios received $276,000 in campaign contributions from property tax appeals attorneys who represent wealthy clients in cases Berrios oversees.\n\n\nBalanoff was initially skeptical of getting behind a \u201cfinancial guy\u201d like Kaegi, a former mutual fund manager,\u00a0but concluded that there was a \u201creal genuineness\u201d in his commitment to a more transparent and less regressive property tax assessment system.\n\n\nWith the help of Our Revolution Illinois and other grassroots groups, Kaegi prevailed Tuesday by promising a fairer system for the city\u2019s middle-class homeowners. He defeated the two-term incumbent and Cook County party chairman by 15 percentage points.\n\n\nVictories like Kaegi\u2019s did not come about in a vaccum. Chicago\u2019s progressive movement has been growing steadily in recent years, beginning with a successful strike launched by the left-leaning Chicago Teachers Union in 2012. \n\n\nThe strike humiliated Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), whose business-friendly policies had already put him on a collision course with grassroots activists. He has presided over massive public school and mental health clinic closings, as well as upscale urban development that has pushed out some members of the city\u2019s longtime black and Latino communities.\n\n\nEfforts to check Emanuel and the coalition of politicians with whom he makes common cause have gradually matured since then. \n\n\n\nThere is no progressive movement anywhere in this country if it not does not underscore black, left progressive men and women winning elected office.\nStacy Davis Gates, Chicago Teachers Union\n\n\nChuy Garc\u00eda\u00a0came up short in his attempt to unseat Emanuel in 2015. But with the backing of the teachers union and other progressive groups, he shocked the Chicago Democratic machine by forcing an unprecedented runoff.\n\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen since then is a steady stream of movement in the electoral realm that this city hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Stacy Davis Gates, the political director of the Chicago Teachers Union, said of the 2015 race.\n\n\n1) Our movements laid the foundation for tonight's four-for-four sweep back in 2015.\n\u2014 UWF Illinois (@UWFIllinois) March 21, 2018\n\n\n\nSanders\u2019\u00a02016 presidential run gave the region\u2019s progressives another jolt of energy. In Hillary Clinton\u2019s home state of Illinois, she defeated Sanders by just 1.8 percentage points thanks in part to the enthusiasm Sanders inspired in Chicago\u2019s young people and restive activists.\n\n\nBy the time the 2018 primaries rolled around, there were several significant locuses of progressive power in Chicago with the resources to recruit and elect a new crop of candidates. Garc\u00eda\u2019s mayoral run made him a household name throughout the city and expanded his political organization in the predominantly Latino parts of western Chicago; Our Revolution Illinois was flush with energized activists; and the Chicago Teachers Union was spoiling for another fight.\n\n\nUnited Working Families, a local branch of the labor-backed Working Families Party, had also made key inroads into the city\u2019s black and Latino communities. \u00a0\n\n\nTogether, these groups provided the financing and field organizing operations that younger or lesser-known candidates needed to challenge entrenched incumbents and compete in contentious open seats.\n\n\nGarc\u00eda, who was virtually assured of victory in Illinois\u2019 4th Congressional District from the moment he stepped into the race, leveraged his political operation to ensure the election of younger progressive Latinos. The clearest beneficiaries from his reach in west and southwest Chicago were Alma Anaya, one of his former aides; Aaron Ortiz, a 26-year-old college counselor and member of the Chicago Teachers Union; labor activist Delia Ramirez; and immigration lawyer Beatriz Frausto-Sandoval.\n\n\nOrtiz\u2019s win was especially notable because he unseated Dan Burke, 66, who had represented the state House district since before Ortiz was born. Ortiz criticized Burke for the ties of his brother, Chicago Alderman Ed Burke, to President Donald Trump. Ed Burke\u2019s law firm has saved Trump millions of dollars in taxes on Chicago\u2019s Trump Tower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Johnson\u2019s Cook County Board Of Commissioners win, by a few hundred votes, also carried special significance.\n\n\nJohnson, a Chicago Teachers Union member and organizer on the West Side, is now one of the Chicago area\u2019s most progressive black elected officials. One reason Garc\u00eda lost in 2015 was because of his inability to peel black voters away from Emanuel.\n\n\nEnsuring that Chicago\u2019s progressive leadership adequately represents the city\u2019s formidable black population is essential to electing a progressive mayor and other powerful leaders, according to Davis Gates. It also provides a road map for national progressives like Sanders, whose struggle to gain traction among African-American voters likely cost him the Democratic nomination, Davis Gates said.\n\n\n\u201cThere is no progressive movement anywhere in this country if it not does not underscore black, left progressive men and women winning elected office,\u201d Davis Gates said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders alone is not gonna be enough to compel black people to turn out and vote,\u201d she added.\n\n\nAt the same time, the teachers union\u2019s decision to go all in for Johnson reflected its disdain for Richard Boykin,\u00a0an African-American\u00a0corporate lobbyist and former chief of staff to Rep. Danny Davis (D).\u00a0Boykin\u00a0opposed Johnson\u2019s ideas to raise progressive revenue for the county that would enable it to save public jobs. He also responded to the city\u2019s epidemic of gang violence by calling for alleged shooters to be tried as \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d\u00a0and inviting United Nations peacekeepers to occupy his district.\n\n\n\u201cPeople like Brandon Johnson are critical as we move ahead in this movement,\u201d Davis Gates said. \u201cIf the national scene is Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and Illinois has J.B.

Since Poland\u2019s conservative Law and Justice Party came to power in 2015, the country has been criticized by international organizations over measures that they say undermine freedom. Here are some of their concerns:\n\nShortly after the Law and Justice Party took power, it took several steps to gain more control over the nation\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal. It appointed more judges aligned with the party to the court, limited the court\u2019s ability to overturn new laws, and made it possible for the government to directly appoint the country\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s executive arm has begun an inquiry into the judicial measures over concerns that they violate the bloc\u2019s rules.", "Politico - EU": "U.S. President Donald Trump  | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n        \n        \n                        Trump confirms he\u2019s backing off raising age for purchasing some guns\n                        US President had previously proposed raising to 21 the legal age for purchasing certain types of guns.\n\n                    \n                \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBy\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLouis Nelson\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t3/12/18, 3:26 PM CET\n\n\t\t\n\n     Donald Trump confirmed Monday morning that his administration would back away from a proposal to raise the minimum age at which Americans are allowed to buy certain firearms, conceding that there is \u201cnot much political support\u201d for such a step.\n\nTrump had previously proposed raising to 21 the legal age for purchasing certain types of guns, including assault-style rifles like the one used in last month\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The president\u2019s proposal was met with pushback from the NRA and was left off of a list of recommendations to stop school shootings released on Sunday by the White House.\n\n\u201cOn 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly),\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nBefore conceding on raising the age limit for the purchase of certain guns, Trump had publicly chided members of his own party, telling GOP lawmakers at a White House meeting that they were \u201cafraid of the NRA.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier tweet, the president touted other steps that his administration still intends to pursue, including \u201cvery strong improvement and strengthening of background checks\u201d and the banning of bump stocks, a device used last year by a mass shooter in Las Vegas that allows a semi-automatic weapon to function essentially as an automatic one. \u201cHighly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to state law,\u201d the president said, a step he has argued will harden schools against shooters and deter attacks.\n\nWhile Trump has backed away from his support for raising the age at which certain guns can be purchased to 21, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed legislation earlier this month doing just that, as well as banning bump stocks, funding mental health programs in schools and instituting a three-day waiting period for the purchase of firearms. The bill, which has prompted the NRA to sue the state of Florida in order to block its implementation, also allows willing teachers to carry a firearm inside  stories on these topics:", "Salon": "In his Monday New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman argued that the reason Republicans ended up with the candidate that they deserve \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 is simply because they\u2019re ideologically bankrupt and do, in fact, deserve him.\n\nHe noted that \u201c[w]hen Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio dutifully repeated the usual conservative clich\u00e9s, you could see that there was no sense of conviction behind their recitations \u2014 all it took was the huffing and puffing of a loud-mouthed showman to blow their houses down.\u201d And \u201ca loud-mouthed showman\u201d is exactly what they got in the person of Donald Trump.\n\nYou Might Also Like Fortunately, Krugman argued, the very nature of the Democratic coalition guarantees that its chosen candidate will be far more robust: As some political scientists are now acknowledging, America\u2019s two major parties are not at all symmetric.

This is no acceptable,\u201d tweeted Trump. He accused the FBI of \u201cspending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, special counsel Robert Mueller announced an indictment of 13 Russians for trying to meddle in the US election. \n\n\n\nThe FBI has said the tip about Cruz should have been investigated thoroughly because it was a \u201cpotential threat to life\u201d.\n\nCruz was arrested on Wednesday and has since been charged with murdering 17 people at a high school this week.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Sunday morning, Kasich, who was a 2016 presidential candidate, branded Trump\u2019s tweet \u201can absurd statement\u201d. \u201cThe fact of the matter is the FBI apparently made a terrible mistake and people should be held accountable. But we need leadership out of the executive. This is a great opportunity for common sense steps that can be taken, just in the area of background checks,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere should be no ability to do a casual sale without anyone having to find out who they\u2019re selling the gun to and what is involved. The president should be for that.\u201d\n\nOn 5 January, a tipster who was close to Cruz called the FBI and provided information about Cruz\u2019s guns, desire to kill people, erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts. The FBI says the caller expressed concerns Cruz could attack a school. Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, issued a curt statement after the FBI admission saying that warnings signs had been missed with \u201ctragic consequences\u201d. He said: \u201cWe must do better.\u201d\n\nMore demonstrations calling for gun control are planned across the country in the weeks ahead.\n\nPlans for the protests circulated widely on social media on Saturday, as students, parents, teachers and neighbors gathered to express their grief over the fatal shooting of 14 students and three staff members at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida.\n\nOrganizers behind the Women\u2019s March, an anti-Trump and female empowerment protest, called for a 17-minute nationwide walkout by teachers and students on 14 March.\n\nThe Network for Public Education, an advocacy organization for public schools, announced a day of walkouts, sit-ins and other events on school campuses on 20 April, the anniversary of the 1999 shooting at Columbine high school in Colorado that left 12 students and one teacher dead.", "Vox": "President Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail that he would pick a \u201cpro-life\u201d Supreme Court justice.\nTrump nominated Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday night. Gorsuch is, without a doubt, a respected conservative jurist. But when it comes to abortion rights, specifically, Gorsuch\u2019s record is minimal. He\u2019s never ruled on a case hinging on the constitutionality of abortion restriction. So the best way to look at his views is to look at how he\u2019s thought about birth control and about assisted suicide. Together, it appears he is more likely pro-life than pro-choice. \nGorsuch wrote that the birth control coverage mandate under the Affordable Care Act forces employers to \u201cunderwrite payments for drugs or devices that can have the effect of destroying a fertilized human egg.\u201d That argument, which is unsupported by medical research, is often made by anti-abortion rights advocates to explain why they oppose birth control methods like IUDs and emergency contraception. \nSeparately, Gorsuch wrote a book, The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia, which argued against the legalization of assisted suicide because human life is \u201cintrinsically valuable.\u201d Arguing against assisted suicide is not the same as arguing against abortion access, but the language he uses is similar to that used by anti-abortion activists.       \n\nTogether, these writings suggest he\u2019ll be the conservative justice Trump promises. But as perennial swing justice Anthony Kennedy has taught us, opposing abortion personally doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll vote to curtail legal abortion rights. Plus, he replaces Antonin Scalia, a fellow conservative, so Gorsuch doesn\u2019t change the balance of the court. \nPro-choice groups are already suspicious \n\u201cGorsuch represents an existential threat to legal abortion in the United States and must never wear the robes of a Supreme Court justice,\u201d NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue said in a statement Tuesday. \nHogue added that Trump\u2019s decision to \u201cspeed up\u201d the announcement should not \u201cdistract from the hundreds of thousands of Americans demonstrating\u201d against his anti-immigration executive order.      \n\nVicki Saporta, president and CEO of the National Network of Abortion Funds, called Judge Gorsuch \u201ca far-right jurist who would overturn basic and well-established principles of American law.\u201d\nClarke Forsythe, acting president of Americans United for Life (which describes itself as \u201cthe legal arm of the pro-life movement\u201d) said Gorsuch\u2019s nomination shows that Trump \u201cvalues the legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and is dedicated to ensuring that the Supreme Court is staffed by jurists who respect the Constitution, not by politicians who vote with their policy preferences.\u201d\nGorsuch has said things that would raise pro-choice alarm bells about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control benefit, and how broad the religious exemptions to that benefit should be in infamous cases like Hobby Lobby.", "The Washington Post": "Once again, President Trump underscored the vast difference between Trump the person and Trump the administration when it comes to his stance on divisive issues. And that's why, in hindsight, Democrats should have seen that Trump would not support any of their gun-control proposals.\n Where Trump's\u00a0White House ended up on how to respond to school shootings is a world away from where he started. On Sunday, the White House released\u00a0its\u00a0proposal, which focuses on arming teachers, and doesn't mention raising the age limit for assault rifle purchases, which Trump supports.\n That's just the latest contradiction from the president on guns. He started out as one of the most pro-gun and pro-National Rifle Association presidents in modern history.\u00a0After the massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last month, he lent his support to a dizzying array of proposals from both sides. He:\n  Tweeted his support for \u201cstrengthening background checks\u201d Called the leaders of the NRA \u201cGreat People and Great American Patriots\u201d Took language right from the NRA to support \u201chardening\u201d schools by arming teachers Promised to ban bump stocks Talked about raising the age to buy assault weapons from 18 to 21 Praised a new Florida gun-control law that does just that Appeared to support Democrats' proposals for banning assault weapons Snubbed the idea of federal commissions a day before his White House announced its own commission on school violence  The White House ended up far to the right of most of these proposals. Its idea to arm teachers is so controversial that most Republicans in Congress don't support it.\n We saw a similar unraveling of compromise play out in a January immigration debate. And a pattern\u00a0is starting to emerge on how to read Trump's wild spins on divisive issues: When it comes time for the White House\u00a0to put its own ideas in writing,\u00a0he'll land to the right of most of the rest of Washington, no matter how he seemed to be at the center or left just a few days ago.\n When the cameras were invited to a White House meeting with Trump and bipartisan lawmakers a few weeks ago, Trump seemed so open to gun-control proposals that he accused one of the most pro gun-control Republicans in the Senate, Patrick J. Toomey, of being afraid of the NRA because\u00a0Toomey's universal background check bill from 2013 also didn't raise the age limit for buying assault rifles.\n  Then,\u00a0Trump made one of the most pro gun-control Democrats in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, positively giddy with the suggestion Congress should ban assault weapons.\n  Actually, almost all Senate Democrats were thrilled after that meeting. They launched a news conference the very next day on Capitol Hill to unveil their gun-control wish list, hoping to build on the momentum the president had just given them.\n \u201cI am sure many of you in this room and many Americans around the country watched the president's meeting on gun violence yesterday,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), \u201cand were rather stunned and surprised. Many of us pleasantly.\u201d\n But whatever support Democrats think they had from the president\u00a0has fizzled. Trump ignored\u00a0their outstretched hand on universal background checks, and started talking more about arming teachers. Less than two weeks after that meeting, his White House formalized his drift back to the right. They announced Sunday night they would help train schoolteachers to carry guns, a\u00a0proposal plucked straight from the NRA, and they'd endorse a Republican-led bill that reinforces the background check system but doesn't expand it.\n [ What will Congress realistically do on guns after the Florida shooting? ]\n Pretty much the same pattern played out a few\u00a0months ago when Congress was trying to come up with an immigration deal to protect \u201cdreamers\u201d from deportation. Democrats thought they had a deal only to\u00a0watch Trump renege. Trump ultimately put forward an immigration proposal to drastically change the legal immigration system that is so conservative most Republicans in Congress won't support it.\n There are two possibilities here about what's leading Trump to perform so many 360s on divisive issues,\u00a0and they aren't mutually exclusive:\n  Trump doesn't know what he wants, and he's also not very familiar with the issues. That leads him to either mistakenly support more liberal solutions, or honestly support them without understanding the politics behind it. In an open-camera meeting with lawmakers on immigration in January, Trump appeared to agree with Democrats on a bill just to legalize dreamers without anything in exchange. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had to interject to correct the president that's actually the opposite of what Trump wants to do. The president seemed genuinely confused:\n \u201cMr. President, you need to be clear, though,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think what Senator Feinstein is asking there \u2014 when we talk about just DACA, we don\u2019t want to be back here two years later. You have to have security.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cI think that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u201d \u201cNo, I think she\u2019s saying something different,\u201d McCarthy said. (She was.)\n Trump agrees with the last person who talked to him. And that's usually his staff, who have much more access to him than Democrats in Congress. That's people like Stephen Miller, a Trump loyalist who even some Republicans in Congress say is too extreme to deal with. \u201cHe's been an outlier for years,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said during the immigration debate of Miller, pointing the finger squarely at\u00a0Miller for\u00a0scuttling a bipartisan deal on dreamers, a deal Trump seemed open to just days earlier.  Whatever the reason for Trump's hard-right turns on immigration and guns, it\u00a0underscores what Democrats most fear about negotiating with the president: That no matter what bipartisan compromises president seems to support\u00a0when they're across the table from him, he'll fall back to his most conservative positions.", "Bloomberg": "Want to receive this post in your inbox every afternoon?

He called the group \u201cGreat American Patriots.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous feeling that we want to get something done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NRA wants to do the right thing.\u201d \nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer condemned LaPierre\u2019s comments and said the NRA was \u201conce again spewing pathetic, out of touch ideas, blaming everything but guns.\u201d \nThe Feb. 14 rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida was the latest in a series of deadly shootings at U.S. schools and has spurred unprecedented youth-led protests in cities across the country. Many of the teenagers and their parents taking part have called for more curbs on guns. \nLaPierre, speaking at the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference, portrayed the NRA as the true protector of the country\u2019s schoolchildren and offered free training to those who want to bear arms to protect schools. \n\u201cWe must immediately harden our schools,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day, young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder.\u201d It should not be easier to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store, he added. \nThe NRA set up a booth at the conference to sign up new members and recruit campaign field workers for the November mid-term elections in which Democrats are trying to take over control of Congress from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans. \nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting mother Melissa Blank (L) and surviving students Jonathan Blank (2nd L) and Julia Cordover (3rd L) react along with U.S. President Donald Trump as they listen to survivors and the relatives of victims during a listening session with high school students, family members and teachers to discuss school safety and shootings at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2018.

He also said he would push for an end to the sale of bump stocks, which allow rifles to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. \nThe White House said Trump does not want to ban sales of an entire class of firearms despite mounting pressure to put assault weapons such as the one used in the Florida shooting out of civilian reach. \nWhile gun laws vary widely by state, most federal gun control measures would require Congress to act. \nA 19-year-old former student at Stoneman Douglas, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with carrying out the Parkland shooting.
