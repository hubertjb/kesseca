Schumer has taken a bite from his doughnut, while Putin is looking down at his with a little less enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cWe should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin,\u201d Trump wrote in the tweet. \u201cA total hypocrite!\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later, Schumer tweeted back and said the meeting happened 14 years ago. \u201cHappily talk re: my contact w Mr. Putin & his associates, took place in \u201903 in full view of press & public under oath. Would you &your team?\u201d\n\nIt was the latest round of sparring between two New Yorkers with a long history. Trump, 70, a former Democrat, has reportedly donated around $9,000 to the senator over the years and claimed: \u201cI was close to Schumer in many ways.\u201d But Schumer, 66, has described the businessman as a casual acquaintance rather than a friend, insisting they have never had a meal or played golf together.\n\nThis week, Schumer demanded that the attorney general and Trump loyalist Jeff Sessions resign for misleading listeners at his Senate confirmation hearing about whether he had contacts with Russia during the election campaign.\n\nIt emerged that Sessions had had two meetings with the Russian ambassador to the US, one of which was at the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, deputy White House press secretary, also drew attention to Schumer on Friday, asking reporters: \u201cPlease explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly 80 ambassadors attended is a story.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity. I mean, Chuck Schumer sitting and having drinks with Putin and that\u2019s not a news story, but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where there\u2019s again dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy.\u201d\n\nTrump has admitted, however, that Sessions could have stated his response \u201cmore accurately\u201d at his confirmation hearing.

McMaster, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all declined to knock down those remarks when pressed by reporters, deferring instead to Trump himself.\n\n\"President Trump will be happy to make statements himself about that,\" Mnuchin said. \"But President Trump handled himself brilliantly.

But they \u201ccredit\u201d the West\u2019s criticism of Russia for the high voter turnout.\nThe U.K. Daily Mail, which often reports U.S. stories before the American media get to them, tells of \u201cwrestlers, nuns and \u2018independent\u2019 monitors\u201d caught on video stuffing ballot boxes and otherwise fixing votes for Mr. Putin.\nA Putin spokesman told the Interfax news agency that Mr. Putin won an \u201cincredible victory\u201d and that the large percentage of votes that went to him \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Given the corruption, it certainly does.\nThe larger question for the West is what happens next? Will Mr. Putin feel emboldened to be even more aggressive than he has been against neighboring countries, perhaps invading another one with some sort of phony excuse to paper over his aggression?\nWill even more Putin enemies, including journalists who dare to print the truth about him and his tactics, wind up dead under suspicious circumstances? Will that nerve agent that nearly killed \u2014 and may still kill \u2014 the two former Russian spies, and which has been banned for decades by international law governing chemical weapons, start showing up in other places and become a weapon of choice for Russia?\nAnd then there is the ultimate question. What will and what can President Trump do about all this? During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump was solicitous of Mr. Putin, refusing to condemn him for his aggressive tactics in Ukraine and later as president reluctant to conclude that Russia interfered in the U.S. election.\nPresident Obama was similarly solicitous, almost obsequious, with Mr. Putin\u2019s puppet, President Dmitry Medvedev. Mr. Obama told Mr. Medvedev in 2012 during one of those \u201ccaught on open mic moments\u201d that he would have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d to address Russia\u2019s concerns about European missile defense after he won re-election, to which Mr. Medvedev replied, \u201cI understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir.\u201d\nMust America and the West return to a Cold War mentality and prepare for a type of Soviet Union 2.0? Are we headed back to the doctrine of \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d with growing numbers of ICBMs pointed at each other?\nIn January, Mr. Trump slapped sanctions on a list of Russian oligarchs, but refused to apply broader sanctions against the country. The pressure is on for him to go further. If he does, will it make a difference, or will Mr. Putin continue his \u201cmake Russia great again\u201d policies?\nRonald Reagan believed in \u201cpeace through strength\u201d and contributed to the downfall of the Soviet Union by successfully employing that policy. Does Mr. Trump have a similar policy when it comes to modern Russia? Does he have any policy? He had better because Mr. Putin has one and a corrupt election is only part of it.\nCal Thomas is a nationally syndicated columnist.

Ed Royce of California said Monday he will not seek re-election after serving out his 13th term in the House, the latest in a string of committee chairmen who have announced their retirement.\n\nWhether or not he sought re-election, Royce was stepping down as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee this year. He said he would spend his final year as chairman fully focused on the \u201curgent threats facing our nation.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also clear the congressman was facing one of the most challenging elections of his career.\n\nIn last year\u2019s presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump in California\u2019s 39th Congressional District. That prompted the campaign arm for congressional Democrats to target Royce\u2019s district in Southern California as one they hoped to flip in their midterm effort to take control of the House.\n\nRoyce won in 2016 with more than 57 percent of the vote, and Republicans hold a narrow edge in voter registration.\n\nRoyce had appeared to be gearing up for another campaign: He had $3.4 million stockpiled in his campaign account as of September, the most recent numbers available.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a re-election problem, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel, who called Royce\u2019s announcement \u201ca shocker.\u201d\n\nBut the district, like much of California, has been growing increasingly favorable for Democratic candidates. The party holds every statewide office and controls both chambers of the Legislature by hefty margins.\n\nTrump lost the state in 2016 by more than 4 million votes and Clinton carried Orange County, once a Republican fortress, by nearly 9 percentage points.\n\nThe suburban district southeast of Los Angeles has significant chunks of Hispanic, Asian and highly educated voters, a combination \u201cthat makes Democrats salivate,\u201d said political scientist Jack Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College.\n\n\u201cIn the suburbs, Trump is toxic,\u201d Pitney said.\n\nRoyce became the 29th House Republican to announce a decision not to seek re-election this year, compared to 14 Democrats. With Trump\u2019s popularity in the dumps and a string of election victories in recent weeks, Democrats have hopes of gaining the 24 seats they would need to win control of the chamber.\n\nIn a press release announcing his retirement, Royce cited the tax cut bill passed in December and the crackdown on the global ivory trade as among recent accomplishments.\n\nRepublican Rep. Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the GOP was \u201cfired up and ready to hold this seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just one message for Democrats who think they can compete for this seat: Bring it on,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nDemocrats said that Royce\u2019s retirement was another sign of the party\u2019s growing momentum going into the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIn a district that Hillary Clinton won by 8 points, Democrats are poised to win this Orange County seat and send someone to Washington who truly represents the values of Southern California,\u201d said Drew Godinich, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nRoyce\u2019s announcement came just a few days after Rep. Gregg Harper of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the House Administration Committee, announced his retirement.\n\nAnd Harper\u2019s announcement followed retirement plans announced by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa. Hatch is 83 and Shuster was barred by GOP rules from seeking another term atop his committee.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\nTrump has been reshaping his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced the departure of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, and announced that he would replace him with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations known for his hawkish views. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also took a more combative stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\nTrump faces pressure to take a stronger stance against Putin from Congress, which passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive measures imposed after Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.
