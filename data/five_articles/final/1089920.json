Warren wrote to The Boston Globe. \u201cI\u2019m intensely frustrated by the apparent likelihood that, for the second time in five elections, a Democratic nominee will have won the popular vote but lost the presidency in the electoral college. But the integrity of our democracy is more important than any individual election, and those of us who supported Hillary Clinton will respect this result.\n\n\u201cPresident-elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task. When he takes the oath of office as the leader of our democracy and the leader of all Americans, it is my sincere hope that he will fulfill that role with respect and concern from every single person in this country, no matter who they are, where they come from, what they believe, or whom they love.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s statement comes one day after she admitted to reporters outside her polling place in Cambridge that she was anxious about the possibility of Trump winning. \u201cOf course I\u2019m nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there is any chance at all that Donald Trump could be elected to lead this country, then I\u2019m nervous, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m out working, I\u2019m headed out to do more work today.\u201d Sen. Warren is widely regarded to be a leader of the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing.

Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, one of the four authors of the GOP memo released Friday, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that he believes a surveillance warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page would not have ever been authorized without the existence of the controversial \"Steele dossier.\"\n\nGowdy's comments come on the heels of the Friday\u00a0release of a memo\u00a0drafted by Gowdy, House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and two investigators on the committee. The memo, declassified by President Trump and released by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee Friday, outlines how Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants were obtained for former Trump campaign official Carter Page, and what relationship the Trump dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer\u00a0Christopher Steele\u00a0had with those FISA warrant applications.\n\nGowdy said the public will \"never know\" if the surveillance against Page was justified, saying the warrants relied on three pieces of information -- the dossier, a reference to a Yahoo News article and other information available to the FISA court judges who approved warrants.\n\nBut, Gowdy, the only Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who has seen the actual FISA warrant applications -- Nunes has not -- emphasized that the memo does not discredit special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to Trump associates.\n\n\"Not to me, it doesn't, and I was pretty integrally involved in the drafting of it,\" Gowdy said, asked if the memo has an impact on the Russia probe. \"There is a Russia investigation without a dossier.\"\n\nThe dossier has \"nothing to do\" with the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, and a Russian lawyer, Gowdy noted. Gowdy also said the dossier did not form the basis for the case against\u00a0George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign aid who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about foreign contacts. The dossier has nothing to do with obstruction of justice, Gowdy noted.\n\n\"So there's going to be a Russia probe, even without a dossier,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Gowdy said \"it would\" concern him if President Trump makes any move to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said he has confidence in the deputy attorney general, of whom Mr. Trump has been publicly critical, and he would be concerned if the commander-in-chief attempts to fire him.\n\n\"It would. Again, I'm not in the Senate. I don't have advice and consent. And the president has not sought my counsel on this,\" Gowdy told CBS News' White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.\n\nPressed as to whether he thinks Rosenstein should be fired, based on the information he has seen in compiling the memo, Gowdy said no.\n\n\"I don't,\" Gowdy said. \"I think it is fair to ask the deputy attorney general, what did you know at the time you signed one of the applications? I think it is fair to ask, what FISA reforms are you going to implement to make sure we don't have this fact pattern come up again? I don't judge people based on a single decision that they make throughout the course of an otherwise really stellar career.\"\n\nGowdy also expressed confidence in FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom President Trump selected to replace fired FBI Director James Comey last May.\n\n\"I've had my differences with Rod Rosenstein and I still think that he is fully capable of helping run a Justice Department that we can all have confidence in,\" Gowdy said. \"I'm actually really impressed with Chris Wray and I say that even though we are on totally opposite sides of this issue and probably will always be. He doesn't think the memo should have been publicly disseminated. I have real questions about the process that the bureau went through in 2016, but I also think he's the person to lead the bureau. I think he's doing a good job.\"\n\nGowdy went on to express his support for Mueller, whose investigation he said is independent.\n\n\"Well I'm actually in a really small group, I think, of Republicans that think that this FISA process is suspect and wrong and should not have taken place. But you still have a Russia investigation even without it,\" Gowdy said. \"So I don't know how many other Republicans feel that way. I am on record as saying I support Bob Mueller 100 percent. I think you would have a Russia -- look, Russia tried to interfere with our election in 2016 with or without a dossier. So you need an investigation into Russia. You need an investigation into the Trump Tower and the Cambridge Analytica email, separate and apart from the dossier. So those are not connected issues to me. They may be for Republicans, but they're not for me. I say investigate everything Russia did but admit that this was a really sloppy process that you engaged in to surveil a U.S. citizen.\"\n\nGowdy's claims would seem to conflict with Mr. Trump, who took to Twitter Saturday morning to claim the GOP memo \"totally vindicates 'Trump.'\" The president frequently describes the Russia probe as a \"witch hunt,\" and did so on Saturday morning.\n\nGowdy also opened up about his upcoming departure from Congress. His announcement that he would not run for reelection in 2018 sent shockwaves throughout Washington.\n\n\"You know, I'm just -- I enjoy the justice system more. I enjoy being fair,\" Gowdy said, explaining the reason for his departure. \"I enjoy the pursuit of fairness as a virtue and I'm just more comfortable in that system. My wife hates it when I say this but I was a pretty good prosecutor, I think. But I've been a pretty lousy politician. So, I've done it for seven years. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to do it but it's time for me to -- whatever time I've got left, I want to spend it in the justice system because that's where my heart is.\"\n\nYou can watch Gowdy's interview with Margaret Brennan on Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" (@FaceTheNation).

One of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest aides, Hope Hicks, announced her exit \u2014 without warning. The president\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, saw his security clearance downgraded and is under increasing ethical scrutiny over his business deals and foreign contacts. The president attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Twitter over his refusal corroborate a conspiracy theory of widespread conspiring in federal law enforcement against Trump, and there are rumors National Security Adviser HR McMaster and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn might soon be out the door. At the same time, Trump decided it might be a good time to kick off a trade war, too, and announced plans to slap large tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel. \n\nIn the midst of all of this White House chaos, wheels were turning on another front: Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. The president has been campaigning for reelection since he arrived at the White House \u2014 Trump filed the paperwork for his reelection campaign the same day he was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2017. He has been fundraising for the past year, ending 2017 with $22 million in cash, and has held multiple campaign rallies across the country. \n\nFirst there was Corey, then Paul, then Steve, and now Brad\nMatt Drudge spent Tuesday morning teasing a \u201cshock\u201d announcement from President Trump \u2014 which turned out to be that Trump is running for reelection in 2020. (Not especially shocking.) But there was in the announcement some new news: that the Trump reelection campaign has tapped Brad Parscale as campaign manager. Parscale was in charge of digital operations in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. In an announcement of the decision to tap Parscale as campaign manager, Trump\u2019s son, Eric, described Parscale as an \u201camazing talent,\u201d and Kushner, said his leadership and expertise will \u201chelp build a best-in-class campaign.\u201d\n\nParscale worked closely with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to boost Donald Trump\u2019s online presence in 2016 and was a major part of his victory. A 60 Minutes profile of Parscale called him the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201csecret weapon,\u201d who leveraged Facebook specifically to give Trump a boost. \u201cI think Donald Trump won, but I think Facebook was the method,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Lesley Stahl. \u201cIt was the highway in which his car drove on.\u201d\n\nFacebook, of course, wasn\u2019t the only technology Parscale used during the 2016 campaign. He is also tied to Cambridge Analytica, Vox\u2019s Sean Illing pointed out, a data analytics form that has become a major focus of both the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the election and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. Kushner brought on Cambridge Analytica to take over the Trump campaign\u2019s data operations in 2016, while Parscale was developing its online microtargeting strategy. (During his 60 Minutes interview, Parscale denied that the firm was useful.)\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica question aside, hiring Parscale as campaign manager is a significant step for Trump\u2019s reelection bid. Trump\u2019s previous campaign managers include Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort (who was chair), and Steve Bannon.\n\nAfter announcing Parscale, the Trump campaign also put out a press release on building out its leadership team. They said Michael Glassner, the 2016 campaign deputy manager, will serve as chief operating officer of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, and Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, will serve as a senior adviser. \n\nTrump is getting ready to ramp up fundraising efforts\nOn Saturday, Trump is launching a fundraising initiative that mimics a tactic employed by former President George W. Bush to raise money, according to a report from Alex Isenstadt at Politico. \n\nTrump is appearing before Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago to kick off the plan that rewards donors who have \u201cbundled\u201d thousands of dollars in contributions, meaning they gather campaign contributions from others. Donors who raise $25,000 will join the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d and those who raise $45,000 will be part of the \u201c45 Club.\u201d The program will jointly benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee. \n\nThis marks a new step in campaign fundraising for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, which has already been taking in millions of dollars in donations. His campaign committee ended 2017 with $22 million in cash, having brought in $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of the year alone. Per FEC data, his campaign committee raised $32 million in 2017. His campaign committee and two fundraising committees that are joint operations with the Republican National Committee \u2014 Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee \u2014 raised a combined $52 million in 2017, according to the Washington Post.\n\nA significant chunk of the reelection campaign\u2019s money has gone to legal fees \u2014 about a quarter, according to the New York Times. The campaign has also been paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to Parscale and his firm quarterly for digital advertising efforts.\n\nIsenstadt also reported on Saturday that Parscale will attend an RNC donor retreat at the Four Seasons Resort in Palm Beach, Florida, this weekend. Trump is keeping an eye on potential Republican challengers in 2020, including Ohio Governor John Kasich and Senators Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ). He\u2019s also trying to focus a lot of his presidential travel around the country on swing states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that President Trump continue to lay the groundwork for a strong reelection campaign because he\u2019s not going to be able to drain the swamp overnight,\u201d Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign aide, told Politico. \n\n2020 is a long way away, but right now, Trump is pretty unpopular\nTrump has kicked off reelection efforts unusually early compared to his predecessors. George W. Bush filed his paperwork in the spring of 2003 for his 2004 reelection campaign; Barack Obama filed in April 2011 for 2012.\n\nOver a year into his presidency, Donald Trump remains a historically unpopular figure.

With conservative strategist Steve Bannon playing a founding role, backed by money from billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, the firm was able to develop data from 50 million Facebook users into a psychologically-based strategy to target voters.\n\nNow there are legal questions about how it obtained that Facebook data. Investigations are gearing up in the U.S. and the U.K. The company this week suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, over comments he made to undercover reporters from the British Television 4 News.\n\nU.S. campaign finance law may have a lot to say about this. Here are some of the biggest questions.\n\n1. Did Cambridge Analytica have a role in running the Trump campaign?\n\nTo hear now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix in the Television 4 News report, his firm handled almost everything except those Make America Great Again caps. He claimed it was responsible for all of the data, research, analytics and targeting, plus the digital and television campaigns. Notably, he said, \"Our data informed all the strategy.\"\n\nBut as a British firm, Cambridge Analytica runs into a federal statute that bars foreign involvement in American elections. The law was strengthened after the 1996 Clinton re-election effort had to disgorge millions of dollars from illegal donors.\n\n\"The Federal Election Campaign Act's prohibition on foreign contributions is the broadest prohibition in the entire statute,\" said Brett Kappel, a partner in the government affairs and public policy practice of the law firm Ackerman in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne provision of the law prohibits foreign nationals from holding decision-making positions in American campaigns. So the Trump campaign could hire Cambridge Analytica, and the firm could recommend, say, an ad-targeting strategy for Wisconsin. But a campaign official \u2014 a U.S. citizen or green-card holder \u2014 would have to approve it.\n\nNix's comment seems to acknowledge that line; he's saying the firm stayed on the right side of it.\n\n2. Did Cambridge Analytica give or sell the data to the Trump campaign?\n\nIf the answer is yes, it would raise questions.\n\nThe Trump campaign paid the firm a total of $5.9 million, according to Federal Election Commission data processed by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. The campaign's filings say the firm provided data management and survey research. But estimates for how much the data is worth, as processed by Cambridge Analytica, run much higher.\n\nIf the firm gave the data, or sold it at less than fair market value, the transaction would amount to a campaign contribution \u2014 a two-fer violation of the law, which bars corporations and foreign nationals from contributing.\n\n3. Did Cambridge Analytica have any other clients?\n\nJust one of note: a superPAC called Make American Number 1. During the campaign it used the name Stop Crooked Hillary PAC. As that suggests \u2014 and as Cambridge Analytica executives indicated in the Channel Four report \u2014 the superPAC served as an attack dog to supplement the campaign's messages.\n\nAccording to that report, Cambridge Analytica treated the campaign and the superPAC as a single project. This might explain why Stop Crooked Hillary PAC paid the firm almost the same sum as the campaign \u2014 $5.7 million \u2014 for its services.\n\nCampaigns and superPACs are supposed to be independent of each other. But ironically, the seemingly sleazy arrangement is within the norms of American politics. While the two political entities cannot coordinate their messages, they can hire the same vendor. It's the vendor's duty to set up two teams, walled-off from each other and legally bound to maintain the separation.\n\n4. How much trouble is Cambridge Analytica in?\n\nNothing is proven yet, or even alleged. But it's worth noting that the Justice Department has a small set of \"core prohibitions\" around campaign finance issues that it is vigilant about prosecuting. The core prohibitions include the bans on corporate contributions and on foreign contributions and expenditures, both of which could put Cambridge Analytica in the department's sights.", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2018/03/21/595535935/cambridge-analyticas-role-in-trump-s-2016-campaign-raises-potential-legal-flags?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news", "logo": "https://media.npr.org/images/podcasts/primary/npr_generic_image_300.jpg?s=200", "left_right_score": 0.020460319385349774, "bias": 3, "facebook_likes": 6205, "title": "Cambridge Analytica's Role In Trump's 2016 Campaign Raises Potential Legal Flags", "source": "NPR"}, "CBN News": {"body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A controversial memo that Republicans say shows the FBI playing politics is expected to be released today at the approval of President Trump.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee gave the memo to Trump earlier this week and when asked Tuesday if he would make it public he said he would, \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\nThe memo centers around the 2016 election and how the FBI reportedly targeted a Trump campaign official.\n\nRepublicans say the dossier\u00a0the agency used to get the warrant to monitor Carter Page, paid for by Democrats,\u00a0was incomplete and misrepresented to the court.\n\nThe Trump administration believes this memo could discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russian collusion investigation which Trump has long called a political \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nWhen and if Trump signs off on declassifying the memo, it will be given to lawmakers who can then release it to the public.", "link": "http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2018/february/president-trump-expected-to-approve-declassification-of-fisa-memo-today", "logo": null, "left_right_score": 0.9386308932416754, "bias": 5, "facebook_likes": 0, "title": "President Trump Expected to Approve Declassification of FISA Memo Today", "source": "CBN News"}, "The Hill": {"body": "Facebook late last week banned the company, saying it violated the platform\u2019s policies by\u00a0failing to delete\u00a0data on 50 million of the social media giant\u2019s users.\u00a0The firm did work for President Trump Donald John TrumpAccuser says Trump should be afraid of the truth Woman behind pro-Trump Facebook page denies being influenced by Russians Shulkin says he has White House approval to root out 'subversion' at VA MORE's 2016 campaign and is also alleged to have links to the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom.\n\nFacebook is also facing mounting pressure from lawmakers in Washington to explain how the firm was able to get its hand on the data.\n\nHere are five things to watch as the controversy unfolds.\n\nHow much damage has Facebook\u2019s reputation taken?\n\nThis is a big crisis for Facebook, which saw its stock fall 7 percent in trading on Monday.\n\nThe dip suggests that investors expect the Cambridge Analytica scandal to have a material impact on the company, including its reputation among consumers.\n\n\u201cOn the consumer level, consumers are very concerned about what\u2019s being collected,\u201d said Michael Priem, CEO of the advertising firm Modern Impact.\n\nHe said it\u2019s possible the controversy will highlight the kinds of information that Facebook has about its users.\n\nLawmakers suggested the news is another reason for Congress to step in.\n\n\u201cIt's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\u201d Sen.

REUTERS/Yves Herman/Files\n\nThe New York Times and the British Observer reported that Cambridge Analytica had acquired private data harvested from more than 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election campaign. \nIn a secretly recorded video by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News, Cambridge Analytica officials were also recorded saying they have used a web of shell companies to disguise their activities in elections in Malaysia, Mexico and Brazil, among various countries where they have worked to sway election outcomes. \n\u201cContrary to media reports, neither Cambridge Analytica nor its parent company SCL Group have ever \u2013 now or in the past \u2013 been contracted, employed or paid in any way by Barisan Nasional, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office or any part of the Government of Malaysia,\u201d the office of Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said on Tuesday. Barisan Nasional (BN) is Malaysia\u2019s ruling coalition.  \nSCL and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment regarding their work in Malaysia. Cambridge Analytica had earlier denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data-protection rules.  \nMalaysia is gearing up for national elections that have to be called by August, with sources telling Reuters that polls may be held as early as April. Najib\u2019s coalition is widely expected to retain power.  \nNajib\u2019s office also said SCL has informed the government that \u201cCambridge Analytica\u2019s advice on the 2013 general election was provided personally to Mukhriz Mahathir,\u201d who was then with the ruling coalition but is now part of the opposition.  \n\u201cThe SCL representative also confirmed that he reported directly to Mukhriz Mahathir, not BN or the government,\u201d Najib\u2019s office said. \nMukhriz told Reuters that the statement by PMO was misleading.  \n\u201cI categorically deny any contact with Cambridge Analytica at any time,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, he denied receiving any analysis, data or advice from the firm.  \nMukhriz is the son of the former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad, who is now the opposition\u2019s prime ministerial candidate.  \nAccording to Cambridge Analytica\u2019s website, the firm \u201csupported Barisan Nasional in Kedah state with a targeted messaging campaign highlighting their school improvements since 2008.\u201d It also notes how BN wrested power back from the opposition in the 2013 elections.  \nMukhriz was appointed chief minister of Kedah after the 2013 win, but he was sacked by the ruling party in 2016 after being critical of Najib in a corruption scandal. \nReporting by A.

They had much to celebrate.\n\nMr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama\u2019s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters\u2019 behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.\n\nThe group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.\n\nThen a chance meeting bought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.\n\nMr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America\u2019s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Bannon declined to comment.\n\nMr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.\n\nThe Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.\n\nWhen Mr. Wylie\u2019s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.\n\n\u201cITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Wylie\u2019s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.\n\nBut those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.\n\nMr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from the their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew \u2014 a claim that has been disputed.\n\nWhen the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs \u2014 more than $800,000 \u2014 and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.\n\nAll he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \u201ca very standard vanilla Facebook app.\u201d\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users \u2014 those who participated in the survey \u2014 had consented to having their data harvested.\n\nMr. Wylie said the Facebook data was \u201cthe saving grace\u201d that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted as much as we could get,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhere it came from, who said we could have it \u2014 we weren\u2019t really asking.\u201d\n\nMr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan\u2019s contributions as \u201cfruitless.\u201d\n\nJust as Dr. Kogan\u2019s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL\u2019s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie\u2019s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.\n\nBut in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.\n\nIn a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself \u201cfrom substantive management\u201d of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, \u201cto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.\u201d\n\nIn summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \u201cpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\u201d Mr. Nix \u201cnever had any strategic or operational role\u201d in an American election campaign, the company said.\n\nWhether the company\u2019s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees\u2019 roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.\n\nCambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.\n\nUnder the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.\n\nCambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm\u2019s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u2014 statements disputed by other campaign officials \u2014 but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.\n\nIn a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on \u201clegacy psychographics\u201d built for the Cruz campaign.\n\nBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former \u201ccontractors\u201d as engaging in \u201cwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\u201d\n\nNear the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \u201ccarefully investigating this situation\u201d and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.\n\nFacebook verified the leak and \u2014 without publicly acknowledging it \u2014 sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \u201cThis data was obtained and used without permission,\u201d said a letter that was obtained by the Times. \u201cIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and \u201cSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201d\n\nBut copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook\u2019s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.\n\nWhile Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.\n\n\n\nToday, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.\n\nAll the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political business. No American campaigns or \u201csuper PACs\u201d have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age \u2014 a \u201cMath Man,\u201d he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "logo": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/misc/NYT_logo_rss_250x40.png", "left_right_score": 0.0006965604061398598, "bias": 2, "facebook_likes": 81068, "title": "How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions", "source": "The New York Times"}, "Fox News": {"body": "Sen.

But the business\u2019s ties to Nix and dubious tactics run deep.\nHe retains a large ownership stake in Cambridge Analytica\u2019s affiliated companies, and many of its top executives share his history of questionable campaign techniques. Nix remains a director and retains partial ownership of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s British affiliate, SCL Group, which continues to work on political campaigns around the world and for governments. It signed a contract with the U.S. State Department last week.\nAlexander Nix leaves Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices in London, on March 20.\n\nPhotographer: Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\nSCL also has deep ties to the U.K.\u2019s Conservative Party, forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to distance her party from the firm. British lawmakers are calling for an investigation into SCL\u2019s activities and why the Ministry of Defense granted the company access to secret government documents.\n\n        \n        The company said bribes and fake IDs \u201cdo not represent the values or operations of the firm\u201d and Nix denies he engaged in such activities.\n\n        \n        Cambridge Analytica and SCL share a London office and many staff members. Receptionists say \u201cCambridge Analytica\u201d when answering calls to SCL\u2019s London phone number. Cambridge Analytica also takes credit on its website for many of SCL\u2019s political campaigns.\nRead more: The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica saga explained\nIn an interview with Bloomberg last year, Nix said the two companies overlap and share methodology and data analytics. But even he seemed at a loss to define the border between them. \u201cThere\u2019s a relationship there,\u201d Nix said, adding when pressed: \u201cIt\u2019s just not clear what the relationship is.\u201d Nix, with his mother and sister, still owns roughly 25 percent of SCL Group, according to company records.\nNeither Cambridge Analytica nor SCL returned calls seeking comment for this story.\nPhotographer: Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n        \n        Cambridge Analytica is partly owned by the family of hedge-fund chief Robert Mercer, a big donor and supporter of President Donald Trump, but Nix\u2019s ties to the family go far beyond that link. Earlier this year, Nix joined other SCL colleagues on the board of a new company, Emerdata Ltd., which shares an address with SCL. This month, Mercer\u2019s daughters Rebekah and Jennifer joined Emerdata\u2019s board, according to Companies House, a British government website.\nEmerdataOther Emerdata directors include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, deputy chairman of Hong Kong-based Frontier Services Group, which is chaired by Blackwater Security Consulting founder and Trump backer Erik Prince. Also on the board is Cheng Peng, whose address is the same as Luk Fook Financial Services, the parent company of the firm that helped Frontier place new shares last year.\nEmerdata was set up in 2017 by Julian Wheatland, the chairman of SCL, and Alex Tayler, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s chief data officer, who was appointed to replace Nix as CEO while the company conducts its investigation. Tayler and Wheatland resigned from Emerdata in January.\nTayler, who earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from University of Cambridge, worked side-by-side with Nix on Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign.\nIn an interview last year, Tayler told Bloomberg that Cambridge Analytica helped the campaign predict rural-voter turnout and target messages.\nTracker Poll\u201cThe methodology is about listening to your audience through large-scale polling and research married with data about those individuals that you acquired from different sources,\u201d he said. He said the company ran a weekly \u201ctracker poll\u201d in every U.S. state that allowed the Trump campaign to gauge how its message was resonating and then shift resources accordingly.\nPreviously, SCL worked on hundreds of election campaigns around the world, from the Caribbean to Latvia and Nigeria, where it sometimes engaged in questionable tactics, such as discouraging opposition voters, according to the company\u2019s sales documents. Nix denies that SCL has ever \u201cundertaken any campaign to discourage voting or undermine the democratic process.\u201d\nMark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political arm, remains at the company after being caught on camera talking about how the firm could push out damaging material on an opponent through social media without leaving a trace.\nInto The Bloodstream\u201cWe just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again,\u201d he was filmed telling an undercover reporter posing as a potential client from Sri Lanka.\nTurnbull joined Cambridge Analytica and SCL in May 2016 to work on election campaigns. He\u2019d spent 16 years at Bell Pottinger, the London public-relations firm, where he focused on \u201cstabilisation, counter-radicalisation and democratic reform in zones of conflict\u201d according to his LinkedIn profile.\nAmong Turnbull\u2019s jobs at Bell Pottinger was overseeing the company\u2019s activities in Iraq. Bell Pottinger worked on propaganda campaigns for the U.S. and British Coalition Provisional Authority in the wake of the U.S. invasion in 2003 and later had a contract with the U.S. military. The firm played a key role in helping the campaigns of Iraqi political candidates favored by the U.S. and British. Later, it worked to combat Al Qaeda in Iraq.\nFake NewsBell Pottinger\u2019s tactics included producing phony television news reports as well as fake terrorist propaganda videos containing computer code that allowed Western intelligence agencies to track anyone who watched, according to a 2016 report from the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a not-for-profit reporting organization.\nThe man who awarded Turnbull\u2019s Bell Pottinger unit its first Iraq contract was Ian Tunnicliffe, then a British colonel who was running strategic communications for the U.K. defense ministry. Tunnicliffe, now retired, has been a member of SCL\u2019s advisory board. He didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment.\nSCL also stoked ethnic tensions in Eastern Europe and sprayed fake graffiti in the Caribbean, according to the firm\u2019s own sales documents. Its defense business claims in pitch documents to have worked for clients as wide-ranging as the Libyan National Transitional Council, NATO and the U.K. Foreign Office. It says it worked in Pakistan for the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Pacific Command in India on countering radicalization.\nSCL recently signed a contract with the U.S. State Department for market research and public-opinion polling, according to a federal procurement database. The one-year contract, signed last week, is worth $496,232, according to the database.\nDeep TiesThe firm also has deep ties to the British defense establishment and Conservative Party. Its first chairman was Geoffrey Pattie, a defense minister under Margaret Thatcher. In addition to Tunnicliffe, the advisory board has included retired Rear Admiral John Tolhurst and Ivar Mountbatten, the great-nephew of Louis Mountbatten, the military hero and Queen Elizabeth\u2019s cousin. Jonathan Marland, a former Conservative Party treasurer who served as a minister for business under former Prime Minister David Cameron, is a shareholder.\nMarland told the Guardian newspaper he hadn\u2019t had a role in running SCL following his initial investment and had refused requests to introduce the firm to Conservative Party officials.\nRoger Gabb, a former British Army officer who later made his fortune as a wine distributor and wholesaler, is also a major SCL shareholder. A founding director who, with his family, still controls about 25 percent of the firm\u2019s shares, Gabb has also been active in the Conservative Party and the campaign for the U.K. to leave the European Union. He donated 500,000 pounds ($705,300) to the party in 2006. In 2016, he was fined 1,000 pounds by the U.K.\u2019s Electoral Commission for failing to disclose that he had helped purchase local newspaper advertisements supporting the leave side in the Brexit referendum.", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/cambridge-analytica-suspends-ceo-nix-but-he-and-his-work-live-on", "logo": null, "left_right_score": 0.0038577464447247, "bias": 3, "facebook_likes": 58, "title": "The Work of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Suspended CEO Will Carry On", "source": "Bloomberg"}, "Daily Beast": {"body": "Cambridge Analytica hoped to capitalize on Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton and her ally, an email written by one of its employees indicates. \nEmily Cornell, the employee, sent the email on July 29, 2016. It went out to people working with Make America Number One, the pro-Trump super PAC funded by Republican super-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer. \nAfter noting some of the firm\u2019s work for the super PAC, Cornell wrote: \u201cWith her campaign getting hacked, I can only imagine what a new swatch [sic] of emails will do to her already fractured base!\u201d \nCornell did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the email. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica also did not respond to requests for comment. \nOn July 22, seven days before Cornell\u2019s email, Wikileaks had published almost 20,000 emails it had stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The hack\u2014which included emails showing some DNC officials pushing for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the primary\u2014threw the Democratic Party into turmoil. Then-DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from her post because of the hack. On July 27, then-candidate Trump said in a press conference that he hoped Kremlin-backed individuals would find emails Clinton deleted as secretary of state. \n\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.\nHis allies later said he was joking. \nCambridge Analytica has drawn intense scrutiny since the election. This week, the UK\u2019s Channel 4 released two documentaries on the company\u2019s internal practices based on hidden-camera footage. In one, a Cambridge Analytica official says the company used Ukrainian sex workers to try to entrap its clients\u2019 political foes. \n\u201cJust saying we could bring some Ukrainians in,\u201d the firm\u2019s CEO Alexander Nix said to journalists posing as prospective clients. \u201cThey are very beautiful. I find that works very well.\u201d\nCambridge Analytica announced on Tuesday it has suspended Nix pending an independent investigation. \n\u201cMr. Nix\u2019s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\u201d the firm said in a statement.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/cambridge-analytica-looked-to-pounce-on-russian-hacks-email-shows?source=politics_sum&via=rss", "logo": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/static/images/square_logo_1x.16983b61.png", "left_right_score": 0.020461827710889148, "bias": 1, "facebook_likes": 314, "title": "Cambridge Analytica Looked to Pounce on Russian Hacks, Email Shows", "source": "Daily Beast"}}
