{"The Washington Post": {"body": "Once again, President Trump underscored the vast difference between Trump the person and Trump the administration when it comes to his stance on divisive issues. And that's why, in hindsight, Democrats should have seen that Trump would not support any of their gun-control proposals.\n Where Trump's\u00a0White House ended up on how to respond to school shootings is a world away from where he started. On Sunday, the White House released\u00a0its\u00a0proposal, which focuses on arming teachers, and doesn't mention raising the age limit for assault rifle purchases, which Trump supports.\n That's just the latest contradiction from the president on guns. He started out as one of the most pro-gun and pro-National Rifle Association presidents in modern history.\u00a0After the massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last month, he lent his support to a dizzying array of proposals from both sides. He:\n  Tweeted his support for \u201cstrengthening background checks\u201d Called the leaders of the NRA \u201cGreat People and Great American Patriots\u201d Took language right from the NRA to support \u201chardening\u201d schools by arming teachers Promised to ban bump stocks Talked about raising the age to buy assault weapons from 18 to 21 Praised a new Florida gun-control law that does just that Appeared to support Democrats' proposals for banning assault weapons Snubbed the idea of federal commissions a day before his White House announced its own commission on school violence  The White House ended up far to the right of most of these proposals. Its idea to arm teachers is so controversial that most Republicans in Congress don't support it.\n We saw a similar unraveling of compromise play out in a January immigration debate. And a pattern\u00a0is starting to emerge on how to read Trump's wild spins on divisive issues: When it comes time for the White House\u00a0to put its own ideas in writing,\u00a0he'll land to the right of most of the rest of Washington, no matter how he seemed to be at the center or left just a few days ago.\n When the cameras were invited to a White House meeting with Trump and bipartisan lawmakers a few weeks ago, Trump seemed so open to gun-control proposals that he accused one of the most pro gun-control Republicans in the Senate, Patrick J. Toomey, of being afraid of the NRA because\u00a0Toomey's universal background check bill from 2013 also didn't raise the age limit for buying assault rifles.\n  Then,\u00a0Trump made one of the most pro gun-control Democrats in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, positively giddy with the suggestion Congress should ban assault weapons.\n  Actually, almost all Senate Democrats were thrilled after that meeting. They launched a news conference the very next day on Capitol Hill to unveil their gun-control wish list, hoping to build on the momentum the president had just given them.\n \u201cI am sure many of you in this room and many Americans around the country watched the president's meeting on gun violence yesterday,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), \u201cand were rather stunned and surprised. Many of us pleasantly.\u201d\n But whatever support Democrats think they had from the president\u00a0has fizzled. Trump ignored\u00a0their outstretched hand on universal background checks, and started talking more about arming teachers. Less than two weeks after that meeting, his White House formalized his drift back to the right. They announced Sunday night they would help train schoolteachers to carry guns, a\u00a0proposal plucked straight from the NRA, and they'd endorse a Republican-led bill that reinforces the background check system but doesn't expand it.\n [ What will Congress realistically do on guns after the Florida shooting? ]\n Pretty much the same pattern played out a few\u00a0months ago when Congress was trying to come up with an immigration deal to protect \u201cdreamers\u201d from deportation. Democrats thought they had a deal only to\u00a0watch Trump renege. Trump ultimately put forward an immigration proposal to drastically change the legal immigration system that is so conservative most Republicans in Congress won't support it.\n There are two possibilities here about what's leading Trump to perform so many 360s on divisive issues,\u00a0and they aren't mutually exclusive:\n  Trump doesn't know what he wants, and he's also not very familiar with the issues. That leads him to either mistakenly support more liberal solutions, or honestly support them without understanding the politics behind it. In an open-camera meeting with lawmakers on immigration in January, Trump appeared to agree with Democrats on a bill just to legalize dreamers without anything in exchange. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had to interject to correct the president that's actually the opposite of what Trump wants to do. The president seemed genuinely confused:\n \u201cMr. President, you need to be clear, though,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think what Senator Feinstein is asking there \u2014 when we talk about just DACA, we don\u2019t want to be back here two years later. You have to have security.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cI think that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u201d \u201cNo, I think she\u2019s saying something different,\u201d McCarthy said. (She was.)\n Trump agrees with the last person who talked to him. And that's usually his staff, who have much more access to him than Democrats in Congress. That's people like Stephen Miller, a Trump loyalist who even some Republicans in Congress say is too extreme to deal with. \u201cHe's been an outlier for years,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said during the immigration debate of Miller, pointing the finger squarely at\u00a0Miller for\u00a0scuttling a bipartisan deal on dreamers, a deal Trump seemed open to just days earlier.  Whatever the reason for Trump's hard-right turns on immigration and guns, it\u00a0underscores what Democrats most fear about negotiating with the president: That no matter what bipartisan compromises president seems to support\u00a0when they're across the table from him, he'll fall back to his most conservative positions.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/12/in-hindsight-democrats-should-have-seen-trumps-360-on-gun-control-coming/", "logo": null, "left_right_score": 0.1544099276204683, "bias": 2, "facebook_likes": 642, "title": "Analysis | In hindsight, Democrats should have seen Trump\u2019s 360 on gun control coming", "source": "The Washington Post"}, "The Guardian": {"body": "Organizers believe up to 500,000 people could travel to Washington DC on 24 March to demand action on gun control.\n\nMarch for Our Lives, organized by the new #NeverAgain movement \u2013 founded by survivors of the Florida school shooting \u2013 has applied for a permit for half a million people in the capital, the Washington Post reported on Friday.\n\nSeventeen people \u2013 14 students and three teachers \u2013 were killed in the shooting at the school.

Think Mitt Romney or Michael Dukakis.\n\nBut Donald Trump won\u2019t disappear. Trump needs attention the way normal people need food.\n\nFor starters, he\u2019ll dispute the election results. He\u2019s already\u00a0warned followers \u201cwe better be careful because that election is going to be rigged and I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it\u2019s going to be taken away from us.\u201c\n\nHis first campaign ad, released last week, features an image of a polling site with the word \u201crigged\u201d flashing onscreen less than two seconds after the spot begins.\n\nTrump won\u2019t have any legal grounds to stand on \u2014 this election won\u2019t be a nail-biter like 2000 \u2014 but his goal won\u2019t be to win in court. It will be to sow enough doubt about the legitimacy of Hillary Clinton\u2019s election that he can continue to feed paranoia on the right.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey shows even now, 51 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters have little or no confidence in the accuracy of the vote count nationally. That\u2019s a big change from supporters of the defeated Republican nominees in 2004 and 2008.\n\nReportedly, Trump is also considering launching his own media network. He\u2019s already hired two of the nation\u2019s most infamous right-wing fight promoters \u2014 Roger Ailes, the founder and former CEO of Fox News, and Stephen Bannon, the pugilistic former head of Breitbart News \u2014 who\u2019d take to such an enterprise like alligators to mud.\n\nAccording to one source, Trump\u2019s rationale is that, \u201cwin or lose, we are onto something here. We\u2019ve triggered a base of the population that hasn\u2019t had a voice in a long time.\u201d\n\nTriggered indeed. Many of them angry and bigoted before his campaign, Trump supporters have only become more so under his tutelage.\n\nThe poison has even seeped down to America\u2019s\u00a0children. A Southern Poverty Law Center survey\u00a0of 2,000 school teachers recently found Trump\u2019s campaign producing an \u201calarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color\u201d and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. \u201cTeachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets \u2026 on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nMost likely to remain after Trump are the economic anxieties Trump exploited. Globalization and technological displacement will continue to rip away the underpinnings of the bottom half of the population, creating fodder for another demagogue. The real problem isn\u2019t globalization or technological change per se. It\u2019s that America\u2019s moneyed interests won\u2019t finance policies necessary to reverse their consequences \u2014 such as a first-class education for all the nation\u2019s young, wage subsidies that bring all workers up to a livable income, a massive \u201cgreen\u201d jobs program, and a universal basic income. Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t proposed anything remotely on this scale, and House Republicans (who will almost certainly remain in power) wouldn\u2019t go along anyway. After Trump, our politics seems likely remain as polarized as before \u2014 but divided less between traditional right and left than between establishment and anti-establishment. Trump will leave the GOP sharply split between its corporate donor class and its working class. Clinton will preside over a party divided only somewhat less dramatically between its own donor class and an increasingly vocal progressive base. Which raises an intriguing, if unlikely, scenario. What if Trump\u2019s authoritarian populists join with progressive populists to form an anti-establishment third party dedicated to getting big money out of American politics? The combination could prove an invincible force for wresting back the economy and democracy from the moneyed interests. It\u2019s not impossible. This has been the strangest election year in modern history, partly because such a large swath of Americans \u2014 Republicans, Democrats and Independents \u2014 have concluded the system is rigged in favor of the privileged and powerful.

And how lucky we are that he won the presidency?I don't know the answer. What I do know is that they ought to be deeply appreciative of him, and deeply grateful for luck or providence, and certainly for Trump himself, that he was elected president. First, it is unlikely that any other Republican would have defeated Hillary Clinton. Second, he has not only surpassed many of our expectations but also thus far governed in a manner more consistent with conservative principles than any president since Ronald Reagan, and arguably Calvin Coolidge.I say this as one who vigorously opposed him during the Republican contest for the nomination. I said from the beginning, in print and on my radio show, that I would support Trump if he became the nominee, but I dreaded his becoming the nominee. His comments about the size of his hands, Sen. John McCain as a prisoner of war and former President George W. Bush lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; his lack of any history as a conservative; and the seeming absence of a filter between his brain and his Twitter app made it difficult for me to imagine him as a serious president of the United States.Nevertheless, once he was nominated, I just as vigorously supported him on the simple and -- I still believe -- unanswerable grounds that while no one could be certain how Trump would govern, we were all certain about how Hillary Clinton would govern -- as a leftist. And I truly believed that another four years of left-wing rule would mean the end of America as it was founded to be.That is why I found the arguments of the conservatives who were Never-Trumpers, many of whom I work with, admire and count as friends, not just unpersuasive but incomprehensible. That a conservative could prefer Clinton -- which was the only upshot of a Never Trump position -- to any Republican could only mean that we have an entirely different understanding of the damage the left has done and would have done to America and the Western world if Clinton had won.I remember Never-Trumpers calling my radio show and asking me how I could possibly believe that, if elected president, Trump would honor his commitment to nominate to the Supreme Court one of the conservatives on the list of judges from which he promised to choose. He has honored that promise. And given the supreme importance of the Supreme Court, isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?He has repealed many of President Obama's energy regulations that would have strangled the American economy. He doesn't believe that carbon-induced warming of the planet will destroy the human race -- the greatest of the innumerable hysterias the left manufactures and then believes in. Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?He has appointed a woman who, as a billionaire, could have easily devoted her life to enjoying her wealth but instead has fought for American students and their parents to be able choose their schools just as the wealthy do. And he has taken on the teachers unions, the only group that has ever given American teachers a bad name. Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?He has appointed as ambassador to the United Nations a woman who is calling the U.N. the naked emperor that it is. And now, America is backing, rather than subverting, Israel in that benighted institution.Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?By building a wall along our southern border, he is reasserting the belief that America actually has borders. Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?And then there is tax reduction and simplification so that private citizens can keep more of their money and corporations can be far more productive.Isn't that reason enough for conservatives to celebrate his presidency?And now, he has vowed, after decades of American obsequiousness, to confront the sociopathic North Korean regime.The American media -- most particularly, its elite -- no longer even feigns objective reporting. It is solely an arm of the left and the Democratic Party, its task being the delegitimization of the Trump presidency.If you live among liberals, it is not chic to express support for President Trump.

So the best way to look at his views is to look at how he\u2019s thought about birth control and about assisted suicide.

The decision to arm them came last week, as preparation has continued for an offensive to retake what is effectively the capital of ISIS, the city of Raqqa in northern Syria. Military officials say the Syrian Kurds are key to that mission.\n\nErdogan's administration, however, considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists because of their ties to Turkish Kurds who have been waging an insurgency to create an independent state over the last three decades. The U.S. and the European Union agree with Turkey that the group of Kurds in Turkey known as the PKK are indeed terrorists, and the Trump administration has sought to ease Turkish worries that the weapons provided to Kurds in Syria would not end up in the hands of the Turkish Kurds.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the U.S. would ensure the PKK has \"no safe quarter.\"\n\nNeither leader broached human rights in their statements, which will likely frustrate those worried about Trump getting too close to a leader inching toward autocratic rule.\n\nErdogan called Trump his \"dear friend\" and made a point to congratulate the U.S. president on his \"legendary triumph\" over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Trump said it was a \"great honor\" to host Erdogan.\n\nBack home, however, not all of Erdogan's countrymen were pleased.\n\n\"Turkey is under a state of emergency since (the failed coup), during which human rights have been trampled on,\" Sezgin Tanrikulu, a legislator from Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, told the AP before the meeting. \"The media and press freedoms have been placed under government control. Torture and ill-treatment have increased.\"\n\n\"Human rights and democracy are not part of Trump's agenda, but we hope that he abandons this stance,\" Tanrikulu said.\n\nTrump made news last month by phoning Erdogan to congratulate him on a referendum in Turkey that furthered Erdogan's power. It continued a trend of Trump's supporting strongmen, as Erdogan has been criticized for jailing the most journalists of any leader in the world, as well as tens of thousands of political dissidents.\n\nStrictures on information are also tightening. Just a few weeks ago, Turkish Web users found that they no longer had access to Wikipedia.\n\nThe two presidents' statements also didn't touch on another key Turkey-related issue: the extradition of cleric Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan blames last year's failed coup attempt on Gulen, a religious leader who now lives in Pennsylvania, and he has repeatedly called for Gulen to stand trial in Turkey.\n\nThe White House has not responded to a request for comment from NPR about Trump's stance on Gulen.\n\nAnd for all the talk of their great relationship, President Trump mispronounced Erdogan's name multiple times in his statement. The Turkish leader's name is pronounced \"AIR-doh-ahn\" but Trump repeatedly said \"Er-duh-GON.\"", "link": "http://www.npr.org/2017/05/16/528614863/turkish-leader-calls-trump-his-dear-friend-despite-decision-to-arm-syrian-kurds?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=politics", "logo": "https://media.npr.org/images/podcasts/primary/npr_generic_image_300.jpg?s=200", "left_right_score": 0.2245469147691077, "bias": 3, "facebook_likes": 2124, "title": "Turkish Leader Calls Trump His 'Dear Friend,' Despite Decision To Arm Syrian Kurds", "source": "NPR"}, "CBN News": {"body": "Survivors from the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, rallied today in Tallahassee, pushing for new gun control measures.\n\nIt's been one week since the deadly shooting rampage at their high school, and state and federal lawmakers are under pressure to take new action on guns.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with students and teachers at the White House.\n\nHundreds of people also showed up at the Minnesota state capitol this week for a rally held by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.\n\n\"We're mothers; we're fathers, parents, neighbors, and we're all ready for our lawmakers to take action to prevent the gun violence that is plaguing our countries,\" Erin Zamoff, a chapter representative said.\n\nIn Florida, survivors of the shooting massacre in Parkland traveled to their state capitol to push for new gun laws.\n\n\"This is not about Democrats; this is not about Republicans,\" one student said. \"This isn't Left or Right.

He\u2019s not about ideas. And ideas are what parties are supposedly based on.\u201d\n\nSuch open divisions between a president and elected officials of the same party mark an extraordinary departure from modern political tradition. Even if they feuded at times with their president, lawmakers knew they could ultimately count on the White House to endorse and raise money for incumbents, because controlling as many seats as possible would serve both their interests.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to align himself with congressional Democrats this week over federal spending and hurricane relief cemented a view that he will not operate according to any such conventions. Relations between the president and congressional Republicans have frayed over the lawmakers\u2019 failure to deliver on key legislation and Mr. Trump\u2019s constant badgering and personal attacks against them.\n\nThe president has repeatedly assured Republicans that he will be an active campaigner for the party next year. But Republican leaders fret that he will gravitate toward candidates who share his distinctive political priorities and anti-Washington attitude, and that nominating some of the Trump-driven candidates could imperil their control of Congress. He will have spent as much time in his first year in office raising money for his own re-election as helping others.\n\nYet even Republicans who are uneasy about Mr. Trump say lawmakers need to understand the grip he holds on the conservative grass roots.\n\n\u201cIf you would go to my county Republican clubs right now, they are all about Trump,\u201d said Representative Tom Rooney, Republican of Florida. \u201cHe is the party.\u201d\n\nJust how far his reach extends could determine some of the most high-profile races next year.\n\nMr. Trump is in open war with Mr. Flake, who shunned the president last year and has written a scathing book about his party\u2019s \u201cFaustian bargain.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s political arm has aired ads against Mr. Heller, while the president himself used a televised White House meeting with Mr. Heller to warn that he would be voted out if he did not back repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, Mr. Flake and Mr. Heller, the only two Republican senators on the 2018 ballot from swing states, are facing primary challenges from pro-Trump candidates.\n\n\u201cHopefully the president recognizes it\u2019s in his best political interest to have as many Republicans in the Senate as possible,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, adding, \u201cI think he can count.\u201d\n\nNearly as worrisome to Republicans is what the president is not doing for another incumbent: Mr. Strange. Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Strange, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, shortly before the senator\u2019s primary last month. At that time, he signaled to the senator that he would campaign with him before a runoff on Sept. 26.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s offered to do whatever he can to help,\u201d Mr. Strange said the day before the primary.\n\nBut now that Mr. Strange finds himself locked in a difficult race with Mr. Moore, Mr. Trump has gone quiet. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, is loudly urging Mr. Trump to back away from Mr. Strange, while some current White House officials counsel the president to be careful about spending political capital on a candidate who may lose, according to a senior administration official.\n\nIn a phone call with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, Mr. Strange highlighted a radio interview that Mr. Moore had done with Laura Ingraham last month in which Mr. Moore said the president was disconnected from his base and suggested that Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, was behind the endorsement of Mr. Strange, according to a Republican briefed on the call.\n\nHowever, any attempt at luring the president into scheduling an Alabama trip has yet to work: Mr. Strange, who has based his entire campaign on his support for and from the president, told Mr. Trump that a presidential or vice-presidential visit could win the race, but no commitment has come.\n\nRepublican leaders are holding out hope that Mr. Trump may still appear with Mr. Strange. Privately, they are furious about the prospect of being saddled with as polarizing a figure as Mr. Moore, who was removed from his post as chief justice of the State Supreme Court over his refusal to remove a Ten Commandments monument. And they are fuming that, even with his loyalists, Mr. Trump cannot be depended upon.\n\nUncertainty is also gripping the House, where this week two Republicans, Mr. Reichert and Mr. Dent, announced their retirements.\n\nTheir decisions, just months after Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, another center-right stalwart, said she would also leave, has Republicans fearing a wave of retirements going into next year. Representative Dave Trott of Michigan is considering retiring, and another Michigan Republican, Fred Upton, may retire or run for the Senate, according to multiple party officials.\n\n\u201cIs the House at risk? Absolutely,\u201d Mr. Dent said.\n\nMr. Dent\u2019s announcement came a day after a pro-Trump candidate announced plans to run against him. That candidate, State Representative Justin Simmons, attacked Mr. Dent as a \u201cringleader\u201d of opposition to the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by the way he\u2019s acted in his votes since President Trump was elected,\u201d Mr. Simmons said in an interview.\n\nWhile they have not gotten the same attention as the threats to Mr. Flake and Mr. Heller, about a half-dozen pro-Trump Republicans have opened primary challenges against Republican members of the House, accusing the incumbents of inadequate fealty to the president. The House Republican campaign arm has quietly started a new incumbent-protection effort called the \u201cPrimary Patriot\u201d program.\n\nMark Harris, a North Carolina minister running against Representative Robert Pittenger in a Republican primary, said voters had plainly validated Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda last year, and expect cooperation from the Republican-led Congress.\n\n\u201cThe average person blames Congress for the failure to enact this president\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cAnd personally, I think they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump will also leave his imprint on races beyond Congress by whom he chooses to support with his time and fund-raising power. Representative Jim Renacci of Ohio, a wealthy former auto dealer who is running for governor, said he had broached the subject of his race during an Oval Office meeting with the president, and Mr. Trump was tuned in.\n\n\u201cThe president has always been supportive of Jim Renacci, because I\u2019ve been supportive of him,\u201d Mr. Renacci said.\n\nBut skeptics of the president say Mr. Trump simply does not understand that his own fate may well hinge on the success of the party\u2019s candidates.\n\nCongressional Republicans are \u201ccarrying water on the Trump agenda up to their eyeballs,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a top lieutenant to Mr. McConnell, while \u201cyou\u2019ve got a Democratic minority that is doing nothing less than trying to impeach the man.\u201d\n\nRepublican frustrations boiled over this week after Mr. Trump torpedoed his own party on a fiscal deal, and then flew on Air Force One with Senator Heidi Heitkamp to North Dakota, where he handed Ms. Heitkamp, a Democrat, a ready-made commercial for her re-election next year by praising her as \u201ca good woman.\u201d\n\nIt was a vivid illustration of just how inconstant his enthusiasm for Republicans might be. Faced with a choice between helping his party weaken a vulnerable Democrat, and indulging a Democrat who has been nice to him and whose support he wants for a tax overhaul, Mr. Trump opted emphatically for the latter.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/us/politics/trump-rattles-republicans-ahead-of-midterm-elections.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "logo": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/misc/NYT_logo_rss_250x40.png", "left_right_score": 0.00429826722734769, "bias": 2, "facebook_likes": 1023, "title": "Mercurial Trump Rattles Republican Party Ahead of Midterms", "source": "The New York Times"}, "Fox News": {"body": "During a bipartisan meeting between Trump and lawmakers, the president issued new gun safety proposals to increase school safety.
