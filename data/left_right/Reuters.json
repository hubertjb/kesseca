[{"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON/PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Americans gathered across the country on Saturday at March For Our Lives rallies to demand tighter gun laws, led by survivors of last month\u2019s Florida school massacre which reignited public anger over mass shootings. \nStudents from the Parkland, Florida, high school where 17 people were killed on Feb. 14 were set to speak at the biggest event, in Washington, where organizers said as many as 500,000 people were expected to demonstrate near the Capitol and call on Congress to fight gun violence. \nThe protests aim to break a legislative gridlock that has long stymied efforts to increase restrictions on firearms sales in a nation where mass shootings at schools and colleges have become a frighteningly frequent occurrence. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want any child to be seen as another statistic,\u201d said Ashley Schlaeger, an 18-year-old freshman at Ohio State University who drove to the Washington rally with friends. \nIn the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland, thousands of people passed through police checkpoints to assemble in a park for a rally and march. Many held signs with slogans including \u201cAm I Next?\u201d \u201cA Call To Arms For the Safety of Our Sons and Daughters\u201d and \u201cCongress = Killers.\u201d \nAdam Buchwald, who survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the crowd he and his friends would stay focused on getting new legislation passed. \n\u201cSadly, this could be repeated in your city or town. This stops now!\u201d he said to loud cheers. \nAt a rally in New York, a moment of silence was held for the Parkland victims. The accused gunman, 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, faces the death penalty if convicted. \nRALLIES WORLDWIDE  More than 800 demonstrations were set to take place in U.S. cities from Los Angeles to New York and in countries around the world, according to coordinators. \nProtesters raise signs during a \"March For Our Lives\" demonstration demanding gun control in New York City, U.S. March 24, 2018.

On the other side of the debate, gun rights advocates cite constitutional guarantees of the right to bear arms. \nThe teenage U.S. organizers have won kudos and cash from dozens of celebrities, with singer Ariana Grande and \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda among those performing in Washington. \n\u201cTrainwreck\u201d star Amy Schumer is set to appear at the Los Angeles rally. Actor George Clooney and his human rights attorney wife, Amal, have donated $500,000 and said they would be at the Washington rally. \nOn Friday, Republican President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that includes modest improvements to background checks for gun sales and grants to help schools prevent gun violence. \nDemocrats and nonpartisan groups hope to register at least 25,000 first-time voters at the rallies, potentially a boost for Democrats, who generally favor stricter gun controls. \nWhite House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said the administration applauded \u201cthe many courageous young Americans\u201d exercising their free-speech rights on Saturday.  \n\u201cKeeping our children safe is a top priority of the president\u2019s,\u201d said Walters, noting that on Friday the Justice Department proposed rule changes that would effectively ban \u201cbump stock\u201d devices that let semi-automatic weapons fire like a machine gun. \nReporting by Ian Simpson and Zachary Fagenson; Additional reporting by Katanga Johnson in Washington and Jim Oliphant in West Palm Beach; Editing by Daniel Wallis and James Dalgleish", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns/massive-crowds-rally-across-u-s-to-urge-tighter-gun-controls-idUSKBN1H00BI?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Voter registration activists fanned out among throngs of young Americans who marched for tighter gun laws on Saturday, signing up thousands of first-time voters who want to eject lawmakers who oppose gun control. \nHigh school students carry a banner during a \"March for Our Lives\" demonstration demanding gun control in Seattle, Washington, U.S. March 24, 2018.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump spelled out in new detail several steps he favors to fight a U.S. epidemic of opioid abuse, including the execution of drug dealers, a proposal that has gained little support from drug abuse and judicial experts. \nAt an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump unveiled an anti-opioid abuse plan, including his death penalty recommendation, new funding for other initiatives and stiffer sentencing laws for drug dealers.  \nHe said the United States must \u201cget tough\u201d on opioids. \u201cAnd that toughness includes the death penalty,\u201d he said. Neither Trump nor the White House gave further details as to when it would be appropriate to seek the death penalty. \nTrump said that he was working with Congress to find $6 billion in new funding for 2018 and 2019 to fight the opioid crisis. The plan will also seek to cut opioid prescriptions by a third over three years by changing federal programs, he said. \nAddiction to opioids - mainly prescription painkillers,  heroin and fentanyl - is a growing U.S. problem, especially in rural areas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016. \nFor Trump, the New Hampshire visit returned him to a state that gave him a key Republican primary election win when he was a political newcomer in 2016. Back then, he promised to tackle the opioid crisis, which is severe in the New England state. \nIn October, he declared the crisis a public health emergency, but without providing more money. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said then that the declaration was meaningless without additional funds. \nIn Manchester, Trump stopped at a local fire station that helps addicts get treatment. He was greeted by roughly 200 protesters, some chanting \u201cYou talk, we die.\u201d \nOthers carried signs, including one that read \u201cDonald J. Duterte,\u201d a reference to the Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal crackdown on drugs has lead to thousands of deaths. \nU.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on \"combatting the opioid crisis\" in a speech at Manchester Community College in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S., March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nFREE NARCAN  Trump said he wanted to give first responders access to life-saving drugs that can reverse overdoses. He said the nasal spray Narcan, which can block opioid effects in overdoses, would be provided free to U.S. schools. \nHe introduced Mike Kelly, an executive at Adapt Pharma, which makes Narcan, at the event. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided, free-of-charge, four boxes to all colleges and universities in the United States. Two boxes free for every high school in the United States, as well as educational awareness,\u201d Kelly said. \nShares in Narcan seller Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Adapt\u2019s commercial partner, rose sharply after Trump\u2019s comments. \nTrump also said his plan would crack down on international and domestic illicit drug supply chains. Part of that would include requiring electronic data for 90 percent of international mail shipments with goods, he said. \nHe said the United States would \u201cengage with China and expand cooperation with Mexico to reduce supplies of heroin, other illicit opioids, and precursor chemicals.\u201d \nThe Justice Department will target negligent physicians and pharmacies, he said, adding that he was considering litigation against drug companies implicated in the opioid crisis. \n\u201cWe will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The death penalty is allowed in 31 states. \nDr Harold Pollack, an urban public health professor at the University of Chicago, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the death penalty for drug dealers will accomplish very much.\u201d \nHe said there was little evidence that tougher sentencing reduced the availability of street drugs and urged Trump to work with Republican state governors to expand the Medicaid federal health program so that drug addicts could get more access to healthcare and counseling. \nOhio Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, in a statement, said Trump took too long to offer a plan, but praised him for offering \u201cambitious, evidence-based reforms.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cI am disappointed that President Trump felt the need to ... encourage prosecutors to seek the death penalty against drug dealers.

REUTERS/John Sommers II\n\nSessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he \u201cpushed back\u201d against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting. Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team.  \n\u201cYes, I pushed back,\u201d Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos\u2019 proposed outreach to Russia. Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller.         \nThree people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all threes, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos\u2019 idea. \nHowever, another meeting attendee, J.D. Gordon, who was the Trump campaign\u2019s director of national security, told media outlets including Reuters in November that Sessions strongly opposed Papadopoulos\u2019 proposal and said no one should speak of it again. In response to a request for comment, Gordon said on Saturday that he stood by his statement. \nSessions, through Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment beyond his prior testimony. The special counsel\u2019s office also declined to comment. Spokeswomen for the Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee did not immediately comment.  \nReuters was unable to determine whether Mueller is probing discrepancies in accounts of the March 2016 meeting.  \nThe three accounts, which have not been reported, raise new questions about Sessions\u2019 testimony regarding contacts with Russia during the campaign. \nSessions previously failed to disclose to Congress meetings he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and testified in October that he was not aware of any campaign representatives communicating with Russians.  \nSome Democrats have seized on discrepancies in Sessions\u2019 testimony to suggest the attorney general may have committed perjury. A criminal charge would require showing Sessions intended to deceive. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he had always told the truth and testified to the best of his recollection.  \nLegal experts expressed mixed views about the significance of the contradictions cited by the three sources.  \nSessions could argue he misremembered events or perceived his response in a different way, making any contradictions unintentional, some experts said.  \nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Sessions\u2019 words might be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what the term pushing back means. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about false statements, prosecutors look for something that is concrete and clear,\u201d he said. \nOther legal experts said, however, that repeated misstatements by Sessions could enable prosecutors to build a perjury case against him.  \n\u201cProving there was intent to lie is a heavy burden for the prosecution. But now you have multiple places where Sessions has arguably made false statements,\u201d said Bennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor.  \nThe March 2016 campaign meeting in Washington was memorialized in a photo Trump posted on Instagram of roughly a dozen men sitting around a table, including Trump, Sessions and Papadopoulos. \nPapadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his Russia contacts, is now cooperating with Mueller.  \nAccording to court documents released after his guilty plea, Papadopoulos said at the campaign meeting that he had connections who could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nPapadopoulos continued to pursue Russian contacts after the March 2016 meeting and communicated with some campaign officials about his efforts, according to the court documents. \nTrump has said that he does not remember much of what happened at the \u201cvery unimportant\u201d campaign meeting. Trump has said he did not meet Putin before becoming president.  \nMoscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russia. \nReporting by Karen Freifeld, Sarah N.

A probe was launched last year under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act. \n\u201cChina doesn\u2019t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,\u201d the Chinese commerce ministry responded in a statement.   \n\u201cChina hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\u201d  \nIn a presidential memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday, there will be a 30-day consultation period that only starts once a list of Chinese goods is published.  \nThat effectively creates room for potential talks to address Trump\u2019s allegations on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.  \nThough the White House has said the planned tariffs were a response to China\u2019s \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d, Trump said he views China as \u201ca friend\u201d, and both sides are in the midst of negotiations. A Chinese commerce ministry official said both sides were in touch, and communication channels were smooth. \nMeantime, China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fresh fruit, wine and nuts in response to imports tariffs Trump announced earlier this month on steel and aluminum, which were due to go into effect on Friday. \nThe inevitable fall in demand from a full-blown trade war would spell trouble for all the economies supplying the United States and China.  \nFeeling the chill, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dropped 2.45 percent, tracking a large overnight fall in Wall Street shares, Shanghai shares .SSEC shed 3.8 percent and Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 4.5 percent, while perceived safe havens such as government bonds gained. \n\u201cThe upshot is that today\u2019s (U.S.) tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,\u201d Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. \u201cChina won\u2019t change its ways. Worries about escalation therefore won\u2019t go away.\u201d \nWilliams estimated that the $506 billion that China exported to the United States drove around 2.5 percent of its total gross domestic product, and the $50-60 billion targeted by the U.S. tariffs contributed just around 0.25 percent.  \nTrump, however, appears intent on fulfilling election campaign promises to reduce the record U.S. trade deficit with China. A commentary published by the official Xinhua news agency said the United States had adopted a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d, and \u201cpanic\u201d over China\u2019s economic rise was driving Washington\u2019s confrontational approach.  \nFILE PHOTO - A worker checks steel wires at a warehouse in Dalian, Liaoning province, China May 15, 2017.

China was not exempted even though it was a far smaller supplier than Canada or South Korea.  \nAlso omitted from the exemption list was U.S. ally Japan, though a government spokesman said Tokyo would press to be included. And Finance Minister Taro Aso expressed empathy with Washington regarding the importance of protecting intellectual property. \nChina\u2019s retaliation against the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum appeared restrained. \nTargeting $3 billion of U.S. imports, China has drawn a list of 128 U.S. products that could be hit with tariffs if the two countries are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues, the ministry said. \nThe commerce ministry said China was considering implementing measures in two stages: first the 15 percent tariff on 120 products including steel pipes, dried fruit and wine worth $977 million, and later, the higher 25 percent tariff on $1.99 billion of pork and recycled aluminum.  \nU.S. wine exports to China last year were $79 million, according to data from the U.S. Wine Institute, which represents Californian wine makers. \nThe fruit growers of California, Florida, Michigan and Washington all stood to lose as China\u2019s list also included close to 80 fruit and nut products. U.S. exports of fruits, frozen juices and nuts to China amounted to $669 million last year, and it was the top supplier of apples, cherries, walnuts and almonds.  \n\u201cWith the restrained response, China hopes Trump can realize his errors and mend his ways,\u201d said Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think tank. \n\u201cIf we really want to counter, the strongest response would be to target soybean and automobiles,\u201d said Xu. \u201cChina is \u2018drawing its bow but not firing.

REUTERS/Aaron P.

The firing - which comes nine months after Trump fired Comey - puts McCabe\u2019s pension in jeopardy. \nIt also is likely to raise questions about whether McCabe received an overly harsh punishment due to political pressure by the Republican president, who has blasted McCabe on Twitter and called for his ouster. \nComey\u2019s firing paved the way for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to tap Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is now leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Trump has denied there was any collusion. \n\u201cI am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\u201d McCabe said in his statement. \n\u201cThis attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort ... to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.\u201d \nMcCabe had stepped down from his position as FBI deputy director in January but remained on leave pending retirement. \nHis departure was triggered by a critical report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that eventually led the  FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility to recommend he be fired.  \nThe report, which has yet to be made public, says McCabe misled investigators about his communications with a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was writing about McCabe\u2019s role in probes tied to Clinton, including an investigation of the Clinton family\u2019s charitable foundation. \nIn his statement, McCabe denied ever misleading investigators.  \nHe added that the release of the inspector general\u2019s report was \u201caccelerated\u201d after he testified behind closed doors before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee where he revealed he could back up Comey\u2019s claims. \nComey\u2019s firing has become central to questions about whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.  \nMcCabe could potentially be a crucial witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation. \nTrump and other Republicans have accused McCabe, a lifelong Republican who worked at the FBI for more than 20 years, of political bias and conflicts in connection with his oversight of investigations related to Clinton. \nSome of that criticism stemmed from the fact that his wife, Jill McCabe, a Democrat, received donations for her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia state Senate campaign from Terry McAuliffe, who was then the state\u2019s governor and an ally of the Clintons. \nMcCabe did not start overseeing the investigations until after his wife\u2019s campaign ended, the FBI has said, and therefore did not have a conflict of interest. \nOn Twitter last year, Trump questioned why McCabe was allowed to oversee an investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while his wife received donations from \u201cClinton puppets.\u201d He said McCabe was \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d \nBehind closed doors, Trump also asked McCabe who he voted for in the presidential election and referred to his wife as a loser, according to a source familiar with the matter. \nMcCabe initially did not respond to Trump\u2019s question but later told Trump he did not vote in 2016, the source said. \nAsked about this in January, Trump said he did not recall asking McCabe whom he voted for. \nThe inspector general\u2019s report is largely focused on how  McCabe answered questions about whether he leaked to the press in advance of a story that was critical of his oversight into the Clinton foundation investigation. \nMcCabe contends he did not view this as a leak but as an authorized disclosure that is commonplace in Washington between reporters and government officials.  \nHe said he answered questions truthfully, and later, when he felt investigators misunderstood his answers, he tried to clarify his responses with them. \nReporting by Sarah N.

He already faces trial on separate charges of illicit spending overruns during his failed re-election campaign in 2012. \nA lawyer for Sarkozy could not immediately be reached for comment. The former president has dismissed the Libya allegations as \u201cgrotesque\u201d and a \u201ccrude manipulation\u201d. \nFrance opened an inquiry into the Libya case in 2013, after reports by French website Mediapart based on claims by a Franco-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, who said he had transferred 5 million euros ($6 million) from Gaddafi\u2019s former intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi to Sarkozy\u2019s campaign director.  \nMonths after he took office in 2007, the French leader came in for criticism for hosting a state visit by Gaddafi during which the Libyan leader pitched his trademark Bedouin-style tent next to the Elysee Palace. \nGaddafi\u2019s first visit to a Western leader in decades, which was accompanied by the signing of several business deals, came after Sarkozy helped get five Bulgarian nurses accused of infecting children with HIV released from jail in Libya. \nSarkozy was later one of the chief advocates of a NATO-led military campaign that resulted in Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow and killing at the hands of rebel forces in 2011. \nFrench judicial procedure allows for investigators to hold a person for questioning for up to 48 hours, after which the magistrates must say whether they have grounds for turning a preliminary inquiry into a full investigation. \nFILE PHOTO: France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (R) and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi attend a ceremony for the signature of 10 billion euros of trade contracts between the two countries at the Elysee Palace in Paris, December 10, 2007.

French authorities had no comment. \nSarkozy\u2019s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was convicted in 2011, after his retirement, of misusing public funds to keep political allies in phantom jobs. That made the now ailing Chirac the first French head of state convicted since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain in 1945. \nSarkozy has been dogged for years by political scandals, but none has led to a conviction. \nThe Libya inquiry has largely focused on the evidence provided by Takieddine, who is himself under investigation in a separate affair of arms sales to Pakistan in the 1990s. \nTakieddine stated in 2016 that he personally handed over three suitcases filled with cash from Gaddafi to Sarkozy and a senior aide to help finance Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. \nSarkozy\u2019s lawyer at the time, Thierry Herzog, dismissed Takieddine\u2019s claims and produced a copy of a witness statement to police by Takieddine in 2012 in which the businessman said he had last seen Sarkozy in November 2003. \nReporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Luke Baker and Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-sarkozy-libya/former-french-leader-sarkozy-held-over-libyan-funding-inquiry-idUSKBN1GW0RH?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress voted early on Friday to approve a $1.3-trillion government funding bill with large increases in military and non-defense spending, sending it to President Donald Trump, who was expected to sign it into law. \nWith Trump\u2019s signature, the bill will avert a threatened government shutdown and keep federal agencies funded until Sept. 30, ending for now Washington\u2019s constant budget squabbles and letting lawmakers focus on getting reelected in November. \nThe Senate voted 65-32 for the bill, several hours after the House of Representatives passed it 256-167 on Thursday. \nThe votes capped a long struggle by Congress, which was supposed to have approved the government funding by last Oct. 1. \nSince then, several stop-gap spending bills have kept the government open, except for two brief shutdowns earlier this year when Congress deadlocked and funding expired. \nDespite Republican leaders urging passage of the bill, some Republicans voted no.

The British response, he said, would be\u201ccommensurate but robust\u201d. \nRussia has requested access to the nerve agent used against Skripal but Britain has denied it access, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Interfax reported that Russia had summoned the British ambassador. \nJOINT WESTERN RESPONSE Britain could call on allies for a coordinated Western response, freeze the assets of Russian business leaders and officials, expel diplomats, launch targeted cyber attacks and cut back participation in events such as the soccer World Cup. \nEuropean allies including French President Emmanuel Macron expressed solidarity with Britain though President Donald Trump has not yet publicly commented on the attack.   \nThe forensic tent, covering the bench where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found, is repositioned by officials in protective suits in the centre of Salisbury, Britain, March 8, 2018.

EU nationals and companies are also banned from buying or selling new bonds or equity in some state-owned Russian banks and major Russian energy companies.  \nNERVE AGENT May said Russia had shown a pattern of aggression including the annexation of Crimea and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.  \nA British public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, one of them a former KGB bodyguard who later became a member of the Russian parliament. \nBoth denied responsibility, as did Moscow. \nPutin, a former KGB spy who took over as Kremlin chief from Yeltsin on the last day of 1999, has denied allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and says the West has repeatedly tried to undermine Russian interests. \nSkripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.   \nSince emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, he has lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious on Sunday. \nA British policeman who was one of the first to attend to the stricken spy was also affected by the nerve agent. He is now conscious in a serious but stable condition, police said. \nAdditional reporting by Alastair Macdonald and Robin Emmott in Brussels, Andreas Rinke in Berlin and Katya Golubkova in Moscow; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia/britain-demands-answer-from-putin-by-midnight-over-nerve-attack-on-former-spy-idUSKCN1GP0PG?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, in a round of interviews with conservative radio shows on Thursday, said the Florida school shooting that killed at least 17 people on Wednesday should not threaten citizens\u2019 rights to own guns. \u201cThere\u2019s more questions than answers at this stage,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said in an interview with Tom Katz on  Indiana radio station WIBC about the mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t think that means you then roll that conversation into taking away citizens\u2019 rights - taking away a law-abiding citizen\u2019s rights.

Police have charged Cruz, who had been kicked out of Douglas for disciplinary problems, with 17 counts of premeditated murder. \n\u201cWe want to see some common sense gun laws so this will never happen again,\u201d said Rachel Padnis, a 16-year-old sophomore from the school near Fort Lauderdale. \nShe and classmates said they were dismayed but undeterred by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature\u2019s Tuesday rebuff of a bid to bring up a bill to block sales of assault rifles. \nPresident Donald Trump, a strong supporter of gun rights, was due to meet later Wednesday with parents, students and teachers who have been victims of gun violence, including those affected by the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting in Florida. \nThe White House meeting comes a day after Trump said his administration would take steps to ban bump stocks, an accessory that enables a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. A spokeswoman said the administration was open to the idea of setting national age limits on sales of assault rifles. \nFlorida state Senator Bill Galvan, slated to be the upper chamber\u2019s next president, has called for a bill to raise the legal age for purchasing assault rifles from 18 to 21, the same as it is for handguns. \nAt the Florida capital in Tallahassee, dozens of students packed into a meeting room and peppered Senate President Joe Negron, a Republican, with questions about why individuals should have continued access to assault rifles. \nNegron declined to say whether he would support any specific gun control measures, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an issue we\u2019re going to look at as we work to develop legislation.\u201d \nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and those supporting them react as they watch the Florida House of Representatives vote down a procedural move to take a bill banning assault weapons out of committee and bring it to the floor for a vote in Tallahassee, Florida, following last week's mass shooting on their campus. REUTERS/Colin Hackley\nTRUMP TALKS U.S. President Donald Trump, a strong supporter of gun rights, was scheduled to host a \u201clistening session\u201d with high school students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday. \nTrump\u2019s support for any tightening of gun laws would mark a change for a Republican who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association gun lobby during the 2016 presidential campaign. \nThe NRA opposes an outright ban on bump stocks but has said it would be open to restrictions on the devices. \nUnder pressure after Parkland, the deadliest-ever shooting at a U.S. high school, Trump on Tuesday directed the Justice Department to quickly complete a proposed rule that would treat \u201cbump stocks\u201d as machine guns, which could effectively outlaw them in the United States. \nLast October, a retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler used multiple assault rifles equipped with bump stocks to kill 58 people at a Las Vegas outdoor concert, the deadliest attack by a single gunman in U.S. history. Bump stocks have not played a prominent role in other recent U.S. mass shootings. \nLater this week, Trump will meet with local and state officials, and plans to talk with governors about the issue. \nTrump generally favors a Senate bill on background checks, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.  \nCalls for national student walk-outs and marches in the coming months have gained steam on social media, including the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d on March 24 in Washington, spearheaded by Douglas students. \nScattered school walk-outs in support of the Florida students were planned around the United States on Wednesday, according to officials and local media. \nThe NRA has agreed to participate in a televised town hall on guns to be broadcast by CNN later today, the news network said. NRA officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nGun violence on public school and college campuses has become so commonplace in the United States in the last several years that administrators regularly stage drills to train students and staff in the event of a mass shooting. \nAdditional reporting by Katanga Johnson in Parkland, Florida, and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Jonathan Oatis", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns/florida-school-massacre-survivors-push-lawmakers-for-assault-gun-ban-idUSKCN1G51QY?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "LIMA (Reuters) - A Peruvian judge on Saturday imposed travel restrictions on former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned this week while facing near-certain impeachment over ties to a construction firm at the heart of a graft investigation. \nPedro Pablo Kuczynski greets palace staff members after resignation, at the Government Palace in Lima, Peru March 22, 2018.

But more must be done,\u201d Republican House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce added. \nTrump has faced fierce criticism in the United States for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling and other actions, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians, an allegation the president denies. \nSixteen of the Russian individuals and entities sanctioned were indicted on Feb. 16 as part of Mueller\u2019s criminal investigation. \n\u201cThey didn\u2019t hit Putin\u2019s power structure and they didn\u2019t team up with Europe,\u201d Brian O\u2019Toole, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former senior adviser at the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said of the administration\u2019s actions. \nA senior administration official told Reuters that Trump, who campaigned on warmer ties with Putin, has grown exasperated with Russian activity. \u201cA classic bully,\u201d the official said of Putin. \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, asked if Russia is a friend or foe, told reporters, \u201cRussia is going to have to make that determination.

The United States and Britain last month blamed Russian military for that attack. \nTrump has frequently questioned a January 2017 finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign using hacking and propaganda in an effort eventually aimed at tilting the race in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia denies interfering in the election.  \nBut Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was unequivocal in saying that Thursday\u2019s action by his department \u201ccounters Russia\u2019s continuing destabilizing activities, ranging from interference in the 2016 election to conducting destructive cyber-attacks.\u201d \n\u2018GET SMART\u2019 \u201cPutin constantly attacks our friends.

Trump called it \u201csomething that should never, ever happen, and we\u2019re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.\u201d \nThe new sanctions include Russian intelligence services, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and six individuals working on behalf of the GRU. \nThursday\u2019s action blocks all property of those targeted that is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits American citizens from engaging in transactions with them. \nRussian businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, one of those indicted by Mueller and hit with sanctions on Thursday, said in comments cited by RIA news agency that he already had been hit with U.S. sanctions \u201cmaybe three or four times - I\u2019m tired of counting.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not worried by this,\u201d Prigozhin was quoted as saying. \u201cExcept that now I will stop going to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d \nReporting by Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu; Additional reporting by Dustin Volz, Timothy Gardner, Lesley Wroughton, Warren Strobel and James Oliphant in Washington, Guy Faulconbridge and Estelle Shirbon in London and Polina Ivanova in Moscow; Editing by Mary Milliken and Will Dunham", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/u-s-sanctions-russians-for-meddling-but-not-putins-oligarchs-idUSKCN1GR23B?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday required Arizona to continue to issue driver\u2019s licenses to the young adult immigrants known as Dreamers, refusing to hear the state\u2019s challenge to an Obama-era program that protects hundreds of thousands of people brought into the country illegally as children. \nThe case centered on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created in 2012 under Democratic former President Barack Obama that Republican President Donald Trump already has sought to rescind.

A lawyer for Sadr declined comment. \nProsecutors said Sadr\u2019s family controlled an Iranian conglomerate called Stratus Group, which had international business operations and that led a project to construct thousands of housing units in Venezuela. \nThe project stemmed from agreements that Iran and Venezuela entered into in 2004 and 2005 calling for cooperation between the two governments in constructing housing units in the South American country. \nThe indictment said an Iranian company that Stratus incorporated called Iranian International Housing Corporation entered into a $476 million deal in 2006 with a Venezuelan state-owned energy company to build 7,000 housing units. \nSadr belonged to a committee overseeing the project\u2019s execution, prosecutors said. \nThey said Sadr took steps as part of the project to evade U.S. economic sanctions by concealing the role of Iran and Iranian parties in payments sent through the U.S. banking system. \n\u201cAs alleged, Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad created a network of front companies and foreign bank accounts to mask Iranian business dealings in Venezuela and evade U.S. sanctions,\u201d     Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. \nThe Venezuelan energy company made $115 million in payments to Iranian International Housing Corporation using entities in Switzerland and Turkey to conceal the Iranian connection to the funds, prosecutors said. \nSadr faces six counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. \nPilatus Bank was in litigation with the Maltese journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered last October, over several articles she wrote that accused the bank and Ali Sadr of facilitating corrupt political activities and money laundering.  \nThe bank said the articles were false and defamatory.

Islamic State released a video last month in which it warned Egyptians against taking part in the upcoming vote and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders. \nState news agency MENA quoted Nemr as saying that two people, a policeman and a driver, were killed in the blast. \nPhotos on social media that Reuters could not independently verify showed a burnt out car and smoke at the site of the blast. \n\u201cOn Saturday March 24 an explosive device planted underneath a car exploded ... as the Alexandria security chief drove by,\u201d the interior ministry said in a statement. \nEyewitnesses said police and military personnel formed a cordon around the site of the explosion.

(Reuters) - California will block the transportation through its state of petroleum from new offshore oil rigs, officials told Reuters on Wednesday, a move meant to hobble the Trump administration\u2019s effort to vastly expand drilling in U.S. federal waters. California\u2019s plan to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast is the most forceful step yet by coastal states trying to halt the biggest proposed expansion in decades of federal oil and gas leasing.  Officials in Florida, North and South Carolina, Delaware and Washington, have also warned drilling could despoil beaches, harm wildlife and hurt lucrative tourism industries. \u201cI am resolved that not a single drop from Trump\u2019s new oil plan ever makes landfall in California,\u201d Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, chair of the State Lands Commission and a Democratic candidate for governor, said in an emailed statement. The commission sent a letter on Wednesday to the U.S. Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) urging the bureau\u2019s program manager Kelly Hammerle to withdraw the draft proposal, saying the public did not have an adequate opportunity to provide input on the plan.  \u201dIt is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore,\u201d the commission wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. California has clashed repeatedly with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over a range of other issues since last year, from climate change to automobile efficiency standards to immigration. The Interior Department last month announced its proposal to open nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, sparking protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.  Governors from nearly every U.S. coastal state except Alaska and Maine expressed opposition, and even Alaska\u2019s governor requested sensitive areas be removed. The proposal also comes amid low U.S. oil industry demand for new offshore leases, as drillers focus on cheaper and highly-productive wells onshore that have pushed U.S. production over 10 millions barrels per day for the first time since 1970.  Heather Swift, spokeswoman for Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, said developing the five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leases is \u201ca very open and public process.\u201d \u201cSecretary Zinke looks forward to meeting with more Governors and other coastal representatives who want to discuss the draft program,\u201d she said, adding the bureau \u201chas planned 23 public meetings, in our coastal states, to secure feedback directly from citizens.\u201d In an interview on Tuesday, William Brown, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s chief environmental officer, said state input is taken seriously, and has resulted in past drilling plans being scaled back. He said the approval process would take two years and include an environmental review. PROTESTS Trump has said more offshore drilling would boost the U.S. economy and national security by reducing reliance on imported oil.  Opponents of offshore drilling have complained that Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP Plc\u2019s Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. It took months to stop that leak, which became the largest oil spill in American history, despoiling the environment of Gulf Coast states and causing billions of dollars in economic damage. Offshore drilling has been restricted in California since a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. In 2015, another spill in Santa Barbara County sent as much as 2,400 barrels of oil (101,000 gallons or 382,000 liters) onto the coast and into the Pacific, leaving slicks that stretched over nine miles (14 km). Major oil companies, like Chevron Corp (CVX.N), have long since abandoned their efforts in California\u2019s offshore region, despite its estimated 250 million barrels of proven oil reserves, due in part to legislative and political hurdles and easier prospects elsewhere. Chevron gave away the U.S. Geological Survey seismic data on offshore California and other parts of the U.S. West Coast for research use in 2005, deeming it no longer commercially useful. Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small and mid-sized drilling companies, said his members support the administration\u2019s drilling plan.  But, he said that the industry was primarily interested in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region close to existing oil infrastructure and highly-productive fields. He said if California bars oil from passing through pipelines, companies would be even less likely to seek new offshore leases there. A number of other states have asked the Interior Department to exempt them from the drilling plan. So far, Secretary Zinke has said he would exempt Florida, which borders the Eastern Gulf and the Southeastern Atlantic, to protect its tourism industry and he has promised to hold discussions with other states that have expressed concerns.  On Jan. 24, U.S. lawmakers from Florida sent Zinke a letter pressing him to honor his pledge, noting that the acting chief of the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had said Florida\u2019s coast is \u201cstill under consideration for offshore drilling.\u201d  Environmentalists and some elected officials plan to protest the drilling plan at a public meeting on Thursday in Sacramento.

He was freed under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain. \nThe attack on him was likened in Britain to the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium 210. Russia refused to extradite the two Russians identified by Britain as the killers. \nBritain\u2019s response to the Litvinenko affair, which included the expulsion of four Russian diplomats, was criticised domestically as too weak, and many in British politics and media have called for a much tougher response to the Skripal attack. \nSome Russia experts cast doubt over whether May\u2019s actions met that test. \n\u201cThis is certainly not a strong response from Britain - it is a mild response,\u201d said Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue, a Russia expert at  Chatham House think-tank in London. \u201cIt will not deter Russia because Britain is showing too little steel.\u201d \nMay said the 23 diplomats, identified as undeclared intelligence officers, had one week to leave and Russian intelligence capabilities in Britain would be damaged for years. \nMay also said Britain would revoke an invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to visit and suspend planned high level bilateral contacts between London and Moscow. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said Lavrov had not accepted the invitation to visit Britain anyway. \nOn the soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting in June and July, May said no ministers or members of the British royal family would attend. \n\u201cCORRUPT ELITES\u201d But unlike when the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea, May did not name Russian individuals or companies that would be specifically targeted by sanctions. \n\u201cWe will freeze Russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents,\u201d she said. \nShe said checks on private flights, customs and freight would be stepped up to better track those travelling to Britain who could represent a security threat. \nShe also threatened action against those she described as \u201cserious criminals and corrupt elites,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no place for these people, or their money, in our country.\u201d \nLondon has been a venue of choice for many rich Russian to buy property and the in-flow of Russian money has led to the capital being nicknamed \u201cLondongrad\u201d. \nRussian gas giant Gazprom will cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices, including Britain where it has its largest such office by far, and move them to St Petersburg, as part of a drive by Putin to repatriate capital to reduce exposure to sanctions, according to two sources familiar with the plan who spoke exclusively to Reuters in Moscow \nIn a separate development, British media regulator Ofcom said it could strip Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded TV channel, of its UK licence.

Arizona said DACA was enacted through a Department of Homeland Security memo, rather than legislation in the U.S. Congress or a formal agency rule-making process, and could not supersede state law regulating driver\u2019s licenses. \nThe Trump administration urged the justices not to take the case, saying that the president\u2019s rescind the policy means the state\u2019s concerns have already been addressed. \nReporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-arizona/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-arizona-challenge-to-dreamers-program-idUSKBN1GV1QD?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Costas Pitas", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack on a Russian former double agent in southern England, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday, adding it was the biggest single expulsion in over 30 years. \nRussia's flag flies from the consular section of its embassy, in central London, Britain March 14, 2018.

Trump, who wanted warmer ties with Moscow and had opposed the legislation as it worked its way through Congress, signed it reluctantly in August, just six months into his presidency. Under the measure, the administration faced a deadline on Monday to impose sanctions on anyone determined to conduct significant business with Russian defense and intelligence sectors, already sanctioned for their alleged role in the election.  But citing long time frames associated with major defense deals, Nauert said it was better to wait to impose those sanctions. \u201cFrom that perspective, if the law is working, sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent,\u201d she said in a statement.     The measure, known as the \u201cCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,\u201d or CAATSA, required the administration to list \u201coligarchs\u201d close to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government and issue a report detailing possible consequences of penalizing Russia\u2019s sovereign debt. WOULD TRUMP CLAMP DOWN ON RUSSIA? Monday\u2019s deadline to release those reports was seen as a test of Trump\u2019s willingness to clamp down on Russia. Critics blasted him for failing to announce any sanctions. \u201cThe State Department claims that the mere threat of sanctions will deter Russia\u2019s aggressive behavior. How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that\u2019s already underway? It just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cI\u2019m fed up waiting for this Administration to protect our country and our elections,\u201d he said in a statement. Members of Congress, including Democrats and some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, have been clamoring for his administration to use sanctions to punish Moscow for past election interference and prevent future meddling in U.S. polls. Shortly before midnight (0500 GMT) on Monday, the Treasury Department released an unclassified \u201coligarchs\u201d list, including 114 senior Russian political figures and 96 business people. Those named on the list will not immediately face any immediate penalties like asset freezes or visa bans. But the law mandated that the U.S. Treasury and State Departments, and intelligence agencies, compile a list of political figures and business people close to Putin\u2019s government and network, for potential future sanctions. Several U.S. congressional committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November\u2019s election in Trump\u2019s favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats and promoting divisive social and political messages online. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion.  Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the main congressional architects of the sanctions law, said he was not concerned that the administration did not announce sanctions by Monday\u2019s deadline. \u201cThis is when sanctions season begins, and so they\u2019ll be rolling them out,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe feel pretty good about the process,\u201d Corker said. \u201cThey\u2019re rushing the information over to us today, and by the close of business, they\u2019re going to have two of the three, as I understand it.

Trump ... and disparaging Hillary Clinton,\u201d the court document said. The indictment broadly echoes the conclusions of a January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment, which found that Russia had meddled in the election, and that its goals eventually included aiding Trump. In November 2016, the Republican candidate won a surprise electoral college victory over Democratic Party candidate Clinton, who won the popular vote.  A Kremlin spokesman said he was not yet familiar with the U.S. indictment.

Some of those charged, posing as Americans, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the indictment said. Last year, two former Trump campaign aides pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI - charges brought by Mueller\u2019s office. The indictment of the Russians, coupled with the FBI disclosure that it failed to heed a warning about the Florida high school shooter, were blows to the White House, still reeling from the fallout of a scandal involving a former aide accused of domestic abuse by two ex-wives. Trump, who had hoped to focus the entire week on his infrastructure proposal, was closeted in the Oval Office as the reports rolled in, and his communications team was slow to respond to the ever-growing list of queries.

It names the Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg, Russia, 13 Russian nationals and two other companies. The indictment describes a sophisticated, multi-year and well-funded operation, dubbed \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d by Russian entities to influence the election, beginning as early as May 2014. It reveals a deeper level of sophistication and planning than previously known behind Moscow\u2019s purported attempts to interfere. The indictment said that Russians unlawfully used stolen social security numbers and birth dates of Americans to open accounts on the PayPal digital payment platform and to post on social media using those fake identities. It said the defendants and others began producing, purchasing and posting political advertisements of U.S. social media. They included \u201cI say no to Hillary Clinton/I say no to manipulation,\u201d  \u201cJOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016,\u201d \u201cDonald wants to defeat terrorism . . .

Yuri Kadobnov/POOL via Reuters\n\nPutin\u2019s victory will extend his total time in office to nearly a quarter of a century, until 2024, by which time he will be 71. Only Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ruled for longer. Putin has promised to use his new term to beef up Russia\u2019s defenses against the West and to raise living standards. \nIn a widely expected outcome, an exit poll by pollster VTsIOM showed Putin, who has dominated the political landscape for the last 18 years, had won 73.9 percent of the vote. The Central Election Commission, speaking after almost a third of the votes had been counted, put Putin on 73 percent.    \nBacked by state TV, the ruling party, and credited with an approval rating around 80 percent, his victory was never in doubt. His nearest challenger, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, got just over 11 percent, according to exit polls, while nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky got around 6 percent.    \nNone of the seven candidates who ran against him posed a threat, and opposition leader Alexei Navalny was barred from running. Critics alleged that officials had compelled people to come to the polls to ensure that voter boredom at the one-sided contest did not lead to a low turnout.  \nRussia\u2019s Central Election Commission recognized that there were some irregularities, but was likely to dismiss wider criticism and declare the overall result legitimate. \nPutin loyalists said the result was a vindication of his tough stance towards the West. \n\u201cI think that in the United States and Britain they\u2019ve understood they cannot influence our elections,\u201d Senator Igor Morozov said on state television.  \nValentina Matviyenko, a close Putin ally and speaker of the upper house of parliament, hailed the victory as a moral one over the West.  \n\u201cOur elections have proved once again ... that it\u2019s not possible to manipulate our people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople came together. No other country in the world has such open and transparent elections.\u201d \nThe immediate question is if and when opponents like Navalny  organize protests, citing fraud, and how large and sustained those protests will be. A senior opposition politician has warned they could descend into street clashes if police crack down too hard on demonstrators. \nThe longer-term question is whether Putin will soften his anti-Western rhetoric now the election is won. \nHOSTILE RELATIONS Putin\u2019s bellicose language reached a crescendo before the election in a state-of-the-nation speech when he unveiled new nuclear weapons, saying they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield. \nAt odds with the West over Syria, Ukraine, allegations of Russian election meddling and cyber attacks and the poisoning in Britain of a former Russian spy and his daughter, relations between Moscow and the West are at a post Cold War low.         \nPutin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000.  \nAllies laud the former KGB agent as a father-of-the-nation figure who has restored national pride and expanded Moscow\u2019s global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine. \nCritics accuse him of overseeing a corrupt, authoritarian system and of illegally annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimea in 2014, a move that isolated Russia internationally. \nWestern sanctions on Russia imposed over Crimea and Moscow\u2019s backing of a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine remain in place and have damaged the Russian economy, which  only rebounded last year after a prolonged downturn.  \nBritain and Russia are also locked in a diplomatic dispute over the spy poisoning incident, and Washington is eyeing new sanctions on Moscow over allegations it interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Russia flatly denies. \nOfficials and analysts say there is little agreement among Putin\u2019s top policymakers on an economic strategy for his new term. \nHow long Putin wants to stay in power is uncertain. \nThe constitution limits the president to two successive terms, obliging him to step down at the end of his new mandate \u2014 as he did in 2008 after serving two four-year terms. The presidential term was extended from four to six years, starting in 2012. \nAlthough Putin has six years to consider a possible successor, uncertainty about his long-term future is a potential source of instability in a fractious ruling elite that only he can keep in check.  \nKremlin insiders say Putin has selected no heir apparent, and that any names being circulated are the product of speculation, not knowledge of Putin\u2019s thinking. \n\u201cThe longer he stays in power, the harder it will be to exit,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. \u201cHow can he abandon such a complicated system, which is essentially his personal project?\u201d               \nAdditional reporting by Reuters reporters; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Christian Lowe, Larry King", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-election/putin-wins-another-six-years-at-russias-helm-in-landslide-victory-idUSKCN1GT0TL?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union member states agreed at a summit on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia for a nerve agent attack in Britain, as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it. \nMoscow has denied that it is behind the attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two. \nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel said evidence of Russian culpability presented by British Prime Minister Theresa May was \u201cvery solidly based\u201d and promised new measures after EU leaders agreed late on Thursday to recall their ambassador to Moscow. \n\u201cGermany and France agree that additional steps, on top of the recall of the ambassador, are necessary,\u201d Merkel said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. \nMacron called the attack \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said Europe must respond: \u201cIt is an aggression against the security and sovereignty of an ally that is today a member of the European Union.

Putin said last year that it had destroyed its last stockpiles of such weapons.  \nA Russian chemist who helped develop the nerve agent said only the Russian government could have carried out the attack with such a deadly and advanced toxin. \nVil Mirzayanov, 83, said he had no doubt that Putin was responsible, given that Russia maintains tight control over its Novichok stockpile and that the agent is too complicated for a non-state actor to have weaponized. \n\u201cThe Kremlin all the time, like all criminals, denying - it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Mirzayanov said in an interview in his home in Princeton, New Jersey, where he has lived in exile for more than 20 years. \nSkripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before being arrested in Moscow and later jailed in 2006. He was released under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain.  \nSince emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, Skripal lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious on Sunday. \nA British policeman who was also affected by the nerve agent is now conscious in a serious but stable condition. \nMay said Russia had shown a pattern of aggression including the annexation of Crimea and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210. \nA public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, one of them a former KGB bodyguard who became a member of the Russian parliament. Both denied responsibility, as did Moscow. \nCounter-terrorism officers began investigating the death of another Russian in Britain on Tuesday, although police said it was not thought to be linked to the attack on the Skripals. \nNikolai Glushkov, 68, who was an associate of late tycoon Boris Berezovsky, was found dead on Monday. Berezovsky was found dead in March 2013 with a scarf tied around his neck in the bathroom of his luxury mansion west of London. \nBerezovsky\u2019s death, which police and forensic experts concluded was suicide although a coroner said he could not rule out foul play, is one of 14 deaths in Britain linked to the Russian state in recent years, which interior minister Amber Rudd said authorities would look at again. \nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Michael Holden; Additional reporting by Joseph Ax in Princeton, New Jersey; Editing by Toni Reinhold", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia/britain-and-russia-brace-for-showdown-as-deadline-expires-for-nerve-attack-explanation-idUSKCN1GQ03R?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - China has sent its sole operational aircraft carrier the Liaoning through the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates China from the self-ruled island, Taiwan\u2019s defense minister said on Wednesday, according to local media. \nFILE PHOTO: China's aircraft carrier Liaoning departs Hong Kong, China, July 11, 2017.

Previous mass shootings in the United States have also stirred outrage and calls for action to tighten U.S. gun laws, with few results in Congress. Trump, who visited survivors of the shooting and law enforcement officials on Friday night before spending the weekend at his property in Palm Spring, Florida, is a strong supporter of gun rights and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby group, for his 2016 presidential campaign.  He angered some students by suggesting in a tweet on Saturday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had missed signs that the school shooter was troubled because it was distracted by its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The FBI has acknowledged it failed to act on a tip flagging concerns about the suspect, Nikolas Cruz. Many Republicans generally oppose measures to tighten gun restrictions, citing the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protection of the right to bear arms.

Ahead of Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech, Democrats had said they hoped to see signs from the president that he would give ground on the contentious issue of whether to shield young immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d from deportation. But the president, aiming to keep conservative supporters happy as he looks to November congressional elections, stood by a set of principles opposed by Democrats, including the border wall with Mexico and new restrictions on how many family members that legal immigrants can bring into the United States. \u201cTonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve,\u201d Trump said in his first State of the Union address to Congress. Trump used the hour-and-20-minute speech, given annually by presidents to Congress, to try to overcome doubts about his presidency at a time when he is battling a probe into his campaign\u2019s alleged ties with Russia and suffering low job approval ratings. Trump made no mention of the federal probe into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, a controversy that is dogging his presidency. Trump has denied collusion and has called the probe a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The speech was short on details about Trump\u2019s policy proposals. There was little sign of unity inside the House of Representatives chamber where Trump spoke. Republican lawmakers cheered wildly at the president\u2019s applause lines. Democrats often sat in their seats silently and many booed when he laid out his immigration proposals. DENOUNCES NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP Turning to foreign policy late in the speech, Trump denounced the \u201cdepraved character\u201d of North Korea\u2019s leadership and said Pyongyang\u2019s \u201creckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.\u201d \u201cWe are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening,\u201d he said. Trump also said he had signed an order to keep open the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for detained militants. Democratic President Barack Obama had vowed to close the prison, which has been criticized by human rights groups, but was not able to shut it down completely. Whether Trump would follow through on his appeal for bipartisan harmony was far from clear. Trump\u2019s past attempts at a unifying message have been undermined by his later rancorous tweets and divisive statements that angered Democrats and frequently annoyed lawmakers in his own Republican Party. The unity plea will first be put to the test in his drive for a compromise on protecting 1.8 million Dreamers - people brought illegally to the country as children - who face a March 5 deadline on whether they can begin to be deported.

Trump said he was \u201cextending an open hand\u201d for an immigration deal and that he would provide Dreamers a pathway to citizenship over 10 to 12 years in exchange for funding the border wall, which he promised during his campaign, and restrictions on legal immigration. He called his plan a \u201cdown-the-middle compromise,\u201d but some Democrats hissed when he said he wanted to rein in \u201cchain migration,\u201d the ability of legal immigrants to bring a wide-ranging number of family members into the country. \u201cLet\u2019s come together, set politics aside and finally get the job done,\u201d Trump said. INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN Trump took credit for U.S. economic gains including a soaring stock market and a low jobless rate. He boasted about the economic growth he believes will result from tax cuts Republicans pushed through Congress late last year. \u201cThis is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream,\u201d he said. Trump said he would like a compromise over a plan to rebuild aging roads, bridges and other infrastructure. He said he wanted legislation to generate at least $1.5 trillion through a combination of federal, state and local spending as well as private-sector contributions. \u201cI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve,\u201d he said. Market reaction was muted, with SP 500 futures drifting higher, but investors saying there was little new for Wall Street in the speech. \u201cFutures lifted a bit because it was not a negative speech.  He was calm. He celebrated America. He avoided his own failures,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.  While Trump spoke of compromise, his speech provided some reminders of partisan battles over the past year. He singled out a speech guest, 12-year-old Preston Sharp, for leading an effort to put American flags on the graves of 40,000 veterans, saying the initiative was \u201cwhy we proudly stand for the national anthem.\u201d  His belittling of National Football League players who refused to stand for the anthem in protest against police shootings of minorities and racial disparities in the justice system, dominated headlines last autumn.

Facing a deadline on an immigration controversy and strong Democratic opposition, Trump was calling for the type of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats that has eluded him during a rocky first year in office. Trump will visit Capitol Hill to deliver his first State of the Union speech at 9:10 p.m. (0210 GMT on Wednesday). In preparing for the event, Trump told U.S. television network anchors that he would offer a message of unity, in what would be a rarity for the politically polarizing president. \u201cI would consider it a great achievement if we could make our country united,\u201d he told the anchors during a lunch, according to comments released by the White House. Trump\u2019s speech comes as Americans voice doubts about his fitness for office. A Gallup poll said Trump had an average job approval in 2017 of 38 percent, the lowest first-year rating for any president in the firm\u2019s history. Gallup said that was nearly 20 points lower than the 57 percent averaged by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump\u2019s current approval rating is also 38 percent. That is alarming to Republicans as they seek to maintain control of the U.S. Congress in midterm elections in November.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\u201cOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses,\u201d Trump will say. The atmosphere in the House of Representatives chamber where Trump will speak could be tense. Several Democratic lawmakers have said they will boycott the event. Some Democratic women who will attend plan to wear black in support of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. Ahead of Trump\u2019s speech, Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided over immigration, which has been linked to congressional efforts to pass a spending bill. Lawmakers face a Feb. 8 deadline to reach a compromise on the issue and pass a new budget measure to avoid a second government shutdown after a brief closure earlier this month. Trump will argue that struggling U.S. communities, particularly immigrant communities, will be aided by immigration polices that \u201cfocus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\u201d To attract Democratic votes for an immigration deal, Trump has said he is open to letting \u201cDreamers,\u201d a group of immigrants brought into the country illegally as children, stay in the United States. In return, he has demanded funding for his long-proposed  wall along the border with Mexico and measures to curb family sponsorship of immigrants, proposals that have failed to gain traction with Democrats in the past. RUSSIA PROBE Trump will also promote a $1.7 trillion plan to rebuild America\u2019s aging roads and other infrastructure, but he is not expected to offer many details. Trump is expected to address the various global issues that have preoccupied his administration, such as the challenge posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear and weapons programs, and Iran\u2019s clout in the Middle East.  The president is being buffeted by a series of headlines about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump or his aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign using hacking and propaganda to attempt to tilt the race in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia has denied meddling. Trump, who has called Mueller\u2019s probe a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d has denied any collusion with Russia or that he has obstructed justice in his actions related to the federal investigation.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said so far the two sides had made little progress in bridging differences on immigration. \u201dWe didn\u2019t agree on anything,\u201c Durbin said after a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Monday. \u201dIt\u2019s the same place as it was before, but there was a sense of urgency.\u201d RUSSIA PROBE Trump will also promote a $1.7 trillion plan to rebuild America\u2019s aging roads and other infrastructure, but he is not expected to offer many details. He will speak at a time when he is being buffeted by a drumbeat of headlines about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump or his aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign using hacking and propaganda to attempt to tilt the race in favor of Trump. Russia has denied meddling. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201choax.\u201d Americans, at the same time, are voicing concerns about Trump\u2019s fitness for office. His job approval ratings are about 40 percent, an alarming number with congressional elections coming in November that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Congress. Republicans want Trump to concentrate on job growth and stock market gains in the U.S. economy and tax cuts enacted late last year. \u201cWe hope the president focuses on economic growth and accomplishments and leaves out the drama,\u201d said Republican strategist Scott Reed. \u201cHave a nice world-class event that allows people to focus on his successful accomplishments and not the daily drama.\u201d Trump is expected as well to address the various global crises that have persisted during his watch, such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear challenge and Iran\u2019s clout in the Middle East.  Trump\u2019s drive for more reciprocal trade with China and other countries is also expected to be a dominant theme. Trump has so far been unsuccessful in lowering U.S. trade deficits around the world.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \n\nThe departure of Cohn, the National Economic Council director, expected to be finalized in a few weeks, will blow a hole in Trump\u2019s advisory team at a time when the economy is growing but stock markets are experiencing surges of volatility. \nTrump said in a tweet on Tuesday night he \u201cwill be making a decision soon\u201d on replacing Cohn. Administration officials said Peter Navarro, who is director of the White House National Trade Council, and conservative commentator Larry Kudlow were the \u201ctop two candidates\u201d for the job. \nWhite House officials said the tariffs dispute contributed to Cohn\u2019s decision to leave but was not the sole reason. One official cited several issues and noted: \u201cHis biggest mission was on the tax cut bill, which he got passed.\u201d \nIt was the latest in a series of recent high-profile departures from the White House.     \nCohn told Trump about his decision to resign on Tuesday, but he and the president had been discussing his possible departure for weeks, a White House official said.  \nFollowing the news, the U.S. dollar weakened, while an exchange-traded fund tracking the broad market SP 500 dipped 1 percent. Prices for U.S. government debt barely budged, with analysts expressing concern about trading on Wednesday. \n\u201cOne of the adults in the room has left. The markets will worry that this is a signal that we will definitely go ahead with these tariffs,\u201d said Paul Mortimer-Lee, chief market economist at BNP Paribas corporate and investment banking. \n\u201cCohn was seen as a moderating influence, and now he\u2019s gone. The president\u2019s ear is going to be dominated by louder and louder protectionist voices,\u201d said Mortimer-Lee in New York. \nWithout Cohn in the picture, Navarro, an economist, will likely have a clearer field to pursue a protectionist agenda, which squares with Trump\u2019s long-held concerns about trade. \nTrump said last week he would impose import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, a move criticized by a number of prominent Republican lawmakers. \nTrump\u2019s announcement followed an intense debate within the White House between Cohn and Navarro and their respective allies, said White House officials. \n\u201cIt looks like Gary Cohn has been completely unsuccessful in trying to stop the steel and aluminum tariffs,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank. \nU.S. President Donald Trump arrives with Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn at the U.S. Capitol to meet with House Republicans ahead of their vote on the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" in Washington, U.S., November 16, 2017.

The economic nationalists now certainly have the upper hand,\u201d she added. \nHELPED DRIVE TAX OVERHAUL Cohn, 57, who served in the White House for a little more than a year, achieved an early rapport with Trump and proved influential in the administration\u2019s decisions last April not to label China a currency manipulator and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, instead of terminating it. \nHe also emerged as a main driver of a sweeping tax overhaul passed by Congress in December and signed into law by Trump. The overhaul was Trump\u2019s only major legislative victory of 2017. \nAfter the tax package was approved, Cohn tackled an infrastructure initiative, but it has been slow to gain traction and will likely be further handicapped by his departure. \n\u201cIt has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform,\u201d Cohn said in a statement issued by the White House. \n\u201cI am grateful to the president for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the administration great success in the future,\u201d said Cohn. \nHis relationship with Trump began to sour in mid-2017 after Cohn disagreed with the president\u2019s tepid response to clashes between neo-Nazis and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, sources close to Cohn said. \nCohn, a Democrat, aligned himself in the constantly shifting White House power structure with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump. Like Cohn, both are seen as centrists. \nFormerly president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, Cohn was viewed as a bulwark against protectionism. Business lobbyists frequently cited Cohn as their strongest ally in the White House. \nIn a statement, Trump gave Cohn credit for his role in pushing the tax package through Congress and \u201cunleashing the American economy once again.\u201d \n\u201cHe is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people,\u201d he said. \nAdditional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Lindsay Dunsmuir, Paul Simao, David Shepardson an Chris Sanders in Washington; Kate Duguid and Jennifer Ablan in New York; Writing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Makini Brice; Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohn/trump-economic-adviser-cohn-quits-after-tariffs-dispute-idUSKCN1GI2ZS?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Julia Harte", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of Republican lawmakers in the tightest congressional races are changing their message on guns, expressing new support for restrictions after last month\u2019s high school shooting in Florida, according to a Reuters review of the candidates\u2019 public statements. \nEleven Republican incumbents face elections in 2018 widely seen as toss-ups or leaning against the current office holder. So far, six of them have publicly embraced new gun control measures in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Reuters found. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2I8qevA) \nIn advocating for some restrictions, they are breaking ranks with a party that has often balked at taking significant steps that could restrict Americans\u2019 constitutional right to own guns and has typically limited its responses to mass shootings to expressions of sympathy. \nHowever limited the shift, it shows\u00a0that\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0who will depend on\u00a0the votes of moderates and independents to win tough swing-district races are\u00a0deviating from decades of party orthodoxy on gun ownership.\u00a0 \nThey are doing it amid a public outcry over repeated mass shootings that has been driven in part by student activists who have confronted lawmakers over legislative inaction on the issue. \nIn less competitive races, most Republican candidates are still holding to the party position on guns. Most Republican lawmakers were largely silent last week when President Donald Trump surprised his party with his call for new limits on gun ownership, including a directive to ban so-called bump stocks that make semi-automatic rifles fire more quickly.  \nDon Bacon, a first-term congressman for Omaha, Nebraska, is one of those lawmakers facing what is shaping up to be a hard-fought race in November\u2019s congressional elections. After a former student shot dead 17 people at the Florida high school, he expressed support for tighter restrictions on Americans\u2019 ability to buy and own guns. \nIn social media posts and interviews, he departed from the message of the National Rifle Association, which is a major donor to the Republican Party and has given Bacon one of its highest ratings.  \nBacon said he was working on legislation to raise penalties for illegal gun buyers. He also wanted to improve background checks and allow law enforcement officers to temporarily seize firearms from people believed to be dangerous, after those people are allowed to contest the claims against them. \nAfter a gunman shot dead 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas in October, Bacon was more cautious: He joined 78 lawmakers from both parties in signing a letter urging the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to reevaluate bump stocks. The NRA also supported the move. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not about winning re-election. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right,\u201d the congressman told Reuters of his post-Parkland support for new measures. At the same time, he emphasized that he views himself as a defender of the gun rights enshrined in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nAMERICANS FAVOR RESTRICTIONS \u00a0 Three out of four Americans say they favor banning military-style assault weapons, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\u00a0The poll of 1,488 people between Feb. 25 and March 1 also found that nearly 9 in 10 people supported expanding background checks for gun buyers. \nRepublican incumbents in competitive districts need to respond to voters who are often more open to gun restrictions than those in districts that are easy wins, said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist at FP1 Strategies. \n\u201cIn swing districts, voters have different opinions and they want to see a more comprehensive approach,\u201d Williams said. \nFILE PHOTO: Republican U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher speaks at a news conference in Moscow, Russia, June 2, 2013.   REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\nBecause concern in the United States over mass shootings is high, adopting more restrictive views on gun policy could help candidates in tight races, said Doug Heye, another Republican strategist. But Republican lawmakers also want to avoid alienating gun rights supporters, said Williams. \nUnderscoring that, in another 13 races, where Republican incumbents face competitive but not toss-up races, only three of the Republicans have moved toward gun control, according to the Reuters review. \nNOTICEABLE SHIFTS\u00a0 Dana Rohrabacher is another congressman and gun rights stalwart facing a tough fight to keep his seat. The Southern California Republican has also noticeably shifted his positions. He now says it should be illegal to sell weapons to felons and people taking psychiatric prescription drugs.  \nBy contrast, after the Las Vegas shooting, Rohrabacher\u2019s spokesman Ken Grubbs said it was \u201cdemagoguery\u201d to discuss specific legislative changes, according to a report in a local Californian newspaper. Grubbs did not return a request for comment from Reuters. \nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher arrives for a closed Republican conference meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\nCongressman John Faso of upstate New York said in interviews after the Florida shootings that he favors expanding background checks and not allowing people to buy semi-automatic guns until they turn 21. \nFaso, who took office in 2017, confined his response to the Las Vegas shootings to a Twitter post in which he described them as \u201cheart breaking.\u201d  \nBacon, Rohrabacher and Faso and eight other Republican incumbents face the toughest re-election fights, according to three political analysis groups - Cook Political Report, Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball and Inside Elections.  \nRepublican lawmakers in seven \u201csafe\u201d districts\u00a0adjoining those districts have largely stuck to the same positions they had before the shooting: mostly opposed to new forms of gun control.  \nSome defended their decision to not endorse new restrictions when contacted for comment by Reuters. Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado said he has seen no evidence to justify new laws restricting the purchase or ownership of guns. None of the other lawmakers contacted by Reuters besides Bacon and Buck offered an explanation for their shift or steadfastness on gun policy following Parkland. \nReuters examined the public statements of 31 lawmakers in the competitive and safe districts, including speeches and social media postings, and asked them about any other pronouncements they have made on the issue.  \nNRA DECISIONS TO COME The stark difference in responses can be seen in Florida. Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo is in a tight race in his South Florida district. He said he now favors raising the age of purchase for long guns and even advocates banning civilian purchases of military-style weapons and regulating high-capacity magazines.  \nCongressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who is in an adjacent safe Republican district, issued a press release praising Trump\u2019s NRA-endorsed call to ban bump stocks as \u201ca welcome announcement.\u201d  He advocated no other specific measures to reduce gun violence.  \nThe 18 Republican lawmakers in both competitive and safe seats whose statements Reuters analyzed have received more than $1.5 million from the NRA in donations or expenditures on their behalf throughout their political careers. The 11 lawmakers who did not shift their stance on gun control after the Florida shootings received 85 percent of that, Reuters found. \nAsked whether the NRA was considering limiting support for any of the lawmakers who have expressed support for new gun control measures, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said the association had yet to complete its evaluations of candidates. This would be done after election registration deadlines, which have not yet passed in most states. \u00a0 \nReporting by Julia Harte and Jason Lange; Additional reporting by Grant Smith in New York; Editing by Damon Darlin and Ross Colvin", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-guns-insight/republican-lawmakers-in-tight-races-now-embrace-gun-control-measures-idUSKCN1GJ1EL?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling the deadly nerve agent used to poison a Russian former double agent in England and has been investigating how such weapons can be used in assassinations. \nA police officer stands on duty outside a restaurant which has been secured as part of the investigation into the poisoning of former Russian inteligence agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in Salisbury, March 11, 2018.

This could be done bilaterally outside the EU so as not to press too hard on those bloc members worried about their ties with Moscow, the person said.   \nReluctance from countries - Greece and Hungary among them - mean a draft joint statement by EU leaders now says only that they take \u201cextremely seriously\u201d London\u2019s assessment that it was highly likely Russia was responsible for the attack. \nBut May will push fellow EU leaders to blame Moscow directly for the poisoning of the Skripals who British authorities say have been critically ill since the attack by a Soviet-produced military-grade nerve agent called Novichok.  \nA British official confirmed London was seeking to work with groups of countries on intelligence sharing over spy networks.  \n\u201cRussia has shown itself as a strategic enemy, not a strategic partner,\u201d said another British official, who stressed however that Britain was not seeking new economic sanctions. \nMay will seek to demonstrate to EU governments that all Western countries are vulnerable to such attacks, as well as what NATO says is a Russian strategy to undermine the West, officials said. \n\u201cThe Russia threat does not respect borders and as such we are all at risk,\u201d a second senior British official said. \nPROOF May will need to overcome reluctance from the Russia doves in the EU since the bloc is traditionally split on how to deal with Moscow. \nTies between Moscow and the West plummeted over Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Kiev and support for rebels in east Ukraine, which have triggered sanctions by the EU. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday the Salisbury attack could not go without response. \nMacron and May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump, have already said in a joint statement they \u201cshare\u201d Britain\u2019s assessment of Russian responsibility.  \nDiplomats said EU leaders could to settle for similar language, though some bloc members remained concerned there was not enough direct proof to incriminate Russia in the attack. \nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair the summit and has sided with Britain, said: \u201cIt is clear we should improve our preparedness for future attacks.\u201d \nHe wants the bloc to discuss how to better protect itself from chemical and biological attacks, including in cooperation with NATO, as well as to how to beef up counter-intelligence capabilities to combat hybrid threats. \nAdditional reporting by Elizabeth Piper, Richard Lough, Jean-Baptiste Vey, Editing by Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-eu/britain-seeks-european-help-against-russian-spy-networks-diplomats-idUSKBN1GX3C9?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Susan Cornwell", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders of the U.S. Congress said on Tuesday they would not raise the minimum age for gun buyers, in a sign that one of President Donald Trump\u2019s proposals likely will not get far on Capitol Hill after a deadly Florida school shooting.  \nThe second-deadliest shooting at a U.S. public school has reignited the long-running national debate over gun rights, pitting many of the students who survived the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, against powerful gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association. \nSeveral of those students visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to press Congress to enact new restrictions on gun ownership.  \nRepublicans in Congress have rejected those efforts after similar mass shootings in the past, and party leaders said they were not likely to act this time either. \n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be banning guns from law-abiding citizens. We should be focusing on making sure that citizens who should not get guns in the first place don\u2019t get those guns,\u201d House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told a news conference.     \nTrump has suggested arming teachers and raising the minimum age to buy semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18, but Ryan said Congress was not likely to act on either idea.  \nLocal governments, not Congress, should decide whether to arm teachers, he said. \nTrump still supports raising the age limit and will release specific policy proposals this week, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. \nRyan\u2019s comments made it clear that more aggressive gun limits, like a ban on the military-style rifle used by the 19-year-old Parkland shooter, were unlikely to gain traction in Congress. \nRyan met later in the day with Parkland students, who pushed for a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, as well as other school-safety features, said Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat who represents the district. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the last time they they\u2019re going to come to Washington,\u201d Deutch said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just the beginning of that effort.\u201d  \nBACKGROUND CHECKS Prosecutors have said Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland with a legally purchased rifle. Federal and local law enforcement agencies have acknowledged receiving multiple warnings about Cruz\u2019s potential for violence. \nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor Delaney Tarr walks with other survivors into the office of the House Speaker Paul Ryan for a meeting in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\nTrump and his fellow Republicans are under pressure to act following the massacre, but they also must avoid angering Republican voters who broadly support gun rights as well as interest groups like the NRA, which spent $55 million in the 2016 election.  \nThe House voted in December to bolster a database of people not legally allowed to buy guns and to spur federal agencies and states to upload more data into the system after the Air Force failed to provide records that could have flagged a former service member who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November. \nThat legislation has broad support in the Senate as well, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2  Republican, said he wanted a vote to take place this week. \nSenate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said that measure by itself would not be adequate. He called for Congress to expand the background check system to cover all gun sales, including those conducted at gun shows and over the internet.  \nThat legislation has failed in Congress twice over the past five years, and it fell short again in the House on Tuesday as Republicans rejected an effort by Democrats to bring it up for a vote. \n\u201cWe Democrats, at a minimum, believe we should be passing a universal background check legislation that assures that guns don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \nThe White House does not back that idea, Sanders said. \nACTION IN FLORIDA  As Congress has failed to tighten gun laws after other mass shootings, states have taken action on their own. \nA House of Representatives committee of the Republican-controlled Florida legislature voted on Tuesday to raise the minimum legal age for purchasing all rifles to 21 from 18 and impose a three-day waiting period for any gun purchases. Buyers of handguns must already be at least 21 and submit to a three-day wait. \nThe measure would also create a statewide program to arm specially trained teachers - subject to school district approval - while assigning more police as school resource officers and allowing police to confiscate weapons from people who are involuntarily committed as a danger to themselves or others. \nIn addition, the measure would outlaw the sale of bump stocks, devices that enable semiautomatic rifles to be operated as fully automatic machine guns. The panel rejected a Democratic-backed amendment to ban assault-style weapons. \nThe package must now win approval in the full legislature before it goes to Republican Governor Rick Scott for signature. \nCruz, charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, was due back in court on Wednesday for a hearing to determine whether he has sufficient assets to pay for his own lawyer. His mother died in November. \nStoneman Douglas students were scheduled to return to class on Wednesday for the first time since the massacre. The building where most of the bloodshed occurred will remain closed. The bill adopted by a state House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday would provide funding to demolish the building and replace it with a memorial to shooting victims. \nAdditional reporting by Steve Holland, Katanga Johnson and Doina Chiacu in Washington, Zachary Fagenson in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by Andy Sullivan and Scott Malone; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns/u-s-congressional-republicans-reject-new-limits-on-guns-idUSKCN1GB0K8?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Mark Hosenball", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, has lost access to the most valued U.S. intelligence report, the President\u2019s Daily Brief, as the White House imposes greater discipline on access to secrets, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. \nKushner, who has been operating under an interim security clearance for about a year, had his access to the highly classified briefing cut off in the past few weeks, said the sources. \nA third official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recently passed new information to White House Counsel Don McGahn that led to the slowing or stopping of Kushner\u2019s pending clearance application. The nature of that information was not clear. \nIt also is unclear if and when Kushner\u2019s access to the briefing, known as the PDB, which requires clearance higher than the Top Secret level, would be reinstated. \nKushner, a wealthy New York businessman married to Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, has not received his full security clearance because of his extensive financial links, which have taken a long time to examine. He has revised his security clearance form, called an SF-86, several times. \nA White House spokesman for Kushner did not immediately return a phone call and email seeking comment. Trump ignored reporters\u2019 shouted questions about Kushner and his clearance at an event on Tuesday afternoon. \nKushner\u2019s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement: \u201cMr. Kushner has done more than what is expected of him in this process.\u201d \n\u201cMy inquiries ... have confirmed that there are a dozen or more people at Mr. Kushner\u2019s level whose process is delayed, that it is not uncommon for this process to take this long in a new administration, that the current backlogs are being addressed, and no concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner\u2019s application,\u201d Lowell said.             \nTrump\u2019s White House has been grappling with the security clearance issue since it emerged this month that staff secretary Rob Porter worked for Trump for a year with a temporary clearance despite accusations by his two former wives of domestic abuse. Porter has maintained his innocence. \nThe President\u2019s Daily Brief is distributed to a small number of top-level U.S. officials. It includes highly classified intelligence analysis, information about CIA covert operations and reports from the most sensitive U.S. sources or those shared by allied intelligence agencies. \nFILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump passes his adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner during a Hanukkah Reception at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2017.  REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nNew security clearance policies announced by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \u201cwill not affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the President,\u201d Lowell said. \nBut one of the U.S. officials who said Kushner had lost access to the daily brief said that without it, his role in some major policy deliberations, including on China and Russia, could be limited. \nBROAD PORTFOLIO Kushner has had a broad portfolio in the White House. He has taken the lead on Trump\u2019s plan to forge a Middle East peace deal and led the Office of American Innovation, which is intended to modernize and downsize government programs. \nKelly, whose handling of the Porter case was heavily criticized, decreed on Feb. 16 that any interim security clearances for staffers whose background investigations had been pending since June 1 or before would be discontinued within a week. \nA source familiar with the matter said the situation had caused tensions between Kushner and Kelly. \nOn Friday, Trump said he would leave it to Kelly to settle the security clearance dispute with Kushner, but left little doubt he wanted the case settled in a way that allowed Kushner to keep his job. As president, Trump could grant Kushner a full security clearance on his own authority. \nWhite House spokesman Sarah Sanders would not comment on whether Kushner\u2019s security clearance issues had been resolved. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a valued member of the team and he will continue to do the important work that he\u2019s been doing since he started in the administration,\u201d she told a briefing. \nA top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to McGahn and FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday, asking for more information on the number of White House officials with interim clearances. \nThe letter by Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, suggested bipartisan concern over the issue. \nCiting reports that dozens of officials are operating with interim clearances, the two lawmakers wrote: \u201cIf true, this raises significant concerns that ineligible individuals, who hold positions of public trust, may have access to sensitive or classified information.\u201d \nAdditional reporting by John Walcott, Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Peter Cooney", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kushner/trump-son-in-law-adviser-kushner-loses-access-to-top-intelligence-briefing-sources-idUSKCN1GB2VE?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott on Friday signed into law a bill from the legislature that raises the legal age for buying rifles, imposes a three-day waiting period on all gun sales and allows the arming of some school employees. \nFILE PHOTO - Florida Governor Rick Scott listens during a meeting with law enforcement, mental health, and education officials about how to prevent future tragedies in the wake of last week's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Florida, U.S., February 20, 2018.

At the time there was a big discrepancy with what the government had promised during the elections and what they eventually did.\u201d      \nPublic sector workers are angry with plans to cut public sector headcount by 120,000 by 2022, including with voluntary redundancies, and introduce other reforms including merit-based pay. \nRailway workers are worried by government plans to scrap job-for-life guarantees, automatic annual pay rises and generous early retirement. \n\u201cDiscontent and worry are spreading very quickly,\u201d said Jean-Marc Canon of UGFF-CGT, one of the largest public sector\u2019s unions. \nWhile rail workers have planned a three-month rolling strike starting April 3, public sector workers have no plan yet for further labor action but they will meet next week to decide on any possible move. \nThursday\u2019s strike, and the government\u2019s reaction, will be a test, said Laurent Berger, the head of France\u2019s largest union, CFDT. \n\u201cEither they (the government) listen to us and it will have been just a warning shot, or they don\u2019t listen to us and then, let me tell you that public sector workers are very mobilized,\u201d he told RTL radio. \nAdditional reporting by Caroline Pailliez, Bate Felix and Julie Carriat; Graphic by Leigh Thomas; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-reform-protests/french-public-sector-rail-workers-strike-in-test-for-macron-idUSKBN1GX3AF?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Bernie Woodall", "body": "PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - The 19-year-old man accused of shooting 17 people to death at a Florida high school legally purchased the assault rifle used in the killings and may have foreshadowed the attack in a social media comment investigated by the FBI last year, authorities said on Thursday. (For a graphic on Florida school shooting click tmsnrt.rs/2nX8ECo)  New details about the troubled background and gun ownership of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, emerged as he appeared in court to face formal charges of carrying out the second-deadliest mass shooting at a public school in U.S. history. Authorities also shed more light on how the suspect made a getaway by blending in with students fleeing the school, then casually spent more than an hour drifting through a Walmart store and visiting two fast-food outlets before he was arrested. The shooting also raised questions among anguished parents about the adequacy of school security measures and renewed a national debate on Capitol Hill and elsewhere about the epidemic of gun violence in American schools. The Federal Bureau of Investigation disclosed it received a tip in September about an ominous online message that read: \u201cI\u2018m going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d The comment had been posted to someone else\u2019s YouTube video by a person going by the name of Nikolas Cruz, now presumed to be the same individual as the suspect in the Florida shooting.  However, FBI agents had no information pointing to the \u201ctime, location or true identity\u201d of the person behind the message, Robert Lasky, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Jacksonville office, told reporters. YouTube ultimately removed the material in question, and the FBI\u2019s inquiry was dropped until the name Nikolas Cruz surfaced again in connection with Wednesday\u2019s massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, near Miami. ARRIVED VIA UBER, LEFT WITH FLEEING STUDENTS Authorities say the gunman, identified as a former student at Stoneman Douglas High who had been expelled for disciplinary problems, walked into the school shortly before dismissal time, pulled a fire alarm and opened fire as students and teachers streamed out of classrooms into the halls. Seventeen people died and 15 were injured in the ensuing violence.  The suspect was armed with an AR-15-style semiautomatic assault rifle and numerous ammunition cartridges. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Cruz legally purchased the murder weapon from a licensed dealer, Sunrise Tactical Supply, in Coral Springs, Florida. The sheriff also said Cruz arrived at the school by way of the Uber ride-sharing service and left the scene on foot, mixing in \u201cwith a group that were running away, fearing for their lives.\u201d He walked into a Walmart, bought a beverage at a Subway outlet inside the store, then visited a McDonald\u2019s before he was finally spotted and detained by a police officer in the adjacent town of Coconut Creek, Israel said.

REUTERS/Susan Stocker/PoolCruz, charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, made a brief initial court appearance on Thursday, in which he was ordered held without bond. He spoke only two words - \u201cYes ma\u2018am\u201d - when a judge asked him to confirm his name.  Cruz\u2019s court-appointed lawyer said her client had expressed remorse for his crimes. \u201cHe\u2019s a broken human being,\u201d public defender Melissa McNeill told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s sad, he\u2019s mournful, he\u2019s remorseful.\u201d According to a court document made public on Thursday, Cruz admitted to police after being arrested and advised of his right to avoid self-incrimination that he had committed the attack. Former classmates have described Cruz as a social outcast with a reputation as a trouble-maker, as well as someone who was \u201ccrazy about guns.\u201d The sheriff has said some of the online and social media activity Cruz engaged in was \u201cvery, very disturbing.\u201d     On Thursday, a local leader of the white nationalist militia Republic of Florida, Jordan Jereb, said Cruz had participated in paramilitary training with that group at some point, though Reuters could not immediately verify this. Wednesday\u2019s shooting was the 18th in a U.S. school this year, according to gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. It also ranks as the greatest loss of life from school gun violence after the 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 first-graders and six adult educators dead. President Donald Trump addressed the shooting in a White House speech that emphasized school safety and mental health while avoiding any mention of gun policy. \u201cIt is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe must actually make that difference.\u201d Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives criticized the Republican leadership for refusing to take up legislation on tightening background checks for prospective gun buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling,\u201d Representative Mike Thompson told reporters. \u201cThirty people every day are killed by someone using a gun, and the best we can do is say we need more information?\u201d The Republican-controlled Congress last year revoked Obama-era regulations meant to make it harder for those with severe mental illness to pass FBI background checks for guns, saying it deprived the mentally ill of their gun rights. The American Civil Liberties Union joined in opposing the rule, saying there was no evidence that people with mental disabilities were more likely to commit gun violence. Some gun control proponents and legal experts said Wednesday\u2019s shooting might have been averted if Florida were among the handful of U.S. states with laws allowing police and family members to obtain restraining orders barring people suspected of being a threat from possessing guns. Cruz had recently moved in with another family after his mother\u2019s November death, said Jim Lewis, a lawyer representing the family, bringing his AR-15 along with other belongings.  The family believed Cruz was depressed, but attributed that to his mother\u2019s death, not mental illness, Lewis said.

Trump later denied making the comment.   \n\u201cWe are not in any way attempting to keep Chinese dollars from Africa,\u201d Tillerson told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital. \u201cIt is important that African countries carefully consider the terms of those agreements and not forfeit their sovereignty.\u201d \nThe United States is the leading aid donor to Africa but China surpassed it as a trade partner in 2009. Beijing has pumped billions into infrastructure projects, though critics say the use of Chinese firms and labor undermines their value. \nTillerson said Chinese investments \u201cdo not bring significant job creation locally\u201d and criticized how Beijing structures loans to African government.  \nIf a government accepts a Chinese loan and \u201cgets into trouble\u201d, he said, it can \u201close control of its own infrastructure or its own resources through default.\u201d He did not give examples. \nThe growing Chinese lending to the continent has also attracted criticism from some Africans, who say China\u2019s agenda is to feed its appetite for African raw materials like oil, timber and minerals, and secure contracts for its firms. \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, visiting Zimbabwe on Thursday, told reporters it was inappropriate for Tillerson to criticize China\u2019s relationship with African countries. \n\u201cIt was not appropriate to criticize the relations of his hosts \u2014 when he was a guest there \u2014 with another country,\u201d he said. Many African governments enjoy close ties with both Washington and Beijing.  \nKenya, for example, inaugurated a $3.2 billion railway funded by China last year. For the last three years, Kenya has received more than $100 million annually in U.S. security assistance. \nAsked about Tillerson\u2019s criticism of China\u2019s approach on the continent, Kenya\u2019s foreign affairs minister Monica Juma said: \u201cThis country is engaging with partners from across the world driven by our own interests and for our own value.\u201d \nAfrican Union (AU) Commission Chairman Moussa Faki, of Chad, and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hold a news conference after their meeting at African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia March 8, 2018.

The complex was funded and built by China and is seen as a symbol of Beijing\u2019s thrust for influence and access to the continent\u2019s natural resources. \nEthiopia is home to some of Beijing\u2019s biggest investments, from a railway to Djibouti that opened last year to factories and industrial parks.     \nEarlier this week, Tillerson criticized \u201cChina\u2019s approach\u201d to Africa which he said encouraged dependency through \u201copaque contracts\u201d and \u201cpredatory loan practices\u201d.  \nEthiopia\u2019s prime minister resigned suddenly last month and a state of emergency was imposed but protests in the restive Oromia region have continued.  \nThe secretary of state met Hailemariam Desalegn, who resigned as prime minister but is still acting in the post awaiting a replacement. Details of their discussions were not released.  \nTillerson said after meeting his Ethiopian counterpart Workneh Gebeyehu that the answer to political turmoil in Ethiopia was greater freedoms. \n\u201cIt is important that the country moves on past the state of emergency as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.  \nTillerson reiterated previous calls for African states to cut ties with North Korea. \nNorth Korea has more than a dozen embassies on the continent. The Trump administration has said that Pyongyang earns hard currency from arms deals with African government and the trafficking of wildlife parts from Africa. \nTillerson is due to fly to Djibouti, host to military bases owned by the U.S., China, Japan, France, and Italy.  \nHe will then visit Kenya, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Shabaab Islamist militants in Somalia, before traveling to Chad and Nigeria, which are also battling to contain Islamist insurgents.  \nAnalysts say Trump has focused mainly on security concerns in Africa at a time when China, Turkey and other nations are ramping up diplomatic and business links.  \n\u201cWhen you look at the set of countries that are being visited I think it kind of reinforces the perception that security, indeed, is the overwhelming focus,\u201d said Brahima Coulibaly, the director of the Africa Growth Initiative at Brookings Institution. \nAdditional reporting by Kumerra Gemechu in Addis Ababa and Omar Mohammed in Nairobi; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-africa/u-s-secretary-of-state-says-african-countries-should-weigh-chinese-loans-carefully-idUSKCN1GK114?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam\u2019s state oil firm PetroVietnam has ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol to suspend its \u201cRed Emperor\u201d project off the country\u2019s southeastern coast following pressure from China, the BBC reported on Friday. \nFILE PHOTO: A Repsol logo at a petrol station in Bormujos near the Andalusian capital of Seville, southern Spain March 3, 2016.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump spelled out in new detail several steps he favors to fight a U.S. epidemic of opioid abuse, including the execution of drug dealers, a proposal that has gained little support from drug abuse and judicial experts. \nAt an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump unveiled an anti-opioid abuse plan, including his death penalty recommendation, new funding for other initiatives and stiffer sentencing laws for drug dealers.  \nHe said the United States must \u201cget tough\u201d on opioids. \u201cAnd that toughness includes the death penalty,\u201d he said. Neither Trump nor the White House gave further details as to when it would be appropriate to seek the death penalty. \nTrump said that he was working with Congress to find $6 billion in new funding for 2018 and 2019 to fight the opioid crisis. The plan will also seek to cut opioid prescriptions by a third over three years by changing federal programs, he said. \nAddiction to opioids - mainly prescription painkillers,  heroin and fentanyl - is a growing U.S. problem, especially in rural areas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016. \nFor Trump, the New Hampshire visit returned him to a state that gave him a key Republican primary election win when he was a political newcomer in 2016. Back then, he promised to tackle the opioid crisis, which is severe in the New England state. \nIn October, he declared the crisis a public health emergency, but without providing more money. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said then that the declaration was meaningless without additional funds. \nIn Manchester, Trump stopped at a local fire station that helps addicts get treatment.

Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team.  \n\u201cYes, I pushed back,\u201d Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos\u2019 proposed outreach to Russia. Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller.         \nThree people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all threes, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos\u2019 idea. \nHowever, another meeting attendee, J.D. Gordon, who was the Trump campaign\u2019s director of national security, told media outlets including Reuters in November that Sessions strongly opposed Papadopoulos\u2019 proposal and said no one should speak of it again. In response to a request for comment, Gordon said on Saturday that he stood by his statement. \nSessions, through Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment beyond his prior testimony. The special counsel\u2019s office also declined to comment. Spokeswomen for the Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee did not immediately comment.  \nReuters was unable to determine whether Mueller is probing discrepancies in accounts of the March 2016 meeting.  \nThe three accounts, which have not been reported, raise new questions about Sessions\u2019 testimony regarding contacts with Russia during the campaign. \nSessions previously failed to disclose to Congress meetings he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and testified in October that he was not aware of any campaign representatives communicating with Russians.  \nSome Democrats have seized on discrepancies in Sessions\u2019 testimony to suggest the attorney general may have committed perjury. A criminal charge would require showing Sessions intended to deceive. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he had always told the truth and testified to the best of his recollection.  \nLegal experts expressed mixed views about the significance of the contradictions cited by the three sources.  \nSessions could argue he misremembered events or perceived his response in a different way, making any contradictions unintentional, some experts said.  \nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Sessions\u2019 words might be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what the term pushing back means. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about false statements, prosecutors look for something that is concrete and clear,\u201d he said. \nOther legal experts said, however, that repeated misstatements by Sessions could enable prosecutors to build a perjury case against him.  \n\u201cProving there was intent to lie is a heavy burden for the prosecution. But now you have multiple places where Sessions has arguably made false statements,\u201d said Bennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor.  \nThe March 2016 campaign meeting in Washington was memorialized in a photo Trump posted on Instagram of roughly a dozen men sitting around a table, including Trump, Sessions and Papadopoulos. \nPapadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his Russia contacts, is now cooperating with Mueller.  \nAccording to court documents released after his guilty plea, Papadopoulos said at the campaign meeting that he had connections who could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nPapadopoulos continued to pursue Russian contacts after the March 2016 meeting and communicated with some campaign officials about his efforts, according to the court documents. \nTrump has said that he does not remember much of what happened at the \u201cvery unimportant\u201d campaign meeting. Trump has said he did not meet Putin before becoming president.  \nMoscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russia. \nReporting by Karen Freifeld, Sarah N.

A probe was launched last year under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act. \n\u201cChina doesn\u2019t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,\u201d the Chinese commerce ministry responded in a statement.   \n\u201cChina hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\u201d  \nIn a presidential memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday, there will be a 30-day consultation period that only starts once a list of Chinese goods is published.  \nThat effectively creates room for potential talks to address Trump\u2019s allegations on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.  \nThough the White House has said the planned tariffs were a response to China\u2019s \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d, Trump said he views China as \u201ca friend\u201d, and both sides are in the midst of negotiations. A Chinese commerce ministry official said both sides were in touch, and communication channels were smooth. \nMeantime, China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fresh fruit, wine and nuts in response to imports tariffs Trump announced earlier this month on steel and aluminum, which were due to go into effect on Friday. \nThe inevitable fall in demand from a full-blown trade war would spell trouble for all the economies supplying the United States and China.  \nFeeling the chill, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dropped 2.45 percent, tracking a large overnight fall in Wall Street shares, Shanghai shares .SSEC shed 3.8 percent and Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 4.5 percent, while perceived safe havens such as government bonds gained. \n\u201cThe upshot is that today\u2019s (U.S.) tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,\u201d Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. \u201cChina won\u2019t change its ways. Worries about escalation therefore won\u2019t go away.\u201d \nWilliams estimated that the $506 billion that China exported to the United States drove around 2.5 percent of its total gross domestic product, and the $50-60 billion targeted by the U.S. tariffs contributed just around 0.25 percent.  \nTrump, however, appears intent on fulfilling election campaign promises to reduce the record U.S. trade deficit with China. A commentary published by the official Xinhua news agency said the United States had adopted a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d, and \u201cpanic\u201d over China\u2019s economic rise was driving Washington\u2019s confrontational approach.  \nFILE PHOTO - A worker checks steel wires at a warehouse in Dalian, Liaoning province, China May 15, 2017.

China was not exempted even though it was a far smaller supplier than Canada or South Korea.  \nAlso omitted from the exemption list was U.S. ally Japan, though a government spokesman said Tokyo would press to be included. And Finance Minister Taro Aso expressed empathy with Washington regarding the importance of protecting intellectual property. \nChina\u2019s retaliation against the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum appeared restrained. \nTargeting $3 billion of U.S. imports, China has drawn a list of 128 U.S. products that could be hit with tariffs if the two countries are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues, the ministry said. \nThe commerce ministry said China was considering implementing measures in two stages: first the 15 percent tariff on 120 products including steel pipes, dried fruit and wine worth $977 million, and later, the higher 25 percent tariff on $1.99 billion of pork and recycled aluminum.  \nU.S. wine exports to China last year were $79 million, according to data from the U.S. Wine Institute, which represents Californian wine makers. \nThe fruit growers of California, Florida, Michigan and Washington all stood to lose as China\u2019s list also included close to 80 fruit and nut products. U.S. exports of fruits, frozen juices and nuts to China amounted to $669 million last year, and it was the top supplier of apples, cherries, walnuts and almonds.  \n\u201cWith the restrained response, China hopes Trump can realize his errors and mend his ways,\u201d said Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think tank. \n\u201cIf we really want to counter, the strongest response would be to target soybean and automobiles,\u201d said Xu. \u201cChina is \u2018drawing its bow but not firing.

The firing - which comes nine months after Trump fired Comey - puts McCabe\u2019s pension in jeopardy. \nIt also is likely to raise questions about whether McCabe received an overly harsh punishment due to political pressure by the Republican president, who has blasted McCabe on Twitter and called for his ouster. \nComey\u2019s firing paved the way for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to tap Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is now leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Trump has denied there was any collusion. \n\u201cI am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\u201d McCabe said in his statement. \n\u201cThis attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort ... to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.\u201d \nMcCabe had stepped down from his position as FBI deputy director in January but remained on leave pending retirement. \nHis departure was triggered by a critical report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that eventually led the  FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility to recommend he be fired.  \nThe report, which has yet to be made public, says McCabe misled investigators about his communications with a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was writing about McCabe\u2019s role in probes tied to Clinton, including an investigation of the Clinton family\u2019s charitable foundation. \nIn his statement, McCabe denied ever misleading investigators.  \nHe added that the release of the inspector general\u2019s report was \u201caccelerated\u201d after he testified behind closed doors before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee where he revealed he could back up Comey\u2019s claims. \nComey\u2019s firing has become central to questions about whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.  \nMcCabe could potentially be a crucial witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation. \nTrump and other Republicans have accused McCabe, a lifelong Republican who worked at the FBI for more than 20 years, of political bias and conflicts in connection with his oversight of investigations related to Clinton. \nSome of that criticism stemmed from the fact that his wife, Jill McCabe, a Democrat, received donations for her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia state Senate campaign from Terry McAuliffe, who was then the state\u2019s governor and an ally of the Clintons. \nMcCabe did not start overseeing the investigations until after his wife\u2019s campaign ended, the FBI has said, and therefore did not have a conflict of interest. \nOn Twitter last year, Trump questioned why McCabe was allowed to oversee an investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while his wife received donations from \u201cClinton puppets.\u201d He said McCabe was \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d \nBehind closed doors, Trump also asked McCabe who he voted for in the presidential election and referred to his wife as a loser, according to a source familiar with the matter. \nMcCabe initially did not respond to Trump\u2019s question but later told Trump he did not vote in 2016, the source said. \nAsked about this in January, Trump said he did not recall asking McCabe whom he voted for. \nThe inspector general\u2019s report is largely focused on how  McCabe answered questions about whether he leaked to the press in advance of a story that was critical of his oversight into the Clinton foundation investigation. \nMcCabe contends he did not view this as a leak but as an authorized disclosure that is commonplace in Washington between reporters and government officials.  \nHe said he answered questions truthfully, and later, when he felt investigators misunderstood his answers, he tried to clarify his responses with them. \nReporting by Sarah N.

He already faces trial on separate charges of illicit spending overruns during his failed re-election campaign in 2012. \nA lawyer for Sarkozy could not immediately be reached for comment. The former president has dismissed the Libya allegations as \u201cgrotesque\u201d and a \u201ccrude manipulation\u201d. \nFrance opened an inquiry into the Libya case in 2013, after reports by French website Mediapart based on claims by a Franco-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, who said he had transferred 5 million euros ($6 million) from Gaddafi\u2019s former intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi to Sarkozy\u2019s campaign director.  \nMonths after he took office in 2007, the French leader came in for criticism for hosting a state visit by Gaddafi during which the Libyan leader pitched his trademark Bedouin-style tent next to the Elysee Palace. \nGaddafi\u2019s first visit to a Western leader in decades, which was accompanied by the signing of several business deals, came after Sarkozy helped get five Bulgarian nurses accused of infecting children with HIV released from jail in Libya. \nSarkozy was later one of the chief advocates of a NATO-led military campaign that resulted in Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow and killing at the hands of rebel forces in 2011. \nFrench judicial procedure allows for investigators to hold a person for questioning for up to 48 hours, after which the magistrates must say whether they have grounds for turning a preliminary inquiry into a full investigation. \nFILE PHOTO: France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (R) and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi attend a ceremony for the signature of 10 billion euros of trade contracts between the two countries at the Elysee Palace in Paris, December 10, 2007.

French authorities had no comment. \nSarkozy\u2019s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was convicted in 2011, after his retirement, of misusing public funds to keep political allies in phantom jobs. That made the now ailing Chirac the first French head of state convicted since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain in 1945. \nSarkozy has been dogged for years by political scandals, but none has led to a conviction. \nThe Libya inquiry has largely focused on the evidence provided by Takieddine, who is himself under investigation in a separate affair of arms sales to Pakistan in the 1990s. \nTakieddine stated in 2016 that he personally handed over three suitcases filled with cash from Gaddafi to Sarkozy and a senior aide to help finance Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. \nSarkozy\u2019s lawyer at the time, Thierry Herzog, dismissed Takieddine\u2019s claims and produced a copy of a witness statement to police by Takieddine in 2012 in which the businessman said he had last seen Sarkozy in November 2003. \nReporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Luke Baker and Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-sarkozy-libya/former-french-leader-sarkozy-held-over-libyan-funding-inquiry-idUSKBN1GW0RH?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress voted early on Friday to approve a $1.3-trillion government funding bill with large increases in military and non-defense spending, sending it to President Donald Trump, who was expected to sign it into law. \nWith Trump\u2019s signature, the bill will avert a threatened government shutdown and keep federal agencies funded until Sept. 30, ending for now Washington\u2019s constant budget squabbles and letting lawmakers focus on getting reelected in November. \nThe Senate voted 65-32 for the bill, several hours after the House of Representatives passed it 256-167 on Thursday. \nThe votes capped a long struggle by Congress, which was supposed to have approved the government funding by last Oct. 1. \nSince then, several stop-gap spending bills have kept the government open, except for two brief shutdowns earlier this year when Congress deadlocked and funding expired. \nDespite Republican leaders urging passage of the bill, some Republicans voted no.

She is due to hold a meeting of top security officials on Wednesday. \nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson said the poisoning represented the first use of nerve agents on the continent of Europe since World War Two. The British response, he said, would be\u201ccommensurate but robust\u201d. \nRussia has requested access to the nerve agent used against Skripal but Britain has denied it access, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Interfax reported that Russia had summoned the British ambassador. \nJOINT WESTERN RESPONSE Britain could call on allies for a coordinated Western response, freeze the assets of Russian business leaders and officials, expel diplomats, launch targeted cyber attacks and cut back participation in events such as the soccer World Cup. \nEuropean allies including French President Emmanuel Macron expressed solidarity with Britain though President Donald Trump has not yet publicly commented on the attack.   \nThe forensic tent, covering the bench where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found, is repositioned by officials in protective suits in the centre of Salisbury, Britain, March 8, 2018.

EU nationals and companies are also banned from buying or selling new bonds or equity in some state-owned Russian banks and major Russian energy companies.  \nNERVE AGENT May said Russia had shown a pattern of aggression including the annexation of Crimea and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.  \nA British public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, one of them a former KGB bodyguard who later became a member of the Russian parliament. \nBoth denied responsibility, as did Moscow. \nPutin, a former KGB spy who took over as Kremlin chief from Yeltsin on the last day of 1999, has denied allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and says the West has repeatedly tried to undermine Russian interests. \nSkripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.   \nSince emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, he has lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious on Sunday. \nA British policeman who was one of the first to attend to the stricken spy was also affected by the nerve agent. He is now conscious in a serious but stable condition, police said. \nAdditional reporting by Alastair Macdonald and Robin Emmott in Brussels, Andreas Rinke in Berlin and Katya Golubkova in Moscow; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia/britain-demands-answer-from-putin-by-midnight-over-nerve-attack-on-former-spy-idUSKCN1GP0PG?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, in a round of interviews with conservative radio shows on Thursday, said the Florida school shooting that killed at least 17 people on Wednesday should not threaten citizens\u2019 rights to own guns. \u201cThere\u2019s more questions than answers at this stage,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said in an interview with Tom Katz on  Indiana radio station WIBC about the mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t think that means you then roll that conversation into taking away citizens\u2019 rights - taking away a law-abiding citizen\u2019s rights.

Police have charged Cruz, who had been kicked out of Douglas for disciplinary problems, with 17 counts of premeditated murder. \n\u201cWe want to see some common sense gun laws so this will never happen again,\u201d said Rachel Padnis, a 16-year-old sophomore from the school near Fort Lauderdale. \nShe and classmates said they were dismayed but undeterred by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature\u2019s Tuesday rebuff of a bid to bring up a bill to block sales of assault rifles. \nPresident Donald Trump, a strong supporter of gun rights, was due to meet later Wednesday with parents, students and teachers who have been victims of gun violence, including those affected by the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting in Florida. \nThe White House meeting comes a day after Trump said his administration would take steps to ban bump stocks, an accessory that enables a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. A spokeswoman said the administration was open to the idea of setting national age limits on sales of assault rifles. \nFlorida state Senator Bill Galvan, slated to be the upper chamber\u2019s next president, has called for a bill to raise the legal age for purchasing assault rifles from 18 to 21, the same as it is for handguns. \nAt the Florida capital in Tallahassee, dozens of students packed into a meeting room and peppered Senate President Joe Negron, a Republican, with questions about why individuals should have continued access to assault rifles. \nNegron declined to say whether he would support any specific gun control measures, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an issue we\u2019re going to look at as we work to develop legislation.\u201d \nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and those supporting them react as they watch the Florida House of Representatives vote down a procedural move to take a bill banning assault weapons out of committee and bring it to the floor for a vote in Tallahassee, Florida, following last week's mass shooting on their campus. REUTERS/Colin Hackley\nTRUMP TALKS U.S. President Donald Trump, a strong supporter of gun rights, was scheduled to host a \u201clistening session\u201d with high school students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday. \nTrump\u2019s support for any tightening of gun laws would mark a change for a Republican who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association gun lobby during the 2016 presidential campaign. \nThe NRA opposes an outright ban on bump stocks but has said it would be open to restrictions on the devices. \nUnder pressure after Parkland, the deadliest-ever shooting at a U.S. high school, Trump on Tuesday directed the Justice Department to quickly complete a proposed rule that would treat \u201cbump stocks\u201d as machine guns, which could effectively outlaw them in the United States. \nLast October, a retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler used multiple assault rifles equipped with bump stocks to kill 58 people at a Las Vegas outdoor concert, the deadliest attack by a single gunman in U.S. history. Bump stocks have not played a prominent role in other recent U.S. mass shootings. \nLater this week, Trump will meet with local and state officials, and plans to talk with governors about the issue. \nTrump generally favors a Senate bill on background checks, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.  \nCalls for national student walk-outs and marches in the coming months have gained steam on social media, including the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d on March 24 in Washington, spearheaded by Douglas students. \nScattered school walk-outs in support of the Florida students were planned around the United States on Wednesday, according to officials and local media. \nThe NRA has agreed to participate in a televised town hall on guns to be broadcast by CNN later today, the news network said. NRA officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nGun violence on public school and college campuses has become so commonplace in the United States in the last several years that administrators regularly stage drills to train students and staff in the event of a mass shooting. \nAdditional reporting by Katanga Johnson in Parkland, Florida, and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Jonathan Oatis", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns/florida-school-massacre-survivors-push-lawmakers-for-assault-gun-ban-idUSKCN1G51QY?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "LIMA (Reuters) - A Peruvian judge on Saturday imposed travel restrictions on former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned this week while facing near-certain impeachment over ties to a construction firm at the heart of a graft investigation. \nPedro Pablo Kuczynski greets palace staff members after resignation, at the Government Palace in Lima, Peru March 22, 2018.

A lawyer for Sadr declined comment. \nProsecutors said Sadr\u2019s family controlled an Iranian conglomerate called Stratus Group, which had international business operations and that led a project to construct thousands of housing units in Venezuela. \nThe project stemmed from agreements that Iran and Venezuela entered into in 2004 and 2005 calling for cooperation between the two governments in constructing housing units in the South American country. \nThe indictment said an Iranian company that Stratus incorporated called Iranian International Housing Corporation entered into a $476 million deal in 2006 with a Venezuelan state-owned energy company to build 7,000 housing units. \nSadr belonged to a committee overseeing the project\u2019s execution, prosecutors said. \nThey said Sadr took steps as part of the project to evade U.S. economic sanctions by concealing the role of Iran and Iranian parties in payments sent through the U.S. banking system. \n\u201cAs alleged, Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad created a network of front companies and foreign bank accounts to mask Iranian business dealings in Venezuela and evade U.S. sanctions,\u201d     Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. \nThe Venezuelan energy company made $115 million in payments to Iranian International Housing Corporation using entities in Switzerland and Turkey to conceal the Iranian connection to the funds, prosecutors said. \nSadr faces six counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. \nPilatus Bank was in litigation with the Maltese journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered last October, over several articles she wrote that accused the bank and Ali Sadr of facilitating corrupt political activities and money laundering.  \nThe bank said the articles were false and defamatory.

Islamic State released a video last month in which it warned Egyptians against taking part in the upcoming vote and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders. \nState news agency MENA quoted Nemr as saying that two people, a policeman and a driver, were killed in the blast. \nPhotos on social media that Reuters could not independently verify showed a burnt out car and smoke at the site of the blast. \n\u201cOn Saturday March 24 an explosive device planted underneath a car exploded ... as the Alexandria security chief drove by,\u201d the interior ministry said in a statement. \nEyewitnesses said police and military personnel formed a cordon around the site of the explosion.

(Reuters) - California will block the transportation through its state of petroleum from new offshore oil rigs, officials told Reuters on Wednesday, a move meant to hobble the Trump administration\u2019s effort to vastly expand drilling in U.S. federal waters. California\u2019s plan to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast is the most forceful step yet by coastal states trying to halt the biggest proposed expansion in decades of federal oil and gas leasing.  Officials in Florida, North and South Carolina, Delaware and Washington, have also warned drilling could despoil beaches, harm wildlife and hurt lucrative tourism industries. \u201cI am resolved that not a single drop from Trump\u2019s new oil plan ever makes landfall in California,\u201d Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, chair of the State Lands Commission and a Democratic candidate for governor, said in an emailed statement. The commission sent a letter on Wednesday to the U.S. Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) urging the bureau\u2019s program manager Kelly Hammerle to withdraw the draft proposal, saying the public did not have an adequate opportunity to provide input on the plan.  \u201dIt is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore,\u201d the commission wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. California has clashed repeatedly with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over a range of other issues since last year, from climate change to automobile efficiency standards to immigration. The Interior Department last month announced its proposal to open nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, sparking protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.  Governors from nearly every U.S. coastal state except Alaska and Maine expressed opposition, and even Alaska\u2019s governor requested sensitive areas be removed. The proposal also comes amid low U.S. oil industry demand for new offshore leases, as drillers focus on cheaper and highly-productive wells onshore that have pushed U.S. production over 10 millions barrels per day for the first time since 1970.  Heather Swift, spokeswoman for Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, said developing the five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leases is \u201ca very open and public process.\u201d \u201cSecretary Zinke looks forward to meeting with more Governors and other coastal representatives who want to discuss the draft program,\u201d she said, adding the bureau \u201chas planned 23 public meetings, in our coastal states, to secure feedback directly from citizens.\u201d In an interview on Tuesday, William Brown, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s chief environmental officer, said state input is taken seriously, and has resulted in past drilling plans being scaled back. He said the approval process would take two years and include an environmental review. PROTESTS Trump has said more offshore drilling would boost the U.S. economy and national security by reducing reliance on imported oil.  Opponents of offshore drilling have complained that Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP Plc\u2019s Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. It took months to stop that leak, which became the largest oil spill in American history, despoiling the environment of Gulf Coast states and causing billions of dollars in economic damage. Offshore drilling has been restricted in California since a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. In 2015, another spill in Santa Barbara County sent as much as 2,400 barrels of oil (101,000 gallons or 382,000 liters) onto the coast and into the Pacific, leaving slicks that stretched over nine miles (14 km). Major oil companies, like Chevron Corp (CVX.N), have long since abandoned their efforts in California\u2019s offshore region, despite its estimated 250 million barrels of proven oil reserves, due in part to legislative and political hurdles and easier prospects elsewhere. Chevron gave away the U.S. Geological Survey seismic data on offshore California and other parts of the U.S. West Coast for research use in 2005, deeming it no longer commercially useful. Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small and mid-sized drilling companies, said his members support the administration\u2019s drilling plan.  But, he said that the industry was primarily interested in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region close to existing oil infrastructure and highly-productive fields. He said if California bars oil from passing through pipelines, companies would be even less likely to seek new offshore leases there. A number of other states have asked the Interior Department to exempt them from the drilling plan. So far, Secretary Zinke has said he would exempt Florida, which borders the Eastern Gulf and the Southeastern Atlantic, to protect its tourism industry and he has promised to hold discussions with other states that have expressed concerns.  On Jan. 24, U.S. lawmakers from Florida sent Zinke a letter pressing him to honor his pledge, noting that the acting chief of the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had said Florida\u2019s coast is \u201cstill under consideration for offshore drilling.\u201d  Environmentalists and some elected officials plan to protest the drilling plan at a public meeting on Thursday in Sacramento.

He was freed under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain. \nThe attack on him was likened in Britain to the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium 210. Russia refused to extradite the two Russians identified by Britain as the killers. \nBritain\u2019s response to the Litvinenko affair, which included the expulsion of four Russian diplomats, was criticised domestically as too weak, and many in British politics and media have called for a much tougher response to the Skripal attack. \nSome Russia experts cast doubt over whether May\u2019s actions met that test. \n\u201cThis is certainly not a strong response from Britain - it is a mild response,\u201d said Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue, a Russia expert at  Chatham House think-tank in London. \u201cIt will not deter Russia because Britain is showing too little steel.\u201d \nMay said the 23 diplomats, identified as undeclared intelligence officers, had one week to leave and Russian intelligence capabilities in Britain would be damaged for years. \nMay also said Britain would revoke an invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to visit and suspend planned high level bilateral contacts between London and Moscow. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said Lavrov had not accepted the invitation to visit Britain anyway. \nOn the soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting in June and July, May said no ministers or members of the British royal family would attend. \n\u201cCORRUPT ELITES\u201d But unlike when the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea, May did not name Russian individuals or companies that would be specifically targeted by sanctions. \n\u201cWe will freeze Russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents,\u201d she said. \nShe said checks on private flights, customs and freight would be stepped up to better track those travelling to Britain who could represent a security threat. \nShe also threatened action against those she described as \u201cserious criminals and corrupt elites,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no place for these people, or their money, in our country.\u201d \nLondon has been a venue of choice for many rich Russian to buy property and the in-flow of Russian money has led to the capital being nicknamed \u201cLondongrad\u201d. \nRussian gas giant Gazprom will cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices, including Britain where it has its largest such office by far, and move them to St Petersburg, as part of a drive by Putin to repatriate capital to reduce exposure to sanctions, according to two sources familiar with the plan who spoke exclusively to Reuters in Moscow \nIn a separate development, British media regulator Ofcom said it could strip Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded TV channel, of its UK licence.

Arizona said DACA was enacted through a Department of Homeland Security memo, rather than legislation in the U.S. Congress or a formal agency rule-making process, and could not supersede state law regulating driver\u2019s licenses. \nThe Trump administration urged the justices not to take the case, saying that the president\u2019s rescind the policy means the state\u2019s concerns have already been addressed. \nReporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-arizona/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-arizona-challenge-to-dreamers-program-idUSKBN1GV1QD?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Costas Pitas", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack on a Russian former double agent in southern England, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday, adding it was the biggest single expulsion in over 30 years. \nRussia's flag flies from the consular section of its embassy, in central London, Britain March 14, 2018.

Trump, who wanted warmer ties with Moscow and had opposed the legislation as it worked its way through Congress, signed it reluctantly in August, just six months into his presidency. Under the measure, the administration faced a deadline on Monday to impose sanctions on anyone determined to conduct significant business with Russian defense and intelligence sectors, already sanctioned for their alleged role in the election.  But citing long time frames associated with major defense deals, Nauert said it was better to wait to impose those sanctions. \u201cFrom that perspective, if the law is working, sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent,\u201d she said in a statement.     The measure, known as the \u201cCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,\u201d or CAATSA, required the administration to list \u201coligarchs\u201d close to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government and issue a report detailing possible consequences of penalizing Russia\u2019s sovereign debt. WOULD TRUMP CLAMP DOWN ON RUSSIA? Monday\u2019s deadline to release those reports was seen as a test of Trump\u2019s willingness to clamp down on Russia. Critics blasted him for failing to announce any sanctions. \u201cThe State Department claims that the mere threat of sanctions will deter Russia\u2019s aggressive behavior. How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that\u2019s already underway? It just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cI\u2019m fed up waiting for this Administration to protect our country and our elections,\u201d he said in a statement. Members of Congress, including Democrats and some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, have been clamoring for his administration to use sanctions to punish Moscow for past election interference and prevent future meddling in U.S. polls. Shortly before midnight (0500 GMT) on Monday, the Treasury Department released an unclassified \u201coligarchs\u201d list, including 114 senior Russian political figures and 96 business people. Those named on the list will not immediately face any immediate penalties like asset freezes or visa bans. But the law mandated that the U.S. Treasury and State Departments, and intelligence agencies, compile a list of political figures and business people close to Putin\u2019s government and network, for potential future sanctions. Several U.S. congressional committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November\u2019s election in Trump\u2019s favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats and promoting divisive social and political messages online. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion.  Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the main congressional architects of the sanctions law, said he was not concerned that the administration did not announce sanctions by Monday\u2019s deadline. \u201cThis is when sanctions season begins, and so they\u2019ll be rolling them out,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe feel pretty good about the process,\u201d Corker said. \u201cThey\u2019re rushing the information over to us today, and by the close of business, they\u2019re going to have two of the three, as I understand it.

Trump ... and disparaging Hillary Clinton,\u201d the court document said. The indictment broadly echoes the conclusions of a January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment, which found that Russia had meddled in the election, and that its goals eventually included aiding Trump. In November 2016, the Republican candidate won a surprise electoral college victory over Democratic Party candidate Clinton, who won the popular vote.  A Kremlin spokesman said he was not yet familiar with the U.S. indictment.

Some of those charged, posing as Americans, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the indictment said. Last year, two former Trump campaign aides pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI - charges brought by Mueller\u2019s office. The indictment of the Russians, coupled with the FBI disclosure that it failed to heed a warning about the Florida high school shooter, were blows to the White House, still reeling from the fallout of a scandal involving a former aide accused of domestic abuse by two ex-wives. Trump, who had hoped to focus the entire week on his infrastructure proposal, was closeted in the Oval Office as the reports rolled in, and his communications team was slow to respond to the ever-growing list of queries.

It names the Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg, Russia, 13 Russian nationals and two other companies. The indictment describes a sophisticated, multi-year and well-funded operation, dubbed \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d by Russian entities to influence the election, beginning as early as May 2014. It reveals a deeper level of sophistication and planning than previously known behind Moscow\u2019s purported attempts to interfere. The indictment said that Russians unlawfully used stolen social security numbers and birth dates of Americans to open accounts on the PayPal digital payment platform and to post on social media using those fake identities. It said the defendants and others began producing, purchasing and posting political advertisements of U.S. social media. They included \u201cI say no to Hillary Clinton/I say no to manipulation,\u201d  \u201cJOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016,\u201d \u201cDonald wants to defeat terrorism . . .

Yuri Kadobnov/POOL via Reuters\n\nPutin\u2019s victory will extend his total time in office to nearly a quarter of a century, until 2024, by which time he will be 71. Only Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ruled for longer. Putin has promised to use his new term to beef up Russia\u2019s defenses against the West and to raise living standards. \nIn a widely expected outcome, an exit poll by pollster VTsIOM showed Putin, who has dominated the political landscape for the last 18 years, had won 73.9 percent of the vote. The Central Election Commission, speaking after almost a third of the votes had been counted, put Putin on 73 percent.    \nBacked by state TV, the ruling party, and credited with an approval rating around 80 percent, his victory was never in doubt. His nearest challenger, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, got just over 11 percent, according to exit polls, while nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky got around 6 percent.    \nNone of the seven candidates who ran against him posed a threat, and opposition leader Alexei Navalny was barred from running. Critics alleged that officials had compelled people to come to the polls to ensure that voter boredom at the one-sided contest did not lead to a low turnout.  \nRussia\u2019s Central Election Commission recognized that there were some irregularities, but was likely to dismiss wider criticism and declare the overall result legitimate. \nPutin loyalists said the result was a vindication of his tough stance towards the West. \n\u201cI think that in the United States and Britain they\u2019ve understood they cannot influence our elections,\u201d Senator Igor Morozov said on state television.  \nValentina Matviyenko, a close Putin ally and speaker of the upper house of parliament, hailed the victory as a moral one over the West.  \n\u201cOur elections have proved once again ... that it\u2019s not possible to manipulate our people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople came together. No other country in the world has such open and transparent elections.\u201d \nThe immediate question is if and when opponents like Navalny  organize protests, citing fraud, and how large and sustained those protests will be. A senior opposition politician has warned they could descend into street clashes if police crack down too hard on demonstrators. \nThe longer-term question is whether Putin will soften his anti-Western rhetoric now the election is won. \nHOSTILE RELATIONS Putin\u2019s bellicose language reached a crescendo before the election in a state-of-the-nation speech when he unveiled new nuclear weapons, saying they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield. \nAt odds with the West over Syria, Ukraine, allegations of Russian election meddling and cyber attacks and the poisoning in Britain of a former Russian spy and his daughter, relations between Moscow and the West are at a post Cold War low.         \nPutin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000.  \nAllies laud the former KGB agent as a father-of-the-nation figure who has restored national pride and expanded Moscow\u2019s global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine. \nCritics accuse him of overseeing a corrupt, authoritarian system and of illegally annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimea in 2014, a move that isolated Russia internationally. \nWestern sanctions on Russia imposed over Crimea and Moscow\u2019s backing of a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine remain in place and have damaged the Russian economy, which  only rebounded last year after a prolonged downturn.  \nBritain and Russia are also locked in a diplomatic dispute over the spy poisoning incident, and Washington is eyeing new sanctions on Moscow over allegations it interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Russia flatly denies. \nOfficials and analysts say there is little agreement among Putin\u2019s top policymakers on an economic strategy for his new term. \nHow long Putin wants to stay in power is uncertain. \nThe constitution limits the president to two successive terms, obliging him to step down at the end of his new mandate \u2014 as he did in 2008 after serving two four-year terms. The presidential term was extended from four to six years, starting in 2012. \nAlthough Putin has six years to consider a possible successor, uncertainty about his long-term future is a potential source of instability in a fractious ruling elite that only he can keep in check.  \nKremlin insiders say Putin has selected no heir apparent, and that any names being circulated are the product of speculation, not knowledge of Putin\u2019s thinking. \n\u201cThe longer he stays in power, the harder it will be to exit,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. \u201cHow can he abandon such a complicated system, which is essentially his personal project?\u201d               \nAdditional reporting by Reuters reporters; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Christian Lowe, Larry King", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-election/putin-wins-another-six-years-at-russias-helm-in-landslide-victory-idUSKCN1GT0TL?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union member states agreed at a summit on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia for a nerve agent attack in Britain, as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it. \nMoscow has denied that it is behind the attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two. \nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel said evidence of Russian culpability presented by British Prime Minister Theresa May was \u201cvery solidly based\u201d and promised new measures after EU leaders agreed late on Thursday to recall their ambassador to Moscow. \n\u201cGermany and France agree that additional steps, on top of the recall of the ambassador, are necessary,\u201d Merkel said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. \nMacron called the attack \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said Europe must respond: \u201cIt is an aggression against the security and sovereignty of an ally that is today a member of the European Union.

Putin said last year that it had destroyed its last stockpiles of such weapons.  \nA Russian chemist who helped develop the nerve agent said only the Russian government could have carried out the attack with such a deadly and advanced toxin. \nVil Mirzayanov, 83, said he had no doubt that Putin was responsible, given that Russia maintains tight control over its Novichok stockpile and that the agent is too complicated for a non-state actor to have weaponized. \n\u201cThe Kremlin all the time, like all criminals, denying - it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Mirzayanov said in an interview in his home in Princeton, New Jersey, where he has lived in exile for more than 20 years. \nSkripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before being arrested in Moscow and later jailed in 2006. He was released under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain.  \nSince emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, Skripal lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious on Sunday. \nA British policeman who was also affected by the nerve agent is now conscious in a serious but stable condition. \nMay said Russia had shown a pattern of aggression including the annexation of Crimea and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210. \nA public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, one of them a former KGB bodyguard who became a member of the Russian parliament. Both denied responsibility, as did Moscow. \nCounter-terrorism officers began investigating the death of another Russian in Britain on Tuesday, although police said it was not thought to be linked to the attack on the Skripals. \nNikolai Glushkov, 68, who was an associate of late tycoon Boris Berezovsky, was found dead on Monday. Berezovsky was found dead in March 2013 with a scarf tied around his neck in the bathroom of his luxury mansion west of London. \nBerezovsky\u2019s death, which police and forensic experts concluded was suicide although a coroner said he could not rule out foul play, is one of 14 deaths in Britain linked to the Russian state in recent years, which interior minister Amber Rudd said authorities would look at again. \nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Michael Holden; Additional reporting by Joseph Ax in Princeton, New Jersey; Editing by Toni Reinhold", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia/britain-and-russia-brace-for-showdown-as-deadline-expires-for-nerve-attack-explanation-idUSKCN1GQ03R?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - China has sent its sole operational aircraft carrier the Liaoning through the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates China from the self-ruled island, Taiwan\u2019s defense minister said on Wednesday, according to local media. \nFILE PHOTO: China's aircraft carrier Liaoning departs Hong Kong, China, July 11, 2017.

Previous mass shootings in the United States have also stirred outrage and calls for action to tighten U.S. gun laws, with few results in Congress. Trump, who visited survivors of the shooting and law enforcement officials on Friday night before spending the weekend at his property in Palm Spring, Florida, is a strong supporter of gun rights and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby group, for his 2016 presidential campaign.  He angered some students by suggesting in a tweet on Saturday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had missed signs that the school shooter was troubled because it was distracted by its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The FBI has acknowledged it failed to act on a tip flagging concerns about the suspect, Nikolas Cruz. Many Republicans generally oppose measures to tighten gun restrictions, citing the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protection of the right to bear arms.

Ahead of Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech, Democrats had said they hoped to see signs from the president that he would give ground on the contentious issue of whether to shield young immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d from deportation. But the president, aiming to keep conservative supporters happy as he looks to November congressional elections, stood by a set of principles opposed by Democrats, including the border wall with Mexico and new restrictions on how many family members that legal immigrants can bring into the United States. \u201cTonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve,\u201d Trump said in his first State of the Union address to Congress. Trump used the hour-and-20-minute speech, given annually by presidents to Congress, to try to overcome doubts about his presidency at a time when he is battling a probe into his campaign\u2019s alleged ties with Russia and suffering low job approval ratings. Trump made no mention of the federal probe into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, a controversy that is dogging his presidency. Trump has denied collusion and has called the probe a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The speech was short on details about Trump\u2019s policy proposals. There was little sign of unity inside the House of Representatives chamber where Trump spoke. Republican lawmakers cheered wildly at the president\u2019s applause lines. Democrats often sat in their seats silently and many booed when he laid out his immigration proposals. DENOUNCES NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP Turning to foreign policy late in the speech, Trump denounced the \u201cdepraved character\u201d of North Korea\u2019s leadership and said Pyongyang\u2019s \u201creckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.\u201d \u201cWe are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening,\u201d he said. Trump also said he had signed an order to keep open the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for detained militants. Democratic President Barack Obama had vowed to close the prison, which has been criticized by human rights groups, but was not able to shut it down completely. Whether Trump would follow through on his appeal for bipartisan harmony was far from clear. Trump\u2019s past attempts at a unifying message have been undermined by his later rancorous tweets and divisive statements that angered Democrats and frequently annoyed lawmakers in his own Republican Party. The unity plea will first be put to the test in his drive for a compromise on protecting 1.8 million Dreamers - people brought illegally to the country as children - who face a March 5 deadline on whether they can begin to be deported.

Trump said he was \u201cextending an open hand\u201d for an immigration deal and that he would provide Dreamers a pathway to citizenship over 10 to 12 years in exchange for funding the border wall, which he promised during his campaign, and restrictions on legal immigration. He called his plan a \u201cdown-the-middle compromise,\u201d but some Democrats hissed when he said he wanted to rein in \u201cchain migration,\u201d the ability of legal immigrants to bring a wide-ranging number of family members into the country. \u201cLet\u2019s come together, set politics aside and finally get the job done,\u201d Trump said. INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN Trump took credit for U.S. economic gains including a soaring stock market and a low jobless rate. He boasted about the economic growth he believes will result from tax cuts Republicans pushed through Congress late last year. \u201cThis is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream,\u201d he said. Trump said he would like a compromise over a plan to rebuild aging roads, bridges and other infrastructure. He said he wanted legislation to generate at least $1.5 trillion through a combination of federal, state and local spending as well as private-sector contributions. \u201cI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve,\u201d he said. Market reaction was muted, with SP 500 futures drifting higher, but investors saying there was little new for Wall Street in the speech. \u201cFutures lifted a bit because it was not a negative speech.  He was calm. He celebrated America. He avoided his own failures,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.  While Trump spoke of compromise, his speech provided some reminders of partisan battles over the past year. He singled out a speech guest, 12-year-old Preston Sharp, for leading an effort to put American flags on the graves of 40,000 veterans, saying the initiative was \u201cwhy we proudly stand for the national anthem.\u201d  His belittling of National Football League players who refused to stand for the anthem in protest against police shootings of minorities and racial disparities in the justice system, dominated headlines last autumn.

Facing a deadline on an immigration controversy and strong Democratic opposition, Trump was calling for the type of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats that has eluded him during a rocky first year in office. Trump will visit Capitol Hill to deliver his first State of the Union speech at 9:10 p.m. (0210 GMT on Wednesday). In preparing for the event, Trump told U.S. television network anchors that he would offer a message of unity, in what would be a rarity for the politically polarizing president. \u201cI would consider it a great achievement if we could make our country united,\u201d he told the anchors during a lunch, according to comments released by the White House. Trump\u2019s speech comes as Americans voice doubts about his fitness for office. A Gallup poll said Trump had an average job approval in 2017 of 38 percent, the lowest first-year rating for any president in the firm\u2019s history. Gallup said that was nearly 20 points lower than the 57 percent averaged by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump\u2019s current approval rating is also 38 percent. That is alarming to Republicans as they seek to maintain control of the U.S. Congress in midterm elections in November.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\u201cOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses,\u201d Trump will say. The atmosphere in the House of Representatives chamber where Trump will speak could be tense. Several Democratic lawmakers have said they will boycott the event. Some Democratic women who will attend plan to wear black in support of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. Ahead of Trump\u2019s speech, Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided over immigration, which has been linked to congressional efforts to pass a spending bill. Lawmakers face a Feb. 8 deadline to reach a compromise on the issue and pass a new budget measure to avoid a second government shutdown after a brief closure earlier this month. Trump will argue that struggling U.S. communities, particularly immigrant communities, will be aided by immigration polices that \u201cfocus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\u201d To attract Democratic votes for an immigration deal, Trump has said he is open to letting \u201cDreamers,\u201d a group of immigrants brought into the country illegally as children, stay in the United States. In return, he has demanded funding for his long-proposed  wall along the border with Mexico and measures to curb family sponsorship of immigrants, proposals that have failed to gain traction with Democrats in the past. RUSSIA PROBE Trump will also promote a $1.7 trillion plan to rebuild America\u2019s aging roads and other infrastructure, but he is not expected to offer many details. Trump is expected to address the various global issues that have preoccupied his administration, such as the challenge posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear and weapons programs, and Iran\u2019s clout in the Middle East.  The president is being buffeted by a series of headlines about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump or his aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign using hacking and propaganda to attempt to tilt the race in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia has denied meddling. Trump, who has called Mueller\u2019s probe a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d has denied any collusion with Russia or that he has obstructed justice in his actions related to the federal investigation.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said so far the two sides had made little progress in bridging differences on immigration. \u201dWe didn\u2019t agree on anything,\u201c Durbin said after a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Monday. \u201dIt\u2019s the same place as it was before, but there was a sense of urgency.\u201d RUSSIA PROBE Trump will also promote a $1.7 trillion plan to rebuild America\u2019s aging roads and other infrastructure, but he is not expected to offer many details. He will speak at a time when he is being buffeted by a drumbeat of headlines about U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump or his aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign using hacking and propaganda to attempt to tilt the race in favor of Trump. Russia has denied meddling. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201choax.\u201d Americans, at the same time, are voicing concerns about Trump\u2019s fitness for office. His job approval ratings are about 40 percent, an alarming number with congressional elections coming in November that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Congress. Republicans want Trump to concentrate on job growth and stock market gains in the U.S. economy and tax cuts enacted late last year. \u201cWe hope the president focuses on economic growth and accomplishments and leaves out the drama,\u201d said Republican strategist Scott Reed. \u201cHave a nice world-class event that allows people to focus on his successful accomplishments and not the daily drama.\u201d Trump is expected as well to address the various global crises that have persisted during his watch, such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear challenge and Iran\u2019s clout in the Middle East.  Trump\u2019s drive for more reciprocal trade with China and other countries is also expected to be a dominant theme. Trump has so far been unsuccessful in lowering U.S. trade deficits around the world.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \n\nThe departure of Cohn, the National Economic Council director, expected to be finalized in a few weeks, will blow a hole in Trump\u2019s advisory team at a time when the economy is growing but stock markets are experiencing surges of volatility. \nTrump said in a tweet on Tuesday night he \u201cwill be making a decision soon\u201d on replacing Cohn. Administration officials said Peter Navarro, who is director of the White House National Trade Council, and conservative commentator Larry Kudlow were the \u201ctop two candidates\u201d for the job. \nWhite House officials said the tariffs dispute contributed to Cohn\u2019s decision to leave but was not the sole reason. One official cited several issues and noted: \u201cHis biggest mission was on the tax cut bill, which he got passed.\u201d \nIt was the latest in a series of recent high-profile departures from the White House.     \nCohn told Trump about his decision to resign on Tuesday, but he and the president had been discussing his possible departure for weeks, a White House official said.  \nFollowing the news, the U.S. dollar weakened, while an exchange-traded fund tracking the broad market SP 500 dipped 1 percent. Prices for U.S. government debt barely budged, with analysts expressing concern about trading on Wednesday. \n\u201cOne of the adults in the room has left. The markets will worry that this is a signal that we will definitely go ahead with these tariffs,\u201d said Paul Mortimer-Lee, chief market economist at BNP Paribas corporate and investment banking. \n\u201cCohn was seen as a moderating influence, and now he\u2019s gone. The president\u2019s ear is going to be dominated by louder and louder protectionist voices,\u201d said Mortimer-Lee in New York. \nWithout Cohn in the picture, Navarro, an economist, will likely have a clearer field to pursue a protectionist agenda, which squares with Trump\u2019s long-held concerns about trade. \nTrump said last week he would impose import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, a move criticized by a number of prominent Republican lawmakers. \nTrump\u2019s announcement followed an intense debate within the White House between Cohn and Navarro and their respective allies, said White House officials. \n\u201cIt looks like Gary Cohn has been completely unsuccessful in trying to stop the steel and aluminum tariffs,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank. \nU.S. President Donald Trump arrives with Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn at the U.S. Capitol to meet with House Republicans ahead of their vote on the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" in Washington, U.S., November 16, 2017.

The economic nationalists now certainly have the upper hand,\u201d she added. \nHELPED DRIVE TAX OVERHAUL Cohn, 57, who served in the White House for a little more than a year, achieved an early rapport with Trump and proved influential in the administration\u2019s decisions last April not to label China a currency manipulator and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, instead of terminating it. \nHe also emerged as a main driver of a sweeping tax overhaul passed by Congress in December and signed into law by Trump. The overhaul was Trump\u2019s only major legislative victory of 2017. \nAfter the tax package was approved, Cohn tackled an infrastructure initiative, but it has been slow to gain traction and will likely be further handicapped by his departure. \n\u201cIt has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform,\u201d Cohn said in a statement issued by the White House. \n\u201cI am grateful to the president for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the administration great success in the future,\u201d said Cohn. \nHis relationship with Trump began to sour in mid-2017 after Cohn disagreed with the president\u2019s tepid response to clashes between neo-Nazis and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, sources close to Cohn said. \nCohn, a Democrat, aligned himself in the constantly shifting White House power structure with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump. Like Cohn, both are seen as centrists. \nFormerly president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, Cohn was viewed as a bulwark against protectionism. Business lobbyists frequently cited Cohn as their strongest ally in the White House. \nIn a statement, Trump gave Cohn credit for his role in pushing the tax package through Congress and \u201cunleashing the American economy once again.\u201d \n\u201cHe is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people,\u201d he said. \nAdditional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Lindsay Dunsmuir, Paul Simao, David Shepardson an Chris Sanders in Washington; Kate Duguid and Jennifer Ablan in New York; Writing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Makini Brice; Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohn/trump-economic-adviser-cohn-quits-after-tariffs-dispute-idUSKCN1GI2ZS?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Julia Harte", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of Republican lawmakers in the tightest congressional races are changing their message on guns, expressing new support for restrictions after last month\u2019s high school shooting in Florida, according to a Reuters review of the candidates\u2019 public statements. \nEleven Republican incumbents face elections in 2018 widely seen as toss-ups or leaning against the current office holder. So far, six of them have publicly embraced new gun control measures in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Reuters found. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2I8qevA) \nIn advocating for some restrictions, they are breaking ranks with a party that has often balked at taking significant steps that could restrict Americans\u2019 constitutional right to own guns and has typically limited its responses to mass shootings to expressions of sympathy. \nHowever limited the shift, it shows\u00a0that\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0who will depend on\u00a0the votes of moderates and independents to win tough swing-district races are\u00a0deviating from decades of party orthodoxy on gun ownership.\u00a0 \nThey are doing it amid a public outcry over repeated mass shootings that has been driven in part by student activists who have confronted lawmakers over legislative inaction on the issue. \nIn less competitive races, most Republican candidates are still holding to the party position on guns. Most Republican lawmakers were largely silent last week when President Donald Trump surprised his party with his call for new limits on gun ownership, including a directive to ban so-called bump stocks that make semi-automatic rifles fire more quickly.  \nDon Bacon, a first-term congressman for Omaha, Nebraska, is one of those lawmakers facing what is shaping up to be a hard-fought race in November\u2019s congressional elections. After a former student shot dead 17 people at the Florida high school, he expressed support for tighter restrictions on Americans\u2019 ability to buy and own guns. \nIn social media posts and interviews, he departed from the message of the National Rifle Association, which is a major donor to the Republican Party and has given Bacon one of its highest ratings.  \nBacon said he was working on legislation to raise penalties for illegal gun buyers. He also wanted to improve background checks and allow law enforcement officers to temporarily seize firearms from people believed to be dangerous, after those people are allowed to contest the claims against them. \nAfter a gunman shot dead 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas in October, Bacon was more cautious: He joined 78 lawmakers from both parties in signing a letter urging the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to reevaluate bump stocks. The NRA also supported the move. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not about winning re-election. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right,\u201d the congressman told Reuters of his post-Parkland support for new measures. At the same time, he emphasized that he views himself as a defender of the gun rights enshrined in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nAMERICANS FAVOR RESTRICTIONS \u00a0 Three out of four Americans say they favor banning military-style assault weapons, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\u00a0The poll of 1,488 people between Feb. 25 and March 1 also found that nearly 9 in 10 people supported expanding background checks for gun buyers. \nRepublican incumbents in competitive districts need to respond to voters who are often more open to gun restrictions than those in districts that are easy wins, said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist at FP1 Strategies. \n\u201cIn swing districts, voters have different opinions and they want to see a more comprehensive approach,\u201d Williams said. \nFILE PHOTO: Republican U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher speaks at a news conference in Moscow, Russia, June 2, 2013.   REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\nBecause concern in the United States over mass shootings is high, adopting more restrictive views on gun policy could help candidates in tight races, said Doug Heye, another Republican strategist. But Republican lawmakers also want to avoid alienating gun rights supporters, said Williams. \nUnderscoring that, in another 13 races, where Republican incumbents face competitive but not toss-up races, only three of the Republicans have moved toward gun control, according to the Reuters review. \nNOTICEABLE SHIFTS\u00a0 Dana Rohrabacher is another congressman and gun rights stalwart facing a tough fight to keep his seat. The Southern California Republican has also noticeably shifted his positions. He now says it should be illegal to sell weapons to felons and people taking psychiatric prescription drugs.  \nBy contrast, after the Las Vegas shooting, Rohrabacher\u2019s spokesman Ken Grubbs said it was \u201cdemagoguery\u201d to discuss specific legislative changes, according to a report in a local Californian newspaper. Grubbs did not return a request for comment from Reuters. \nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher arrives for a closed Republican conference meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\nCongressman John Faso of upstate New York said in interviews after the Florida shootings that he favors expanding background checks and not allowing people to buy semi-automatic guns until they turn 21. \nFaso, who took office in 2017, confined his response to the Las Vegas shootings to a Twitter post in which he described them as \u201cheart breaking.\u201d  \nBacon, Rohrabacher and Faso and eight other Republican incumbents face the toughest re-election fights, according to three political analysis groups - Cook Political Report, Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball and Inside Elections.  \nRepublican lawmakers in seven \u201csafe\u201d districts\u00a0adjoining those districts have largely stuck to the same positions they had before the shooting: mostly opposed to new forms of gun control.  \nSome defended their decision to not endorse new restrictions when contacted for comment by Reuters. Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado said he has seen no evidence to justify new laws restricting the purchase or ownership of guns. None of the other lawmakers contacted by Reuters besides Bacon and Buck offered an explanation for their shift or steadfastness on gun policy following Parkland. \nReuters examined the public statements of 31 lawmakers in the competitive and safe districts, including speeches and social media postings, and asked them about any other pronouncements they have made on the issue.  \nNRA DECISIONS TO COME The stark difference in responses can be seen in Florida. Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo is in a tight race in his South Florida district. He said he now favors raising the age of purchase for long guns and even advocates banning civilian purchases of military-style weapons and regulating high-capacity magazines.  \nCongressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who is in an adjacent safe Republican district, issued a press release praising Trump\u2019s NRA-endorsed call to ban bump stocks as \u201ca welcome announcement.\u201d  He advocated no other specific measures to reduce gun violence.  \nThe 18 Republican lawmakers in both competitive and safe seats whose statements Reuters analyzed have received more than $1.5 million from the NRA in donations or expenditures on their behalf throughout their political careers. The 11 lawmakers who did not shift their stance on gun control after the Florida shootings received 85 percent of that, Reuters found. \nAsked whether the NRA was considering limiting support for any of the lawmakers who have expressed support for new gun control measures, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said the association had yet to complete its evaluations of candidates. This would be done after election registration deadlines, which have not yet passed in most states. \u00a0 \nReporting by Julia Harte and Jason Lange; Additional reporting by Grant Smith in New York; Editing by Damon Darlin and Ross Colvin", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-guns-insight/republican-lawmakers-in-tight-races-now-embrace-gun-control-measures-idUSKCN1GJ1EL?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling the deadly nerve agent used to poison a Russian former double agent in England and has been investigating how such weapons can be used in assassinations. \nA police officer stands on duty outside a restaurant which has been secured as part of the investigation into the poisoning of former Russian inteligence agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in Salisbury, March 11, 2018.

This could be done bilaterally outside the EU so as not to press too hard on those bloc members worried about their ties with Moscow, the person said.   \nReluctance from countries - Greece and Hungary among them - mean a draft joint statement by EU leaders now says only that they take \u201cextremely seriously\u201d London\u2019s assessment that it was highly likely Russia was responsible for the attack. \nBut May will push fellow EU leaders to blame Moscow directly for the poisoning of the Skripals who British authorities say have been critically ill since the attack by a Soviet-produced military-grade nerve agent called Novichok.  \nA British official confirmed London was seeking to work with groups of countries on intelligence sharing over spy networks.  \n\u201cRussia has shown itself as a strategic enemy, not a strategic partner,\u201d said another British official, who stressed however that Britain was not seeking new economic sanctions. \nMay will seek to demonstrate to EU governments that all Western countries are vulnerable to such attacks, as well as what NATO says is a Russian strategy to undermine the West, officials said. \n\u201cThe Russia threat does not respect borders and as such we are all at risk,\u201d a second senior British official said. \nPROOF May will need to overcome reluctance from the Russia doves in the EU since the bloc is traditionally split on how to deal with Moscow. \nTies between Moscow and the West plummeted over Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Kiev and support for rebels in east Ukraine, which have triggered sanctions by the EU. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday the Salisbury attack could not go without response. \nMacron and May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump, have already said in a joint statement they \u201cshare\u201d Britain\u2019s assessment of Russian responsibility.  \nDiplomats said EU leaders could to settle for similar language, though some bloc members remained concerned there was not enough direct proof to incriminate Russia in the attack. \nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair the summit and has sided with Britain, said: \u201cIt is clear we should improve our preparedness for future attacks.\u201d \nHe wants the bloc to discuss how to better protect itself from chemical and biological attacks, including in cooperation with NATO, as well as to how to beef up counter-intelligence capabilities to combat hybrid threats. \nAdditional reporting by Elizabeth Piper, Richard Lough, Jean-Baptiste Vey, Editing by Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-eu/britain-seeks-european-help-against-russian-spy-networks-diplomats-idUSKBN1GX3C9?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Susan Cornwell", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders of the U.S. Congress said on Tuesday they would not raise the minimum age for gun buyers, in a sign that one of President Donald Trump\u2019s proposals likely will not get far on Capitol Hill after a deadly Florida school shooting.  \nThe second-deadliest shooting at a U.S. public school has reignited the long-running national debate over gun rights, pitting many of the students who survived the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, against powerful gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association. \nSeveral of those students visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to press Congress to enact new restrictions on gun ownership.  \nRepublicans in Congress have rejected those efforts after similar mass shootings in the past, and party leaders said they were not likely to act this time either. \n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be banning guns from law-abiding citizens. We should be focusing on making sure that citizens who should not get guns in the first place don\u2019t get those guns,\u201d House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told a news conference.     \nTrump has suggested arming teachers and raising the minimum age to buy semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18, but Ryan said Congress was not likely to act on either idea.  \nLocal governments, not Congress, should decide whether to arm teachers, he said. \nTrump still supports raising the age limit and will release specific policy proposals this week, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. \nRyan\u2019s comments made it clear that more aggressive gun limits, like a ban on the military-style rifle used by the 19-year-old Parkland shooter, were unlikely to gain traction in Congress. \nRyan met later in the day with Parkland students, who pushed for a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, as well as other school-safety features, said Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat who represents the district. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the last time they they\u2019re going to come to Washington,\u201d Deutch said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just the beginning of that effort.\u201d  \nBACKGROUND CHECKS Prosecutors have said Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland with a legally purchased rifle. Federal and local law enforcement agencies have acknowledged receiving multiple warnings about Cruz\u2019s potential for violence. \nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor Delaney Tarr walks with other survivors into the office of the House Speaker Paul Ryan for a meeting in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\nTrump and his fellow Republicans are under pressure to act following the massacre, but they also must avoid angering Republican voters who broadly support gun rights as well as interest groups like the NRA, which spent $55 million in the 2016 election.  \nThe House voted in December to bolster a database of people not legally allowed to buy guns and to spur federal agencies and states to upload more data into the system after the Air Force failed to provide records that could have flagged a former service member who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November. \nThat legislation has broad support in the Senate as well, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2  Republican, said he wanted a vote to take place this week. \nSenate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said that measure by itself would not be adequate. He called for Congress to expand the background check system to cover all gun sales, including those conducted at gun shows and over the internet.  \nThat legislation has failed in Congress twice over the past five years, and it fell short again in the House on Tuesday as Republicans rejected an effort by Democrats to bring it up for a vote. \n\u201cWe Democrats, at a minimum, believe we should be passing a universal background check legislation that assures that guns don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \nThe White House does not back that idea, Sanders said. \nACTION IN FLORIDA  As Congress has failed to tighten gun laws after other mass shootings, states have taken action on their own. \nA House of Representatives committee of the Republican-controlled Florida legislature voted on Tuesday to raise the minimum legal age for purchasing all rifles to 21 from 18 and impose a three-day waiting period for any gun purchases. Buyers of handguns must already be at least 21 and submit to a three-day wait. \nThe measure would also create a statewide program to arm specially trained teachers - subject to school district approval - while assigning more police as school resource officers and allowing police to confiscate weapons from people who are involuntarily committed as a danger to themselves or others. \nIn addition, the measure would outlaw the sale of bump stocks, devices that enable semiautomatic rifles to be operated as fully automatic machine guns. The panel rejected a Democratic-backed amendment to ban assault-style weapons. \nThe package must now win approval in the full legislature before it goes to Republican Governor Rick Scott for signature. \nCruz, charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, was due back in court on Wednesday for a hearing to determine whether he has sufficient assets to pay for his own lawyer. His mother died in November. \nStoneman Douglas students were scheduled to return to class on Wednesday for the first time since the massacre. The building where most of the bloodshed occurred will remain closed. The bill adopted by a state House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday would provide funding to demolish the building and replace it with a memorial to shooting victims. \nAdditional reporting by Steve Holland, Katanga Johnson and Doina Chiacu in Washington, Zachary Fagenson in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by Andy Sullivan and Scott Malone; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns/u-s-congressional-republicans-reject-new-limits-on-guns-idUSKCN1GB0K8?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Mark Hosenball", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, has lost access to the most valued U.S. intelligence report, the President\u2019s Daily Brief, as the White House imposes greater discipline on access to secrets, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. \nKushner, who has been operating under an interim security clearance for about a year, had his access to the highly classified briefing cut off in the past few weeks, said the sources. \nA third official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recently passed new information to White House Counsel Don McGahn that led to the slowing or stopping of Kushner\u2019s pending clearance application. The nature of that information was not clear. \nIt also is unclear if and when Kushner\u2019s access to the briefing, known as the PDB, which requires clearance higher than the Top Secret level, would be reinstated. \nKushner, a wealthy New York businessman married to Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, has not received his full security clearance because of his extensive financial links, which have taken a long time to examine. He has revised his security clearance form, called an SF-86, several times. \nA White House spokesman for Kushner did not immediately return a phone call and email seeking comment. Trump ignored reporters\u2019 shouted questions about Kushner and his clearance at an event on Tuesday afternoon. \nKushner\u2019s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement: \u201cMr. Kushner has done more than what is expected of him in this process.\u201d \n\u201cMy inquiries ... have confirmed that there are a dozen or more people at Mr. Kushner\u2019s level whose process is delayed, that it is not uncommon for this process to take this long in a new administration, that the current backlogs are being addressed, and no concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner\u2019s application,\u201d Lowell said.             \nTrump\u2019s White House has been grappling with the security clearance issue since it emerged this month that staff secretary Rob Porter worked for Trump for a year with a temporary clearance despite accusations by his two former wives of domestic abuse. Porter has maintained his innocence. \nThe President\u2019s Daily Brief is distributed to a small number of top-level U.S. officials. It includes highly classified intelligence analysis, information about CIA covert operations and reports from the most sensitive U.S. sources or those shared by allied intelligence agencies. \nFILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump passes his adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner during a Hanukkah Reception at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2017.  REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nNew security clearance policies announced by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \u201cwill not affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the President,\u201d Lowell said. \nBut one of the U.S. officials who said Kushner had lost access to the daily brief said that without it, his role in some major policy deliberations, including on China and Russia, could be limited. \nBROAD PORTFOLIO Kushner has had a broad portfolio in the White House. He has taken the lead on Trump\u2019s plan to forge a Middle East peace deal and led the Office of American Innovation, which is intended to modernize and downsize government programs. \nKelly, whose handling of the Porter case was heavily criticized, decreed on Feb. 16 that any interim security clearances for staffers whose background investigations had been pending since June 1 or before would be discontinued within a week. \nA source familiar with the matter said the situation had caused tensions between Kushner and Kelly. \nOn Friday, Trump said he would leave it to Kelly to settle the security clearance dispute with Kushner, but left little doubt he wanted the case settled in a way that allowed Kushner to keep his job. As president, Trump could grant Kushner a full security clearance on his own authority. \nWhite House spokesman Sarah Sanders would not comment on whether Kushner\u2019s security clearance issues had been resolved. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a valued member of the team and he will continue to do the important work that he\u2019s been doing since he started in the administration,\u201d she told a briefing. \nA top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to McGahn and FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday, asking for more information on the number of White House officials with interim clearances. \nThe letter by Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, suggested bipartisan concern over the issue. \nCiting reports that dozens of officials are operating with interim clearances, the two lawmakers wrote: \u201cIf true, this raises significant concerns that ineligible individuals, who hold positions of public trust, may have access to sensitive or classified information.\u201d \nAdditional reporting by John Walcott, Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Peter Cooney", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kushner/trump-son-in-law-adviser-kushner-loses-access-to-top-intelligence-briefing-sources-idUSKCN1GB2VE?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott on Friday signed into law a bill from the legislature that raises the legal age for buying rifles, imposes a three-day waiting period on all gun sales and allows the arming of some school employees. \nFILE PHOTO - Florida Governor Rick Scott listens during a meeting with law enforcement, mental health, and education officials about how to prevent future tragedies in the wake of last week's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Florida, U.S., February 20, 2018.

At the time there was a big discrepancy with what the government had promised during the elections and what they eventually did.\u201d      \nPublic sector workers are angry with plans to cut public sector headcount by 120,000 by 2022, including with voluntary redundancies, and introduce other reforms including merit-based pay. \nRailway workers are worried by government plans to scrap job-for-life guarantees, automatic annual pay rises and generous early retirement. \n\u201cDiscontent and worry are spreading very quickly,\u201d said Jean-Marc Canon of UGFF-CGT, one of the largest public sector\u2019s unions. \nWhile rail workers have planned a three-month rolling strike starting April 3, public sector workers have no plan yet for further labor action but they will meet next week to decide on any possible move. \nThursday\u2019s strike, and the government\u2019s reaction, will be a test, said Laurent Berger, the head of France\u2019s largest union, CFDT. \n\u201cEither they (the government) listen to us and it will have been just a warning shot, or they don\u2019t listen to us and then, let me tell you that public sector workers are very mobilized,\u201d he told RTL radio. \nAdditional reporting by Caroline Pailliez, Bate Felix and Julie Carriat; Graphic by Leigh Thomas; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Richard Balmforth", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-reform-protests/french-public-sector-rail-workers-strike-in-test-for-macron-idUSKBN1GX3AF?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Bernie Woodall", "body": "PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - The 19-year-old man accused of shooting 17 people to death at a Florida high school legally purchased the assault rifle used in the killings and may have foreshadowed the attack in a social media comment investigated by the FBI last year, authorities said on Thursday. (For a graphic on Florida school shooting click tmsnrt.rs/2nX8ECo)  New details about the troubled background and gun ownership of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, emerged as he appeared in court to face formal charges of carrying out the second-deadliest mass shooting at a public school in U.S. history. Authorities also shed more light on how the suspect made a getaway by blending in with students fleeing the school, then casually spent more than an hour drifting through a Walmart store and visiting two fast-food outlets before he was arrested. The shooting also raised questions among anguished parents about the adequacy of school security measures and renewed a national debate on Capitol Hill and elsewhere about the epidemic of gun violence in American schools. The Federal Bureau of Investigation disclosed it received a tip in September about an ominous online message that read: \u201cI\u2018m going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d The comment had been posted to someone else\u2019s YouTube video by a person going by the name of Nikolas Cruz, now presumed to be the same individual as the suspect in the Florida shooting.  However, FBI agents had no information pointing to the \u201ctime, location or true identity\u201d of the person behind the message, Robert Lasky, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Jacksonville office, told reporters. YouTube ultimately removed the material in question, and the FBI\u2019s inquiry was dropped until the name Nikolas Cruz surfaced again in connection with Wednesday\u2019s massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, near Miami. ARRIVED VIA UBER, LEFT WITH FLEEING STUDENTS Authorities say the gunman, identified as a former student at Stoneman Douglas High who had been expelled for disciplinary problems, walked into the school shortly before dismissal time, pulled a fire alarm and opened fire as students and teachers streamed out of classrooms into the halls. Seventeen people died and 15 were injured in the ensuing violence.  The suspect was armed with an AR-15-style semiautomatic assault rifle and numerous ammunition cartridges. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Cruz legally purchased the murder weapon from a licensed dealer, Sunrise Tactical Supply, in Coral Springs, Florida. The sheriff also said Cruz arrived at the school by way of the Uber ride-sharing service and left the scene on foot, mixing in \u201cwith a group that were running away, fearing for their lives.\u201d He walked into a Walmart, bought a beverage at a Subway outlet inside the store, then visited a McDonald\u2019s before he was finally spotted and detained by a police officer in the adjacent town of Coconut Creek, Israel said.

REUTERS/Susan Stocker/PoolCruz, charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, made a brief initial court appearance on Thursday, in which he was ordered held without bond. He spoke only two words - \u201cYes ma\u2018am\u201d - when a judge asked him to confirm his name.  Cruz\u2019s court-appointed lawyer said her client had expressed remorse for his crimes. \u201cHe\u2019s a broken human being,\u201d public defender Melissa McNeill told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s sad, he\u2019s mournful, he\u2019s remorseful.\u201d According to a court document made public on Thursday, Cruz admitted to police after being arrested and advised of his right to avoid self-incrimination that he had committed the attack. Former classmates have described Cruz as a social outcast with a reputation as a trouble-maker, as well as someone who was \u201ccrazy about guns.\u201d The sheriff has said some of the online and social media activity Cruz engaged in was \u201cvery, very disturbing.\u201d     On Thursday, a local leader of the white nationalist militia Republic of Florida, Jordan Jereb, said Cruz had participated in paramilitary training with that group at some point, though Reuters could not immediately verify this. Wednesday\u2019s shooting was the 18th in a U.S. school this year, according to gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. It also ranks as the greatest loss of life from school gun violence after the 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 first-graders and six adult educators dead. President Donald Trump addressed the shooting in a White House speech that emphasized school safety and mental health while avoiding any mention of gun policy. \u201cIt is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe must actually make that difference.\u201d Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives criticized the Republican leadership for refusing to take up legislation on tightening background checks for prospective gun buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling,\u201d Representative Mike Thompson told reporters. \u201cThirty people every day are killed by someone using a gun, and the best we can do is say we need more information?\u201d The Republican-controlled Congress last year revoked Obama-era regulations meant to make it harder for those with severe mental illness to pass FBI background checks for guns, saying it deprived the mentally ill of their gun rights. The American Civil Liberties Union joined in opposing the rule, saying there was no evidence that people with mental disabilities were more likely to commit gun violence. Some gun control proponents and legal experts said Wednesday\u2019s shooting might have been averted if Florida were among the handful of U.S. states with laws allowing police and family members to obtain restraining orders barring people suspected of being a threat from possessing guns. Cruz had recently moved in with another family after his mother\u2019s November death, said Jim Lewis, a lawyer representing the family, bringing his AR-15 along with other belongings.  The family believed Cruz was depressed, but attributed that to his mother\u2019s death, not mental illness, Lewis said.

Trump later denied making the comment.   \n\u201cWe are not in any way attempting to keep Chinese dollars from Africa,\u201d Tillerson told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital. \u201cIt is important that African countries carefully consider the terms of those agreements and not forfeit their sovereignty.\u201d \nThe United States is the leading aid donor to Africa but China surpassed it as a trade partner in 2009. Beijing has pumped billions into infrastructure projects, though critics say the use of Chinese firms and labor undermines their value. \nTillerson said Chinese investments \u201cdo not bring significant job creation locally\u201d and criticized how Beijing structures loans to African government.  \nIf a government accepts a Chinese loan and \u201cgets into trouble\u201d, he said, it can \u201close control of its own infrastructure or its own resources through default.\u201d He did not give examples. \nThe growing Chinese lending to the continent has also attracted criticism from some Africans, who say China\u2019s agenda is to feed its appetite for African raw materials like oil, timber and minerals, and secure contracts for its firms. \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, visiting Zimbabwe on Thursday, told reporters it was inappropriate for Tillerson to criticize China\u2019s relationship with African countries. \n\u201cIt was not appropriate to criticize the relations of his hosts \u2014 when he was a guest there \u2014 with another country,\u201d he said. Many African governments enjoy close ties with both Washington and Beijing.  \nKenya, for example, inaugurated a $3.2 billion railway funded by China last year. For the last three years, Kenya has received more than $100 million annually in U.S. security assistance. \nAsked about Tillerson\u2019s criticism of China\u2019s approach on the continent, Kenya\u2019s foreign affairs minister Monica Juma said: \u201cThis country is engaging with partners from across the world driven by our own interests and for our own value.\u201d \nAfrican Union (AU) Commission Chairman Moussa Faki, of Chad, and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hold a news conference after their meeting at African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia March 8, 2018.

The complex was funded and built by China and is seen as a symbol of Beijing\u2019s thrust for influence and access to the continent\u2019s natural resources. \nEthiopia is home to some of Beijing\u2019s biggest investments, from a railway to Djibouti that opened last year to factories and industrial parks.     \nEarlier this week, Tillerson criticized \u201cChina\u2019s approach\u201d to Africa which he said encouraged dependency through \u201copaque contracts\u201d and \u201cpredatory loan practices\u201d.  \nEthiopia\u2019s prime minister resigned suddenly last month and a state of emergency was imposed but protests in the restive Oromia region have continued.  \nThe secretary of state met Hailemariam Desalegn, who resigned as prime minister but is still acting in the post awaiting a replacement. Details of their discussions were not released.  \nTillerson said after meeting his Ethiopian counterpart Workneh Gebeyehu that the answer to political turmoil in Ethiopia was greater freedoms. \n\u201cIt is important that the country moves on past the state of emergency as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.  \nTillerson reiterated previous calls for African states to cut ties with North Korea. \nNorth Korea has more than a dozen embassies on the continent. The Trump administration has said that Pyongyang earns hard currency from arms deals with African government and the trafficking of wildlife parts from Africa. \nTillerson is due to fly to Djibouti, host to military bases owned by the U.S., China, Japan, France, and Italy.  \nHe will then visit Kenya, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Shabaab Islamist militants in Somalia, before traveling to Chad and Nigeria, which are also battling to contain Islamist insurgents.  \nAnalysts say Trump has focused mainly on security concerns in Africa at a time when China, Turkey and other nations are ramping up diplomatic and business links.  \n\u201cWhen you look at the set of countries that are being visited I think it kind of reinforces the perception that security, indeed, is the overwhelming focus,\u201d said Brahima Coulibaly, the director of the Africa Growth Initiative at Brookings Institution. \nAdditional reporting by Kumerra Gemechu in Addis Ababa and Omar Mohammed in Nairobi; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-africa/u-s-secretary-of-state-says-african-countries-should-weigh-chinese-loans-carefully-idUSKCN1GK114?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews", "source": "Reuters", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "body": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam\u2019s state oil firm PetroVietnam has ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol to suspend its \u201cRed Emperor\u201d project off the country\u2019s southeastern coast following pressure from China, the BBC reported on Friday. \nFILE PHOTO: A Repsol logo at a petrol station in Bormujos near the Andalusian capital of Seville, southern Spain March 3, 2016.

They have also convinced Trump of the importance of international alliances, particularly NATO, which he has criticized as not equally sharing its burdens with the United States. \nHowever, all the officials were quick to add that the tensions could blow over, at least for now, as have previous episodes of discord between the president and other top officials who have fallen out of favor, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \nAsked about sources saying that either National Security Adviser McMaster or Chief of Staff Kelly, or both, might be leaving, White House spokesman Raj Shah on Thursday did not address the possibility.
