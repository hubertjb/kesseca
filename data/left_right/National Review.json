R. McMaster with John Bolton, and the verdict is in. Americans should be \u201cterrified.\u201d Or perhaps \u201chorrified.\u201d The New York Times editorial board declares, in no uncertain terms, \u201cYes, John Bolton really is that dangerous.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Has Donald Trump selected a crazed warmonger to be his national-security adviser? Is Bolton going to lead us down the path to foolish war? Far from it.\n\nBolton is not \u2014 as some in the media would have you believe \u2014 a mere flame-throwing Fox News \u201ctalking head.\u201d He\u2019s a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He\u2019s on the board of trustees of the National Review Institute. He\u2019s a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He\u2019s a conservative hawk, yes, but he\u2019s squarely in the mainstream of conservative foreign-policy thought.\n\n\nHe\u2019s not extreme. The reaction against him, however, is. Moreover, the reaction betrays a sad reality: The foreign-policy Left still hasn\u2019t learned the lessons of the recent past.\n\nTo put it simply, all too many people view the challenge of North Korea and Iran something like this: There is a clearly safer path, including engagement, talks, and continued fidelity to the Iran deal; and there is a clearly more dangerous path \u2014 saber-rattling, increased sanctions, public advocacy for regime change. All right-thinking people should seek more engagement with North Korea. All right-thinking people should support the Iran deal.\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cclearly safer\u201d argument always has a short-term advantage. When choosing between less risk of war and greater risk of war, there is a proper default preference for less risk and a presumption in favor of making immediate moves toward peace. When dealing with jihadist regimes like Iran\u2019s or evil regimes like North Korea\u2019s, however, the problem is that every single path is perilous.\n\nMiscalculate in favor of war, and you risk an unnecessary bloodbath \u2014 one that America would win, but at immense cost in blood and treasure. Miscalculate in favor of peace, and you risk \u2014 God forbid \u2014 American cities in flames, a genocidal nuclear exchange in the Middle East, or (perhaps most likely) future military confrontations with aggressive and hostile foreign powers that we can\u2019t truly win because of their own nuclear shield. Remember the words of Krishnaswamy Sundarji, former chief of staff of the Indian army: \u201cOne principal lesson of the Gulf War is that, if a state intends to fight the United States, it should avoid doing so until and unless it possesses nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nWorld history is littered with both kinds of mistakes, and our recent histories with both Iran and North Korea indicate that bipartisan policies of engagement, negotiation, and forbearance have not, in fact, moderated either regime. Iran continues to export jihad, work to kill Americans, and ally with our Russian rival to engineer a bloodbath in Syria \u2014 even as the Iran \u201cdeal\u201d fails to deliver on Obama\u2019s dream of somehow bringing Iran into the community of nations. North Korea is well on its way to developing a nuclear first-strike capability that threatens the mainland United States.\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the American intelligentsia lives in a world where the \u201chawks\u201d \u2014 those who supported the Iraq War \u2014 are discredited, while the \u201cdoves\u201d \u2014 those who presided over American foreign policy while Syria burned, ISIS rose, and North Korea tested its nuclear weapons \u2014 are not. Yet didn\u2019t Barack Obama himself have to turn hawkish by the end of his second term? Didn\u2019t he reinsert American ground troops in Iraq and put boots on the ground in Syria? Didn\u2019t he keep American troops in Afghanistan during every single day of his presidency and expand the American military footprint in Africa? It turns out that American inaction helped destabilize the Middle East and dramatically elevated the jihadist threat.\n\nMoreover, we should not exaggerate John Bolton\u2019s aggression. To be a hawk isn\u2019t to see war as a first resort. It\u2019s to see war as a realistic option \u2014 an option that ideally makes diplomatic overtures more urgent and effective. As the most powerful nation on the face of the earth, we should not conduct our diplomacy as if we fear war more than our potential foes do.\n\nEven one of the pieces that the New York Times cites to justify its alarm \u2014 Bolton\u2019s 2017 Wall Street Journal article analyzing military options in North Korea \u2014 contains this key sentence: \u201cThe U.S. should obviously seek South Korea\u2019s agreement (and Japan\u2019s) before using force, but no foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nA quarter-century of American nonproliferation policy has failed.\n\nThis is a sensible statement, indicating both the desire for agreement with key allies and the necessity of national self-defense, and the Times fails to effectively grapple with the truth underlying Bolton\u2019s essay \u2014 a quarter-century of American nonproliferation policy has failed.\n\n\nI\u2019m not arguing for a strike against North Korea. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly, war with North Korea would risk loss of life on a staggering scale. And even if future developments force Bolton to urge a strike \u2014 and the president agrees \u2014 it\u2019s imperative that the administration seek the approval of Congress before launching any new military action. It is, however, simply wrong to believe that engagement and appeasement don\u2019t carry their own profound risks.\n\nA nuclear-armed Iran is far more dangerous than John Bolton. A North Korea capable of incinerating American cities is far more dangerous than John Bolton. The question is how we prevent those truly \u201chorrifying\u201d risks. The foreign-policy debate is frequently between hawks and doves, and in the last administration, the doves repeatedly failed.

If so, the GOP has an odd way of showing affection. Green cites a lack of Republican criticism of Trump, the president\u2019s continued popularity within the party, and Trump\u2019s rescue of incumbent Nevada senator Dean Heller from a primary challenge. All true. But when it comes to the president\u2019s priorities and the nationalist-populist style of politics he represents, Trump and the Republican Congress could not be farther apart.\n\nTrump won the nomination and the presidency after distinguishing himself from the party in four ways. Since Ronald Reagan, Republicans have tended to support global economic integration, immigration, democratic internationalism, and entitlement reform. And yet Trump opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, called to renegotiate NAFTA, and wanted tariffs on China. His 2015 immigration plan championed a wall across the southern border, workplace enforcement, an end to birthright citizenship, and a tripling of border and customs agents. He repudiated the Iraq war and questioned the future of NATO. He swore that Social Security and Medicare would be off-limits. His brashness, colorfulness, insults, willingness to transgress norms, humor, novelty, and lack of political experience separated him from the GOP pack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program and its avatar won three Great Lakes states that had been missing from the Republican column for a generation. Trump also came within striking distance in Minnesota and New Hampshire. Obviously, we do not know the exact relation between Trump\u2019s nationalism and populism and the roughly 78,000 votes in three states that gave him an Electoral College victory. But the unexpected shape of his upset suggests that the trademark Trump issues of immigration, trade, nonintervention, and retirement security played some role both in attracting support for him and depressing turnout for Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet the 16 months since the election have seen the gradual, fitful, and partial regularization of Trump into the GOP that predated and opposed him. Until recently, the president and congressional leadership were aligned: They seated a justice and lower-court judges, rolled back Obama-era regulations, failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, and passed a large tax cut. Trump\u2019s foreign policy also became more conventionally Republican. He bombed Syria, turned down his criticism of NATO, maintained a troop presence in Afghanistan despite his instincts to withdraw, and increased defense spending. The signature Trump policies \u2014 including the travel ban, exit from the TPP and the Paris Climate Accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 were greeted with friendly skepticism from party elites. By the end of 2017, one would have thought the party would change Trump more than he would change it.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened. Instead, both Trump and the GOP seem to be reverting to form: Trump has pressed for changes to legal immigration, visited prototypes for the border wall, called for the death penalty for opioid dealers, and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as against China, amid anxiety and dissent and resistance from congressmen of his own party. Trump\u2019s instincts and impulsiveness have driven him to re-embrace the portfolio that delivered his electoral coalition at the very moment Republicans in Congress want nothing so much as to return to their districts, publicize the tax cut, and vainly attempt to divorce their campaigns from national politics. And so we are faced with the oddity that Trump\u2019s approval rating is creeping upward even as Democrats press their midterm advantage.\n\n\n\n\nTrump and the Republicans operate according to different hierarchies of values. To the degree that his behavior can be categorized by a single idea, Trump\u2019s most singular policies address the question of sovereignty: Who rules? Here, in America, the people rule, or are supposed to. Trump\u2019s rhetoric defines the people as American citizens, regardless of racial or ethnic identity. The domestic objective of his presidency is to reassert popular control over judges, bureaucracies, and elected officials. The extent of sovereignty must be defined, which is why we have borders and require a wall to protect a porous one. And national sovereignty is important, too. That is why America must reestablish its privileges and ability to maneuver vis-\u00e0-vis multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, international agreements, and the World Trade Organization.\n\nIf I had to choose a guiding principle of congressional Republicans, it would be freedom. The freedom of the individual to live the life he chooses, the freedom of people and goods and services to move across borders, the freedom to work, spend, and invest as one sees fit, the freedom of people around the world to govern themselves.\n\nNow, sovereignty and freedom are not necessarily in conflict. They overlap, and they can move in tandem. They often have done so in American history. But one must also balance the other. A sovereign without regard for freedom would be unjust, and increasing social and economic freedom can lead to the loss of sovereignty. The thrust of populist politics since 2016 indicates that voters believe that the mix of sovereignty and freedom is out of whack, that national and democratic sovereignty must be upheld even if it means tighter regulation of the global economy and especially of global migration.\n\nA sovereign without regard for freedom would be unjust, and increasing social and economic freedom can lead to the loss of sovereignty.\n\nAt its most politically successful, the party of Trump pits miners, hard hats, farmers, soldiers, veterans, and public-safety officers against CEOs, bankers, lawyers, doctors, bureaucrats, professors, and educators. Yet none of Trump\u2019s personal or policy decisions occasioned as much intra-party pushback, including a high-profile resignation, as the imposition of tariffs. Not only do Republicans seem largely ignorant of the fact that Donald Trump\u2019s political instincts are better than their own, they also refuse to learn.\n\nThis divergence between Trump and the Republicans is apparent in the $1.3 trillion government-funding bill. If there is one thing every American knows about Donald Trump, it is that he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Yet Republican congressmen, most of whom adhere to pre-Trump views of immigration, secured only $1.6 billion for the project. Democrats are crowing. \u201cDemocrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law,\u201d Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cThe bill does not allow any increase in deportation officers or detention beds.\u201d Part of the responsibility for this setback goes to Trump, who seems to have been disengaged from the negotiations until the last minute. But the main reason the money isn\u2019t there is the fact that congressional leadership had neither the desire nor the stomach to fight for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething similar has happened with trade. Whatever the economic consequences of Trump\u2019s protectionism \u2014 and they could be bad \u2014 it cannot be denied that this is the issue on which he has been most consistent over 30 years in the public eye. Nor can the political appeal of siding with domestic manufacturers over multinational corporations be ignored by anyone who has seen Democrats rhetorically position themselves on the side of the American worker since 1992. By dividing trades and construction-union membership against leadership in 2016, Trump called forth the Reagan Democrats who had vanished from the scene, and convinced millions of white working-class voters to defect from the Obama coalition.\n\n\nThey can just as easily switch back, of course. When I visited the websites of the two candidates in the recent Pennsylvania special election, I was struck that it was the Democrat, rather than the Republican, who highlighted infrastructure, opioids, and protecting entitlements, three topics of keen interest to Trump voters. By neutralizing the hot-button cultural issues of guns and abortion, and highlighting Rick Saccone\u2019s support for right-to-work and other pro-business measures, Conor Lamb reappropriated the economic program that Donald Trump used to win PA-18 by 20 points. He won\u2019t be the last Democrat to do so.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Washington Free Beacon.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Doran", "body": "Hillary Clinton at a \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d rally in Concord, N.H., February 6, 2016.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Brian  a textbook example of denial and projection, Trump foes in and out of government wove a sinister yarn meant to take him down.\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBarack Obama keeps a close watch on his emotions. \u201cI loved Spock,\u201d he wrote in February 2015 in a presidential statement eulogizing Leonard Nimoy. Growing up in Hawaii, the young man who would later be called \u201cNo-Drama Obama\u201d felt a special affinity for the Vulcan first officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise. \u201cLong before being nerdy was cool, there was Leonard Nimoy,\u201d the eulogy continued. \u201cLeonard was Spock. Cool, logical, big-eared and level-headed.\u201d\n\nIt is the rare occasion when Obama lets his Spock mask slip. But November 2, 2016, was just such a moment. Six days before the presidential election, when addressing the Congressional Black Caucus, he stressed that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, threatened hard-won achievements of blacks: tolerance, justice, good schools, ending mass incarceration \u2014 even democracy itself. \u201cThere is one candidate who will advance those things,\u201d he said, his voice swelling with emotion. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of his candidacy, is opposition to all that we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe open display of emotion was new, but the theme of safeguarding his legacy was not. Two months earlier, on July 5, in Charlotte, N.C., Obama delivered his first stump speech for Hillary Clinton. He described his presidency as a leg in a relay race. Hillary Clinton had tried hard to pass affordable health care during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, but she failed \u2014 and the relay baton fell to the ground. When Obama entered the White House, he picked it up. Now, his leg of the race was coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019m ready to pass the baton,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know that Hillary Clinton is going to take it.\u201d\n\nBut he was less certain than he was letting on. Hillary Clinton was up in the polls, to be sure, but she was vulnerable. Three weeks earlier, on June 15, a cyberattacker fashioning himself as Guccifer 2.0 had published a cache of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). They proved, as supporters of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders had long alleged, that the DNC had conspired with the Clinton campaign to undermine their candidate. Sanders was still withholding his endorsement of Clinton for president, even though her nomination as the Democratic candidate was now a foregone conclusion. At the very moment when Clinton had expected the Democratic party to unite behind her, its deepest chasm seemed to be growing wider. In contrast to Clinton, Obama held some sway over the Sanders insurgents. He came to Charlotte to urge them to support Clinton against their shared enemy, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.\n\nThe insurgency was not the only Clinton vulnerability on Obama\u2019s mind. He had come to Charlotte, in addition, to deflect attention from the news conference that James Comey, the director of the FBI, had held that morning in Washington, D.C. The investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server was complete, Comey announced. The FBI would recommend no criminal charges \u2014 that was the honey. But Comey administered it with a dose of vinegar. He dwelled on Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified material in such detail that it sounded as if he was laying the foundation for an indictment. The decision not to charge Clinton, his statement signaled, was an exercise in prosecutorial restraint, not a true exoneration.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of the voters, Clinton\u2019s twin email travails \u2014 the hack of the DNC and the investigation into her server \u2014 were two faces of a single problem. Call it \u201cClinton, Inc.\u201d Sanders and Trump were painting Clinton as Wall Street\u2019s darling, the establishment candidate. She was the greatest defender and a prime beneficiary of a rigged political and financial system. Comey\u2019s statement had played directly into the hands of the Sanders insurgents. It left the distinct impression that laws are for the little people; they simply don\u2019t apply to Hillary Clinton, because, well, she\u2019s Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhich points to Obama\u2019s third and final job at Charlotte: humanizing the queen. \u201cI saw how she treated everybody with respect, even the folks who aren\u2019t, quote/unquote, \u2018important,\u2019\u201d Obama testified. He enlarged Clinton\u2019s humility before the crowd, because it was invisible to the naked eye. With his jacket and tie off, the cuffs of his sleeves turned, and a winning smile spread from ear to ear, Obama came to loan Hillary Clinton his common touch.\n\nPassing the baton to her was a team effort, however. It demanded hard work from countless enablers. These included not just Democrats but also many Republicans, who shared the conviction that Trump represented an extraordinary threat to our democracy. Desperate times call for desperate measures. To block Trump, Clinton\u2019s supporters bent rules and broke laws. They went to surprising lengths to strengthen her while framing him \u2014 both in the sense of depicting him in a particular light and of planting evidence against him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoe Friday \n\nWhen it comes to ongoing FBI criminal investigations, presidents typically refrain from describing their preferred outcomes. They fear the appearance of exerting undue influence over Lady Justice. But in the case of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email abuses, Obama made an exception. \u201cShe would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy,\u201d he remarked in a TV interview in April 2016. She has displayed \u201ca carelessness in terms of managing emails,\u201d he allowed. \u201cBut I also think it is important to keep this in  but careless, said the commander in chief, describing Hillary\u2019s use of a private email server. Three months later, Comey, in a Vulcan mind-meld with his boss, arrived at an identical conclusion.\n\nWell-intentioned but careless, said the commander in chief. Three months later, the FBI finished its investigation, and James Comey arrived at an identical conclusion. \u201cAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information,\u201d he said in his July 5 statement, \u201cthere is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d Well-intentioned but careless \u2014 Comey was locked in a Vulcan mind-meld with his boss.\n\nAs a political move, highlighting Clinton\u2019s intentions was astute. It had a commonsense feel. Americans instinctively take intentions into account when determining guilt. As a strict matter of law, however, it was vapid. The mishandling of classified information falls into the category of a \u201cnon-intent crime.\u201d It\u2019s a type of objective recklessness, like running over a pedestrian while blowing through a red light. Violations of this sort trigger criminal liabilities regardless of the offender\u2019s state of mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut let\u2019s assume that some clever lawyer in the Department of Justice discovered a very learned and superficially compelling rationale for applying Obama\u2019s fictive standard of intent. Even so, Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t clear the hurdle. The sheer volume of classified material the FBI recovered from her server constituted proof of intent. \u201cFifty-two email chains . . . contain classified information,\u201d Comey said.\n\nParticularly damning was the form this material took. It is impossible to paste a classified document into an unclassified email accidentally, because the three computer systems (Unclassified, Confidential/Secret, and Top Secret) are physically separate networks, each feeding into an independent hard drive on the user\u2019s desk. If a classified document appears in an unclassified email, then someone downloaded it onto a thumb drive and manually uploaded it to the unclassified network \u2014 an intentional act if ever there was one.\n\nOne of Clinton\u2019s emails suggests that downloading and uploading material in this fashion was a commonplace activity in her office. In June 2011, a staffer encountered difficulty transmitting a document to her by means of a classified system. An impatient Clinton instructed him to strip the classified markings from the document and send it on as an unclassified email. \u201cTurn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure,\u201d Clinton instructed.\n\nOn three separate occasions staffers got sloppy and failed to strip the \u201cnonpapers\u201d of all markings that betrayed their classified origins. The FBI recovered one email, for example, that contained a \u201cC\u201d in parenthesis in the margin \u2014 an obvious sign that the corresponding paragraph was classified \u201cConfidential.\u201d When an agent personally interviewed Clinton, on July 2, he showed her the document and asked whether she understood what the \u201cC\u201d meant. For anyone who has ever held a security clearance, \u201cC\u2019s\u201d in the margins are more ubiquitous than \u201cC\u2019s\u201d on water faucets \u2014 and no more baffling. But Clinton played the ditzy grandmother. She had simply assumed, she said, that the \u201cC\u201d was marking an item in an alphabetized list.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2,500-year life of the alphabet, this was a first: a list that started with the third letter and contained but a single item. The explanation was laughable, but any sensible answer would have constituted an acknowledgement of malicious intent. Her only out was the \u201cwell-intentioned but careless\u201d script that Obama had written for her. In other words, she lied to the FBI \u2014 a felony offense.\n\nBefore she ever told this howler, however, Comey had already prepared a draft of his statement exonerating her. The FBI let Hillary Clinton skate.\n\nIf Comey had followed the letter of the law, the trail of guilt may have led all the way to Obama himself.\n\nBut give Comey his due. If he had followed the letter of the law, the trail of guilt may have led all the way to Obama himself. As Andrew C. McCarthy has demonstrated at National Review Online, Obama used a dummy email account to communicate with Clinton via her private server. Did this make Obama complicit in Clinton\u2019s malfeasance? Anyone in Comey\u2019s position would have thought twice before moving to prosecute her \u2014 and not only because the case might have ensnared the president himself. The FBI must enforce the law, but it must also be seen to be enforcing it. As a rule, these two imperatives buttress each other. During the 2016 election, Comey faced extraordinary circumstances. If he had followed the law to the letter, he would have toppled the leading candidate for president and decapitated the Democratic party. Clinton\u2019s supporters, more than 50 percent of the electorate, would have erupted in outrage, screaming that a politicized FBI had thrown the election to Donald Trump.\n\nGuarding the bureau\u2019s reputation for impartiality is a serious concern. But it is nevertheless a thoroughly political concern. Comey would have us believe that it was a unique moment in his career, the singular entry into the political arena of an otherwise apolitical servant of the law. Truth be told, Comey loves being in the thick of it, but not because he is a partisan brawler. He is not. It is the drama that he relishes \u2014 the grand stage. His favorite role is that of Joe Friday, the no-nonsense lawman, the guardian of legal processes before the encroachments of dirty politicians.\n\n\n\n\nJoe Friday, however, was a simple detective, a confirmed bachelor, content to live quietly with his mother and his parakeet. And, of course, he was a TV fiction. In real life, humble straight shooters get clobbered with a brick before they ever reach the limelight. In real life, snagging the big part often requires the equivalent of leaving a bloody horsehead in the producer\u2019s bed.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMcCabe and the Lovers \n\nAnd it requires a supportive staff. Midyear Exam, the codename for the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, relied on a team of men and women with the right stuff \u2014 a quality that is hard to define but easy to recognize.\n\nThe right stuff did not require strong Democratic credentials, but they certainly helped. Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI, led the team. McCabe was not your FBI gumshoe of old. He spent no time in his younger days chasing bank robbers in Des Moines. He was part of a new breed \u2014 the post-9/11 FBI leadership, for whom the career fast track was counterterrorism. He came of age at the intersection of law enforcement with national security, shuttling between D.C. and New York. Along the way, he developed a valuable personal network. His wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a Virginia state-senate seat in 2015. The political organization of Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s very closest associates, gave her nearly $500,000.\n\nPerhaps more important than having Democratic credentials was having a heightened understanding of the needs of senior leadership \u2014 in the FBI, certainly, but also in the DOJ. Right across the street from the J. Edgar Hoover Building sat Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She would be scrutinizing Midyear Exam in every detail. And not just Lynch. Hillary Clinton herself would be watching closely \u2014 and would be brought in for questioning, too. Being willing and able to treat her with kid gloves was essential. She \u201cmight be our next president,\u201d team member Lisa Page reminded Peter Strzok, the agent in charge of Midyear Exam. Referring to Clinton\u2019s upcoming FBI interview, Page wrote, \u201cThe last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLike McCabe, Strzok had pursued a career at the nexus of law enforcement and counterterrorism. But he was less overtly political. A John Kasich sympathizer, he was by nature a middle-of-the-roader, and a Republican-leaning one, at that. Clinton left him cold. But Trump left him even colder \u2014 and his active personal life helped concentrate his mind on that antipathy. Strzok was having an affair with Page, who was an FBI lawyer on McCabe\u2019s staff. Both were married. Page\u2019s politics were typical of highly educated people in D.C.: She detested Trump and his supporters. He is \u201ca loathsome human being,\u201d she texted to Strzok, who readily agreed. After Trump captured the nomination, hostility to him quickly became part of their private idiom.\n\nIf \u201cthe ultimate aphrodisiac,\u201d as Henry Kissinger famously claimed, is power, then wielding it together with an illicit lover must be the pinnacle of eroticism. Together, Strzok and Page explored the power of secrets, routinely leaking to the press to shape political outcomes. \u201cStill on the phone with Devlin,\u201d Page texted to Strzok, referring to former Wall Street Journal national-security reporter Devlin Barrett. Big news about the Hillary Clinton email story was breaking when Devlin and Page were on the phone together. \u201cYou might wanna tell Devlin he should turn on CNN, there\u2019s news on,\u201d Strzok texted back.\n\nPage: He knows. He just got handed a note.\n\nStrzok: Ha. He asking about it now?\n\nPage: Yeah. It was pretty funny.\n\nInfluencing the nation\u2019s politics was routine. And ridiculously easy: one quick call to \u201cDevlin,\u201d and boom! The world changed.\n\nMcCabe and the two lovers demonstrated the very essence of the right stuff: a breezy comfort with bending the law to the demands of politics.\n\nDeploying secrets for political effect \u2014 deciding which to keep, which to tell, and how to tell them \u2014 was a task that they approached with alacrity. The ultimate goal, of course, was not propping up Hillary Clinton so much as maximizing the power and autonomy of the FBI. In pursuing this goal, McCabe and the two lovers demonstrated the very essence of the right stuff: a breezy comfort with bending the law to the demands of politics.\n\nThey honed their skills on Midyear Exam. As that test ended, an even bigger one loomed before them. At the end of July, Comey and McCabe would officially open an investigation into Russian meddling in the election, including possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. On July 5, the day of Comey\u2019s press conference on Clinton\u2019s emails, a former British spy, Christopher Steele, flew to Rome to meet an old FBI contact. The information he brought had weighty implications for the impending investigation. But neither the information nor the implications are what we have been led to believe.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Super Spy \n\nSteele \u2014 a former British spy and a Russia expert \u2014 was working on contract to Fusion GPS, a Washington-based public-relations firm, which, in turn, was on contract to a D.C. law firm, which, in turn, was on contract to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC. Steele, that is to say, was working for Hillary Clinton. His job, among other things, was to collect opposition research on Trump from his network of Russian sources.\n\nWhen Steele arrived in Rome, his famous \u201cdossier\u201d did not exist. The dossier, as we have come to know it, is some 17 reports that he compiled between June and December 2016. In early July, Steele had been working on the Clinton account for only a few weeks and had written but one report, dated June 20. It claimed that Trump was Vladimir Putin\u2019s Manchurian candidate. \u201c[The] Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting, and assisting Trump for at least 5 years,\u201d Steele reported. Putin\u2019s goal was \u201cto sow discord and disunity both within the US itself, but more especially within the Transatlantic alliance.\u201d The Russian leader supported Trump, mainly, by supplying \u201cvaluable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nPutin had offered lucrative financial contracts, but Trump had turned them down. The wily Russian, however, had managed to get his hooks into Trump due to the American\u2019s \u201csexual perversion.\u201d During a visit to Moscow in 2013, Trump had hired prostitutes to stay with him in the same hotel suite used by the Obamas on one of their trips. The FSB, Russia\u2019s secret police, had fitted the room with cameras and recording equipment. Trump had the prostitutes defile Obama\u2019s bed by putting on a \u201cgolden shower\u201d performance for him. All of it was caught on tape.\n\nEarthshaking news: Vladimir Putin was blackmailing Donald J. Trump. No doubt, Steele\u2019s FBI handler rushed this report to his superiors in Washington, D.C. They, in turn, raced it straight to Obama\u2019s desk. Sorry, wrong. According to the New York Times, Steele\u2019s explosive revelations wound their way to the J. Edgar Hoover Building only slowly. It took weeks before they appeared in Strzok\u2019s in-box. Why?\n\nMike Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA, helps explain the delay. Morell did some digging into Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier and shared the results of his research at a public forum in Washington, D.C., in March 2017. Steele, according to Morell, did not have direct access to the Russians whom he labeled as his \u201csources\u201d \u2014 people who included former officers in the FSB. He \u201ccommunicated\u201d with them, if that is the right word, through paid intermediaries, who paid the so-called sources.\n\nThe chances of Steele having been played were thus great. Morell explained it like this:\n\nIf you\u2019re paying somebody, particularly former FSB officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they\u2019re going to call you up and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s have another meeting, I have more information for you,\u201d because they want to get paid some more.\n\nThis process, Morell said, \u201ctakes you nowhere.\u201d\n\nSteele\u2019s report was, in a word, junk. And Morell, the man who expressed that opinion, was not just a seasoned intelligence professional; he was also a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton for president. Nor did Steele\u2019s FBI handler in Rome set off an alarm in Washington, because he, presumably, was also a seasoned professional who knew junk when he saw it. And he had many additional reasons to doubt the veracity of Steele\u2019s reporting \u2014 reasons that Morell refrained from broaching. How, for example, could Steele be sure that the former FSB officers in his network were fully retired? The convoluted pipeline between Moscow and London gave Russian intelligence too many opportunities to inject disinformation into the flow of reports to London.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not neglect the glaring issue of plausibility. When in the history of the rivalry between the West and Russia has it been possible for a British spy to call up sources in Moscow and gain immediate access to the deepest secrets of the Kremlin? Steele, relying only on his wits, unearthed gems the likes of which glittered only in the dreams of the CIA, Mossad, and MI6, the greatest intelligence-gathering organizations on earth. To believe that tale, we must assume that Steele, like James Bond, is no ordinary secret agent. He\u2019s a super spy.\n\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the little matter of Steele\u2019s personal bias. According to one well-informed associate, Steele was \u201cpassionate about\u201d preventing Trump from winning the election. His financial incentives, of course, oriented him in exactly the same direction. He was a paid piper \u2014 and he got paid only for collecting information detrimental to Trump. Isn\u2019t it possible \u2014 likely, even \u2014 that his shadowy paymasters in the demimonde of the Clinton campaign were calling the tune?\n\nSteele\u2019s reports certainly harmonized beautifully with the campaign\u2019s propaganda. On June 2, in a speech in San Diego, Hillary Clinton unveiled her main line of attack on Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy. His ideas, she said, were \u201cdangerously incoherent.\u201d In fact, they weren\u2019t \u201ceven really ideas \u2014 just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.\u201d Particularly mystifying was his attitude toward the Russian dictator: \u201cHe said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he\u2019d give him an A. . . . I\u2019ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.\u201d\n\nBut the demimonde wasn\u2019t about to leave it to mental-health professionals. It hired instead a British super spy. He immediately explained that Putin was extorting Trump. Two weeks after that, he flew to Rome to share his explanation with the FBI. By the time he left Rome, his handler might not have guessed that the Clinton campaign was funding the spy\u2019s work. The political nature of Steele\u2019s mission, however, would have been obvious.\n\nIn Rome on July 5, the FBI was beginning to acquire a new secret. But it was not the one contained in Steele\u2019s report. The Clinton campaign, the FBI would soon learn with certainty, was intent on framing Trump as Putin\u2019s puppet. That secret was truly explosive \u2014 and perhaps thrilling for the two lovers on McCabe\u2019s staff. In time, all of them \u2014Strzok, Page, McCabe, and Comey \u2014 would all mishandle it, damaging their careers irreparably. In July, however, they were not yet in a rush to ruination. The team with the right stuff cautiously watched and waited. Not until September would they take their fateful missteps.\n\nHillary Clinton greets supporters at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pa., July 28, 2016.\nThe Birth of the Collusion Thesis\n\nOn July 22, WikiLeaks released the largest cache of DNC emails. The plan behind the hack now became clear: to sabotage the Democratic National Convention, which opened in Philadelphia on July 25. While Clinton was organizing a celebration of Democratic unity, Guccifer 2.0 was working to flood the convention floor with enraged Bernie Sanders insurgents. In the event, Clinton managed to prevent the protests from ruining the convention. But they did damage her theater of power \u2014 and they also handed Trump a fresh opportunity to broadcast his \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d theme. He took obvious delight in the rage of the Sanders followers. \u201cAn analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates,\u201d Trump tweeted on the eve of the convention.\n\nThe statement hit Clinton like an iron bar to her kneecap. The thought that a malevolent foreign actor was helping Trump deliver the blow only increased the pain. Most observers assumed that Russian state-backed hackers stood behind Guccifer 2.0 (an assumption that has grown stronger with time). If Trump felt sheepish about benefiting from such people, he hid it well. \u201cI will tell you this, Russia. If you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said on July 27, referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s messages that the FBI never recovered during its investigation of her private server.\n\nIn the eyes of his supporters, Trump\u2019s appeal to Putin was a stage whisper, a mock gesture \u2014 and a pointed dig at Clinton. In her rush to hide emails from the FBI, Trump implied, she had delivered them up to Putin on a platter. But his brand of humor was lost on Clinton and her team. To them, the appeal to Putin was sinister. \u201cI just think that\u2019s beyond the pale,\u201d said Clinton loyalist and former CIA director Leon Panetta. To shame Trump before the voters, the campaign shifted its rhetoric perceptibly. In June, Clinton had depicted Trump\u2019s attitude toward Putin as irrational. Now the two were said to be in a partnership \u2014 a \u201cbromance\u201d was how John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, described it. \u201cThis has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,\u201d said senior Clinton policy aide Jake Sullivan. \u201cThis has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national-security issue.\u201d\n\nShaming was all well and good, but it only resonated among committed voters. Winning the election required convincing independents that Trump was more than just a passive beneficiary of the DNC hack; he had to be an accomplice. Clinton\u2019s campaign thus posted five questions on its website:\n\n1. What\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s fascination with Vladimir Putin?\n\n2. Why does Trump surround himself with advisers with links to the Kremlin?\n\n3. Why do Trump\u2019s foreign policy ideas read like a Putin wish list?\n\n4. Do Trump\u2019s still-secret tax returns show ties to Russian oligarchs?\n\n5. Why is Trump encouraging Russia to interfere in our election?\n\nEach question was followed by a short answer, leading to the inevitable conclusion that Trump was actively conspiring with Putin.\n\n\n\n\nAnd so, the collusion thesis was born. The website did not spell out the details of the conspiracy, but the campaign\u2019s demimonde left nothing to the imagination. Christopher Steele had discovered Russian \u201csources\u201d who painted a vivid picture of the plot. Putin had decided against releasing the compromising videos of Trump. The Manchurian candidate was proving just too beneficial to Russia. In fact, a full-blown alliance had formed between Putin and Trump. Based on their \u201cmutual interest in defeating . . . Hillary Clinton,\u201d they struck a grand bargain: Putin would help elect Trump, who would deliver a supine American policy on Ukraine and NATO defense.\n\nThe super spy\u2019s network was remarkable. His Russian sources were as close to Trump as they were to Putin. \u201cAn ethnic Russian close associate\u201d of Trump\u2019s \u201cadmitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy\u201d between him and the Russians. Another source revealed more: The DNC hack was carried out \u201cwith the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of his campaign team.\u201d There it was: the proof the Clinton campaign needed. The great crime against Hillary Clinton was a joint Russian-American operation, and Trump was in on it from the beginning.\n\nSteele\u2019s startling discoveries hardly stopped there. But before revealing more, let\u2019s pause and consider the purpose of his reports. How, precisely, did his direct employer, Fusion GPS, use them?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Super Duo\n\nTo hear Glenn Simpson tell it, his company, Fusion GPS, is a research organization. \u201cWhat we do is provide people with factual information,\u201d he told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August 2017. \u201cOur specialty is public record information.\u201d In truth, Simpson\u2019s true specialty is not research but persuasion \u2014 more specifically, persuasion of reporters. He has a talent for convincing journalists to publish stories, true or not, that benefit his clients. In short, he is a public-relations flack.\n\nBut Simpson is no ordinary PR man; he\u2019s a super flack. In the first decade of this century, he was in his early forties and working as an investigative journalist for the Wall Street Journal. He was reaching the pinnacle of his profession just as the Internet was gutting the print media. Simpson, however, had a marketable talent. \u201cI call it journalism for rent,\u201d he said at a public forum in August 2017. Journalism as we once knew might be dead, but deep-pocketed clients still needed to get stories into the press. And they needed to block other stories from being published. Simpson knew almost every member of the Washington press corps personally, and he understood the constraints under which they worked \u2014 what it took to get a story past an editor. He handed them canned articles. They got scoops; he got happy clients.\n\nWhen pitching stories on Trump-Putin collusion, Simpson eventually discovered the great benefit of placing Christopher Steele directly in front of reporters. In September and October, he would fly the spy from London to the United States so the two of them could brief major media outlets as a team. Before that, in July and August, Simpson did not have the benefit of Steele\u2019s physical presence. But neither was he alone. He still had the super spy\u2019s reports \u2014 James Bond in a briefcase.\n\nCon men stoke the greed of their marks by letting them catch glimpses of suitcases bulging with cash. Simpson gave his marks a sense that he was similarly loaded \u2014 but with valuable information, not money. \u201cIn September 2016, Steele and I met in Washington and discussed the information now known as the \u2018dossier,\u2019\u00a0\u201d wrote Jonathan Winer, in the Washington Post. A former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, Winer admitted passing Steele\u2019s information to his superiors. \u201cI was allowed to review, but not to keep, a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department,\u201d he explained. Simpson, we infer, would let journalists catch a glimpse of the super spy\u2019s \u201craw intelligence.\u201d Then he would quickly take the document back \u2014 because, you understand, it was just too sensitive to leave lying around.\n\nIf journalists feared that Steele\u2019s startling reports (such as, for example, the one about the golden shower) contained Russian disinformation, Simpson had a well-rehearsed spiel at the ready to reassure them. He inadvertently shared it before the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. Steele, Simpson explained, had a \u201cstandard presentation\u201d for journalists to explain how he avoided falling prey to the diabolical Russians. Sliding into the first person, he rattled off Steele\u2019s lines:\n\nI was the lead Russianist at Ml6 in the final years of my career. And I was previously stationed in Moscow. And I speak Russian. And I\u2019ve done Russian  issues all my life. And the central problem when you\u2019re a Russian intelligence expert is disinformation, and that the Russians have . . . a long history and an advanced capability in disinformation. And so . . . before we go any further, I just want you to know that . . . this is . . . the fundamental problem with my profession. And it should be assumed that in any sort of intelligence gathering . . . there will be some disinformation. And I\u2019m trained to spot that and filter it out, but . . . you should understand that . . . no one\u2019s perfect.\n\nSimpson staked the credibility of the dossier on just one thing: Steele\u2019s super awesomeness.\n\nSimpson then switched to the first-person plural. Perhaps, when briefing journalists, this was the point at which he would speak, in his own voice, as the leader of the talented and experienced team at Fusion GPS:\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve essentially filtered out everything that we think is disinformation, and we\u2019re not going to present that to you here. We\u2019re going to present to you things that we think come from credible sources, but we\u2019re not going to warrant [sic] to you . . . that this is all true.\n\nSimpson staked the credibility of the dossier on just one thing: Steele\u2019s super awesomeness. On his own, Simpson would have been flacking salacious rumor, but paired with Steele, he was briefing \u201ccredible intelligence.\u201d Together, they became a super duo.\n\nThe purpose of the dossier would change over time. In July and August, the goal was not to get Steele\u2019s reports directly into the press. Nobody knew better than Simpson, a highly experienced reporter, that Steele\u2019s claims were unverifiable and, therefore, unprintable. The best he could achieve was an article that reinforced the main suppositions of the collusion thesis \u2014 \u00a0an article such as \u201cTrump and Putin: A Love Story,\u201d which David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, wrote and published in early August. \u201cPutin,\u201d sees in Trump a grand opportunity,\u201d Remnick explained. \u201cHe sees in Trump weakness and ignorance, a confused mind. He has every hope of exploiting him.\u201d\n\nRemnick stopped just short of claiming that Putin was actually blackmailing Trump, but his depiction of their relations matched, in general, the story that emerged from Steele\u2019s reports. Remnick took pains, for example, to instruct readers:\n\nThe gathering of kompromat \u2014 compromising material \u2014 is a familiar tactic in Putin\u2019s arsenal. For years, the Russian intelligence services have filmed political enemies in stages of sexual and/or narcotic indulgence, and have distributed the grainy images online.\n\nDid Remnick personally rely on a Fusion GPS briefing? We do not know. Jane Mayer, a staff writer for the New Yorker, recently confessed that she received a briefing, in September, directly from super spy himself \u2014 so the potential for communication certainly existed. Regardless of what inspired Remnick, his approach represented a win for Simpson. If, with the help of the dossier or any other tool of persuasion, he could convince journalists that Putin was blackmailing Trump with compromising videos, then it was just that much easier to convince them to report stories about, say, the danger to the Western alliance that Trump represented \u2014 a story that would require nothing more than stringing together a few quotes from Trump with a few ominous warnings from foreign-policy experts. The dossier, in short, helped Simpson sell a master narrative.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA Diabolical Mastermind\n\nBy choosing to convince voters that Trump was somehow an accomplice to the DNC hack, the Clinton campaign had set itself a difficult challenge: defining the role of Putin\u2019s American partners in crime. After all, the hack did not require the assistance of a Tom Cruise character. No one broke into DNC headquarters, crawled through a ventilator shaft, rappelled from a cable, and slid a disk into a hard drive. The hackers carried out the operation unilaterally, electronically, and probably from offshore. They required no accomplices on American soil.\n\nSteele solved this problem by finding \u201csources\u201d who revealed that the crucial contributions of Trump\u2019s team came in the planning stages. As it turns out, Steele reported, the idea to hack the DNC actually originated from the American side. It was Trump\u2019s team that defined the objective of the operation: \u201cleaking the DNC e-mails to Wikileaks during the Democratic Convention\u201d in order \u201cto swing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hillary Clinton and across to Trump.\u201d\n\nThis report solved half of the Clinton campaign\u2019s problem: It established Trump\u2019s guilt. But a conspiracy can\u2019t grab the popular imagination if it is devoid of actual conspirators. Here again, the super spy\u2019s \u201csources\u201d came to the rescue. On the day-to-day level, the job of managing the Trump-Putin collusion fell to Paul Manafort, who, at that time, was still Trump\u2019s campaign manager. But Manafort was not the architect of the DNC hack. Fortunately, the super spy was running a mole who was able to identify that criminal genius. The plot, Steele reported, \u201cwas conceived and promoted by Trump\u2019s foreign policy adviser Carter Page.\u201d\n\nHere the super spy\u2019s vaunted ability to filter out Russian disinformation appears to have failed him. Carter Page (who is no relation to Lisa Page on McCabe\u2019s team) played a negligible role in the campaign. The Trump people had placed him on a team of foreign-policy advisers, to be sure, but they had thrown the group together in haste to counter the accusation that the campaign lacked an expert bench. Page did not know Donald Trump personally. He worked in finance, with a focus on investing in Russia\u2019s energy sector, but he had no notable achievements to his name. A former boss described him, very unkindly, as \u201ca gray spot,\u201d a man \u201cwithout any special talents or accomplishments.\u201d\n\nSteele\u2019s allegations against Page make sense only in a Marvel Comics universe. Carter Page: by day, a mild-mannered businessman; by night, a diabolical mastermind.\n\nThe role that the super spy ascribed to Page may have been absurd, but what choice did he have? The conspiracy needed a face. That person had to have plausible connections to Russia plus a certain amount of visibility. In Trump\u2019s orbit, there were only two candidates: Manafort and Page. Manafort\u2019s ties, however, were to Ukraine, not Russia \u2014 and he was too well known. He had been working in Washington since the Reagan era.\n\nPage, by contrast, had direct connections to Russia, having lived in Moscow for some three years. The modesty of his career was actually a plus, because Clinton\u2019s propagandists could present it as shadowy rather than unsuccessful. For an unknown, Page was surprisingly visible. His trip to Moscow in July 2016 had received significant press attention, not least because he had expressed opinions in favor of rapprochement with Russia and critical of American foreign policy.\n\nWith the aid of Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign rolled out their master narrative on Trump-Putin collusion. A new orthodoxy immediately gripped the establishment press, which amplified the overwrought propaganda, complete with suggestions of dirty deals, dark conspiracies, and blackmail. It was Jeffrey Goldberg, the national correspondent (now editor) of The Atlantic, who first trumpeted the new line. In his aptly titled article, \u201cIt\u2019s Official: Hillary Clinton Is Running against Vladimir Putin,\u201d Goldberg alleged that Trump \u201chas chosen . . . to unmask himself as a de facto agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet,\u201d Franklin Foer of Slate examined the matter from the Russian side: \u201cVladimir Putin has a plan for destroying the West \u2014 and that plan looks a lot like Donald Trump,\u201d he wrote. David Remnick\u2019s article discussing Putin\u2019s affinity for grainy sex videos made identical points. All three authors noted, with grave concern, the Russian ties of Paul Manafort and . . . Carter Page.\n\nWith the exception of Fox News, the broadcast media beat the same drum. CNN might not have accused Page of masterminding the hack of the DNC, but it recognized a dangerous man when it saw one. On August 8, for example, it devoted a long segment entirely to Page. \u201cWhat\u2019s really remarkable here,\u201d Jim Sciutto, CNN\u2019s chief national-security correspondent told anchorman Wolf Blitzer, is that Page\u2019s positions \u201cmatch almost word for word the positions of the Kremlin, on, for instance, alleged U.S. orchestration of pro-democracy in and around Russia. And that is sparking concern from Russia experts and former policy makers even inside the GOP.\u201d\n\nSo Page was \u201csparking concern\u201d even among Never-Trump Republicans? How ominous! But imagine how much more ominous it would have sounded if journalists could have reported that Page was also sparking concern in the FBI! At that moment, John Brennan, the director of the CIA, was doing his damnedest to hand journalists precisely that story.\n\nCIA director John Brennan testifies on Capitol Hill, June 16, 2016.\nA Ventriloquist and His Dummy\n\nWhile the establishment press was singing in harmony with the Clinton campaign, a cacophonous debate erupted inside government. At the end of July, James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, said at a public forum that the intelligence community was not \u201cready yet to make a call on attribution\u201d \u2014 not ready, that is, to attribute the DNC hack to Putin. Clapper was also unready to say that the intention of the hackers was to get Trump elected. The goal, he said, may simply have been \u201cto stir up trouble.\u201d When combined with similar comments by other intelligence officials, Clapper\u2019s statements undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s efforts to brand Trump as Putin\u2019s active accomplice.\n\nEnter John Brennan. In early August, Brennan launched a personal campaign to force a consensus in support of Clinton\u2019s propaganda. Before long, Clapper became his partner in this effort. They would succeed, however, only after the election \u2014 and then only by establishing an ad hoc and highly unorthodox intelligence-assessment team. To man the team, Brennan and Clapper handpicked a small number of analysts, tasking them with reaching a consensus before the inauguration of Donald Trump. The team, no surprise, did not disappoint. In January 2017, it produced the \u201cconsensus\u201d that Brennan had been trying to orchestrate for the previous five months. By then, it was still useful as a propaganda tool against President Donald Trump, though it had arrived far too late to help Hillary Clinton win the election.\n\nOf course, Brennan has never admitted his political motives. On the contrary, according to an in-depth Washington Post investigation (based on interviews with either Brennan himself or people very close to him), the CIA director claimed to be in possession of eye-popping intelligence reports about the DNC hack. These reports supposedly \u201ccaptured Putin\u2019s specific instructions on the operation\u2019s audacious objectives \u2014 defeat or at least damage the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and help elect her opponent, Donald Trump.\u201d Yet even if this intelligence trove actually did exist and truly did convince the CIA director, it obviously did not have the same persuasive impact on his colleagues, as evidenced by Brennan\u2019s failure to deliver a consensus assessment of Putin\u2019s motives.\n\nIn his mission to transform the intelligence community into an official choir of the Clinton campaign, Brennan ran up against a 6\u20197\u2033 wall in the form of James Comey. According to the New York Times, in August 2016, \u201ca critical split\u201d emerged between \u201cthe CIA and counterparts at the FBI, where a number of senior officials continued to believe . . . that Russia\u2019s cyberattacks were aimed primarily at disrupting America\u2019s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected.\u201d As a component of this disagreement, Brennan may also have pressured Comey to investigate possible collusion with Russia by aides and associates of Trump.\n\nBy law, the CIA cannot spy on Americans; only the FBI has the authority to investigate citizens. But the CIA can share reports with the FBI about efforts by foreign agents to suborn individual Americans, and it can strongly urge the bureau to take action on the basis of those leads. Brennan, it would appear, did just that in July 2016.\n\nThat was the moment when the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Russian efforts to influence the Trump campaign. As we mentioned, Peter Strzok, who had been in charge of Midyear Exam, took charge of this investigation, too. The genesis and scope of it, however, is shrouded in a fog of deliberate misinformation. From the little we know, the probe seems to have centered on George Papadopoulos, a young foreign-policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Acting mostly on his own initiative, Papadopoulos reached out to Russians in the hopes of brokering a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. In the process, he may have bumped into Russian intelligence agents.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s activities took place, primarily, in London \u2014 a part of the world where the CIA has greater reach than the FBI. How did Comey come to learn of them? The answer is unclear, but certain clues point to Brennan.\n\nOne of these is Brennan\u2019s own testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in March 2017. The CIA, he explained, had shared certain information with the FBI \u2014 an apparent reference to the Papadopoulos leads. This was information, he said, \u201cthat required further investigation by the bureau to determine whether or not U.S. persons were actively conspiring, colluding with Russian officials.\u201d Was Brennan taking responsibility for kick-starting the investigation into the Trump campaign? He seemed to be saying that he had dropped the Papadopoulos file on Comey\u2019s desk and said, \u201cInvestigate Trump!\u201d\n\nIf this supposition about the origins of the investigation in July is correct, it may also help explain Brennan\u2019s behavior in late August, when he grew increasingly exasperated with Comey. In an effort to gain allies, Brennan turned to friends in Congress for help. With the blessing of Obama, he organized a series of briefings for the so-called Gang of Eight \u2014 the Democratic and Republican leaders in both chambers of Congress, and the chairs and ranking minority members on the Senate and the House intelligence committees. According to the New York Times, Brennan told these senior lawmakers that he \u201chad information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president,\u201d a view that was not supported by an authoritative intelligence assessment.\n\nObama and Brennan explained the briefings as an effort to forge bipartisan unity in the face of the Russian threat. But if Brennan couldn\u2019t force a consensus inside the intelligence community, how could he possibly convince Republicans and Democrats to join hands \u2014 during a polarizing election, no less?\n\nDemocratic lawmakers became the ventriloquist\u2019s dummies, moving their lips mechanically as  CIA director Brennan spoke.\n\nThis high-minded bipartisanship was simply cover for a highly partisan move. The true motive of the briefings was to ventriloquize the Democrats on the Hill. If Brennan himself had gone public with his claims about Putin, he would have called down attacks on himself for passing off Clinton propaganda as an official intelligence assessment \u2014 and for meddling, as the director of the CIA, in domestic politics. Democratic lawmakers who received his briefings, however, operated under no such constraints. They were perfectly free to pass along Brennan\u2019s views to the public as their own. They became the ventriloquist\u2019s dummies, moving their lips mechanically as the CIA director spoke.\n\nBrennan placed one of them center stage. On August 25, he gave a briefing that differed from the others; he tailored its content especially to the bare-knuckle politics of its recipient, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. During the 2012 election, Reid had assisted President Obama by falsely claiming that his Republican presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, had paid no taxes for ten years. When later asked if spreading a false rumor wasn\u2019t reminiscent of McCarthyism, Reid responded, \u201cThey can call it whatever they want. Romney didn\u2019t win, did he?\u201d With the certain knowledge that Reid, who was in any case retiring after the 2016 election, would do whatever it took to win, Brennan indulged his own partisan political passions. He told Reid, according to the New York Times, \u201cthat unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election.\u201d\n\nIf Reid\u2019s response is anything to go by, Brennan did much more than that: He briefed the senator on information taken directly from Steele\u2019s dossier; and he complained about the recalcitrance of the director of the FBI. Two days after the briefing, Reid wrote a letter to Comey, which he immediately shared with the press. Claiming there was mounting evidence of\u00a0\u201ca direct connection between the Russian government and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d Reid demanded that the FBI launch an immediate investigation. The American people, he wrote, deserve all the facts \u201cbefore they vote this November.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign, Reid continued bluntly, \u201chas employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.\u201d He was particularly concerned with Trump associates who may have served as what he called \u201ccomplicit intermediaries\u201d between the Russian government and hackers. \u201cThe prospect of individuals tied to Trump, Wikileaks, and the Russian government coordinating to influence our election raises concerns of the utmost gravity and merits full examination.\u201d In an unmistakable reference to Steele\u2019s reports on Carter Page, Reid informed Comey that \u201cquestions have been raised\u201d about a Trump adviser who allegedly \u201cmet with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow.\u201d\n\nServing as Brennan\u2019s dummy, Reid publicized the Marvel Comics rendering of Carter Page, and he demanded that the FBI launch an investigation on the basis of it. Before long, Comey would obey.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C., July 5, 2016.\nThe Cutout\n\nShortly after Reid\u2019s letter, Obama asked the FBI for an update on its investigation of Russian tampering with the election. The president, Lisa Page texted to her lover Peter Strzok, \u201cwants to know everything we\u2019re doing.\u201d The text probably refers to Obama\u2019s preparations for the G-20 meeting in China, where he personally lodged a complaint with Putin about the Russian hacking. But the request is intriguing. Obama was engaging the FBI just as it stood ready to use the allegations of the Steele dossier as a basis for broadening its investigation of Trump. When Comey informed Obama about \u201ceverything we are doing,\u201d did he discuss the Carter Page allegations? Did he note their source, Christopher Steele? And what about the president himself? Did Obama nudge Comey to comply with the demands of Brennan and Reid?\n\nWhatever signals the president may have sent, McCabe and his lovebirds certainly began supporting the efforts of Brennan and Reid to paint Trump as Putin\u2019s puppet. The form of support was nuanced and clandestine. If Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had contacted their favorite reporter, Devlin Barrett, and leaked the fact that a Trump adviser was coming under investigation, the leak would have implicated the FBI. Trump and his supporters would then have castigated Comey, accusing him of intervening in politics. To avoid such problems, the lovers used a pair of cutouts \u2014 intermediaries who laundered the FBI\u2019s information in the same way that Reid had laundered information for Brennan.\n\nWho better to play this role than the super duo, Simpson and Steele? Either directly or through an intermediary, Strzok shared with Steele the news of the impending investigation of Carter Page. He did so with the certain knowledge that Steele would channel it to Simpson, who, in turn, would incorporate it into his standard press briefings. (FBI representatives would later deny having used Steele as a cutout with the press, but their self-defense, as we shall see below, is demonstrably false.)\n\nThe experience of the journalist Julia Ioffe demonstrates how diligent Simpson was at spreading the news that Strzok was surreptitiously feeding him. In mid September, Ioffe published a profile on Carter Page for Politico. \u201cAs I started looking into Page,\u201d she relates, \u201cI began getting calls from two separate \u2018corporate investigators\u2019 digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians.\u201d One of those investigators was, presumably, Simpson; the other one probably represented another dank corner of the Clinton demimonde. Both emphasized an allegation that came directly from Steele\u2019s dossier: namely, that Page, during his trip to Moscow in July, had met with Igor Sechin, who is a key Putin ally and the chairman of the Russian state oil company. The \u201ccorporate investigators,\u201d however, now had something else to push, something new and very newsworthy: \u201cThe FBI was investigating Page.\u201d\n\nAs knowledge of the FBI\u2019s interest in Carter Page spread, Steele\u2019s credibility soared. To exploit the opportunity, Simpson flew Steele to the United States to brief select media outlets in person. Thanks to the information that McCabe\u2019s team was leaking to the press through Steele, Simpson could repackage the super spy. No longer just a former MI6 operative working as an \u201cindependent\u201d researcher, Steele was now a trusted colleague of the FBI\u2019s. He possessed unique insight into the fears of American counterintelligence officials about Trump\u2019s nefarious relations with Putin.\n\nFor the first time, Steele agreed to go on the record as a quoted source for journalists. This round of briefings generated an article, written by veteran Yahoo reporter Michael Isikoff. Entitled \u201cU.S. Intel Officials Probe Ties between Trump Adviser and Kremlin,\u201d it focused, naturally, on Carter Page. Isikoff reported that American officials had \u201creceived intelligence reports\u201d that Page had met with Sechin. \u201cAt their alleged meeting,\u201d Isikoff reported, \u201cSechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.\u201d A Western intelligence source? That would be Christopher Steele. By identifying the super spy in this manner, Isikoff disguises (wittingly or unwittingly) Steele\u2019s identity as a Clinton operative and as the author and disseminator of the reports in question. The moniker had the added benefit of making Steele seem to work for a Western government, creating the illusion of transatlantic trepidation about the cunning Carter Page.\n\nConfirmation of the article\u2019s central claims came from two other sources. The first was a \u201csenior U.S. law enforcement official,\u201d who told Isikoff that Page\u2019s meetings in Moscow were \u201cbeing looked at.\u201d Would that be Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, or Lisa Page? The second confirmation came from \u201ca congressional source familiar with . . . briefings\u201d that lawmakers had received about Carter Page\u2019s meetings in Moscow. Would that be Harry Reid? Whether these were indeed the correct identities, it is obvious where Isikoff found his sources: on Glenn Simpson\u2019s Rolodex. Here was a story processed and canned in Fusion GPS\u2019s information factory. All Isikoff had to do was add water and shake. His sources were all part of a single network conspiring to hoodwink the public.\n\nWhy did Comey participate in this fraud? Perhaps it was to get Brennan and Reid off his back. On the risk side of the ledger, the dangers were minimal. Today the Isikoff article is a fingerprint on a hot bullet casing, irrefutable proof placing the FBI at the scene of the crime. But in September 2016, the chances of anyone ever tying the bureau to it were negligible. Although the article announced with great flourish the opening of an investigation into Carter Page, it\u2019s not even clear that, at this point, Page was truly an official target of the probe.\n\nThe important thing to Brennan and Reid was helping Hillary Clinton win the election. What they desired most from the FBI was a public statement that the Trump team was under investigation for conspiring with Putin. With the Isikoff article, Comey didn\u2019t fully satisfy them, but he threw them a bone.\n\nOn the reward side of the ledger, he showed Hillary Clinton and her friends that he was, despite everything, a team player. And his contribution to the team effort was indeed significant. The FBI\u2019s leaks were indispensable in giving super-flack Glenn Simpson a stable of seemingly independent sources willing to go on the record about the grave concern sweeping the Western world about, of all people, Carter Page.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe speaks at a press conference, July 20, 2016.\nGet Carter\n\n\u201cMr. Page is not an advisor and has made no contribution to the campaign,\u201d said a Trump spokesman in reaction to the media storm over the Isikoff article. If Carter Page thought this disavowal would return some normalcy to his life, he was sadly mistaken. It actually put a target on his back. So long as he was officially affiliated with the Trump campaign, Comey would no doubt hesitate to seek a surveillance warrant, for fear of laying the FBI open to the charge of engaging in politically motivated spying. After the disavowal, Comey had more room for maneuver. He therefore gave the go-ahead to seek a surveillance warrant.\n\nWidening the probe to include Page carried a little additional risk for Comey, but not much. If Clinton were to win the election, as everyone expected, then she would never punish him for the move. If Trump were to win and learn about the probe, it would certainly enrage him. But the investigation could also be useful as leverage. Peter Strzok put it well in a text to Lisa Page a month earlier. On August 15, 2016, referring to the possibility of a Trump victory, Strzok wrote:\n\nI want to believe the path u threw out 4 consideration in Andy\u2019s [McCabe\u2019s] office \u2014 that there\u2019s no way he gets elected \u2014 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event u die be4 you\u2019re 40.\n\nStrzok, presumably, was saying that a counterintelligence operation against Trump and his team would give the FBI leadership a species of job insurance, similar to the job insurance that J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed in his day. Presidents dared not fire Hoover, because he kept a black book on them all.\n\nStrzok\u2019s team began the process of seeking a surveillance warrant on Carter Page from the court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA. The FISA court\u2019s proceedings are not public, because they treat top-secret intelligence. To seek a warrant against Carter Page required the FBI to show probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. In preparation for the warrant application, the FBI flew Steele to Rome for a face-to-face meeting with his main FBI contact. According to the New York Times, the handler told Steele that the FBI \u201cwould pay him $50,000\u201d if he \u201ccould get solid corroboration of his reports.\u201d It was an incriminating admission. Steele\u2019s reports on Page\u2019s Moscow trip were two months old. The U.S. government \u2014 that is, the FBI and the CIA \u2014 hadn\u2019t produced an iota of corroboration \u2014 and yet on the basis of those stale reports, it had suddenly decided to target Page as a probable agent of a foreign power.\n\nWhy? Because without the Carter Page who appeared in the Steele dossier \u2014 without the Marvel Comics villain, there existed no credible intelligence pointing to a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Putin. If the investigation was to be sufficiently broad to dig up dirt on Trump, it had to include the fanciful allegations against Page. These, however, were impossible to corroborate \u2014 because they were fictive. They did, however, include one claim that, if shorn of context, wasn\u2019t as transparently silly as the others: namely, that Page had met with Sechin, the chairman of the Russian state oil company. To be sure, Steele\u2019s report of the meeting contained the outlandish claim that Page had negotiated with Sechin on lifting American sanctions against Russia. But if McCabe\u2019s team were to downplay this aspect as much as possible and focus instead on whether the meeting actually took place (it didn\u2019t) \u2014 well, that could make it appear like a worrisome allegation calling out for a sober follow-up.\n\nThe super spy sprang into action. He tapped his daisy chain of paid Russian informants, and before McCabe\u2019s team submitted the FISA warrant application, he produced some short reports supposedly confirming the meeting with Sechin. Steele discovered in his network another \u201csource\u201d: the friend of one of Sechin\u2019s friend, who had heard from Sechin and from Sechin\u2019s personal assistant that indeed Sechin had met with Page. Confirmation?! The \u201csource\u201d also reported that Sechin offered Page, in return for Trump lifting of U.S. sanctions on Russia, a personal reward: a 19 percent stake in the Russian state-owned oil company \u2014 a haul worth millions upon millions, or probably billions.\n\nNo mere criminal mastermind, Page was master negotiator as well! Cartoonish depictions such as this constitute the primary basis on which the FBI made the case that Page was probably a foreign agent and that, in addition, he had probably broken American law \u2014 the legal standard for issuing surveillance warrants. The application for a warrant against Page is locked behind a top-secret classification. But McCabe testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that without Steele\u2019s information, the FBI could not have secured a surveillance warrant. And according to Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, who have read the original warrant application and the three renewal applications, \u201cthe bulk\u201d of the material on which the FBI made its case against Page came in the Steele dossier. What is more, the application contained, in the words of the two senators, \u201cno additional information corroborating the dossier allegations\u201d \u2014 no additional information, that is, except for one newspaper article: the Isikoff piece.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s team supported an application based primarily on Steele\u2019s allegations by offering the judges an article that itself was based solely on Steele\u2019s reports.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlfa Shmalfa \n\nPlacing Page under surveillance marked the high point of the cooperation between McCabe\u2019s team and the super duo Simpson and Steele. But nefarious partnerships are prone to unravel; and when they do, they unravel quickly. Only ten short days after McCabe\u2019s team pulled the wool over the eyes of the FISA-court judges, Simpson and Steele broke off relations with the FBI in a fit of anger and bitterness.\n\nRelations started to fray amid an effort by the super duo to stage a repeat of their Isikoff triumph. At some point in October, Simpson brought Steele to the United States for a second round of in-person briefings with major news outlets. Unfortunately, not one of these outlets has seen fit to disclose the subject of the briefings, so their precise details are sketchy. Still serving as FBI cutouts, the super duo probably updated reporters on the FISA warrant application and other aspects of the Trump-Russia investigation. If so, they may have intended for that information to serve as filler in articles about a new scoop that Simpson was offering reporters. A journalist whom Fusion GPS briefed at that time subsequently told the Washington Times that Simpson was pushing a story about a secret computer link-up between Trump and a Russian bank.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, news of the link-up had started to see the light of day thanks to the \u201cclassified\u201d briefings that Brennan had organized for trusted Democrats on Capitol Hill. Intelligence officers disclosed, in the words of the Times, \u201cthe possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump,\u201d including \u201ca mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin.\u201d John Brennan had designed those briefings to be leaky, so it should come as no surprise that word of the Alfa Bank investigation flowed directly to Fusion GPS.\n\nFollowing the winning formula that had produced the Isikoff article, Simpson provided reporters with the scoop. At first, the plan proceeded flawlessly. Franklin Foer of Slate ran a breathless story about the secret communications between the servers. Do we know with certainty that Foer\u2019s information came directly from Fusion GPS? No. It\u2019s certainly possible that, as we saw in the case of Julia Ioffe, some other agent emerged from the shadows of the Clinton demimonde to serve it up to him. Whatever the source of the information, Foer thought he might just have discovered the greatest piece of incriminating evidence yet \u2014 and Hillary Clinton agreed.\n\nThe Clinton campaign called on the FBI to investigate.\n\nThe speed and enthusiasm of her endorsement suggest more than a measure of coordination. She immediately sent out not one, but two tweets flagging Foer\u2019s piece. One of them attached a statement from her campaign, which added heart palpitations and comic-book imagery to Foer\u2019s breathlessness. Slate\u2019s discovery of a \u201csecret hotline,\u201d the statement said, might unlock the mystery behind Trump\u2019s love for Putin, and it might also explain why Russia was \u201cmasterminding\u201d cyber theft designed \u201cto hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d The Clinton campaign called on the FBI to investigate.\n\nClearly, this was the cue for McCabe\u2019s lovers to chime in. Their role was to affirm by means of a leak that the FBI was taking very seriously this threat to national security, investigating with all the diligence that the American people expect of their premier law-enforcement agency. Foer\u2019s story came out on October 31 \u2014 a week and a day before the voters went to the ballot box. If McCabe\u2019s team had stuck to the script, the media would have spent the final week before the election talking of nothing but the \u201csecret hotline\u201d that connected Putin to the lair of his evil minion high atop Trump Tower.\n\nBut McCabe\u2019s team double-crossed Steele and Simpson \u2014 or so the super duo must have felt. On the same day the Slate article appeared, the New York Times reported that the FBI had investigated the link between Alfa Bank and Trump Tower. The Bureau, the Times said, had concluded \u201cthat there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\u201d This single sentence wiped out weeks of diligent work by Fusion GPS. As if to console Simpson and Steele, the article did reveal that the FBI, all summer long, had been conducting an investigation into the potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. And the Times even disclosed details of the probe \u2014 information that came courtesy, one assumes, of briefings from Fusion GPS.\n\nBut to Simpson and Steele the inclusion of those details was the bitterest of consolation. The damage the Times visited on their propaganda campaign was not limited to undermining the Alfa Bank story. The article included two additional facts, each as destructive as the other: The FBI\u2019s wide-ranging investigation into Trump had revealed no collusion with Putin, and the FBI did not even believe that Putin was trying to get Hillary Clinton elected. In a convulsive fit of journalistic integrity, the Times had rejected Fusion GPS\u2019s master narrative \u2014 and it had done so on the basis of authoritative leaks from the FBI. Someone in the J. Edgar Hoover Building had dropped a pallet of bricks on Simpson and Steele. Who?\n\nFBI director James Comey testifies on Capitol Hill, July 7, 2016.\nThe Return of Joe Friday\n\nThe collapse of the \u201csecret hotline\u201d story was part of a larger falling-out between the FBI and the super duo \u2014 and not by any means the most important part. The event that truly doomed their relations was an announcement, on October 28, that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. And the character standing at the center of that decision was James Comey.\n\nThe bureau had learned that Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\u2019s trusted right hand, had forwarded thousands of emails to a computer in her home, which Anthony Weiner had put to personal use. Weiner was a former congressman, and he was Abedin\u2019s husband. But he was also a criminal under investigation by the FBI. In her \u201cwell-intentioned but careless\u201d use of government correspondence, Abedin had streamed thousands of official emails to the laptop of a pedophile.\n\nJames Comey\u2019s July statement closing the Clinton email case coincided with Guccifer 2.0\u2019s release of the DNC emails, and it helped build the impression of Hillary Clinton as the entitled CEO of Clinton, Inc. This reopening of the case, coming just a week before the election, was also timed for maximum visibility and carried a similar political valence. It was the third in a string of blows that Clinton received in the final stage of the election. The first came at a September 11 memorial commemoration in New York, where she had stumbled badly and seemed to faint, raising doubts about her stamina and health. On October 7, WikiLeaks published the first trove of emails stolen, presumably by Russian intelligence, from her campaign manager John Podesta. The emails were further grist for the mill of those who argued that Bill and Hillary Clinton were running a Tammany Hall for the 21st century. With Clinton stumbling, both literally and figuratively, the director of the FBI seemed determined to knock her back down.\n\nWhat was he thinking? Comey now claims that he assumed Hillary Clinton would win. He feared that, after the election, people would come to learn that he had hidden the issue of Abedin\u2019s laptop from the public, and they would accuse him of giving unfair consideration to Clinton. That calculation may indeed have been part of his thinking. But he may also have been hedging against a Trump victory. The announcement about the laptop was a card that he could play to ingratiate himself to Trump \u2014 to offset the damage of the leaks about the Russia investigation. On top of those machinations, there was the old story: Comey\u2019s love of the spotlight. Here he was again in a national drama playing the entirely principled and apolitical lawman. He was in Joe Friday heaven.\n\nFor their part, Clinton and her camp read the FBI director\u2019s move as treachery most vile. In a scream of rage masquerading as a letter to Comey, Harry Reid spoke for the team. Comey, he wrote, was breaking the law by engaging in partisan political activity in support of Trump. Whereas Comey never hesitated to publicize damaging \u201cinnuendo\u201d against Clinton, he was protecting Trump from public humiliation. \u00a0\u201cIt has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,\u201d Reid fumed. \u201cThe public has a right to know this information.\u201d To underscore that point, he published the letter immediately.\n\nGlenn Simpson and Christopher Steele shared the sense of betrayal. Simpson later testified to the House intelligence committee:\n\nAt that point I felt like the rules had just been thrown out and that Comey had violated . . . one of the more sacrosanct policies, which is not announcing law enforcement activity in the closing days of an election. . . . We decided that if James Comey wasn\u2019t going to tell people about this investigation that, you know, he had violated the rules, and [it] would only be fair if the world knew that both candidates were under FBI investigation.\n\nSo Simpson and Steele \u201cbegan talking to the press.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the super duo brought about the end of their secret partnership with McCabe\u2019s team. The bureau expects its cutouts to behave as cutouts: that is to say, they must launder secrets. Sensitive and classified information must never appear in the press in a form that betrays its FBI origins.\n\nComey announced the reopening of the Clinton email case on Friday, October 28. Simpson moved quickly. He arranged a Skype interview between Steele, who was now back in London, and David Corn, a veteran journalist at Mother Jones. On October 31, Corn reported that \u201ca former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence\u201d told him \u201cthat in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on . . . Russian sources, contending that the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump \u2014 and that the FBI requested more information from him.\u201d The FBI response, Steele told Corn, was \u201cshock and horror.\u201d In August, the FBI asked for more of Steele\u2019s memos. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on.\u201d To ensure that Corn understood the nature of the inquiry, Steele shared with him the text of the reports that he had given to the Bureau.\n\nSteele\u2019s decision to expose his partnership with the FBI gave McCabe\u2019s team no choice but to terminate the relationship. The break-up was ugly, but its very messiness would later prove useful. In late 2017, congressional investigators would begin questioning the FBI\u2019s senior leaders about the role Steele had played as a cutout. The senior leaders would point to the break-up as proof of the FBI\u2019s integrity. Steele, they said, had been lying all along to the Bureau about his work with journalists. McCabe\u2019s team had no idea that he was funneling the FBI\u2019s secrets to the media. It was the Mother Jones interview that alerted them to Steele\u2019s duplicity; the moment it became clear, they immediately terminated the relationship.\n\nWe have a word to describe the use of fabricated evidence to make an innocent man appear guilty: The Obama administration framed Carter Page. But not only Carter Page. The Obama administration framed Donald Trump.\n\nThis alibi won\u2019t wash. McCabe\u2019s team was fully aware, in September, that Steele stood behind the Isikoff article. In fact, the appearance of \u201ca senior U.S. law enforcement official\u201d in the article implicates McCabe\u2019s team more or less directly. In short, Steele\u2019s FBI handlers were aware of his role in leaking information at that time, and it caused them no consternation. On the contrary, after the Isikoff article, the FBI drew Steele even closer, flying him to Rome and offering him $50,000. His work as a cutout received further tacit commendation when McCabe\u2019s team used the Isikoff article to dupe the FISA-court judges.\n\nThe troubles that eventually befell Steele and McCabe\u2019s team have no bearing on the simple facts: They worked as partners in prosecuting a campaign of innuendo against Carter Page in September, and again in placing him under surveillance in October. What is more, the surveillance order went beyond McCabe\u2019s team, to the highest levels in the FBI and the DOJ. James Comey had to sign off on that decision \u2014 and that fact implicates him in a serious abuse of power.\n\nSteele\u2019s description of Carter Page\u2019s activities in Moscow is comical. We have a word to describe the use of fabricated evidence to make an innocent man appear guilty: The Obama administration framed Carter Page. But not only Carter Page. According to Steele\u2019s dossier, Page was in Moscow to cut a deal on another\u2019s behalf: He was an emissary \u2014 the trusted agent of Donald Trump. Without Steele\u2019s allegations against Carter Page \u2014 without, that is, the story of Page negotiating with Sechin to remove the sanctions \u2014 there was no credible allegation of a Trump-Putin conspiracy. The FBI, therefore, carried out a campaign of innuendo against Donald Trump in September. And the Obama administration placed him under investigation in October, if not earlier. The Obama administration framed Donald Trump.\n\nSecond Sight\n\nDuring the Watergate scandal, the press popularized the phrase \u201cthe non-denial denial.\u201d The Nixon White House had a special talent for issuing statements that sounded like categorical denials of allegations but that, upon close parsing, affirmed them to be true. In the matter of the Steele dossier, Obama officials, some of their allies in Congress, and senior leaders in the FBI have developed an analogous ploy: the \u201cnon-verification verification.\u201d These are statements that distance the speaker from the laughable fantasies of the Steele dossier while still affirming that the tale of collusion it weaves must be taken seriously.\n\nThe unrivaled master of the move is John Brennan. In a recent appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Brennan defended the FBI\u2019s use of the Steele dossier in its FISA warrant application. He railed against the FBI\u2019s critics, whom he depicted as partisan hacks. He played the role of sober intelligence professional. Expressing his personal appraisal of the dossier when he was still director of the CIA, he said, \u201cThere were things in that dossier that made me wonder whether or not they were, in fact, accurate and true.\u201d\n\nExactly what things? Was it the dossier\u2019s view of Page as the diabolical mastermind of the DNC hack that struck the CIA director as credible? Avoiding the dossier\u2019s specific allegations, Brennan maintained his front and asserted, with the somber tone of a button-down national-security professional, that Steele\u2019s reports contain valuable intelligence leads. \u201cI think Jim Comey has said that it contained salacious and unverified information,\u201d Brennan continued. \u201cJust because it was unverified didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe non-verification verification is central to the distinctive nature of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of power. Most of our debate has focused on how the FBI used the Steele dossier to validate the investigation of Carter Page. This issue is important, to be sure, but it must not deflect us from seeing that the reverse is also true: The administration deliberately used the investigation of Page to validate the dossier.\n\nConsider, again, the coy Brennan. When questioners push him to explain what in the Steele dossier he finds compelling, he habitually takes shelter behind secret sources \u2014 evidence hidden behind a classified screen, where only he, the chief intelligence professional, was permitted to see it. \u201cI was aware of intelligence . . . about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether . . . those individuals were cooperating with the Russians . . . and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [or] cooperation occurred.\u201d\n\nBrennan\u2019s somber and self-righteous appeal to hidden secrets is the oldest con in the book.\n\nJohn Brennan sees things that we cannot see. If he indeed has access to secrets that transform stories from Marvel Comics into the stuff of everyday reality, then he has done a very poor job of explaining what they are. Moreover, no disinterested intelligence professional has supported him. Brennan\u2019s somber and self-righteous appeal to hidden secrets is the oldest con in the book. Just replace his top-secret computer monitor with a crystal ball or dried chicken bones, and his scam is the same one that Gypsy fortunetellers ran on superstitious peasants in early-modern Europe, or that soothsayers were operating in Homer\u2019s Greece.\n\nWith respect to the framing of Trump, however, the second-sight scam required elaborate orchestration, the work of many hands. The key was the double-tracking of the dossier. Hillary Clinton\u2019s enablers channeled it simultaneously into the press and into the government. They then recruited people inside government to verify to the outsiders that it was a serious document, a guide to the intelligence that reporters were not allowed to see. Without this double-tracking and official or quasi-official authentication, journalists would never have believed that they were catching a glimpse of what Brennan and the FBI saw in their crystal balls \u2014 pardon me, their top-secret monitors. And without leaks about investigations, journalists would have had no dossier-related news to report. Official statements that the dossier \u201cwas being looked into\u201d transformed it into a legitimate topic for reputable news outlets.\n\nThis con failed in its primary goal of preventing the election of Trump, but it was nevertheless a partial success. It instilled in a significant portion of the American public the conviction that Trump indeed conspired with Putin. This conviction is especially prevalent among the lofty-minded \u2014 a class of people that includes Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\nThe bipartisan character of the delusion was the greatest factor that legitimated the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged relations with Russia. The lofty-minded have greeted every indictment that Mueller has handed down as confirmation of their collusion delusion. In reality, those indictments only prove that a phalanx of crack investigators armed with nearly unlimited resources, a grand jury, and an expansive mandate can draw blood almost at will. If a similar phalanx were to target Hillary Clinton and the shenanigans surrounding the Clinton Foundation, how much blood would flow? In other words, Mueller\u2019s indictments are just the latest form of the non-verification verification.\n\nRegardless of Mueller\u2019s intentions, his probe serves as precisely the kind of \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that Strzok seems to have been discussing with his lover, Lisa Page, in August 2016. Trump cannot shut down the Mueller probe and excise the rot in the DOJ and the FBI without appearing to obstruct justice. In practical terms, then, the Mueller probe is the cover-up.\n\nOf course, the lofty-minded refuse to see it this way. The political damage that Mueller\u2019s team is inflicting on Trump helps explain why a surprising number of people mount passionate and sincere defenses of the dossier and the super spy who compiled it. The logic of partisan politics will always lead a significant percentage of people to insist, with varying degrees of true belief, that a sow\u2019s ear really is a silk purse. But partisanship is not by any means the only factor at work here. Even people with well-deserved reputations for intellectual seriousness passionately defend the integrity of Christopher Steele, a man whom the New York Times insists on calling, despite all contrary evidence, \u201ca whistleblower.\u201d\n\nFor a complete understanding of the dossier\u2019s tenacious hold on lofty minds, one must supplement conventional political analysis with psychology. What we are witnessing is nothing less than a textbook case of denial and projection \u2014 the most perfect case imaginable.\n\nThe event that shaped the dossier more than any other was the hack of the DNC. Guccifer 2.0 first began releasing documents on June 15. A week later, Steele produced his first report. The Hillary Clinton that emerged from the DNC emails was preternaturally unsuited to a populist moment. Here she was: the Hillary Clinton who made high-priced speeches to Wall Street on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. Here was the co-executive of the international slush funds of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. Here was the power-hungry political boss who worked with the DNC to fix the Democratic primaries. Clinton\u2019s supporters instinctively understood the size of the wound that the hack opened up, and they worked frantically to cauterize it \u2014 which meant deflecting attention from the greed, entitlement, and sleaze that characterized Clinton, Inc.\n\nThe dossier quickly became a tool for denying the deficiencies of Bill and Hillary Clinton, projecting them onto Donald Trump. Is Bill Clinton a sexual predator? That\u2019s nothing. Trump pays teams of prostitutes to pee on him! Did Hillary Clinton preside over the failed \u201creset\u201d with Russia? That\u2019s nothing. Putin is blackmailing Trump, and he fears Hillary! Did Bill Clinton pocket a $500,000 fee for a speech he gave in Moscow, shortly before the sale of American uranium to Russian interests? That\u2019s nothing. Trump\u2019s been dependent on Putin for years! Do the emails from the DNC prove that Hillary Clinton rigged the primaries? That\u2019s nothing. Trump conspired with Putin to rig the entire election!\n\nIn the wake of the DNC hack, leading figures in the press and senior officials in the Obama administration faced a choice. They could depict Carter Page as he really was: an unknown man of modest accomplishments who played no role of note in the Trump organization. Or they could conspire with Fusion GPS to promote the fiction that he was a sly operative in a sinister network. In a fateful choice, they opted for dishonesty and deception over truth.\n\nOnce the enablers of Hillary Clinton compromised their own integrity, they internalized her program of denial and projection. Their own egos are now invested in perpetuating it. To avoid owning up to their shortcomings, they insist, in ever-shriller tones, on the personal integrity of the super spy and the credibility of his reports. The mere acknowledgement of a simple truth \u2014 that the \u201cdossier\u201d is junk \u2014 would constitute an admission either of deep professional malfeasance or of gob-smacking gullibility.\n\nChoose your poison, Hillary enablers: You duped people and thereby abetted a gross abuse of power; or you were yourself badly duped.\n\nChoose your poison: You duped people and thereby abetted a gross abuse of power; or you were yourself badly duped. That is the dilemma that the lofty-minded now face. The choice is excruciating. It requires abandoning satisfying self-images and embracing painful self-truths \u2014 while also handing a well-deserved victory to a hated political enemy. As a consequence, the Steele dossier has proved to be as consequential as it is asinine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Greatest Denier\n\nOf course, no one is in deeper denial than Hillary Clinton herself. After she had conceded to Trump on the night of the election, Obama called her. Taking the phone, she said, \u201cMr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nSorry, no doubt, that the baton had fallen to the ground once again. Sorry that she would not be the first female president. Sorry that she would not hold the reins of power. But was contrition an aspect of any component of her sorrow?\n\n\nIf there is one thing Hillary Clinton does not do well, it is contrition. In an interview last September, she clung to the fiction that the election was stolen. Her belief that Trump conspired with Putin was absolute. \u201cThere certainly was communication, and there certainly was an understanding of some sort,\u201d Clinton said. She had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Putin sought a Trump victory, that there was \u201ca tangle of financial relationships\u201d between Trump and Russia, and that Trump\u2019s associates \u201cworked really hard to hide their connections with Russians.\u201d Were those, in her mind, clear signs of collusion? \u201cI\u2019m convinced of it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe will remain convinced until the day she dies. The alternative, a rigorous examination of conscience, is too painful to contemplate.

But the adage about marriage is often true of politics: What is not said is more destructive than what is said.\n\nFor example, over the last 18 months the president has said and done a number of things that warranted dissent from Republicans \u2014 not just from party leaders, but from rank-and-file legislators, pundits, and other commentators. But the dogs did not bark, opting to stay silent.\n\n\n\n\nWe need not take up too much space quibbling over specifics. All one need do is play the \u201cWhat if Obama said this?\u201d game to see that the moral arc of the GOP has bent toward President Trump.\n\nThen, a few weeks ago, the president proposed sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs and heaped praise on the benefits of trade wars. Suddenly, Congress and much of the conservative commentariat rose up in protest.\n\nTrump\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who reportedly almost resigned last summer over the president\u2019s morally equivocating response to a neo-Nazi rally, apparently found tariffs a nobler hill to die on.\n\nAs a free-trader, I welcome this response. But just imagine you\u2019re a run-of-the-mill Democratic congressional candidate looking to unseat a Republican who never spoke up about Trump\u2019s \u201cs***hole countries\u201d remark, the unfolding drama over Stormy Daniels, Trump\u2019s endorsement of Roy Moore, his attacks on the First Amendment, or his flirtation with cutting off aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico because of a spat with the mayor of San Juan.\n\nHow easy it would be to say: \u201cMy opponent never objected to these things, but when Trump tried to save manufacturing jobs, he leapt to his feet to protest at the bidding of the same fat-cat free-traders and globalist big businesses that outsourced so many of your jobs. My opponent is okay with the president endorsing and campaigning for an accused child molester, but he will fight to the death to keep cheap Chinese steel from pouring into this country.\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s a dumb economic argument \u2014 steel tariffs would cost more American manufacturing jobs than they\u2019d save \u2014 but it\u2019s a great political one.\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one illustration of the Republican dilemma. The president divides the Right while he unifies the Left. Praise Trump on his controversial statements and you risk alienating suburban Republicans, particularly women. Criticize Trump and you risk not only his wrath, but also the wrath of the portion of his base that demands rhetorical fealty to Trump in all things. Because this constituency has disproportionate influence in conservative media and GOP primaries, the safest course of action is often silence, or some clever dodge like, \u201cI don\u2019t respond to tweets.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has created a kind of collective-action problem for itself. By making these individual decisions out of self-interest in the moment, the party as a whole ends up getting pulled in a direction not of its own choosing.\n\nVoters don\u2019t judge parties on their lists of principles, but on their real-world priorities. Not objecting to something sends as clear a signal as objecting does. It\u2019s fun to listen to Republicans vent off the record, but most Americans don\u2019t get to hear any of that. They do hear the silence, however.\n\nAnd so does Trump. Over the weekend, the president floated a fairly obvious trial balloon, tweeting, \u201cThe Mueller probe should never have been started,\u201d and calling it, in all caps, a \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not shocking that the president would want to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, but he has never attacked him directly before. The usual suspects cheered on Trump, while most of the party was silent.\n\nOne of the few exceptions was Senator Lindsey Graham, who said firing Mueller would be the \u201cbeginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d House speaker Paul Ryan offered a lackluster response through a spokesperson: \u201cMr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said . . . nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOff the record, Republicans often say they\u2019re afraid Trump responds to being told not to do something by doing it out of spite. That\u2019s a real concern. But it\u2019s not an excuse.\n\nIf Trump does fire Mueller and a constitutional crisis ensues, the previously silent, suddenly angry Republicans will be asked why they\u2019re speaking up now.

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is working on a report that reportedly will be highly critical of McCabe, and the findings apparently triggered the OPR\u2019s review.\n\nMcCabe, readers may recall, is a favorite target of President Donald Trump. McCabe has been a central player in the FBI investigations of Hillary Clinton, Russian election interference, and potential Russian ties to the Trump campaign. He\u2019s a potential witness in the obstruction investigation against Trump. Trump believes that McCabe is biased against him, in part because McCabe\u2019s wife received substantial campaign assistance from Clinton friend (and former Virginia governor) Terry McAuliffe during her failed run for the Virginia state senate in 2015. Here are two Trump tweets from December:\n\n\nHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\n\n\u2014 Donald J.

Democrats online were decrying the allegedly obvious political corruption of the review process, a corruption that now had seeped into the permanent bureaucracy of the DOJ. And then, when the attorney general fired McCabe late Friday night, the Left truly erupted. No tweet better captured the fury than former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s:\n\n\nWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.

No one knew the actual evidence, yet their rage and certainty were undiminished.\n\nBut that\u2019s pretty much par for the course. Remember, we\u2019ve just exited a news cycle where the public, pundits, and politicians opined authoritatively about the legality and credibility of FISA applications they hadn\u2019t read. \u00a0Instead of waiting for comprehensive reports or reviewing source documents, they sallied forth into online battle relying mainly on two shoddily written, hopelessly partisan memos from a terribly compromised House committee.\n\nAt this point American political hypocrisy is boundless. The same people who would parse and condemn Barack Obama\u2019s public statements about ongoing investigations now urge us to ignore Trump\u2019s tweets. Meaningless venting, they say. Conversely, the same people who told us that Obama\u2019s public pronouncements had no impact on the good professionals at the FBI and IRS now tell us that Trump\u2019s tirades are proof positive of political influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd Friday-night news dumps? Well, they\u2019re suspicious only if we don\u2019t like the news.\n\nOne of the most loathsome political stunts in recent memory was the claim of the Democratic Senate majority leader in 2012 that Mitt Romney had not paid income taxes for ten years. He made the claim without any foundation, and it was patently false. Yet he repeated the claim time and again, hammering home an idea that the wealthy Romney escaped his civic obligations while the rest of us schmucks paid our fair share. After the election, when the extent of Harry Reid\u2019s perfidy was known, a reporter asked him if his tactics were \u201creminiscent of McCarthyism.\u201d\n\nHis answer? \u201cThey can call it whatever they want.

He was just another politician who taught us that winning isn\u2019t just everything. It\u2019s the only thing. Lie all you want. Argue against the very claims you just made. If you have standards, make sure they\u2019re double standards. But if you win, then the accolades will roll down from the heavens. Your critics can be dismissed as those messy elitists who just don\u2019t like your \u201ctone\u201d or \u201cstyle.\u201d And you\u2019re doing it for a good cause.

The FBI called around to his friends and colleagues, and one, William Rusher, groaned that he had already answered all of their questions when Buckley had been nominated for an earlier assignment. The agent replied: \u201cI know, but it is my duty to ask whether Mr. Buckley might have done anything since 1969 to embarrass the president.\u201d The sly Rusher responded, \u201cNo, but the Nixon administration has done a great deal to embarrass Mr. Buckley.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nImagine the FBI interviews with nominees like Governor Nikki Haley or General James Mattis. \u201cHave you done anything that could embarrass President Trump?\u201d It\u2019s mind-bending. They are honorable people with stellar careers and he is a failed casino magnate, serial adulterer, swindler of ambitious na\u00effs (see Trump University), sexual predator, and all-around louse. Yes, he\u2019s the president, but is he even capable of embarrassment?\n\nYou might say that Trump isn\u2019t pretending to be a saint, and that he\u2019s tough and strong and ready to be \u201cour\u201d son of a b**** (to paraphrase FDR\u2019s supposed description of a Latin American despot), but it\u2019s not quite that cut and dried. Trump maintains his innocence, which is where things get confusing.\n\nTrump vehemently denies the accusations of groping and affairs, but this week it seems that the elaborate and expensive efforts he has undertaken to conceal his behavior are unraveling a bit. The resulting prurient press party was entirely predictable.\n\nNow Trump is suing Daniels \u2014 in the amount of $20 million \u2014 for breach of the confidentiality agreement, though the official Trump position is that the agreement doesn\u2019t exist. Got that?\n\nStormy Daniels alleges that she had an affair with Trump. At first, the world yawned. But since then we\u2019ve learned that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 in hush money in October 2016. (Such nice lawyers Mr. Trump hires!) That may be a violation of campaign-finance laws if Trump did not report it as an in-kind contribution. Beyond that, it reveals the contempt with which Trump treats the public. There was no affair, but Cohen had a sudden urge to make a charitable contribution to Stormy? And now Trump is suing Daniels \u2014 in the amount of $20 million \u2014 for breach of the confidentiality agreement, though the official Trump position is that the agreement doesn\u2019t exist. Got that?\n\nSome are attempting to link this to the #MeToo movement \u2014 women must speak \u201ctheir truth,\u201d lawyer Gloria Allred explained \u2014 but it\u2019s a safe bet that Stormy is thinking finances, not feminism. Mr. Trump, who stresses that winning is the only virtue he upholds, should admire that.\n\n\n\n\nThe same cannot be said of Summer Zervos, one of the 16 women who accused Trump of groping after the release of the Access Hollywood tape. If you recall, Trump claimed that all of the women were lying and that he would sue them after the election. Zervos, who was a contestant on The Apprentice, has now received the go-ahead from a judge for her lawsuit to proceed. She said he groped. He called her liar. She is suing for defamation. Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that his depiction of Zervos as a liar was \u201cpolitical speech clearly protected by the first amendment.\u201d The judge rejected that argument and, citing the Paula Jones precedent, noted that no president is immunized against suits for purely private acts. This could open the door to sworn depositions, and possible further suits.\n\nAnd because character is destiny, yet another Trump acquaintance, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, is also attempting to invalidate her secrecy agreement. Thanks to Donald Trump, we\u2019ve learned that the gossip magazines have a practice called \u201ccatch and kill\u201d for stories they want to suppress. The parent company of the National Enquirer apparently performed this service for Trump, paying McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story.\n\n\nNevertheless, McDougal seems ready to tell her tale, and Daniels will tell hers (including allegations of threats emanating from Trump world). And perhaps, just perhaps, as they settle in this weekend to watch 60 Minutes, the party of family values will wonder whether they really wanted to sign up for all this.\n\nCopyright 2018 Creators.com", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "John Bolton at CPAC 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Gage  Gen.

As thousands congregated downtown on Saturday morning to watch city workers dye the Chicago River bright green, Illinois attorney-general candidate Erika Harold opted for something a little less flashy but perhaps even more remarkable: a local St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in Palatine, a small village in the city\u2019s northwestern suburbs.\n\nOutside Gray M. Sanborn Elementary School, the sharp Midwestern wind blew children\u2019s shamrock bowler hats into the street. A procession of several dozen decorated lawnmowers waited on the nearby grass, and a contingent of kilt-clad bagpipers warmed up in the parking lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne particularly enthusiastic village resident brought along a white Great Pyrenees dog, whose fur was tinted green for the occasion, and an amateur saxophonist repeatedly played \u201cWhen Irish Eyes Are Smiling,\u201d smoothing out the off-key notes just a bit with each rendition.\n\nAnd Harold stood in the middle of it all \u2014 matching the crowd\u2019s festive flair in her own lime-green scarf and sparkly shamrock earrings \u2014 clearly at home in the bustle and thrum as Palatine residents finished their hasty preparations. The swirl seemed second nature to her, and why wouldn\u2019t it be? She has already excelled in a much more intense atmosphere: In 2003, she was Miss America.\n\nHarold was born and raised in Champaign, Ill., and though her stint as Miss America over a decade ago sent her traveling across the country, she\u2019s now back home in the Prairie State, hoping to serve as its next attorney general, and as the first Republican to hold the office in over a decade.\n\nAlong with the Palatine Township Republican Association, Harold marched in the parade to meet members of the community ahead of the March 20 primary elections. \u201cPeople always remember when you show up at their parades and when you don\u2019t,\u201d Harold tells me as we begin walking the parade route. \u201cThey view it as a proxy for if you\u2019re willing to work hard for their vote.\u201d\n\nIf the children of Palatine could cast ballots, Harold would surely win their votes in a landslide on Tuesday. \u201cIf you have no candy, no kid wants to shake your hand. Your message is candy on a day like today,\u201d she says when she arrives, armed with a bag of the stuff. Her strategy seemed to work with children and adults alike. One man on the sidelines called out after her, \u201cI vote for the candidate who gives me the most candy!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAs the parade swept through the streets of Palatine, the former Miss America had to jog to catch up with volunteers holding her banners. Consistently, she lingered to talk with residents: \u201cYou should never ride in the parade; always walk. It\u2019s important to make a one-on-one connection.\u201d\n\nHarold says she first began to consider herself a conservative when she was a student at the University of Illinois. \u201cI know that\u2019s not the usual course of events,\u201d she tells me with a chuckle. After graduation, Harold was dead-set on going to Harvard Law School but needed to find a way to pay for it. And so she did, in a very unusual style: She entered the Miss America pageant in 2003 \u2014 and emerged the victor.\n\nThough perhaps few realize it, winners do more than wear crowns and gowns and smile for the camera. Harold\u2019s official platform as Miss America was preventing youth violence and bullying, and she deferred law school for a year to travel across the country, speaking to students, teachers, and parents about practical ways to identify and stop bullying in schools.\n\nHer dedication to the issue stemmed from her childhood experience of being a victim of bullying and harassment \u2014 often as the result of her mixed-race background: white on her father\u2019s side and both African American and Native American on her mother\u2019s. \u201cWhen I won Miss America, it was still at a time in which people didn\u2019t take the issue of bullying in schools all that seriously,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey sometimes viewed it as an adolescent rite of passage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHarold went on to graduate from Harvard Law in 2007, and has since worked full time as a lawyer. Now, she wants to take what she has learned both from the law and as Miss America to improve her home state, which she thinks has been plagued by corruption for much too long.\n\nIn her view, current attorney general Lisa Madigan \u2014 daughter of notorious Democratic-party boss Mike Madigan, who has been speaker of the Illinois house since the 1970s \u2014 has squandered the unique authority and the resources of the office. Instead of keeping her promise to lessen both public and private corruption, particularly in Chicago, Madigan has helped her friends and targeted her enemies.\n\n\u2018Political corruption in Illinois is not a partisan issue,\u2019 Harold insists.\n\n\u201cPolitical corruption in Illinois is not a partisan issue,\u201d Harold insists. \u201cPolitical leaders in both parties have abused their positions of power and created cynicism in our state that has undermined people\u2019s view of our government.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Madigan said she planned to seek a fifth term, but when Harold announced her own candidacy a month later, the current attorney general dropped out of the race. Before she can face a new Democratic candidate in November, Harold has to defeat primary challenger Gary Grasso, a Chicago-area politician who currently serves on the DuPage County board.\n\n\n\n\nIn the final weeks of the primary campaign, the GOP contest has gotten particularly ugly. Grasso recently sent mailers accusing Harold of choosing to \u201cplace a child in the home of known child abusers,\u201d decontextualizing remarks Harold made during the Miss America pageant when she was explaining her opposition to same-sex adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI switched my vote because of that mailer and am going to support Erika,\u201d one member of the Palatine Township Republican Association told me at the parade. \u201cThat attack just wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nGrasso also sent mailers suggesting that Harold is anti-family and pro-choice, as well as implying that he had received the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune editorial board, when in fact the paper had endorsed Harold.\n\nWhen supporters at the parade asked her about Grasso\u2019s negative ads, Harold shrugged them off with a pleasant smile. \u201cWhen you get late in a race and your opponent doesn\u2019t like the way things are looking, sometimes they turn to tactics like this. The best thing to do is ignore it and stay focused on the positives,\u201d Harold told one man.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not falling for it,\u201d he replied, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my vote. I think you\u2019ve got the best chance in the fall. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for you.\u201d\n\nAccording to an SIU poll from late February, Harold leads Grasso 18 percent to 14 percent, with a full 65 percent of voters undecided. Among residents of Chicago proper, Harold was up 21 to 14 percent, and in downstate Illinois, where she was born and raised, she leads Grasso 19 to 13 percent. In the suburbs, however, the two are tied at 14 percent support.\n\nWhich makes Harold\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day excursion to the suburbs even more appropriate. Though she appears to be the slight favorite to win today\u2019s primary, she isn\u2019t the type to slack off. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come up to me and say, \u2018I remember shaking your hand\u2019 or \u2018I remember you coming up onto my porch to meet me,\u2019\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou have to actually enjoy people and be curious about their stories.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cVery few people fully understand all the political issues,\u201d one of Harold\u2019s supporters told me just before the parade began. \u201cBut we remember when you show up.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s right, Harold\u2019s knack for showing up in style like she did in Palatine might be exactly what she needs to put her over the edge in today\u2019s primary \u2014 and it might even help her win in November, too.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David French", "body": "Alec Murrary holds an AR-15 assault rifle at the Ringmasters of Utah gun range, in Springville, Utah (George  them would gut the concept of an armed citizenry as a final, emergency bulwark against  about guns tend to suffer from two distinct problems. The first \u2014 and most obvious \u2014 is they quickly get screechy. The arguments devolve into shouting matches and temper tantrums. The goal isn\u2019t to persuade but to mock and bully, as if stigma alone can decisively shift the public debate. The second problem occurs when the debate gets too wonky. Charts and graphs fly across Twitter, as if fundamental questions about liberty and American society can be answered by the right kind of cross-country comparison with Australia, Great Britain, or Switzerland.\n\nWhen facing the big questions about guns \u2014 such as whether America should \u201cban\u201d an entire category of weapons (such as \u2018assault weapons\u2019) \u2014 it\u2019s better, I think, to go back to the first principles embodied in the Second Amendment. At its core, the Amendment protects a person\u2019s individual inherent right of self-defense and empowers the collective obligation to defend liberty against state tyranny. As Justice Scalia noted in District of Columbia v. Heller, this concept was fully embedded in the founding generation:\n\nAnd, of course, what the Stuarts had tried to do to their political enemies, George III had tried to do to the colonists. In the tumultuous decades of the 1760\u2019s and 1770\u2019s, the Crown began to disarm the inhabitants of the most rebellious areas. That provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.\n\nAny given gun-control measure must be evaluated against the background of those twin purposes. That\u2019s one reason why statements such as \u201cThe Second Amendment was only designed to protect muskets\u201d are so ridiculous. Imagine trying to defend your family with a flintlock pistol. The right of self-defense is best understood as a right of effective self-defense, and the tools for effective self-defense will evolve right along with weapon design and development. Any other conclusion leads to absurd results. Consequently, as the Supreme Court held, the amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time.\u201d\n\n\nThis means that if gun-control measures \u201cfreeze\u201d the nature and types of guns that are lawful for civilian use, even as broader gun development proceeds apace, there will be an ever-widening gap between the capacity of a criminal to do harm and law-abiding citizens\u2019 ability to protect themselves from that harm. It will also lead to such a yawning gap between citizen and state that private gun ownership no longer provides any meaningful deterrent to tyranny.\n\nAnd this brings us to the two favorite targets of those who argue for so-called common sense gun control \u2014 assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. While the term \u201cassault weapon\u201d is vague, we\u2019ll define it as a semi-automatic rifle with cosmetic features similar to military weapons. They\u2019re typically paired with high-capacity magazines. In fact, an \u201cassault weapon\u201d without a high-capacity magazine is little more than a menacing-looking hunting rifle.\n\n\n\n\nThere are millions of assault weapons in America. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the nation. There are tens of millions of high-capacity magazines, and they\u2019re extraordinarily easy to make. Both are unquestionably in \u201ccommon use.\u201d\n\nThis means that the foreseeable criminal threat to you or your family comes from a person wielding \u2014 at the very least \u2014 a semiautomatic pistol with a high-capacity magazine. This is one reason that police typically don\u2019t carry revolvers. Their own weapons of choice have evolved to deal with the threat, and \u2014 as my colleague Charlie Cooke is fond of noting \u2014 if a person doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a high-capacity magazine to defend himself, then why do the police use them?\n\nIf I use an AR-15 for home defense, then I possess firepower that matches or likely exceeds (given how rarely rifles are used in gun crimes) that of any likely home intruder. Limit the size of the magazine to, say, ten rounds, and you\u2019ve placed the law-abiding homeowner at a disadvantage. Prohibit them from obtaining a compact, easy-to-use, highly accurate carbine, and you\u2019ve ensured that homeowners will be defending themselves with less accurate weapons. The best weapons \u201cin common use\u201d would be reserved for criminals.\n\nMoreover, an assault-weapon ban (along with a ban on high-capacity magazines) would gut the concept of an armed citizenry as a final, emergency bulwark against tyranny. No credible person doubts that the combination of a reliable semiautomatic rifle and a large-capacity magazine is far more potent than a revolver, bolt-action rifle, or pump-action shotgun. A free citizen armed with an assault rifle is more formidable than a free citizen armed only with a pistol. A population armed with assault rifles is more formidable than a population armed with less lethal weapons.\n\nCitizens must be able to possess the kinds of weapons that can at least deter state overreach.\n\nThe argument is not that a collection of random citizens should be able to go head-to-head with the Third Cavalry Regiment. That\u2019s absurd. Nor is the argument that citizens should possess weapons \u201cin common use\u201d in the military. Rather, for the Second Amendment to remain a meaningful check on state power, citizens must be able to possess the kinds and categories of weapons that can at least deter state overreach, that would make true authoritarianism too costly to attempt.\n\n\nI fully recognize that there are many millions of Americans who flatly disagree with the notion that armed citizens either can or should try to deter tyranny. Either their trust in the government is so complete (or their sense of futility in the face of its armed might so great) that they don\u2019t believe private ownership of weapons is a meaningful check on lawless government action, or they believe that the cost of widespread civilian gun ownership is simply too high to pay in exchange for a theoretical check on state power. That\u2019s a debate worth having \u2014 in the context of a long-term progressive effort to repeal the Second Amendment. But for now, the Founders have settled question.\n\nAs Justice Scalia ably articulated in Heller, the Second Amendment was designed to protect what Blackstone called \u201cthe natural right of resistance and self-preservation.\u201d Without access to the weapons in common use in our time, the law-abiding citizen will grow increasingly \u2014 and intolerably \u2014 vulnerable to the lawless. Thus, to properly defend life and liberty, access to assault weapons and high-capacity magazines isn\u2019t a luxury; it\u2019s a   French is a senior writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, and a veteran of Operation Iraqi", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Robert Bryce", "body": "Micheal Shellenberger discusses climate and nuclear power at a TED Talks event in Banff, Canada, June 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Bret  Shellenberger, a pro-nuclear Democrat, makes a longshot bid for California governor.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf California\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial race gets decided solely by money, Michael Shellenberger doesn\u2019t have a chance.\n\nThe latest campaign filings show that Shellenberger, an environmentalist from Berkeley, has about $37,000 in cash on hand. The frontrunner in the June 5 California primary, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, has more than $16.6 million in the bank. Former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is running second in the polls, has about $5.9 million.\n\nPolls show Shellenberger running fifth. When I talked to him on Monday, he said his fundraising efforts were picking up. \u201cI\u2019m up to $50,000 now,\u201d he bragged. Shellenberger, a lifelong Democrat, may be cash-poor, but his campaign represents a stark break with Democratic-party orthodoxy on energy policy, and that alone makes his candidacy important. Shellenberger is among the world\u2019s foremost advocates for nuclear energy, and one of the fiercest critics of renewables. While his pro-nuclear stance separates him from nearly every other Democratic politician, his willingness to call out fellow Democrats on energy policy has made him one of the most important voices on the left \u2014 particularly in California, where, by 2030, the state\u2019s utilities must obtain half of the electricity they sell from renewable sources.\n\nIn addition to advocating for nuclear energy in California and elsewhere, Shellenberger is calling for reforms to housing policy and pensions. He wants to triple the rate of new housing construction in the state. He also wants to address California\u2019s pension obligations, which now stand at some $366 billion. Name one other politician who dares utter the words \u201cpension reform.\u201d\n\nIn addition to advocating for nuclear energy in California and elsewhere, Shellenberger is calling for reforms to housing policy and pensions. \n\nAuthor and demographer Joel Kotkin has been writing about California politics for many years. He told me that Shellenberger is \u201cfocused on the biggest issue in California, which is the erosion of the middle class and lack of social mobility.\u201d Kotkin said that California has become a one-party state where policy decisions are dominated by \u201cthe urban land speculators who benefit from housing policy, greens, unions, and the oligarchs. Everyone else is a bit player.\u201d Shellenberger, says Kotkin, \u201cunderstands that this has become a rigged game. Make housing and energy more expensive, you hurt the middle and lower classes.\u201d\n\nBefore going further, I should disclose that I\u2019ve known, and admired, Shellenberger for about a decade. He has long been willing to tweak conventional wisdom, particularly when it comes to energy and climate issues. In 2004, along with Ted Nordhaus, he wrote an essay called \u201cThe Death of Environmentalism,\u201d which called out groups such as the Sierra Club for their focus on fundraising rather than policy results. The two went on to found the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based research think tank that consistently turns out top-notch analysis on issues ranging from agriculture to climate change. About two years ago, Shellenberger split with Nordhaus and launched a new organization, Environmental Progress, a Berkeley-based think tank that advocates for nuclear energy.\n\n\n\n\nLast month Environmental Progress released a report, co-authored by Shellenberger and energy analyst Mark Nelson, showing that between 2011 and 2017, California\u2019s electricity prices rose five times faster than rates in the rest of the country. Californians now pay about 60 percent more for their electricity than residents of other states. Shellenberger lays the blame for the state\u2019s soaring energy costs on the its governor during those years, Jerry Brown. High electricity prices are a form of regressive taxation on the poor, Shellenberger told me. In addition, he said, \u201cIt gives lie to the reality of renewables. It shows that high penetration of renewables result in high electricity costs not just in California, but all over the world.\u201d\n\nElectricity prices matter in California, which has the highest poverty rate in the country. In 2015 my colleague Jonathan Lesser, the president of Continental Economics, authored a study for the Manhattan Institute (where I\u2019m a senior fellow) that found that in 2012, nearly 1 million California households faced \u201cenergy expenditures exceeding 10 percent of household income. In certain California counties, the rate of energy poverty was as high as 15 percent of all households.\u201d\n\nDespite those facts, California politicians continue pushing for more renewables. On his campaign website, Newsom says that \u201con his first day in office,\u201d he will \u201cissue a directive putting California on a path to 100 percent renewable energy. It\u2019s achievable and it\u2019s  candidacy has received some favorable press. The San Francisco Chronicle recently called him \u201cthe kind of wonky, engaged person people should want in government, especially because he isn\u2019t afraid to take on his fellow progressives.\u201d Despite some positive squibs in the Bay Area press, Shellenberger may be excluded from the upcoming gubernatorial debates. Earlier this month, more than a dozen energy and environmental experts \u2014 including climate scientist James Hansen, Harvard professor Steven Pinker, Nobel Prize\u2013winning scientist Burton Richter, and University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. \u2014 sent a letter to the state\u2019s biggest newspapers asking that Shellenberger be included in those debates. \u201cWithout endorsing all of his policy positions, we believe his participation in the debates would be salutary for California\u2019s democracy.\u201d They continued: \u201cRelying on money raised as a deciding variable allows wealthy candidates, and those who have taken significant quantities of funding from special interests, to effectively buy their way into debates.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, Shellenberger admitted that he faces long odds in the gubernatorial race. But he said his decision to run was motivated by a desire to change the discussion and create a \u201cnew politics that is not about identity, or scarcity, it\u2019s about abundance, a unifying economic vision along with a moderate view on immigration.\u201d He went on: \u201cIdentity politics is the opiate of the California masses.\u201d Working-class people in the state \u201ccan\u2019t afford housing. We have the highest rates of poverty and homelessness and yet all people want to talk about is identity politics and immigration raids.\u201d\n\n\u2018Identity politics is the opiate of the California masses.\u2019 \u2014 Michael Shellenberger\n\n\n\nTo nearly any observer, it\u2019s apparent that Shellenberger has little chance of moving into the governor\u2019s mansion in Sacramento. The movie-star-handsome Newsom has both name recognition and virtually limitless money. Villaraigosa also has name recognition and will be popular among California\u2019s Hispanics, who account for 28 percent of the state\u2019s voting population.\n\nIn spite of the odds against him, Shellenberger\u2019s decision to run for office is a brave one. More than perhaps any other person on the left, Shellenberger has been adamant \u2014 some would even call him a zealot \u2014 in his advocacy for nuclear energy. His zeal has fueled significant victories, including in South Korea, where he nearly singlehandedly forced the government to have a citizen jury decide the future of the country\u2019s fleet of reactors. Last year, the jury decided in favor, which allowed continued construction of new reactors. South Korea is also a major exporter of nuclear technology. Later this year, the first of four reactors being built by Korea Electric Power Company will begin generating electricity in Abu Dhabi. When completed, the new Barakah nuclear plant will be the world\u2019s largest single nuclear project, with 5,600 megawatts of capacity.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, here in the U.S., the nuclear sector is reeling. Reactors in California, New York, Vermont, and other states are being prematurely shuttered. And as those reactors are shuttered, the juice they were producing is being replaced with electricity from natural-gas-fired generators, thereby increasing carbon dioxide emissions. Shellenberger has repeatedly underscored the hypocrisy of the Left and big environmental groups \u2014 the Sierra Club, 350.org, the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 for their efforts to shutter nuclear reactors while at the same time demanding drastic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nShellenberger has won plenty of detractors during his stint among the greens, and now in politics. To judge from the amount of money he\u2019s raised in his race for governor, it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t have many donors. But in his passion and willingness to speak the truth about electricity prices and the fashionable but expensive renewable-energy mandates that are driving those prices yet higher, he has become a consumer advocate as well.\n\nIf I lived in California, I\u2019d vote for him.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions (John  General Jeff Sessions issued a memo Wednesday instructing prosecutors to seek the death penalty for drug-related offenses whenever \u201cappropriate\u201d in order to bolster the federal government\u2019s efforts to combat the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cIn the face of all of this death, we cannot continue with business as usual,\u201d Sessions said in a memo sent to the country\u2019s U.S. Attorneys. \u201cDrug traffickers, transnational criminal organizations, and violent street gangs all contribute substantially to this scourge.

They should vote for Jeanne Ives in the Republican gubernatorial primary over the thoroughly disappointing incumbent governor Bruce Rauner, who has forfeited any claim on his party\u2019s nod.\n\nRauner, a businessman with no prior experience in politics, vowed in 2014 to take on longtime House speaker Mike \u201cBoss\u201d Madigan and shepherd much-needed free-market reforms through the Democratic state legislature. With the exception of education reform, he has failed to deliver on his promises even after Republicans picked up enough seats in 2016 to sustain a veto. Rauner said he would cut the state income tax; after a long budget impasse, Republican and Democratic legislators overrode him to pass an income-tax hike. He said he would reform the pension system; he bailed it out under pressure, only to see the state\u2019s credit rating downgraded anyway. He signed a bill into law that weakens immigration enforcement. Rauner inherited a bad situation, but since taking office he has mostly made it worse.\n\nRauner\u2019s duplicity on the issue of abortion should be disqualifying to conservatives. \n\nFailing to pass the fiscal reforms he promised wouldn\u2019t alone justify his ouster in the primary. But Rauner\u2019s duplicity on the issue of abortion should be disqualifying to conservatives. During the election, Rauner \u2014 who is pro-choice, had once donated to Planned Parenthood, and whose wife is an abortion-rights activist \u2014 insisted that he was merely running to fix the state\u2019s coffers. He had, he said, \u201cno social agenda.\u201d When a bill to guarantee abortion as a right if the Supreme Court ever overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and provide public money for abortions through all nine months of a woman\u2019s pregnancy began circulating in the state legislature, Rauner said he would veto it. In September, he signed it into law. Pro-lifers who voted for Rauner put their trust in a man who is now forcing them to underwrite third-trimester abortions. His record is not just dreadful, but features a glaring lie.\n\nWhich is why Jeanne Ives, a state legislator, is a better alternative. Ives is an underdog and lacks Rauner\u2019s resources, but she is both a superior candidate to the governor and a solid politician in her own right. One recent poll has her just 7 points behind Rauner. For his part, the governor is running far behind the likely Democratic nominee \u2014 J. B. Pritzker, a cat\u2019s paw of Madigan \u2014 and has been unwilling to engage Ives in debate after an embarrassing showing in a joint appearance with her at the Chicago Tribune editorial office. Illinois Republicans should vote for Ives, the only conservative on the ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless, that is, they live in the state\u2019s third congressional district. There,\u00a0Democrat\u00a0Marie Newman is contesting the\u00a0House seat currently held by Dan Lipinski. The congressman is one of the last remaining pro-life Democrats to hold national office; for this, many Democrats think he has to go. Newman has earned the support of NARAL, Planned Parenthood, progressive luminaries such as Bernie Sanders, and two of Lipinski\u2019s fellow representatives. Enough is at stake for pro-life conservatives that those living in Illinois\u2019s third district should consider voting in the Democratic primaries instead, and cast a vote for Lipinski.\n\nThis primary might well be a symbolic Waterloo for pro-life Democrats. As the party has radicalized on abortion, Democrats who aren\u2019t comfortable with expansive abortion rights have either been cajoled into becoming so or outright replaced.

W. Cooke", "body": "David Hogg (CNN via  Parkland survivor has chosen to insert himself into an important national policy debate. We who disagree with his views on guns have a duty to speak up against them.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDavid Hogg, the telegenic 17-year-old who survived the shooting in Parkland, is not a crisis actor, an FBI plant, or the secret brainchild of a Soros-backed CNN plot. He\u2019s a political advocate engaged in a political debate, and he should be treated as such.\n\nSince the multiple murders at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Hogg has emerged as a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Pundit, whose status within the debate sits contingent upon his critics\u2019 willingness to push back.\u00a0The game being played with his testimony \u2014 by adults, not by Hogg \u2014 is as transparent as it is cynical. For ten days now, Hogg has been as permanent a fixture on the nation\u2019s TV screens as anyone bar the president. In each appearance, he has been invited without reply to share his ideas on our public policy. This he has done, emphatically. Among the proposals that Hogg has advanced are that the most popular rifle in America be federally prohibited; that the NRA be regarded as a haven for \u201cchild murderers\u201d; that Americans boycott Amazon, FedEx, and the state of Florida; and that Governor Rick Scott take responsibility for the failures of another elected official. In addition, Hogg has held a gun-control rally in New Jersey, slammed the president as a coward, criticized the federal response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico, made comments in support of funding for wind and solar power, taken a pre-emptive stand on Florida\u2019s imminent senatorial election, and suggested that, as a matter of general policy, cops cannot be expected to protect the citizenry if they believe they might be outgunned.\n\n\nFor this advocacy \u2014 and that\u2019s what it is \u2014 Hogg has been feted as a key leader within a \u201cmass movement\u201d that is determined to reform America; he has been praised for his attempt to \u201cforce change\u201d; he has been cast, including by himself, as a lion who refuses to back down; and, in some of the more cunning quarters of the left, he has been turned into a walking demonstration of the need to lower the voting age. At no point has anyone hosting him suggested that his relevance is limited to his capacity to describe his experience; rather, he\u00a0has in every instance been asked to join a public political fight \u2014 a fight, remember, that relates to nothing less foundational than the American Bill of Rights.\n\nAnd yet, when other Americans have seen fit to respond, Hogg\u2019s defenders have cast him upon the instant in diametrically opposite terms: As an irrelevance; as a mere \u201ckid\u201d; as a grieving ornament who sits well outside of our national conversation. This is extraordinary. How obvious, one wonders, do his champions intend to make it that they are using him to launder their views? And how clearly must they reveal that, despite their protestations to the contrary, they in fact have no respect whatsoever for his agency?\n\nFar from being \u201cmean,\u201d those contending with Hogg\u2019s pronouncements are accepting that he has an opinion, and that it is worth countering.\n\nIn the last few days, a handful of people have begun to push back against the substance of Hogg\u2019s views, and, in each case, have been met with the insistence that they should simply \u201cignore him\u201d as they would ignore a tenth-grade book report. Yesterday, I criticized Hogg for his routine incoherence, and immediately encountered a host of apologists who submitted that to engage with his remonstrations was \u201cmean\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d or an example of \u201cpunching down.\u201d The political incentives behind this tactic are obvious, but, substantively, the line has it utterly backward. It is condescending to ignore somebody arguing about politics, not to take them on. Far from being \u201cmean,\u201d those contending with Hogg\u2019s pronouncements are accepting that he has an opinion, and that it is worth countering \u2014 that is, they are doing exactly what Hogg\u2019s boosters have asked: treating him as the leader of a movement. Could it be, perhaps, that those boosters don\u2019t really mean what they are saying?\n\nOr could it be, perhaps, that Hogg has become a liability and that his champions now regret having thrust him into the limelight? One certainly couldn\u2019t blame them if they did, for Hogg is in fact a pretty poor advocate.\u00a0And why, pray, would he be otherwise? Suffering through a terrible crime gives a person no special insight into its causes, and Hogg has no special insight into its causes \u2014 or, frankly, into anything else. He\u2019s ignorant about basic civics; he\u2019s liable to backward reasoning; and, unable as he is to synthesize the evolving talking points upon which he relies, he has increasingly come across as slippery. In perhaps his most embarrassing moment thus far,\u00a0he shifted from arguing that the cop on duty who stood outside and did nothing while his classmates were slaughtered was correct to demur (not a great message, all told) to making the opposite case when he sensed an opportunity to lay the blame at the feet of Governor Scott \u2014 who, of course, had nothing to do with running the sheriff\u2019s department responsible for failing to save his classmates.\u00a0Demosthenes he is not.\n\n\n\n\nEven worse has been Hogg\u2019s attitude toward those who have had the temerity to disagree with him. Here, one suspects, he has been let down by those around him, the loudest of whom have evidently led him to believe that our complex political discourse can be circumvented by the blunt issuing of demands. The gun debate in America remains intractable, consisting not only of difficult legislative questions, but of elaborate constitutional, sociopolitical, historical, and criminal inquiries, too. For some reason, David Hogg has come to suppose that he can slice through this reality by issuing threats: Give me what I want, or I\u2019ll stop using FedEx; give me what I want, or I won\u2019t go back to school; give me what I want, or Florida\u2019s economy gets it. And, by the way, I\u2019m going to outlive you\u2026\n\n\nThis, suffice it to say, is not how republics work, and whether he likes it or not, Hogg lives in a republic. There is no Angry Victim clause in our constitutional text.\n\nDavid Hogg is an American, and he should speak as often and as loudly as he wishes. Moreover, if CNN believes that its present monomania will serve it well in the long run, it should continue to give him a platform. But there must be no inoculation for either party, nor must those who agree with the gun-control agenda attempt to shield its purveyors from rebuttal. Hogg did not choose to be involved in a school shooting; that, sadly, was beyond his control. But he has now chosen to play pundit on a topic of import to millions.

Or, as Lisa Page warned her paramour as early as February 2016, at the beginning of the campaign and well before the respective party nominees were even selected:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne more thing: she [Hillary Clinton] might be our next president. The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear. You think she\u2019s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?\n\n\n\n\tThe traditional way of looking at the developing scandals at the FBI and among holdover Obama appointees in the DOJ is that the bizarre atmospherics from candidate and President Trump have simply polarized everyone in Washington, and no one quite knows what is going on.\n\n\n\tAnother, more helpful, exegesis, however, is to understand that if we\u2019d seen a Hillary Clinton victory in November 2016, which was supposed to be a sure thing, there would now be no scandals at all.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat is, the current players probably broke laws and committed ethical violations not just because they were assured there would be no consequences but also because they thought they\u2019d be rewarded for their laxity.\n\n\n\tOn the eve of the election, the New York Times tracked various pollsters\u2019 models that had assured readers that Trump\u2019s odds of winning were respectively 15 percent, 8 percent, 2 percent, and less than 1 percent. Liberals howled heresy at fellow progressive poll guru Nate Silver shortly before the vote for daring to suggest that Trump had a 29 percent chance of winning the Electoral College.\n\n\n\tHillary Clinton herself was not worried about even the appearance of scandal caused by transmitting classified documents over a private home-brewed server, or enabling her husband to shake down foreign donations to their shared foundation, or destroying some 30,000 emails. Evidently, she instead reasoned that she was within months of becoming President Hillary Clinton and therefore, in her Clintonesque view of the presidency, exempt from all further criminal exposure. Would a President Clinton have allowed the FBI to reopen their strangely aborted Uranium One investigation; would the FBI have asked her whether she communicated over an unsecure server with the former president of the United States?\n\n\n\tFormer attorney general Loretta Lynch, in unethical fashion, met on an out-of-the-way Phoenix tarmac with Bill Clinton, in a likely effort to find the most efficacious ways to communicate that the ongoing email scandal and investigation would not harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. When caught, thanks to local-news reporters who happened to be at the airport, Lynch sort of, kind of recused herself. But, in fact, at some point she had ordered James Comey not to use the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d in his periodic press announcements about the FBI investigation.\n\n\n\tHow could Lynch in the middle of an election have been so silly as to allow even the appearance of impropriety? Answer: There would have been no impropriety had Hillary won \u2014 an assumption reflected in the Page-Strzok text trove when Page texted, about Lynch, \u201cShe knows no charges will be brought.\u201d In fact, after a Clinton victory, Lynch\u2019s obsequiousness in devising such a clandestine meeting with Bill Clinton may well have been rewarded: Clinton allies leaked to the New York Times that Clinton was considering keeping Lynch on as the attorney general.\n\n\n\tHow could former deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe assume an oversight role in the FBI probe of the Clinton email scandal when just months earlier his spouse had run for state office in Virginia and had received a huge $450,000 cash donation from Common Good VA, the political-action committee of long-time Clinton-intimate Terry McAuliffe?\n\n\n\tMost elite bureaucrats understood the Clinton way of doing business, in which loyalty, not legality, is what earned career advancement.\n\n\n\tAgain, the answer was clear. McCabe assumed that Clinton would easily win the election. Far from being a scandal, McCabe\u2019s not \u201cloaded for bear\u201d oversight of the investigation, in the world of beltway maneuvering, would have been a good argument for a promotion in the new Clinton administration. Most elite bureaucrats understood the Clinton way of doing business, in which loyalty, not legality, is what earned career advancement.\n\n\n\tSome have wondered why the recently demoted deputy DOJ official Bruce Ohr (who met with the architects of the Fusion GPS file after the election) would have been so stupid as to allow his spouse to work for Fusion \u2014 a de facto Clinton-funded purveyor of what turned out to be Russian fantasies, fibs, and obscenities?\n\n\n\tAgain, those are absolutely the wrong questions. Rather, why wouldn\u2019t a successful member of the Obama administrative aparat make the necessary ethical adjustments to further his career in another two-term progressive regnum? In other words, Ohr rightly assumed that empowering the Clinton-funded dossier would pay career dividends for such a power couple once Hillary was elected. Or, in desperation, the dossier would at least derail Trump after her defeat. Like other members of his byzantine caste, Ohr did everything right except bet on the wrong horse.\n\n\n\tWhat about the recently reassigned FBI lawyer Lisa Page and FBI top investigator Peter Strzok? Their reported 50,000-plus text messages (do the math per hour at work, and it is hard to believe that either had to time to do much of anything else) are providing a Procopian court history of the entire Fusion-Mueller investigation miasma.\n\n\n\tSo why did Strzok and Page believe that they could conduct without disclosure a romantic affair on FBI-government-owned cellphones? Why would they have been emboldened enough to cite a meeting with Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, in which they apparently discussed the dire consequences of an improbable Trump victory?\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s [probably Andrew McCabe, then deputy director of the FBI] office that there\u2019s no way Trump gets elected \u2014 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40.\n\n\n\n\tAnd why would the two believe that they could so candidly express their contempt for a presidential candidate supposedly then under a secret FBI investigation?\n\n\n\tOnce more, those are the wrong interrogatories. If we consider the mentality of government elite careerists, we see that the election-cycle machinations and later indiscretions of Strzok and Page were not liabilities at all. They were good investments. They signaled their loyalty to the incoming administration and that they were worthy of commendation and reward.\n\n\n\tHillary Clinton\u2019s sure victory certainly also explains the likely warping of the FISA courts by FBI careerists seeking to use a suspect dossier to surveille Trump associates \u2014 and the apparent requests by Samantha Power, Susan Rice, and others to read surveilled transcripts of Trump associates, unmask names, and leak them to pet reporters. Again, all these insiders were playing the careerist odds. What we view as reprehensible behavior, they at the time considered wise investments that would earn rewards with an ascendant President Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\tDid Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, or Debbie Wasserman Shultz worry about their fabrications, unethical behavior, and various conspiratorial efforts to ensure that Hillary Clinton would be exempt from criminal liability in her email shenanigans, and that she would win the Democratic nomination and general election? Not when their equally unethical and conspiratorial boss would appreciate her subordinate soul mates. For a deep-state careerist without ethical bearings, one of the advantages of a Clinton sure-thing presidency would be that the Clintons are known to reward loyalty more highly than morality.\n\n\n\tThen we arrive at the tragic farce of former FBI director James Comey. It is now easy to deplore Comey\u2019s unethical and unprofessional behavior: In all likelihood, he wrote an exoneration of Hillary Clinton before he even interviewed her and her top aides; then he lied about just that sequence while he was under oath and virtue-signaling before Congress; he feigned concern about Clinton\u2019s felonious behavior but used linguistic gymnastics in his report to ensure his condemnation would be merely rhetorical and without legal consequences.\n\n\n\tHad Hillary won, as she was supposed to, Comey would probably have been mildly chastised for his herky-jerky press conferences, but ultimately praised for making sure the email scandal didn\u2019t derail her. Comey\u2019s later implosion, recall, occurred only after the improbable election of Donald Trump, as he desperately reversed course a fourth time and tried to ingratiate himself with Trump while hedging his bets by winking and nodding at the ongoing, unraveling fantasy of the Steele dossier.\n\n\n\tAnd Barack Obama? We now know that he himself used an alias to communicate at least 20 times with Hillary on her private, non-secure gmail account. But Obama lied on national TV, saying he learned of Hillary\u2019s illegal server only when the rest of the nation did, by reading the news. Would he have dared to lie so publicly if he\u2019d assumed that Trump\u2019s presidency was imminent? Would he ever have allowed his subordinates to use the dossier to obtain FISA warrants and pass around and unmask the resulting surveillance transcripts if he\u2019d seen Trump as the likely winner and a potentially angered president with powers to reinvestigate all these illegal acts?\n\n\n\tWe sometimes forget that Barack Obama, not candidate Hillary Clinton, was president when the FBI conducted the lax investigation of the email scandal, when Loretta Lynch outsourced her prosecutorial prerogatives to James Comey, when the FBI trafficked with the Clinton-funded Fusion GPS dossier, when various DOJ and FBI lawyers requested FISA-approved surveillance largely on the basis of a fraudulent document, and when administration officials unmasked and leaked the names of American citizens.\n\n\n\tHad Hillary Clinton polled ten points behind Donald Trump in early 2016, we\u2019d have none of these scandals \u2014 not because those involved were moral actors (none were), but because Hillary would have been considered yesterday\u2019s damaged goods and not worth any extra-legal exposure taken on her behalf.\n\n\n\tSimilarly, if the clear front-runner Hillary Clinton had won the election, we\u2019d now have no scandals. Again, the reason is not that she and her careerist enablers did not engage in scandalous behavior, but that such foul play would have been recalibrated as rewardable fealty and absorbed into the folds of the progressive deep state.\n\n\n\tThe only mystery in these sordid scandals is how a president Hillary Clinton would have rewarded her various appendages. In short, how would a President Clinton have calibrated the many rewards for any-means-necessary help? Would Lynch\u2019s tarmac idea have trumped Comey\u2019s phony investigation? Would Glen Simpson now be White House press secretary, James Comey Clinton\u2019s CIA director; would Andrew McCabe be Comey\u2019s replacement at the FBI?\n\n\n\tWhat now appears clearly unethical and probably illegal would have passed as normal in a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton progressive continuum.\n\n\n\tIn reductionist terms, every single scandal that has so far surfaced at the FBI and DOJ share a common catalyst. What now appears clearly unethical and probably illegal would have passed as normal in a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton progressive continuum.\n\n\n\tA final paradox: Why did so many federal officials and officeholders act so unethically and likely illegally when they were convinced of a Clinton landslide? Why the overkill?\n\n\n\tThe answer to that paradox lies in human nature and can be explored through the hubris and nemesis of Greek tragedy \u2014 or the 1972 petty burgling of a Watergate complex apartment when Richard Nixon really was on his way to a landslide victory.\n\n\n\tNeedlessly weaponizing the Obama FBI and the DOJ was akin to Hillary Clinton\u2019s insanely campaigning in the last days of the 2016 campaign in red-state Arizona, the supposed \u201ccherry atop a pleasing electoral map.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn short, such hubris was not just what Peter Strzok in August 2016 termed an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against an unlikely Trump victory. Instead, the Clinton and Obama officials believed that it was within the administrative state\u2019s grasp and their perceived political interest not just to beat but to destroy and humiliate Donald Trump \u2014 and by extension all the distasteful deplorables and irredeemables he supposedly had galvanized.\n\n\n\t\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won, released in October from Basic Books.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew C.

Adam Schiff\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Joshua  confirms that the FBI and the DOJ relied heavily on uncorroborated, third-hand, anonymous sources in their FISA  Adam Schiff has more of a sense of humor than I\u2019d have given him credit for. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat begins his long awaited memo \u2014 the minority response to the Nunes memo that was penned by staffers of the committee\u2019s Republican majority \u2014 by slamming Chairman Devin Nunes\u2019s unconscionable \u201crisk of public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose.\u201d The Schiff memo, which has been delayed for weeks because the FBI objected to its gratuitous effort to publicize highly classified intelligence, including methods and sources, then proceeds to tell its tale through what appear to be scores of blacked-out redactions of information Schiff pushed to expose.\n\nHeavy Reliance on Steele Dossier Confirmed\n\nThe FBI and the Justice Department heavily relied on the Steele dossier\u2019s uncorroborated allegations. You know this is true because, notwithstanding the claim that \u201conly narrow use\u201d was made \u201cof information from Steele\u2019s sources,\u201d the Democrats end up acknowledging that \u201conly narrow use\u201d actually means significant use \u2014 as in, the dossier was the sine qua non of the warrant application. The memo concedes that the FISA warrant application relied on allegations by Steele\u2019s anonymous Russian hearsay sources that:\n\nPage met separately while in Russia with Igor Sechin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin and executive chairman of Roseneft, Russia\u2019s state-owned oil company, and Igor Divyekin, a senior Kremlin official. Sechin allegedly discussed the prospect of future U.S.-Russia energy cooperation and \u201can associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia.\u201d Divyekin allegedly disclosed to Page that the Kremlin possessed compromising information on Clinton (\u201ckompromat\u201d) and noted the possibility of its being released to Candidate #1\u2019s [i.e., Donald Trump\u2019s] campaign. . . . This closely tracks what other Russian contacts were informing another Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos.\n\nThis passage puts the lie to two of the main Democratic talking points:\n\n1) This was obviously the most critical allegation against Page. The Democrats attempt to make much of Page\u2019s trip to Moscow in July 2016, but the uncorroborated Sechin and Divyekin meetings, which Page credibly denies, are the aspect of the Moscow trip that suggested a nefarious Trump-Russia conspiracy. That\u2019s what the investigation was about. Far from clandestine, the rest of Page\u2019s trip was well publicized and apparently anodyne. And saliently \u2014 for reasons we\u2019ll get to in due course \u2014 Page was clearly prepared to talk to the FBI about the trip if the Bureau wanted to know what he was up to.\n\nIt is the Steele dossier that alleges Page was engaged in arguably criminal activity. The Democrats point to nothing else that does.\n\nMoreover, because Page was an American citizen, FISA law required that the FBI and the DOJ show not only that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power (Russia), but also that his \u201cclandestine\u201d activities on behalf of Russia were a likely violation of federal criminal law. (See FISA, Section 1801(b)(2)(A) through (E), Title 50, U.S. Code.) It is the Steele dossier that alleges Page was engaged in arguably criminal activity. The Democrats point to nothing else that does.\n\n2) Democrats implausibly insist that what \u201claunched\u201d the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation was not Steele\u2019s allegations but intelligence from Australia about George Papadopoulos\u2019s contact with what Democrats elusively describe as \u201cindividuals linked to Russia.\u201d As we learned when Papadopoulos pled guilty, though, it is anything but clear that these \u201cindividuals linked to Russia\u201d had much in the way of links to Putin\u2019s regime: London-based academic Joseph Misfud, who is from Malta and apparently does not speak Russian; an unidentified woman who falsely pretended to be Putin\u2019s niece; and Ivan Timofeev, a program director at a Russian government-funded think-tank.\n\nEven if we assume for argument\u2019s sake that these characters had solid regime connections \u2014 rather than that they were boasting to impress the credulous young Papadopoulos \u2014 they were patently not in the same league as Sechin, a Putin crony, and Divyekin, a highly placed regime official. And that, manifestly, is how the FBI and the DOJ saw the matter: They sought a FISA warrant on Page, not Papadopoulos. And, as the above-excerpted passage shows, they highlighted the Steele dossier\u2019s sensational allegations about Page and then feebly tried to corroborate those allegations with some Papadopoulos information, not the other way around. (More on that when we get to Schiff\u2019s notion of \u201ccorroboration.\u201d)\n\nConcealing the Dossier\u2019s Clinton-Campaign Origins\n\nAnother major takeaway from the Schiff memo is that the FBI and the DOJ withheld from the FISA court the fact that Steele\u2019s work was a project of the Clinton campaign. Naturally, the reader must ferret this admission out of a couple of dense paragraphs, in which Democrats risibly claim that the \u201cDOJ was transparent with the Court about Steele\u2019s sourcing.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019s this for transparency? The FISA warrant application says that Steele, referred to as \u201cSource #1,\u201d was \u201capproached by\u201d Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, referred to as \u201can identified U.S. person,\u201d who\n\nindicated to Source #1 that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. Person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s [i.e., Trump\u2019s] ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. Person and Source #1 have a longstanding business relationship.) The identified U.S. Person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign. [Emphasis in Schiff memo, p. 5]\n\nThe first thing to notice here is the epistemological contortions by which the DOJ rationalized concealing that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid for Steele\u2019s reporting. They ooze consciousness of guilt. If you have to go through these kinds of mental gymnastics to avoid disclosing something, it\u2019s because you know that being \u201ctransparent\u201d demands disclosing it.\n\nNext, Schiff \u2014 again, hilariously enough to make you wonder if it\u2019s done tongue-in-cheek \u2014 accuses Nunes of hypocrisy for condemning the omission of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name after having rebuked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cunmasking\u201d of American names. Of course, the two things have nothing to do with each other.\n\n\u201cUnmasking\u201d refers to the revelation of American identities in intelligence reports. These are Americans who, though not targeted as foreign agents, are incidentally intercepted in surveillance. In marked contrast, we are talking here about a FISA warrant application, not an intelligence report. In a warrant application, it is the DOJ\u2019s honorable practice, and the judiciary\u2019s expectation, that the court must be informed about the material biases of the sources of the factual allegations that the DOJ claims amount to probable cause.\n\nAs the Democrats\u2019 own excerpt from the FISA application illustrates, unmasking has nothing to do with it, because there is no need to use names at all: Note that Simpson is referred to as \u201can identified U.S. person\u201d; Perkins-Coie is referred to as \u201ca U.S.-based law firm.\u201d The dispute here is not about the failure to use the words \u201cHillary Clinton.\u201d They could have referred to \u201cCandidate #2.\u201d To state that \u201cCandidate #2\u201d had commissioned Steele\u2019s research would have been just as easy and every bit as appropriate as the DOJ\u2019s reference to a \u201cCandidate #1,\u201d who might have \u201cties to Russia.\u201d Had DOJ done the former, it would not have \u201cunmasked\u201d Hillary Clinton any more than Donald Trump was unmasked by DOJ\u2019s description of him as \u201cCandidate #1\u201d; but it would have been being \u201ctransparent\u201d with the FISA court. By omitting any reference to Clinton, the DOJ was being the opposite of transparent.\n\nTwo other things to notice here.\n\n1) The DOJ\u2019s application asserted: \u201cThe identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d There is only one reason to include such a statement: The DOJ well understood that the implied biases in the process of compiling the dossier\u2019s allegations, including Steele\u2019s implied biases, were material to the FISA court\u2019s evaluation. A prosecutor does not get to tell a judge reasons that a source\u2019s reports should be thought free of bias while leaving out why they should not be thought free of bias. If you know it\u2019s necessary to disclose that \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d Simpson was being paid by \u201ca U.S.-based law firm\u201d (Perkins-Coie), then it is at least equally necessary to disclose that, in turn, the law firm was being paid by its clients: the Clinton campaign and the DNC. To tell half the story is patently misleading.\n\n2) Schiff comically highlights this DOJ assertion as if it were his home run, when it is in fact damning: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d This is the vague reference that Democrats and Trump critics laughably say was adequate disclosure of the dossier\u2019s political motivation. But why would the FBI \u201cspeculate\u201d that a political motive was \u201clikely\u201d involved when, in reality, the FBI well knew that a very specific political motive was precisely involved?\n\nThere was no reason for supposition here. If the FBI had transparently disclosed that the dossier was a product of the Clinton campaign \u2014 oh, sorry, didn\u2019t mean to unmask; if the FBI had transparently disclosed that the dossier was a product of \u201cCandidate #2\u2019s\u201d campaign \u2014 then the court would have been informed about the apodictic certainty that the people behind the dossier were trying to discredit the campaign of Candidate #2\u2019s opponent. It is disingenuous to tell a judge that something is \u201clikely\u201d when, in fact, it is beyond any doubt.\n\nThe Issue Is the Credibility of Steele\u2019s Informants, Not of Steele Himself\n\nWhen the Justice Department seeks a warrant from a court, the credibility that matters is not that of the agent who has assembled the information from the informants; it is that of the informants who observe the fact matters that are claimed to be a basis for finding probable cause. That is, what mattered was the credibility of Steele\u2019s anonymous Russian sources, not the credibility of Steele himself. By dwelling on the countless reasons why Schiff is wrong about the adequacy of the disclosure of Steele\u2019s biases, I am falling into the trap I have warned against (here, and in section C here).\n\nThe FBI and the DOJ relied vicariously on Steele\u2019s credibility, as a substitute for their failure to corroborate his informants\u2019 information. It was improper to do this.\n\nTo be clear, the only reason Steele\u2019s own biases have any pertinence is that the FBI and the DOJ relied vicariously on Steele\u2019s credibility, as a substitute for their failure to corroborate his informants\u2019 information. It was improper to do this. Yet even if a prosecutor goes down a certain road wrongly, the duty to be candid with the tribunal still applies. The prosecutor is obliged to tell the whole story about potential bias, not a skewed version.\n\nSchiff\u2019s memo struggles mightily, and futilely, to demonstrate that Steele\u2019s credibility issues were sufficiently disclosed. But that is a side issue. The question is whether Steele\u2019s informants were credible. To the limited extent that committee Democrats grapple with this problem, they tell us that, after the first FISA application, the FBI and the DOJ provided additional information that corroborated Steele\u2019s informants. There are four problems with this:\n\n1) It would not justify using uncorroborated allegations in the first warrant.\n\n2) The supposedly corroborative information is blacked out; while that may be an appropriate protection of sensitive intelligence, we are still left having to take Schiff\u2019s word for it.\n\n3) Taking Schiff\u2019s word for it would be unwise given his memo\u2019s warped conception of \u201ccorroboration.\u201d Recall the Schiff memo passage excerpted in the first section above. In the last part, the Democrats argue that the dossier claim that Page met with Kremlin official Divyekin was somehow corroborated because it \u201cclosely tracked\u201d what Papadopoulos was hearing from his dubious \u201cRussian contacts.\u201d But the supposed \u201cRussian contacts\u201d were telling Papadopoulos that the Kremlin had thousands of Clinton-related emails. That did nothing to confirm Steele\u2019s claim that Page had met with Divyekin, a top regime official; nor did it corroborate that the \u201ckompromat\u201d Divyekin referred to was the same thing as the emails that Papadopoulos\u2019s \u201cRussian contacts\u201d were talking about. (Of course, it may well be that Page never actually met with Divyekin and that Papadopoulos\u2019s sources were wrong about emails; if so, committee Democrats are in the strange position of contending that the non-existent can corroborate the non-existent.)\n\n4) Most significantly, Democrats seem not to grasp that the flaw here lies not merely in the failure to corroborate the information from Steele\u2019s sources. There appears not even to be corroboration that these sources existed \u2014 i.e., that they are real people whose claims are accurately reported. Indeed, it is worse than that. Even if we stipulate for argument\u2019s sake that Steele\u2019s anonymous Russian informants are authentic, they are generally hearsay witnesses, one or more steps removed from the events they relate. The real question, then, is whether the informants\u2019 sources are real, identifiable, reliable informants. Based on what has been disclosed, we must assume that the FBI did not know. That is why the DOJ inappropriately tried to rely on Steele\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe FBI Interviews of Carter Page\n\nIn the course of providing a skewed portrait of Carter Page\u2019s background, the Schiff memo unintentionally highlights another deep flaw in the warrant application.\n\nThe memo limns Page as a master spy with disturbing \u201cconnections to Russian Government and Intelligence Officials\u201d \u2014 which will be amusing to anyone who has seen an interview of Page, now a ubiquitous oddball media presence. What Democrats conveniently omit is that (a) Page cooperated with the FBI and Justice Department in a prior investigation in which his information was used to prosecute Russian spies; (b) the Russian spies explicitly regarded him as an \u201cidiot\u201d (and they had not even seen him on cable TV); and (c) since Russian operatives can be as diabolical and sophisticated as the Democrats suggest, they would have known that Page did not have the kind of relationship with Trump that would have made Page a suitable conduit for proposing traitorous deals \u2014 and as we\u2019ve seen, the Russians had far better ways to approach Trump (e.g., the Kremlin-connected oligarch Aras Agalarov, who had a personal relationship with Trump and orchestrated the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting).\n\nThe memo does note that \u201cthe FBI also interviewed Page multiple times about his Russian intelligence contacts.\u201d Apparently, these interviews stretch back to 2013. The memo also lets slip that there was at least one more interview with Page in March 2016, before the counterintelligence investigation began. We must assume that Page was a truthful informant since his information was used in a prosecution against Russian spies and Page himself has never been accused of lying to the FBI.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance? It is a requirement of FISA law.\n\nSo . . . here\u2019s the question: When Steele brought the FBI his unverified allegations that Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin, why didn\u2019t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance? Lest you wonder, this is not an instance of me second-guessing the Bureau with an investigative plan I think would have been better. It is a requirement of FISA law.\n\nWhen the FBI and DOJ apply for a FISA warrant, they must convince the court that surveillance \u2014 a highly intrusive tactic by which the government monitors all of an American citizen\u2019s electronic communications \u2014 is necessary because the foreign-intelligence information the government seeks \u201ccannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques.\u201d (See FISA, Section 1804(a)(6)(C) of Title 50, U.S. Code.) Normal investigative techniques include interviewing the subject. There are, of course, situations in which such alternative investigative techniques will inevitably fail \u2014 a mafia don or a jihadist is not likely to sit down with FBI agents and tell them everything he knows. But Carter Page was not only likely to do so, he had a documented history of providing information to the FBI.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see what the DOJ told the FISA court about why normal investigative techniques would not suffice to pry information from Page. They certainly seem to work fine for Fox News.\n\nThe Page Surveillance Enabled Interception of Past Communications\n\nThe Schiff memo repeats the canard that the Obama administration was not really spying on the Trump campaign because the DOJ waited until the Trump campaign cut ties with Page before seeking a surveillance warrant. What Democrats fail to mention is that the surveillance enabled the FBI to intercept not only his forward-going communications but also any stored emails and texts he might have had. Clearly, they were hoping to find a motherlode of campaign communications. Remember, Page was merely the vehicle for surveillance; the objective was to probe Trump ties to Russia.\n\nThe \u201cClosely Held Investigative Team\u201d\n\nSchiff is determined to run with the implausible story that George Papadopoulos is the face that launched a thousand ships \u2014 that Papadopoulos\u2019s boozy conversation with an Australian diplomat, not the Steele dossier\u2019s allegations of a traitorous Trump-Russia conspiracy, was the true impetus for the counterintelligence investigation. Schiff maintains that the FBI was therefore not even paying attention to Steele until long after the Papadopoulos information came in. That is, even though the Bureau started receiving Steele\u2019s reports in July 2016, they did not make their way to the FBI\u2019s \u201cclosely held investigative team\u201d for some seven weeks \u2014 i.e., until mid September. This team is described elsewhere (p. 3) in the Schiff memo as \u201cthe counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters.\u201d Of course, by mid September, Steele and Fusion GPS were leaking Steele\u2019s allegations to many favored reporters, so perhaps Schiff is saying that the \u201cclosely held investigative team\u201d read about them in the news.\n\nIt is, in any event, a frivolous point. The fact that the Bureau administratively opened a case on Papadopoulos does not mean that much of anything was done on it. As we know, investigators did not even interview Papadopoulos until late January 2017, after Trump had already taken office and about six months after they received the info about Papadopoulos. By contrast, once the \u201cclosely held investigative team\u201d got the Steele dossier, the FBI and the DOJ were at the FISA court\u2019s doorstep tout de suite. And to repeat, they got a surveillance warrant for Page, not Papadopoulos.\n\nMeantime, Schiff needs to make up his mind about the significance of the \u201cclosely held investigative team.\u201d Near the end of the memo, he raps Nunes for pointing to the anti-Trump animus evident in the texts of FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. These Bureau officials are not important, Schiff says, because neither of them was the \u201caffiant\u201d on any of the FISA warrant applications.\n\nBut wait: Stzok and Page were part of the \u201cclosely held investigative team,\u201d which Schiff has only just told us are the only FBI personnel who matter. Anyway, though he is wont to remind us every few minutes that he is a former prosecutor, Schiff seems unfamiliar with how investigations work. The affiant on a warrant application aggregates the information of many agents and informants. A warrant is a team effort, which I had thought was why Schiff stressed the \u201cclosely held investigative team.\u201d And Page was a lawyer, not an agent, so though she would presumably not be the affiant on a warrant application, she may well have participated in the FBI\u2019s legal review of the applications, which occurs both in-house and in consultation with Justice Department lawyers.\n\nFour Different FISA-Court Judges\n\nSchiff makes much of the fact that the four FISA warrants (the original authorization and three renewals, at 90-day intervals) were signed by four different FISA-court judges \u2014 all apparently appointed to the federal district courts by Republican presidents. This hardly commends the validity of the warrants.\n\nIn criminal surveillance orders, for example, it is common for prosecutors to bring renewal applications back to the same judge who authorized the original surveillance. That judge presumably knows the case better and is thus in a superior position to detect any irregularities. If FISA surveillance works differently, that would be another reason for critics to fear that the court is merely a rubber stamp. (For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t share the view that the FISA court merely rubber-stamps applications. The process is a give-and-take one, and though the FISA court rarely rejects warrants, the DOJ does modify many warrants in response to the court\u2019s concerns. Moreover, since surveillance of foreign threats to the U.S. is an executive responsibility, the court should approve them unless it appears that the FBI and the DOJ are abusing the process).\n\nIn any event, the issue here is failure to disclose information to the court. If a judge was not made aware of material facts, the judge\u2019s authorization of a warrant does not validate the derelict application. (That said, it is difficult to understand why judges would not be troubled by the lack of corroboration of Steele\u2019s unidentified Russian hearsay informants.)\n\nThe Basis for Steele\u2019s Termination as an FBI Informant\n\nThe FISA judges were not told that Steele had lied to the FBI about contacts with the press.\n\nThe Schiff memo is disingenuous in claiming that the warrant applications were forthright with the FISA court about the reasons for Steele\u2019s termination as an FBI source. The Grassley-Graham memo explains (as I\u2019ve previously detailed) that the court was apparently told that Steele was dismissed over contacts with the press. The FISA judges were not told that Steele had lied to the FBI about contacts with the press.\n\nPapadopoulos and the Clinton Emails\n\nCommittee Democrats misrepresent a significant fact derived from Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s statement of Papadopoulos\u2019s offense (filed when the latter pled guilty). The Schiff memo states\n\nWe would later learn in Papadopoulos\u2019s plea that the information the Russians could assist by anonymously releasing were thousands of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nWhat we actually learned in Papadopoulos\u2019s plea was that his dubious Russian sources had heard that the Kremlin had the emails. There is no indication that the Kremlin in fact had the emails; the Kremlin apparently provided no emails to Papadopoulos (or anyone else in Trump\u2019s orbit); and there is no evidence that the \u201cRussia-linked\u201d people to whom Papadopoulos spoke knew what they were talking about \u2014 it is at least as plausible that they were playing Papadopoulos.\n\nThe Use of a Media Report to \u2018Corroborate\u2019 Steele\n\nCommittee Democrats make a highly unlikely claim about the DOJ\u2019s controversial use in the FISA warrant applications of a Yahoo News report by journalist Michael Isikoff. The claim appears to be contradicted by both the aforementioned Grassley-Graham memo and by the Isikoff article itself.\n\nSpecifically, the Schiff memo denies the Republican claim that the DOJ tried to corroborate Steele\u2019s allegations by relying on Isikoff\u2019s media story, dated September 23, 2016. Rather, Schiff says the Isikoff report was mentioned for a righteous purpose: \u201cto inform the Court of Page\u2019s public denial of his suspected meetings in Russia\u201d (with Sechin and Divyekin). The memo further claims that the FISA application cited another news story along these lines, but that the Nunes memo withheld this detail.\n\nSchiff\u2019s version has two problems.\n\n1) While it is true (as noted above) that Page denies meeting Sechin and Divyekin, it is not true that this denial is reported in Isikoff\u2019s article. Instead, Isikoff reported that Page \u201cdeclined repeated requests to comment for this story.\u201d He added that, while in Moscow in July 2016, \u201cPage declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip\u201d \u2014 not that he denied doing so. Isikoff, who is a superb reporter, also took pains to explain that it was merely \u201calleged\u201d that Page had met with high-ranking Russians \u2014 that is, the meetings had not been confirmed. But there is nothing in Isikoff\u2019s article about Page himself denying that they occurred. It is therefore hard to understand why the DOJ would, as Schiff suggests, include the article as a way of informing the court that Page denied the meetings.\n\n2) Schiff\u2019s version is contradicted by the Grassley-Graham memo, which quotes the FISA warrant application. Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham recount (memo, p. 3) that \u201cthe FISA applications note the existence of\u201d Isikoff\u2019s article, \u201cwhich in particular contained some of the same dossier information about Mr. Page compiled by Mr. Steele and on which the FBI relied in its application.\u201d The senators then quote from the FISA application, which said:\n\nGiven that the information contained in the September 23rd news article generally matches the information about Page that [Steele] discovered during his/her research, [two lines redacted.] The FBI does not believe that [Steele] directly provided this information to the press.\u201d [Emphasis added, brackets in original.]\n\nThe senators\u2019 memo strongly suggests that Nunes is right and Schiff is wrong: The Isikoff article was used precisely because, to quote the DOJ again, it \u201cgenerally matched\u201d Steele\u2019s allegations about Page. In effect, the DOJ was using Steele to corroborate Steele.\n\nSchiff\u2019s Defense of Bruce Ohr\n\nSchiff\u2019s attack on the Nunes memo for referring to top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr\u2019s connections with Steele is utterly unpersuasive \u2014 a \u201cHow dare you\u201d argument that rests on Schiff\u2019s description of Ohr as \u201ca well-respected career professional.\u201d\n\nRepublicans did not attack Ohr personally or belittle his law-enforcement credentials. To the contrary, the Nunes memo argued that because Ohr was a high-ranking official \u2014 the right-hand of Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was effectively running DOJ \u2014 it should have been disclosed to the court that (a) Ohr was meeting with Steele about the anti-Trump project; (b) Steele had told Ohr in September (i.e., before the first FISA application) that he \u201cwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president\u201d; and (c) Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie Ohr, was a Russia expert at Fusion who was collaborating with Steele on the dossier. If Schiff thinks that is unreasonable, I expect most people will disagree.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the Schiff memo does more to harm than advance the Democrats\u2019 defense of the Obama administration and the use of the FISA process by the FBI and the DOJ.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rich Lowry", "body": "Gina Haspel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CIA/Handout via  Haspel\u2019s record should be an asset, not a roadblock, to her appointment \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPresident Donald Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director is about to experience a good Borking.\n\nNo one doubts her professionalism, and she\u2019s been endorsed by Obama intelligence officials. Yet Gina Haspel\u2019s long career at the agency, including extensive work undercover in the field, is getting blotted out by her reported involvement in the CIA\u2019s black-site interrogation program, which has become a warrant to say anything about her.\n\nHer critics assert she should be in jail, and the New York Times editorial page wrote about her nomination under the headline \u201cHaving a Torturer Lead the C.I.A.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in demagogic attacks on anyone associated with our national-security apparatus, Senator Rand Paul calls Haspel \u201cthe head cheerleader for waterboarding,\u201d and claims she mocked a detainee for his drooling. The only problem is that this anecdote comes from a book by a contractor who worked with the CIA, James Mitchell, and it describes a man, not a woman, making the comment.\n\nTheir factual accuracy aside, the attacks on Haspel are ahistorical in that they ignore the context of the CIA program, and unfair insofar as they portray her as a remorselessly cruel prime mover behind it.\n\nThe interrogation program began when al-Qaida operative Abu Zubaydah was captured in March 2002. At the time, we believed another attack was imminent, and preventing it had an urgency fueled by raw memories of an event that was literally yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nIn light of this pervasive feeling, it\u2019s unsurprising that a broad political consensus supported doing what was necessary to get information from captured al-Qaida leaders. The CIA repeatedly briefed select congressional leaders, especially the top Republicans and Democrats on the intelligence committees. By all accounts, the program met with assent.\n\nThe interrogation program wasn\u2019t a rogue operation. It was approved at the highest level of the U.S. government, and the CIA sought, and got, explicit legal approval from the Department of Justice.\n\nThe interrogation program wasn\u2019t a rogue operation. It was approved at the highest level of the U.S. government, and the CIA sought, and got, explicit legal approval from the Department of Justice.\n\nHaspel is connected in the press to the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, although the CIA hasn\u2019t confirmed her participation in the oversight of any particular detainee and insists much of the reporting about her work in this period is erroneous.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider Zubaydah\u2019s case. He was not a detainee who had nothing to tell us, as he is often portrayed by critics of the CIA. Shortly after his capture, he identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of 9/11. CIA documents say that \u201cAbu Zubaydah provided information on al-Qa\u2019ida activities, plans, capabilities, and relationships,\u201d as well as information on \u201cits leadership structure, including personalities, decision-making processes, training and tactics.\u201d\n\nThe enhanced interrogations were brutal. Zubaydah was struck, placed in stress positions, confined in small boxes and repeatedly waterboarded. During one session, he became unresponsive. By any standard, this was extreme and right up to the legal line.\n\nThe CIA didn\u2019t learn of any planned attack in the U.S.; it did become confident that Zubaydah wasn\u2019t holding back anything about one. From his capture to his transfer to the Department of Defense on September 5, 2006, information from him produced 766 intelligence reports.\n\nIn the cold light of day, we would have handled all of this differently. The Bush administration shouldn\u2019t have been as aggressive in its legal interpretations. We should have realized that we had more time to play with, and that the program itself would become a black mark on our reputation overseas and such a domestic flashpoint that we would basically lose all ability to interrogate detainees (droning became the preferred alternative).\n\nBut this was a national failing, and at a time when we understandably believed we were in a race to prevent another atrocity on our shores. To punish Gina Haspel more than\u00a015 years later\u00a0for doing what her country asked her to do, and in response to what she was told were lawful orders, would be a travesty and a disgrace.\n\nBut so were the confirmation hearings of Robert Bork.\n\n\u00a9 2018 by King Features   Lowry is the editor of National Review.

Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon devoted considerable resources to promoting Trumpist candidates who supposedly shared President Trump\u2019s worldview and parroted his rhetoric, including anti-globalism, economic nationalism, and crude insults of \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians. Those schemes largely came to naught.\n\n\nThe intellectual effort to craft or divine a coherent Trumpist ideology didn\u2019t fare much better. Just over a year ago, Julius Krein launched a new journal called American Affairs to \u201cgive the Trump movement some intellectual heft,\u201d as Politico put it. As I wrote at the time, American Affairs\u2019 dilemma was that by associating itself with Trump, it would be forced to either defend the incoherence of his behavior or break with him to defend its own consistency.\n\nSix months later, after the debacle of Trump\u2019s response to the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., Krein recanted his support for the president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left, there\u2019s an enormous investment in the idea that Trump isn\u2019t a break with conservatism but the apotheosis of it. This is a defensible, or at least understandable, claim if you believe conservatism has always been an intellectually vacuous bundle of racial and cultural resentments. But if that were the case, Commentary magazine\u2019s Noah Rothman recently noted, you would not see so many mainstream and consistent conservatives objecting to Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nIntellectuals and ideologically committed journalists on the left and right have a natural tendency to see events through the prism of ideas. Trump presents an insurmountable challenge to such approaches because, by his own admission, he doesn\u2019t consult any serious and coherent body of ideas for his decisions. He trusts his instincts.\n\nTrump has said countless times that he thinks his gut is a better guide than the brains of his advisers. He routinely argues that the presidents and policymakers who came before him were all fools and weaklings. That\u2019s narcissism, not ideology, talking.\n\nEven the \u201cideas\u201d that he has championed consistently \u2014 despite countervailing evidence and expertise \u2014 are grounded not in arguments but in instincts. He dislikes regulations because, as a businessman, they got in his way. He dislikes trade because he has a childish, narrow understanding of what \u201cwinning\u201d means. Foreigners are ripping us off. Other countries are laughing at us. He doesn\u2019t actually care about, let alone understand, the arguments suggesting that protectionism can work. Indeed, he reportedly issued his recent diktat on steel tariffs in a fit of pique over negative media coverage and the investigation into Russian election interference. His administration was wholly unprepared for the announcement.\n\nNews emanating from the White House is always more understandable once you accept that Trumpist policy is downstream of Trump\u2019s personality.\n\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s attack on his attorney general\u2019s conduct as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d makes no political, legal, or ideological sense, but it is utterly predictable as an expression of Trump\u2019s view that loyalty to Trump should trump everything else.\n\nLikewise, his blather about skipping due process to \u201ctake the guns\u201d was politically bizarre but perfectly consistent with his poor impulse control and well-established tendency to tell people in the room with him what they want to hear.\n\nAnd, of course, his decision to promote and protect his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is purely psychological. Giving Kushner the responsibility to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for all time seems like the premise of a sitcom \u2014 yet is wholly congruent with Trump\u2019s management style.\n\nStill, many of Trump\u2019s biggest fans stick by him, mirroring Trump\u2019s mode of thinking and discovering ever more extravagant ways to explain or rationalize the president\u2019s behavior. (Krein\u2019s abandonment of Trump was an exception to the rule.) When Trump attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University tweeted his support, floating the idea that Sessions was an anti-Trump deep cover operative who endorsed Trump to undermine his presidency from within.\n\n\nIt seems Trumpism is infectious. If this infection becomes a pandemic \u2014 a cult of personality \u2014 one could fairly call Trumpism a movement. But psychology would still be the best way to understand it.\n\n(C) 2018 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY,   Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David French", "body": "Barack Obama delivers a statement after the Supreme Court blocked his illegal immigrant work permit plan, June 23, 2016.

When the opposing party occupies the White House, the Founders\u2019 vision of sovereign states and a limited federal government suddenly has an alluring appeal. Retake the White House, and it becomes time for the states to fall into line.\n\nCalifornia progressives have been loving federalism lately. While they\u2019ve pushed through a number of policies specifically designed to fight the Trump administration, few have garnered more headlines than the state\u2019s comprehensive statutory scheme to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The statutes don\u2019t block the federal government from enforcing federal law. They do, however, limit the extent to which federal authorities can depend on California citizens and state officials to affirmatively assist in executing the federal mission.\n\n\nSo that\u2019s federalism, right? While it\u2019s clear that states can\u2019t nullify federal laws, in the absence of conflicting federal statutes, can\u2019t California enact immigration policies that advance its own, unique state interests?\n\nIt appears not. Ironically enough, thanks to a determined litigation effort by Obama\u2019s Department of Justice, progressives handed the Trump administration a legal club that will likely beat down California\u2019s attempt to go its own way: A Supreme Court precedent. And yesterday, the Trump DOJ picked up that club, suing California to block its new statutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, way back in 2012 the two parties had very different views of federalism. The GOP wanted to dissent from Obama\u2019s immigration policies, and the Obama administration very much wanted to impose its own version of uniform, national rule. The state of Arizona, facing multiple challenges from a swelling illegal-immigrant population, enacted a statute that essentially created enhanced penalties for illegal immigration and granted state officials new powers to enforce existing federal law.\n\nIn other words, it was the mirror image of the California effort. Arizona\u2019s statute didn\u2019t conflict with federal law; it was just different from federal law, reflecting the state\u2019s sovereign priorities. The Obama administration sued, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court. On June 25, 2012, the Court struck down the key provisions of the Arizona law. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion, and it was sweeping in its language and scope.\n\nEssentially, Kennedy ruled that Congress \u2014 through its comprehensive statutory scheme \u2014 had \u201coccupied the field\u201d of alien registration and thus \u201ceven complementary state regulation is impermissible.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This so-called \u201cfield preemption\u201d reflects \u201ca congressional decision to foreclose any state regulation in the area [preempted], even if it is parallel to federal standards.\u201d After waxing eloquent about the importance of immigration in the American national story, Kennedy\u2019s opinion goes on to conclude that \u201cArizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration . . . but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, and it was classic Scalia. It surveyed relevant American constitutional history, discussed the nature of state sovereignty, and reached a conclusion that California would almost certainly like to cling to today:\n\nIn light of the predominance of federal immigration restrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the States\u2019 traditional role in regulating immigration \u2014 and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so. I accept as a given that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution when (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or (2) it conflicts with federal regulation \u2014 when, for example, it admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or excludes those whom federal regulation would admit.\n\nUnder the Kennedy framework, California law likely goes down in flames. If Arizona\u2019s efforts at creating complementary policy were impermissible, then California faces an immense challenge justifying a policy that is quite explicitly designed to undermine federal enforcement. According to Kennedy\u2019s reasoning (adopted by Roberts, Breyer, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor), federal statutes are precisely designed to accomplish national goals \u2014 goals that no state can undermine.\n\nTrue federalism could temper polarization by empowering self-governance. Cynical, fake federalism divides us with its dishonesty.\n\nScalia\u2019s reasoning, firmly rooted in American constitutional tradition, represents federalism as the Founders intended. The Founders recognized that America wasn\u2019t a single sovereign entity but rather a unified nation comprising multiple distinct and different states with their own sovereign interests. The federal government is supreme, but in the absence of conflict with federal law, the states have considerable discretion to fashion their own policies. They are, after all, different in history, politics, geography, and culture.\n\n\nBut the Founders\u2019 vision is largely lost. Federalism has become just another constitutional means to an ideological end, a way of accomplishing locally what you can\u2019t accomplish nationally. It\u2019s a defense mechanism when you\u2019re out of power and an annoyance when you\u2019re in power. That\u2019s why the Obama administration sued Arizona, and the Trump administration is suing California. That\u2019s why the same progressives who cheered the Obama administration\u2019s SCOTUS victory in 2012 will complain bitterly if the Trump administration wins its suit in 2018. And that\u2019s why all too many conservatives who supported Arizona now want to bring down the hammer on California.\n\nIt will take more time and more pain before Americans on both sides (hopefully) remember the wisdom of the Founders and understand that centralized control of an ideologically diverse and polarized nation is not only elusive but destructive. True federalism could temper polarization by empowering self-governance. Cynical, fake federalism divides us with its dishonesty. I\u2019m with Scalia. California should be able go its own way. But will Californians support Arizona\u2019s right to go its own way when and if the roles are once again reversed?

Peterson is fond of reminding us, the oldest theme of storytelling is a conflict between something cruel and masculine, and something kind and feminine. In the literature of North American political journalism, this has certainly been the long-favored prism for portraying Canadian\u2013American relations, particularly these days, when the leaders of both countries seem such on-the-nose stereotypes.\n\nIn the age of Trump vs. Trudeau, a plot point that journalists of both nations have gripped especially tight is the supposed stampede of Third World refugees from the United States into Canada. Reuters was but the latest to produce a feature story on the phenomenon, reporting on Monday that \u201cmore than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how abundant they are in color and anecdote, these stories rarely divert from a few predetermined conclusions: that Trump is a frightening racist, that American-based refugees are right to flee, and that if Canada is guilty of anything, it\u2019s caring too much.\n\nIf one exerts minimal effort to get off this tendentious narrative track, however, the tale becomes far less morally tidy.\n\nTo begin, the fact that some people illegally cross the border from the United States into Canada does not suggest that the continent is descending into a Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2013esque dystopia. Illegal crossings are a persistent logistical problem that has dogged the two countries for decades. Every year, somewhere between hundreds and thousands of American-based persons sneak across the Canadian border, and certain persistent trends, such as Somalis crossing the Minnesota-Manitoba line, experience peaks and valleys that do not tend to correlate with developments. During the 2015\u201316 election cycle, for instance, 294 Somalis crossed the border before Donald Trump even won the Republican nomination.\n\nAttempts to chronicle larger trends are hampered by unclear data (as is often the case with Canadian statistics). The \u201cmore than 20,000\u201d figure cited by Reuters is based on Royal Canadian Mounted Police \u201capprehensions\u201d of border-crossers in 2017, for which no previous data exist, but other, vaguer data do support the thesis that there\u2019s been a significant \u201cTrump Bump\u201d of American-originated refugees applying for amnesty at Canadian immigration offices at both \u201cland\u201d (i.e., border) and \u201cinland\u201d (inside the country) locations. Under the terms of a 2004 treaty, American-based persons are not supposed to apply for refugee status in Canada at all, though the agreement has exemptions and can be dodged altogether by entering Canada illegally. The combined land and inland total was 5,005 in 2015, followed by 8,990 in 2016 and 18,190 in 2017, though that 2015 figure shows that Canada would still be struggling with a substantial inflow of American asylum seekers even with a Democrat in the White House.\n\n\n\n\nFor many American-based refugees, Canada has always been the ultimate destination, with the United States understood as a temporary stop along the way. Now we have the so-called New Underground Railroad, in which migrants from Asia, Africa, or the Middle East enter this hemisphere through Latin America and then make an arduous trek upward until they arrive in the Great White North.\n\nCanada is an attractive endpoint for refugees for a number of reasons. The main one can sound insensitive when stated bluntly, because it inevitably involves passing moral judgement on such frequently desperate people: Basically, Canada is just fundamentally more lawless than the United States when it comes to immigration.\n\nOne should therefore be wary of the narrative, popular in some circles on both right and left, that Prime Minister Trudeau has exacerbated the refugee situation by posturing disingenuously, on social media and elsewhere, about Canadian generosity, when, supposedly, Canadian refugee law is actually quite tough \u2014 little different from America\u2019s.\n\nWhatever Canadian law says on paper, terrible follow-through ensures that Canada is, in fact, a very logical place for any refugee, including those of dubious claim or character, seeking comparatively easy treatment.\n\nIn reality, whatever Canadian law says on paper, terrible follow-through ensures that Canada is, in fact, a very logical place for any refugee, including those of dubious claim or character, seeking comparatively easy treatment. Global News has been reporting this week on just how spectacularly incompetent Canada\u2019s immigration bureaucracy is at deporting even the most brazenly unacceptable aliens, including a Sudanese man with 37 criminal convictions and a Palestinian terrorist deemed a \u201cdanger to the security of Canada\u201d \u2014 both of whom remain in the country more than a decade after ordered out.\n\nIllegal border-crossers aside, Canada welcomes thousands of ordinary refugee applicants to the country every year, yet the Canadian refugee-verification system has proven unable to process this steady intake, CBC News has reported. By Ottawa\u2019s own estimate, it may soon take eleven years for a refugee applicant to even get an initial hearing, and obviously longer should he choose to appeal an unfavorable ruling.\n\nIn a cynical concession to this fact, multiple levels of government have made staying in unprocessed refugee limbo a kind of de facto long-term visa of its own, with members of the class eligible to obtain work permits, use the Canadian public health-care system, and even collect welfare.\n\nCanada has made staying in unprocessed refugee limbo a kind of de facto long-term visa, with members of the class eligible to obtain work permits, use the Canadian public health-care system, and even collect welfare.\n\nAll of this creates a particularly powerful border-crossing incentive for refugees in the United States who have exhausted the limits of the American immigration system. This is very much the case with the large number of Haitians who have crossed into Quebec recently, migrants who are not fleeing \u201cTrump\u201d so much as his administration\u2019s decision to rescind a temporary deportation amnesty imposed by President Obama in the wake of that country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nWhen the executive branch offers a temporary amnesty for humanitarian purposes, as it has done repeatedly since Congress granted such powers in 1990, there is an implied obligation that those benefitting from this conditional right will be aware of its specific terms \u2014 in the case of the Haitians, the reality that their country would eventually rebuild to the point where their return could be morally justified. (The conclusion that Haiti is now safe enough to be deported to, incidentally, is one the Trudeau administration shares.) Over the decades, countless temporarily protected refugees in America have found ways to upgrade their immigration status to something more permanent, while others have failed and returned home. It is the rule of law, more than any uniquely sinister or sadistic president, that many of the border-crossers seek to flee.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose inclined to view North American politics as a simple morality fable may find none of this nuance compelling. If we rob refugees of all agency, individualism, and responsibility, and simply treat them as bit players in the grand drama of Donald Trump, Destroyer of Worlds, then it\u2019s easy to frame their plight as a crisis America has caused, and that generous, passive Canada is trying to cure.\n\n\nThose who believe there is some worth in a civilization whose compassion is managed through enforced standards of justice, procedure, and precedent will find the morality tale troubling for different reasons.

In a written response to questions from the New York Times, he said, \u201cI do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn a world in which journalists treated unfounded assumptions as just that, rather than headline news, Brennan\u2019s charges would have been dismissed.

In particular, the coverage on MSNBC and CNN consisted of highlighting the accusation, treating it as a proven fact, and then following up with panels in which others speculated as to what evidence might substantiate Brennan\u2019s charge, even though he had already admitted he had no such information.

When Brennan spoke of the Russians\u2019 having something on Trump, not one member of the panel asked the former Obama staffer whether his opinion was rooted in actual knowledge rather than pure speculation. Nor did many others ask that question over the course of a day in which Brennan\u2019s comment was among the most discussed stories.\n\nThat fits a pattern that applies to every stage of the Russian-collusion investigation.\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year into the Trump presidency and the appointment of Robert Mueller to lead a special investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, information about the subject is still scarce. Speculation about the dearth of knowledge regarding what happened or what exactly Mueller has discovered is understandable. But in most of the media, that lack of information hasn\u2019t stopped both reporters and commentators from jumping to conclusions about Trump\u2019s being in big trouble every time even the smallest tidbit about the probe is aired.\n\nUntil Mueller finishes his work and issues a report, we won\u2019t know what he has found. Like virtually every other special counsel, armed with an unlimited budget and near plenary powers to chase down any potential crime no matter how tenuous its link to his original brief, Mueller is taking his time. But after his indictments of Russians for their activities, the only crimes committed by Americans that he appears to have found get us nowhere near a finding of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. While there were scattered contacts, there is still no evidence they cooperated on anything. At this point, and since the charges against the Russians were not tied to those against Americans with whom they might have colluded, it is not unreasonable to think that there may be none.\n\nWhat we do know is that President Trump does appear to have a soft spot for the Putin regime and seems unwilling to listen to the counsel of those who urge him to be more guarded in his statements about the subject.\n\nIs that enough, as Brennan seems to think, to fuel a charge that he might be under some sort of pressure from Russia?\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious answer is no. Trump has been consistent throughout his campaign about believing in better relations with Russia and for his lack of outrage about its foreign mischief making. This is a terrible idea, as Moscow has proved time and again over the last year, since thwarting U.S. interests is, along with reassembling the old Soviet empire, one of the keynotes of Putin\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nYet you don\u2019t have to be a Russian agent of influence to back policies or gestures that are favorable to Putin. After all, President Obama made the same foolish gesture for which Trump has been lambasted this week: calling to congratulate the authoritarian leader after winning a rigged election in which his victory was foreordained. Obama began his first term with a comical effort to \u201creset\u201d relations and continued to defend Russia. He mocked Mitt Romney for declaring Russia to be America\u2019s prime geostrategic foe in their 2012 foreign-policy debate, a stance that is Democratic-party orthodoxy now that d\u00e9tente with Putin is identified with Trump. Just as bad, in an infamous hot-mic moment, he told Putin\u2019s puppet Dmitry Medvedev to tell \u201cVladimir\u201d that he could be more \u201cflexible\u201d in bowing to Russian demands after he was reelected.\n\n\n\n\nNone of that constituted proof that Obama was in thrall to Putin. His belief in showing weakness to Russia was sincere. But Trump\u2019s sporadic continuation of this imprudent policy \u2014 for which Brennan was at least partially responsible \u2014 is assumed without proof as being prima facie evidence of treason, even though Trump has also done some things, such as his arming of Ukraine, to offend Putin.\n\n\nTheoretically, Brennan could be right. But to assume without proof that the only possible motive for a policy choice is a criminal connection isn\u2019t journalism. At best, it\u2019s a highly partisan talking point. At worst, it\u2019s a smear.\n\nIt used to be that partisan assumptions fueled by pure speculation and unaccompanied by proof didn\u2019t pass the smell test at any major network or newspaper. The fact that political smears of this sort have now become not only possible but also normal says a lot about the way animus for the Trump administration has distorted much of the media\u2019s judgment and coverage.

He prefaced the remark by saying, \u201cEach successive administration has said somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s remarks manage to combine self-pity with contempt. They are unhelpful to Democrats trying to get elected. And they articulate what is becoming the central myth of the liberal elite: We are beautiful and successful because we\u2019re morally superior. Clinton\u2019s remarks connect the expanding GDP of her constituents to their commitment to diversity, and the economic trouble of the red states to their supposed opposition to \u201cwomen having jobs\u201d and civil rights. She seems to confirm the observation made by Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen at First Things:\n\nOur ruling class is more blinkered than that of the ancien r\u00e9gime. Unlike the aristocrats of old, they insist that there are only egalitarians at their exclusive institutions. They loudly proclaim their virtue and redouble their commitment to diversity and inclusion. They cast bigoted rednecks as the great impediment to perfect equality \u2014 not the elite institutions from which they benefit.\n\nEffectively, Clinton admitted she disclaims any responsibility to the states she lost, arguing that they deserve their lower economic status on account of their wickedness.

Yet, the press barely notices.\n\n\n\tRest assured: If a Republican administration had used unverifiable hearsay from a patently suspect agent of the Republican presidential candidate to gull the FISA court into granting a warrant to spy on an associate of the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign, it would be covered as the greatest political scandal in a half-century.\n\n\n\tInstead, it was the other way around. The Grassley-Graham memo corroborates the claims in the Nunes memo: The Obama Justice Department and FBI used anonymously sourced, Clinton-campaign generated innuendo to convince the FISA court to issue surveillance warrants against Carter Page, and in doing so, they concealed the Clinton campaign\u2019s role. Though the Trump campaign had cut ties with Page shortly before the first warrant was issued in October 2016, the warrant application was based on wild allegations of a corrupt conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Moreover, the warrant meant the FBI could seize not only Page\u2019s forward-going communications but any past emails and texts he may have stored \u2014 i.e., his Trump campaign communications.\n\n\n\tWith its verification by the Grassley-Graham memo, the Nunes memo now has about a thousand times more corroboration than the Steele dossier, the basis of the heinous allegations used by the Justice Department and FBI to get the FISA warrants.\n\n\n\tWhat the Grassley-Graham memo tells us is that the Nunes memo, for all the hysteria about it, was tame. The Grassley-Graham memo tells us that we need not only a full-blown investigation of what possessed the Obama administration to submit such shoddy applications to the FISA court, but of how a judge \u2014 or perhaps as many as four judges \u2014 rationalized signing the warrants.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWe need full disclosure \u2014 the warrants, the applications, the court proceedings. No more games.\n\n\n\tSenators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are senior Republicans on the Judiciary Committee (which Grassley chairs, while Graham chairs a relevant subcommittee). As we\u2019ve previously detailed (in a two-part series, here and here), they composed their memo in support of a criminal referral recommending that dossier author Christopher Steele be investigated for making false statements to the FBI (which is a felony). Initially, the senators\u2019 memo was withheld, then it was released with extensive redactions because its contents were largely classified \u2014 covering submissions to the FISA court, the secret tribunal established by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But following the release of the Nunes memo \u2014 the memo prepared by Republican majority staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence led by Representative Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) \u2014 Senators Grassley and Graham stepped up their admirable efforts to get more information unsealed . . . so that the public can see it, even if the press prefers not to cover it.\n\n\n\tLast Friday, the Nunes memo asserted that the FBI and Justice Department had significantly relied on the unverified Steele dossier to obtain FISA warrants on Page. In the week that followed, House Intelligence Committee Democrats and their media echo chamber bleated about how things had been taken out of context, with some suggesting that there was plenty of other evidence to establish probable cause that Page was acting as a Russian agent. (See my column last Sunday responding to claims by Representative Jerrold Nadler, here.) It was even implied that Nunes  Co. had deceptively reported committee testimony by the FBI\u2019s then deputy director Andrew McCabe that the Steele dossier was essential to this probable-cause showing.\n\n\n\tWe\u2019re not hearing much of that now. No wonder. Here\u2019s the Grassley-Graham memo on the critical first FISA application, the basis for the warrant granted on October 21, 2016:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe bulk of the application consists of allegations against Page that were disclosed to the FBI by Mr. Steele and are also outlined in the Steele dossier. The application appears to contain no additional information corroborating the dossier allegations against Mr. Page, although it does cite to a news article that appears to be sourced to Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier.\n\n\n\n\tWe\u2019ll come to the news article \u2014 the stupefying circular attempt to corroborate Steele with Steele. For the moment, suffice it to say that the senators have confirmed the Nunes memo\u2019s account, except with much more information than House Republicans were able to include. Information such as this:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen asked at the March 2017 briefing [of Judiciary Committee leaders] why the FBI relied on the dossier in the FISA applications absent meaningful corroboration \u2014 and in light of the highly political motives surrounding its creation \u2014 then-Director [James] Comey stated that the FBI included the dossier allegations about Carter Page in the FISA applications because Mr. Steele himself was considered reliable due to his past work with the Bureau. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\tOn this score, Grassley and Graham quote directly from the warrant applications: \u201cBased on [Steele\u2019s] previous reporting history with the FBI whereby [Steele] provided reliable information to the FBI, the FBI believes [Steele\u2019s] reporting to be credible.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\tI cannot stress enough how irregular this is. It is why there is abundant reason to demand that the judge explain his or her rationale for granting the warrant.\n\n\n\tAs I outlined at greater length last week (here, in section C), in applying for a warrant, the government must establish the reliability of the informants who witnessed the alleged facts claimed to support a probable-cause finding. Steele was not one of those witnesses. He is not the source of the facts. He is the purveyor of the sources \u2014 anonymous Russians, much of whose alleged information is based on hearsay, sometimes multiple steps removed from direct knowledge. Steele has not been in Russia since his cover as a British spy was blown nearly 20 years ago. He has sources, who have sources, who have sources . . . \u00a0and so on. None of his information is better than third-hand; most of it is more attenuated than that.\n\n\n\tFor purposes of justifying a warrant, it does not matter that, in a totally unrelated investigation (involving corruption at FIFA, the international soccer organization), the FBI judged that the hearsay information provided by Steele, then a British agent, checked out. In his anti-Trump research, Steele could not verify his sources. Furthermore, he was now a former foreign intelligence officer who was then working for private clients \u2014 which is the advocacy business, not the search-for-truth business.\n\n\n\tA judge would need to know whether Steele\u2019s sources were reliable, not whether Steele himself was reliable.\n\n\n\tLet that sink in, then think about this contrast: No actual FBI agent, no matter how renowned, would be able to get a judicial warrant based solely on his own reliability as an investigator. Jim Comey, despite having a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 geometrically more impressive than Steele\u2019s, including Senate confirmations to some of federal law-enforcement\u2019s loftiest positions, would not be given a warrant based on representations to the court that the FBI, the Justice Department, the president, and the Senate all attested to his impeccable reliability.\n\n\n\tThe only reliability that counts is the reliability of the factual informants, not of the investigator who purports to channel the informants. The judge wants to know why the court should believe the specific factual claims: Was the informant truly in a position to witness what is alleged, and if so, does the informant have a track record of providing verified information? The track record of the investigator who locates the sources is beside the point. A judge would need to know whether Steele\u2019s sources were reliable, not whether Steele himself was reliable.\n\n\n\tThis is not esoterica. In the investigations biz, this is so basic that to call it \u201cWarrants 101\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice. If you don\u2019t have witnesses with verifiable, first-hand knowledge, you don\u2019t have anything. Without them, to borrow Director Comey\u2019s notorious dictum, no reasonable prosecutor would bring a warrant application to a federal judge, and no reasonable judge would issue a warrant.\n\n\n\tIf there is no credible sourcing for the factual allegations in the warrant application, that is a probable-cause deficiency that could not have been cured by the reputation of the purveyor of the sources, no matter how sterling. That said, it is obvious that the less identifiable and reliable the informants are, the greater is the government\u2019s obligation to be transparent in conveying the investigator\u2019s potential biases. The Obama administration\u2019s malfeasance on this point is breathtaking.\n\n\n\tGraham and Grassley recount:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe FBI noted to a vaguely limited extent the political origins of the dossier. In footnote 8 [of the first warrant application, apparently repeated in the subsequent applications] the FBI stated that the dossier information was compiled pursuant to the direction of a law firm who had hired an \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d \u2014 now known as Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS.\n\n\n\n\tThe fact that Fusion GPS\u2019s ultimate client was the Clinton campaign was never disclosed in any of the warrant applications, which ran well beyond June 2017, when the last 90-day extension was granted. Patently, so much struggle and circumlocution went into crafting this \u201cvaguely limited\u201d footnote that we can only conclude the decision not to disclose the Clinton connection was the subject of much deliberation.\n\n\n\tThe Clinton campaign\u2019s sponsorship was not publicly disclosed until October 2017. Before then, it is virtually certain that, to the extent the FISA court and Congress were told of the \u201cpolitical origins\u201d of the dossier, these were benignly presented as bipartisan concerns about Donald Trump. That is, the Steele dossier phase of Fusion\u2019s anti-Trump project was conflated with the earlier phase, when \u2014 as Simpson has testified \u2014 Fusion did documentary research on Trump during the Republican primaries for a conservative media outlet. It was not disclosed that, by the time Steele was hired to do the dossier, the project was backed exclusively by the Democratic party and the Clinton campaign.\n\n\n\tManifestly, that was a material fact. If a prosecutor withheld an arguably exculpatory fact of this degree of significance, it could get a conviction reversed. As some have observed, a public company would likely face a stock fraud prosecution for concealing a fact so patently material from its required SEC reports.\n\n\n\tThe Clinton-campaign tie should have been disclosed from the beginning. Now, consider what happened as the surveillance continued for the better part of a year.\n\n\n\tIn late October 2016, shortly after the first warrant was issued, the FBI terminated its relationship with Steele because he lied to the Bureau about his contacts with the media. But the Justice Department did not report this to the FISA court. Instead, when the first warrant expired in January 2017, the FBI and Justice Department sought its renewal by, again, relying on the credibility of the guy they\u2019d booted for lying. In another lawyerly footnote, they told the FISA court that Steele had been terminated not because he lied but because he was guilty of \u201cunauthorized disclosure of information to the press.\u201d\n\n\n\tBut that was not the half of it. Steele\u2019s agreement with the FBI was that he would not communicate with the press. He made that agreement and then communicated with the press anyway \u2014 which showed he was unreliable, notwithstanding the FBI\u2019s continued insistence to the contrary. He hadn\u2019t just flouted the agreement by speaking to the press, though; he had clearly lied about doing so.\n\n\n\tBy mid-September 2016, at Fusion\u2019s direction and even before the first FISA warrant was issued, Steele had spoken with a plethora of Clinton-friendly press outlets. As a result, Yahoo News published a news story by Michael Isikoff on September 23, which reported precisely the information that Steele had given to the FBI about Page: that he\u2019d supposedly met in Moscow with two top Russian operatives and discussed the lifting of sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\tHow could the FBI and Justice Department not have known that Steele was the source for this story? Isikoff explicitly stated that his account of Page\u2019s activities was set forth in \u201cintelligence reports\u201d that were in the possession of \u201cU.S. officials.\u201d Plainly, the FBI was privy to intelligence reports in the government\u2019s possession \u2014 the purported \u201cintelligence\u201d reports Steele had provided as well as any others. Had there been another intel report from a different source who happened to provide the same exact information Steele had provided, not only would the FBI have known about it; the Bureau would have touted it to the FISA court as critical corroboration of Steele\u2019s anonymous sources.\n\n\n\tTo the contrary, the FISA court was told: \u201cThe FBI does not believe that [Steele] directly provided this information to the press.\u201d I\u2019ve emphasized \u201cdirectly\u201d to highlight how curious this assertion is. Ostensibly, the Bureau seems to have been saying that Steele was not the source \u2014 meaning that there must have been another source, yet one the Bureau had not managed to identify even though this mystery source was described in intelligence reports accessible to the Bureau.\n\n\n\tOn the other hand, what does \u201cdirectly\u201d mean? By using that qualifier, was the Bureau conceding that Steele might have provided information to the press indirectly \u2013 i.e., through an intermediary? But that would make no sense: What would be the point of citing the Isikoff article as corroboration for Steele if Steele had been Isikoff\u2019s source, even if indirectly?\n\n\n\tIt is not good, one way or the other. Either Steele lied to the FBI about speaking to the press, or the FBI consciously avoided learning that Steele had spoken to Isikoff and then speculated to the court that Steele was probably not Isikoff\u2019s source. Either way, Steele\u2019s credibility was a huge issue. That put in doubt the FBI\u2019s vouching for his reliability, which in turn made disclosure of the Clinton campaign\u2019s sponsorship of his dossier even more imperative.\n\n\n\tOr how about this: Steele gave a published interview to Mother Jones in late October 2016, after promising not to speak to the media. In trying to soft-peddle the palpable unreliability Steele had thus exhibited, the FBI rationalized that he was acting not out of dishonesty but in a fit of pique over Director Comey\u2019s pre-election announcement that the FBI had reopened the Clinton emails investigation.\n\n\n\tThis, of course, is the announcement that Clinton partisans blame for their candidate\u2019s loss. So, according to the Bureau, Steele\u2019s pro-Clinton partisanship induced him to such outrage over Comey\u2019s announcement that he was moved to violate his agreement with the FBI. Wouldn\u2019t you think it might then occur to the Bureau and the Justice Department that maybe, just maybe, they ought to let the court in on that teeny detail about the Clinton campaign\u2019s being the sponsor of Steele\u2019s dossier?\n\n\n\tNope. Instead they kept mum and they kept telling the court Steele was perfectly reliable.\n\n\n\tIn fact, they kept telling the FISA court he was reliable even after Steele himself admitted to a British court that his dossier wasn\u2019t at all reliable.\n\n\n\tWhat\u2019s that? Am I kidding? No.\n\n\n\tTruth is a defense to libel. Suffice it to say, it was not Steele\u2019s defense.\n\n\n\tEven though there was still no meaningful corroboration of Steele\u2019s sources after months of investigation, even though Steele had lied to them, the FBI and Justice Department represented again and again, in April and June 2017, that the FISA court could confidently bank on Steele\u2019s reliability. By early 2017, however, Steele was being sued for libel in Britain, among other places, by people accused of misconduct in the dossier.\n\n\n\tTruth is a defense to libel. Suffice it to say, it was not Steele\u2019s defense.\n\n\n\tIn May 2017, as I have detailed (here), Steele was required to respond to interrogatories. He emphasized that his dossier allegations were \u201craw intelligence\u201d that was \u201cunverified\u201d and \u201cwarranted investigation.\u201d He further described his reports as \u201climited intelligence\u201d that described mere \u201cindications\u201d of \u201cpossible\u201d coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. He was not in a position to vouch for the accuracy of what he\u2019d been told, he explained; he passed it along because it needed further investigation.\n\n\n\tYet, far from reporting Steele\u2019s retreat to the FISA court, Grassley and Graham report that the FBI and Justice Department continued vouching for the reliability of his allegations.\n\n\n\tBeyond all that, we now learn through the senators\u2019 memo, and some follow-up reporting, that two longtime Clinton cronies, Cody Shearer and Sidney Blumenthal, fed their own anti-Trump dossier to Steele, through a State Department official, Jonathan Winer. In the fall of 2016, Steele, while working on his Clinton-funded project, reported this Clinton-crony information to the FBI.\n\n\n\tStill, the FBI and Justice Department elected not to tell the FISA court that the Clinton campaign was paying for Steele\u2019s unverified, unverifiable anti-Trump research.\n\n\n\tI spent many months assuring people that nothing like this could ever happen \u2014 that the FBI and Justice Department would not countenance the provision to the FISA court of uncorroborated allegations of heinous misconduct. When Trump enthusiasts accused them of rigging the process, I countered that they probably had not even used the Steele dossier. If the Justice Department had used it in writing a FISA warrant application, I insisted that the FBI would independently verify any important facts presented to the court, make any disclosures that ought in fairness be made so the judge could evaluate the credibility of the sources, and compellingly demonstrate probable cause before alleging that an American was a foreign agent.\n\n\n\tI was wrong.\n\n\n\t\u2014 Andrew C.

If you are a federal law-enforcement agent with a comfy desk chair, you probably cannot imagine a more attractive anticrime program than gun control. Gun dealers have federal licenses, and they have to apply for them: You don\u2019t have to go tracking them down \u2014 they come to you. They fill out paperwork. They generally operate from fixed addresses with regular business hours. Convenient! What you have is the power of political interposition, which is a mild form of terrorism.

Sometimes, you have to go so far as to pick up the phone.\nAs was reported on Friday, the FBI had been alerted that a particular pasty-faced virgin down in Florida was probably going to shoot up his old school. He had put up social-media posts to that effect, cleverly shielding his identity from the steely-eyed G-men by signing his legal name to those public threats. The epigones of J. Edgar Hoover may not be Sherlock Holmes, but presumably they can read, and some public-minded citizen took some screen shots and sent them to the FBI.\nThe FBI of course did what the relevant authorities did in the case of Omar Mateen, the case of Nidal Hasan, the case of Adam Lanza: nothing.\nWe could replace these guys with trained monkeys, if we could train monkeys to be self-important.\nThe FBI has \u2018protocols\u2019 for handling specific credible threats of that sort, \u2018protocol\u2019 here being a way of saying, \u2018Pick up the phone and call the local field office or, if we really want to get wild, the local police.\u2019\nThe Friday press conference on that little oversight was a masterpiece of modern bureaucracy. The FBI has \u201cprotocols\u201d for handling specific credible threats of that sort, \u201cprotocol\u201d here being a way of saying, \u201cPick up the phone and call the local field office or, if we really want to get wild, the local police.\u201d \u201cThe protocol was not followed,\u201d the FBI bureaucrats explained.

It went from being radioactive to a \u201cnothingburger.\u201d\n\n\n\tThe obvious conclusion is cynical: Cry Armageddon to prevent its release, then, after the release, resort to yawns to downplay its significance. An even more cynical interpretation is that Rod Rosenstein, James Comey, and other officials stridently objected to the release of the memo because they are named in it. Comey incoherently mocked the memo\u2019s purported unimportance even while listing all its deleterious effects and the crises that would  DOJ, and FBI resistance to the release of most documents connected to FISA-gate apparently originates with fears that information will either reveal Obama-administration efforts to surveille Trump officials during a campaign or will suggest that the impetus for the Mueller investigation came as a result of illegal activities and a concocted dossier \u2014 or both.\n\n\n\t2) Critics scream, \u201cCarter Page is no big deal.\u201d Aside from the easy retort that neither, initially, was a petty break-in at the Watergate complex, or rumors of supplying arms to distant guerillas in Central America, Page is a big deal for a variety of reasons.\n\n\n\tDemocrats allege that, given Carter Page\u2019s familiarity with Russians, it was logical for the Obama administration to use the dossier\u2019s references to him to substantiate FISA warrants.\n\n\n\tBut is not the opposite more likely true?\n\n\n\tHe was apparently known to intelligence agencies for years (supposedly under investigation variously by the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network), and he may have been the object of a 2014 FISA warrant. But such intelligence agents were never able to bring charges against him, and it appears he even cooperated with American intelligence in gathering info against the Russians. So why would the FBI and DOJ, suddenly in 2016, believe that mention of Page\u2019s name in an unverified opposition-research dossier warranted four FISA warrants to find wrongdoing?\n\n\n\tAfter all, if he was so well known to the FBI for so many years, during which they never charged him with being a Russian agent, and if the FBI nonetheless still regarded him as suspicious in 2016, why not simply go to a regular court to obtain a warrant to wiretap him? Such a\u00a0court, of course, would be less secretive, not known for a 99 percent approval rate, subject to far more deliberation, and less useful for surveilling Trump associates.\n\n\n\tA more likely supposition is that it\u00a0was not Page\u2019s past flirtations with the Russians (who supposedly dubbed him an \u201cidiot\u201d) that abruptly brought him back into the sights of the DOJ and FBI in 2016. Instead, it was his brief and minor relationship with Trump, and his appearance in a bogus dossier, that offered useful pretexts for court-ordered surveillance sweeps and indirect targeting of possible Trump associates.\n\n\n\tPage was simply a tool, to be surveilled in hopes of also sweeping up other names and information that might corroborate some shred of the dubious Steele dossier.\n\n\n\tPage was simply a tool, to be surveilled in hopes of also sweeping up other names and information that might corroborate some shred of the dubious Steele dossier. In that narrow sense, his name might as well have been Jones or Smith.\n\n\n\tSo far, all Carter Page has been found guilty of is momentarily working for the Trump campaign. His likely future lawsuits against Steele, Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign, the FBI, and the DOJ will probably follow a number of avenues.\n\n\n\t3) The New York Times and others strangely have claimed that the dossier-based FISA warrants were not the real basis of the Russian-collusion allegations, given, as the memo implies, that the FISA warrants were issued after FBI agent Peter Strzok had investigated George Papadopoulos, another minor Trump-campaign official of brief tenure.\n\n\n\tBut there has never been much connection between Page and Papadopoulos, as the Nunes memo also made clear. It is far more likely that Papadopoulos was written off as a dead-end functionary by Strzok, who also claimed to his paramour that there was likely nothing to be found at all in the Russian-collusion investigation. (And indeed Papadopoulos eventually pled guilty to making false statements, not collusion).\n\n\n\tMore likely, the collusion narrative gained ground only when the Steele dossier energized subsequent FISA requests in October and after the election, resulting in surveillance sweeps.\n\n\n\tMoreover, given the admissions by Strzok that he detested Trump and pondered ways of stopping him, and given that he and the FBI were never able to find Papadopoulos indictable on intended collusion charges, it is entirely unlikely that Papadopoulos prompted much of anything.\n\n\n\tIf he was not a dead end, then the argument could just as well be that an admittedly biased FBI agent hounded a minor, former Trump aide to find collusion, failed to find it, tried to turn him by the usual \u201cfalse statements\u201d perjury traps, and then Strzok or others around him leaked information about collusion investigations to damage the Trump campaign.\n\n\n\t4) Other than Andrew McCarthy of National Review, few have written about the FISA-court application(s) for surveillance of Trump-campaign officials that the FISA court rejected in June 2016, shortly before Trump was nominated as the Republican candidate.\n\n\n\tGiven that 99.97 percent of FISA requests are eventually granted, why exactly did a federal judge quite extraordinarily reject an Obama-administration FBI-DOJ request? Was it too \u201cbroad\u201d or insufficiently sourced in June? And what (or who) had changed by October, when a subsequent request was apparently granted? Was Strzok\u2019s July investigation of Papadopoulos better grounds to surveille Trump associates? Was the dossier (which apparently became known to the FBI as early as June or July 2016) initially used to obtain a warrant, to no avail? Or was the dossier instead used first in October, on a subsequent attempt, and in this case the FISA court granted the warrant?\n\n\n\t5) The talented, Trump-hating Peter Strzok was a sort of ubiquitous Zelig of FISA-gate and the most interesting of all the players named so far in the case. He probably convinced Comey to change the wording of his report on Hillary Clinton to prevent criminal liability. He may have started the whole shebang off by investigating George Papadopoulos. He texted away to his mistress and fellow FBI investigator Lisa Page the court secrets of the FBI and Mueller investigations, saying his gut sense was that there was \u201cno big there there\u201d to the entire effort. He interviewed Mike Flynn without Flynn\u2019s lawyer being present, and he probably compared Flynn\u2019s responses in that interview to FISA intercepts. He also met with Andrew McCabe to ponder ways to nullify the Trump ascendency. And unlike his far less talented superiors, he may have been careful to avoid strictly breaking the law.\n\n\n\t6) Even less has been written about the Obama administration\u2019s public attitude to the ongoing efforts of its own DOJ and FBI to seek FISA warrants to surveille Trump associates.\n\n\n\tTrump (apparently tipped off to prior FISA surveillance of his campaign associates) presciently tweeted on March 4:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\n\t\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\n\n\tMost of the establishment media insisted that Trump\u2019s tweet proved he was unhinged and paranoid. Former Obama White House officials issued haughty denials. Yet it is increasingly likely that Trump received good counter-intelligence on Obama-administration efforts that were either improper or illegal, and likely both.\n\n\n\tAn Obama communiqu\u00e9 that replied to Trump\u2019s accusation had the inadvertent effect of leaving even more doubt:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.\n\n\n\n\tSome have noted that the disavowal was carefully worded. First, it claims that no \u201cWhite House official\u201d interfered with any independent investigation. Fine, but does that mean other administration officials may have, or that a White House official may have interfered with investigations not deemed \u201cindependent\u201d? And does \u201cinterfered with\u201d include unmasked? Second, if neither President Obama nor a White House official ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen, does that mean that Obama-appointed DOJ and FBI officials might well have?\n\n\n\tThe problem may not be that the Obama White House itself had ordered surveillance of Trump associates, but rather than it sat back and enjoyed the wide berth granted to its DOJ and FBI investigators.\n\n\n\tIn support of the Obama denial, the Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler, to take one example, at the time issued an embarrassing second denial in a \u201cfact check\u201d that was soon made inoperative by leaks about ongoing FISA-warranted surveillance of Trump officials:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Washington Post for months has sought to confirm this report of a FISA warrant related to the Trump campaign but has been unable to do so. Presumably other U.S. news organizations have tried to do so as well. So one has to take this claim with a huge dose of skepticism.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe Wrongdoer in Chief: Obama?\n\n\n\tIn this context, one of the final executive orders of the Obama administration takes on new significance. Shortly before leaving office, Obama abruptly issued yet another expansion of the Reagan-era Executive Order 12333, dramatically enlarging some 17 government agencies\u2019 legal authority to surveille U.S. citizens \u2014 an order that had followed even earlier expansions of the number of officials privy to surveilled information. Why such a radical move in the last days in office?\n\n\n\tThe practical intent of that order might have been inadvertently contextualized by Evelyn Farkas, a former assistant deputy secretary of defense. On MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show, she blurted out:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI was urging my former colleagues and \u2014 and frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed \u2014 aimed at telling the Hill people, \u201cGet as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration.\u201d Because, I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left. So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff\u2019s dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried, because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues, and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.\n\n\n\n\tWhat exactly did she mean by \u201chow we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff\u2019s dealing with Russians\u201d? Was the DOD also privy to FISA-ordered surveillances, or did DOD staffers simply read the passed-around Steele dossier and other memos?\n\n\n\tWhat Farkas was probably outlining was an eleventh-hour attempt to leak, perhaps improperly and illegally, surveillance and classified gossip to as many government agencies as possible as well as sympathetic congressional leaders, in hopes that the information would flood out (as it did) before the incoming Trump administration could stop such illicit dissemination of improper government surveillance.\n\n\n\tObama allowed his DOJ and the FBI to manipulate the FISA courts to surveille an American citizen and indirectly target others.\n\n\n\tAt some distant point, investigators and the media will conclude that the nexus of wrongdoing was likely Barack Obama himself. Aside from the massaged investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s wrongdoing, during the election of 2016 and the Trump transition of November 2016 to January 2017, Obama allowed his DOJ and the FBI to manipulate the FISA courts to surveille an American citizen and indirectly target others. He then made sure such data were\u00a0disseminated among as many administration hands as possible. And he further allowed his subordinates to unmask surveilled citizens, whose identities and (in some cases conversations) were ultimately leaked to news organizations.\n\n\n\tThat was a process of leaking and sensationalism that sought first to damage the Trump campaign. Ultimately, it succeeded in creating overwhelming public and official Washington pressure to justify James Comey\u2019s later efforts to angle for the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\n\tThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s \u201cphase one\u201d memo, as Nunes has described it, limits itself to the likely wrongdoing of DOJ and FBI officials.\n\n\n\tOne would expect that phase two and beyond would examine the nature of the surveillance itself, the number of Obama intelligence and political officials who had access to such information, the exact requests of named officials to unmask Trump associates, and the correlations of such unmasking with the roughly simultaneous appearance of such names in the media.\n\n\n\tBoth Watergate and Iran-Contra were multiyear affairs. FISA-gate may last longer, given that the media this time around are not a watchdog, but an enabler, of government misconduct. We are at the very beginning of the exposure of wronging by Obama-era DOJ and FBI officials \u2014 and their superiors \u2014 and have not begun to learn exactly why and how American citizens were improperly monitored, and by whom. In one of the strangest moments in the history of American journalism, Washington reporters and agencies, known for their loud interests in protecting civil liberties, are either silent or working to suppress news of these scandals, and they may well soon rue their own complacency.\n\n\n\tWashington reporters and agencies are either silent or working to suppress news of these scandals.\n\n\n\tNor have we learned the full nature of why and how Obama-era investigative agencies departed from normal protocol in exonerating Hillary Clinton from criminal liability during a number of 2015\u201316 controversies. Presumably there are records, official and otherwise, of these matters; they should come to light as soon as possible.\n\n\n\tWhat seems clear is that the present hysteria about the Trump administration was already deeply seeded in the federal government throughout the 2016 campaign and the 2016\u201317 transition. A number of powerful Obama officials thought they had both moral right and the administrative means to nullify Trump. And they were not shy in breaking the law to exercise them.\n\n\n\t\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won, released in October from Basic Books.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "Conor Lamb is greeted by supporters during his election night rally in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, March 13, 2018.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Brendan  Cook Political Report, a renowned nonpartisan election forecaster, shifted its projections of nine House races in favor of Democrats Friday, days after political novice Conor Lamb bested his Republican challenger in the special election to represent a Pennsylvania district President Trump carried by 20 points against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nAmong the notable ratings changes were three races affected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s recent move to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts, ostensibly as a counterweight to the effects of partisan gerrymandering.

If you believe what you watch, read, and hear, America is hopelessly fractured among red and blue partisan team lines, poised for an endless and nightmarish cable-news-style shouting match.

But let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMeh\u201d was first widely popularized on The Simpsons, a TV show credited with predicting this year\u2019s U.S. Olympic curling win against Sweden eight years before it happened, as well as forecasting Donald Trump\u2019s presidency way back in the year 2000. Since its Simpsons debut, \u201cmeh\u201d has appeared in various dictionaries as well as headlines for BBC News, ABC News, and the New York Times. \u201cMeh,\u201d apparently, has arrived.\n\nIn its political form, a \u201cmeh\u201d might signify displeasure with American politics at large, but with none of the gushers of faux outrage and over-the-top feigned surprise that regularly festoon social media. (Remember, say, the trauma of the proposed Washington, D.C., military parade that was going to potentially end America as we know it and that inspired a brief burst of hysteria until everyone forgot about it a few days later? No? Ah ha! You might be a \u201cmeh.\u201d)\n\nAs a \u201cmeh,\u201d you might align with one political party \u2014 ahem, I\u2019m sorry, political \u201ctribe\u201d \u2014 but in reality, that tribe frequently annoys and exasperates you and makes you wonder, at least once a week, why it even exists as an entity.

Many were reluctant Trump voters at best.)\n\nMost significantly, the \u201cmehs\u201d have a crucial skill in this day and age: They understand the grand unifying theory of politics, which is that a frighteningly large percentage of the people involved in politics can be insufferable and wildly out of touch.

But it does involve a certain detached understanding that much of our federal government is a gigantic, sprawling, often self-serving mess. On one side, a \u201cmeh\u201d understands why we\u2019re somehow voting on a gargantuan $1.3 trillion funding bill when the supposedly fiscally conservative political party is power. On the other, a \u201cmeh\u201d understands that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is not unfolding in real life.\n\nI hope that the rise of the \u201cmehs\u201d will correlate with increased calls for limited, accountable government, and the votes to back them up.

The government will in effect place those with unpaid taxes under arrest, effectively denying them their right to travel.\n\n\n\tTo be clear: We are not talking about Americans who have been convicted of tax evasion or tax fraud, or who are awaiting a criminal trial on charges related to tax matters. These Americans have not been charged with a crime, must less convicted of one. They simply have unpaid taxes amounting to $50,000 or more.\n\n\n\tMore precisely: They have an unpaid IRS liability amounting to $50,000 or more. The IRS\u2019s aggressive schedule of interest and penalties for unpaid taxes ensures that a relatively small amount of unpaid taxes can turn into a $50,000-plus liability with remarkable speed.\n\n\n\tThe IRS has remarkable investigative tools and collections procedures at its disposal. Say what you will about the Patriot Act, it does not oblige Americans to file detailed paperwork annually with the Department of Homeland Security detailing their personal affairs, business arrangements, housing situation, health-insurance coverage, etc. The IRS has that power, and then some: It can seize assets, garnish wages, put liens on property, and more. Still, there are occasions when it finds itself unable to collect a debt. Sometimes, that is because it is dealing with a crafty person who manages to hide his income and property from the government. More often, that is because it is dealing with a person who simply cannot pay.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat\u2019s worse is that there is no appeal, no procedural remedy in the law, no redress for those who have been wrongly targeted \u2014 and we know the IRS has a history of wrongly targeting Americans its agents perceive as political enemies. The sole remedy available to Americans who wrongfully lose their passports to the IRS \u2014 or who fail to have them reinstated after making good on their taxes \u2014 is to file a civil action against the agency under 26 USC 7345. Suing the IRS is an expensive and difficult proposition, especially for people who are likely already to be in a difficult financial situation.\n\n\n\tWhen it comes to relations between citizen and state, it\u2019s always a matter of \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Here is a data point for you: Under federal sentencing guidelines, the recommended sentence for involuntary manslaughter is 10 months to 16 months. The average sentence for tax evasion? Seventeen months. The average sentence in a tax case is longer than the average sentence for a car thief (twelve months), a forger (twelve months), or a felon convicted in a drug case (14 months).\n\n\n\tBut that\u2019s tax fraud. We aren\u2019t even talking about that. We\u2019re just talking about Americans with unpaid back taxes.\n\n\n\tThe right to travel is \u2014 like the right to free speech, the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievance \u2014 a basic civil right. Americans as free people have a God-given right to come and go as they please, irrespective of the preferences of any pissant bureaucrat in Washington. Yes, we curtail people\u2019s rights in certain circumstances \u2014 when they have been charged with a crime and convicted after due process. Tax fraud is a crime; having unpaid taxes is not.\n\n\n\tThe U.S. government needs a periodic reminder that it was created by the states and by the people, not the other way around, and that it exists at the sufferance of the people \u2014 not the other way around. Suspending passports in the course of a civil dispute \u2014 a civil dispute that may well be in litigation or soon to be in litigation \u2014 is banana-republic, totalitarian stuff.\n\n\n\tSuspending passports in the course of a civil dispute is banana-republic, totalitarian stuff.\n\n\n\tCongress did this, and Congress can undo this \u2014 and Congress should undo this.\n\n\n\tYes, people should pay their taxes. Most people do. But there are limits to what the government may permissibly do to citizens in any situation, and much narrower limits to what the government may permissibly to do citizens who have neither been charged with nor convicted of any crime in the matter \u2014 which is not, after all, a criminal matter in the first place.\n\n\n\tPeople should pay their taxes, and the people at the IRS should do their jobs honestly and ethically. Most of them do. But not all of them. Lois Lerner, the IRS boss who illegally targeted conservative groups for harassment in the runup to the 2012 presidential election, is happily enjoying retired life in some Washington suburb while collecting a fat federal pension. She didn\u2019t lose her passport. Former IRS commissioner John Koskinen lied to Congress about the situation and oversaw the destruction of evidence. He still has a passport. The crimes \u2014 actual crimes \u2014 of the powerful and the connected go unpunished, while those who for whatever reason have an unmet obligation to the IRS are treated like East Germans locked behind the Checkpoint Charlie of the federal bureaucracy. If you want to know why faith in our institutions is at such a low point, meditate on that.\n\n\n\tIn the meantime, Congress should repeal the statute enabling the IRS to effectively place Americans under house arrest over unpaid bills. And if Congress fails to act, its members should be made to pay a price. My senators are Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and my representative is Pete Sessions.

The debate on the right is mainly between Trump partisans who believe, or at least claim they believe, that President Trump is in the habit of saying astoundingly stupid things in public as part of a grand political scheme (twelve-dimensional chess!) and those who believe that President Trump is in the habit of saying astoundingly stupid things in public because . . . of the more straightforward reason.\n\nJamie Kirchick of the Brookings Institution wryly observes: \u201cEverything Trump says makes sense when you just preface it with, \u2018Donald from Queens, you\u2019re on the air.\u2019\u201d I do not know if Kirchick intended his remark this way, but his joke actually splits the difference between the grand-design explanation of Trump\u2019s ridiculousness and the he\u2019s-just-an-ordinary-fool explanation. There\u2019s a reason Trump sounds like your chemtrail-obsessed uncle or that guy at work who\u2019s always going on about Q-Anon, trafficking in a poisonous mix of conspiracy theories, scapegoating, and resentment-driven politics.\n\n\n\n\nThe formal term for what\u2019s at the root of all this is \u201crational ignorance.\u201d Many of you will have experienced the phenomenon of the very smart person who has very dumb ideas about politics \u2014 and who, if challenged, will immediately retreat into the vaguest of generalities, and often ends up displaying surprising ignorance about the most basic public-policy questions. These are the people who believe that you can walk into Walmart and buy a machine gun, that foreign aid represents half of federal spending, that the CIA introduced crack into inner-city neighborhoods, etc., and who tend not to know things like who their representative in Congress is or how our tax system works. Why are these smart and often very successful people so ignorant about politics? Because they\u2019ve spent their lives getting really smart about a different subject and achieving their success in a field in which political knowledge isn\u2019t very important. This is why Albert Einstein had such batty ideas about politics.\n\nWe have only so much time and only so much available in the way of neural resources to throw back at all the problems life throws at us. Earning a living eats up a bunch of the ordinary person\u2019s time-and-brainpower budget, while seeing to children and family, managing a household, maintaining friendships and social obligations, etc., demands most of what\u2019s left \u2014 or, for many busy people, more. I\u2019d like to learn French and, if I dedicated a couple of hours a day to it, I could make some real progress in a year or two, I\u2019m sure. But if I take into consideration all the other things I might do with that one or two hours a day, learning French ends up not making the cut. (So far.) That doesn\u2019t mean that I lack the capacity to learn a Romance language or that I hold the works of Guy de Rabelais in low regard. My ongoing ignorance of the French language is rational \u2014 there are other uses of my time and resources that better serve my overall ends in life.\n\nWe have only so much time and only so much available in the way of neural resources to throw back at all the problems life throws at us.\n\nOn top of that, in a mass democracy there is little opportunity for the learned amateur to put what political knowledge he does have to efficacious use. It is extremely unlikely that your individual vote is going to be the deciding factor in any given election, or that the outcome of any given election is likely to be the deciding factor in any public-policy issue that is deeply important to you in your own life. Imagine you are 18 years old, and ask yourself which would have the bigger likely payoff: spending four years studying public policy or spending four years studying finance? Imagine you are a 35-year-old mother or father: If you had spent two hours a day for the past ten years reading up on the details of federal fiscal policy instead of investing that time in your children, would you or your family be happier or better off? Unlikely. You\u2019re probably in the same position vis-\u00e0-vis most of that kind of stuff that I am with French: If your options were unlimited, it would be on the agenda. But your options are not unlimited. That\u2019s the root of \u201crational ignorance.\u201d\n\nRevenons \u00e0 nos moutons.\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that most people who don\u2019t make their living thinking about politics tend not to think very much or very carefully about politics does not mean that they are not interested in politics or do not care about it. Far from it. But, as Robin Hanson reminds us, politics is not about policy. Politics is about tribe. How we align politically is based for most people almost entirely on how we wish to position ourselves socially and culturally. At the moment, our politics is marked by a kind of inverse partisanship: It isn\u2019t that Trump partisans think the Republican party is so great \u2014 they just think those other guys are so awful that any alternative is acceptable. That\u2019s the \u201cBut Hillary\u201d defense, a moral get-out-of-jail-free card for right-wing talk-radio hosts and their listeners. Democrats have their own version of that, which is why they don\u2019t argue that Republicans are wrong about tax policy or abortion but that they are racists, misogynists, homophobes, captive to corporate greed, etc. We end up with a political discourse in which both sides are, at their broadest points, heavily invested in their insistence that there is no good-faith disagreement about policy \u2014 there is only the eternal conflict between the guys in the white hats and the guys in the black hats.\n\nAcknowledging good-faith disagreement inevitably would highlight the basic political ignorance of the general electorate (including the cable-news-watching and talk-radio-listening sub-electorate), and people find it very disagreeable to confess their ignorance about these issues, even as they are entirely comfortable admitting that they do not know very much about diesel engines or blood disorders or the internal politics of Tuvalu.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is clearly a creature of ignorance. No other sort of man would be capable of writing these sentences: \u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. When we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don\u2019t trade anymore \u2014 we win big. It\u2019s easy!\u201d There isn\u2019t a serious economist or businessman in these United States who really believes that. But it may sound good on talk radio and social media, and Trump is at the very least clever enough to understand that his core partisans are ignorant enough about the underlying issues that their sense of tribal loyalty is almost certain to overwhelming whatever critical thinking they may bring to the question.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t know much, but he knows enough to know that that doesn\u2019t much matter, at least as a question of the crude calculation of his own self-interest \u2014 the only subject to which he gives serious thought.\n\nCall it rational ignorance with a vengeance, rational ignorance with malice aforethought.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Charles C.

And not just a little bit moronic. This is so moronic, so dim, so utterly and incandescently stupid that I frankly worry for the future of the republic. I have been reading through these reactions for a few hours now, and I can still scarcely imagine the rank historical and legal illiteracy that it takes to hear \u201cAnglo-American\u201d in such a context and to assume it\u2019s a racial reference. Sessions could not have been more clear if he had tried. His talk was to sheriffs \u2014 about sheriffs. His point \u2014 \u201cliterally\u201d! \u2014 was that sheriffs play a \u201ccritical\u201d role within the law enforcement system that developed first in England, and then in America. (\u201cSheriff\u201d derives from a combination of the word \u201cshire\u201d and the word \u201creeve.\u201d) In order to make that point at that talk, he said, \u201cThe office of sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\n\tIt is hard to overstate just how commonly used this phrase is in this context. Within the law, \u201cAnglo-American\u201d does not mean \u201cwhite.\u201d It does not mean \u201cthe KKK.\u201d It is not a \u201cdog whistle.\u201d It is fundamental. It is used \u2014 shock! \u2014 to refer to those institutions, ideals, structures, and customs that are common to England and the United States \u2014 that is, to the common legal heritage the two countries share. Most basically, it means \u201ccommon law,\u201d but it can also apply more broadly. There is, for example, an identifiable \u201cAnglo-American\u201d conception of due process, which is distinct from, say, the Napoleonic system.

Their strategy has been to position China as the aggrieved party by claiming the mantle of rationality, global integration, and fairness. Chinese officials evidently believe that in appearing to take the high road they have an opportunity not only to undercut worldwide support for the U.S. actions, but also to sow seeds of dissension and doubt in the U.S. body politic.

And the reality is that China is not justified in taking any retaliatory actions in response to the Trump administration\u2019s 301 investigation; China has long been failing to live up to its trade commitments.

Please don\u2019t take action against our unfair actions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: Beijing will \u201copen even wider\u201d to imports and investment. (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: Beijing will not open even wider to imports and investment. In fact, we might impose even more market-access barriers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cChina will remain a responsible long-term investor [in U.S. government bonds].\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: There is no way we will stop buying U.S. T-bills. If we didn\u2019t recycle our massive trade surplus into U.S. debt, our currency would rise and our trade surplus would disappear.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nStatement: We plan to \u201cfurther bring down overall tariffs,\u201d with \u201czero tariffs for drugs, especially much-needed anti-cancer drugs.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: Our tariffs are much higher than U.S. tariffs and will remain so, but rather than continuing to raise the price of life-saving drugs, we will bring down tariffs on a few of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: We plan to \u201cfully open the manufacturing sector\u201d to foreign competitors. (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: When pigs fly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cThere will be no mandatory requirement for technology transfers, and intellectual-property rights will be better protected.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: There never has been and never will be an official Chinese law mandating tech transfer as the price of accessing our market. But if foreign companies don\u2019t turn over valuable technology, we will continue to make life miserable for them. And in the meantime, we will make sure to protect Chinese IP better so we can bring more IP cases against foreign companies.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cA large trade deficit is not something we want to see. What we want to see is balanced trade; otherwise this kind of trade will not be sustainable.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: We don\u2019t care that much about the trade deficit anymore. We are happy to import more of your soybeans, timber, and minerals. We just want to dominate the advanced-technology industries you now hold the lead in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cWe believe these [steps to allow us to buy U.S. defense technology] will bring opportunities for American companies, too.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: We\u2019d end our trade surplus with you if you would just sell us supercomputers, advanced computer chips, and advanced lasers (which we would then use to build up our military even more), and that would be a \u201cwin-win\u201d because some U.S. companies would make profits.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: Further opening up the Chinese market \u201cwill naturally be a step-by-step process.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: Don\u2019t call us, we\u2019ll call you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cI want to emphasize that opening needs to be a two-way track, just as it takes paddling on both sides for a boat to move forward.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: Sell us your most advanced technology and let us buy up your advanced-technology companies.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: China will \u201cresolutely defend\u201d its interests. (Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, March 19, 2018)\n\nTranslation: China will \u201cresolutely defend\u201d its interests.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStatement: \u201cLet the sunshine of a community with a shared future for humanity illuminate the world!\u201d (President Xi Jinping, March 21, 2018)\n\nTranslation: We want to dominate the world.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mairead Mcardle", "body": "President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on July 7, 2017.

By congressional standards, he was obscure; last month, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer kept mispronouncing Nunes\u2019s surname. (It is NEW-nes, not NOON-yez.) The tumultuous presidency of Donald Trump catapulted the once-little-known congressman into the harshest glares of the Washington spotlight, and his critics contend that he\u2019s comically underqualified for his role and the moment.\n\nHouse Minority leader Nancy Pelosi dismisses Nunes as \u201ca stooge of the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly nothing in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that would have qualified him for the post,\u201d scoffed Peter Lance in the Huffington Post. Roll Call\u2019s David Hawkings concluded that \u201cthe match between his backstory and his prominence seems wholly incongruous and helps underscore the perception that Nunes is cavalierly playing at a very high-stakes game while in way over his head.\u201d\n\nThe Left has created a hostile caricature of Nunes, while conservatives know little about him beyond his work on his explosive memo. But Nunes didn\u2019t come from nowhere. He\u2019s a farmer turned politician whose career began with a near-accidental run for the board of trustees at a community college. He delved deeply into foreign policy as part of his work for the intelligence committee, and he was respected by Democrats with whom he worked \u2014 until the divisive post\u20132016 election debate changed everything.\n\n\n\nImmigrants in the Fields\n\nThe backstory of Devin Nunes begins not really in Washington or California but in the Azores, a tiny group of islands more than 800 miles off the coast of Portugal. These distant, isolated volcanic islands, settled in the 1400s, offered a harsh and difficult life. Inhabitants faced starvation, harsh weather, and earthquakes. Ships crossing the Atlantic stopped regularly in the Azores, and the locals often felt tempted by the thought of new life on a distant shore; some joined the gold rush to California in 1849.\n\nNunes\u2019s grandparents came from the Azores and, like many other Portuguese, settled in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, which holds some of the best land for farming in the country, or perhaps on earth. Previous generations of Portuguese Azorean immigrants and their children had turned to farming after the sheepherding industry declined in the 1870s. This is the region that John Steinbeck wrote about so frequently, a fertile, sunny Eden that offered many opportunities for work \u2014 and at least a slim chance at a fortune and the American dream. As Nunes described it in his 2010 book Restoring the Republic, the valley was \u201ca place where someone with few belongings, little education, and even no ability to speak English could prosper by picking grapes, milking cows, or hoeing cotton fields.\u201d Nunes\u2019s family ultimately worked and saved enough money to buy a 640-acre farm outside Tulare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the agricultural center of the planet,\u201d Nunes boasts. \u201cOver 300 crops grow here, year-round for the most part.\u201d The congressman grew up surrounded by extended family, all working on the farm and finding work on other farms nearby. Family and the land were closely intertwined in this immigrant subculture. Tony Jerome, a Portuguese Azorean immigrant who moved to Turlock, Calif., in 1912, wrote:\n\nSometimes when I am working in the fields, I reach down and get a handful of good clean dirt. It feels warm in the palm of my hand. I let it dribble through my fingers and I feel as if I had just shaken hands with all my ancestors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s little bit of a dying breed now, not a lot of people my age or younger grew up like that,\u201d Nunes tells me. He describes the family milieu:\n\nYou get together for every single birthday, Sunday afternoons are family dinners or lunches, and it\u2019s not just your immediate family, it\u2019s all your aunts and uncles and cousins and great-aunts and uncles and all of that. . . . Until I was a freshman in high school, I grew up with a dozen cousins who were all [aged] within three or four years of me.\n\nWhen the extended Nunes family wasn\u2019t farming, its members were serving in the armed forces. Since his election to Congress in 2002, Nunes has always had cousins and relatives serving in uniform and often in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the moment, Nunes and his wife together have five cousins serving in the military; among them, one is an officer, one just returned from Afghanistan, and one is about to deploy to Afghanistan. The congressman says his many relatives in the military are one of the factors that made him want to join the intelligence committee.\n\nWhen the extended Nunes family wasn\u2019t farming, its members were serving in the armed forces.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the congressman\u2019s father, Anthony Nunes, urged his son to not merely go out and find work but to start his own business. The teenage Devin Nunes and his younger brother, also named Anthony, started their own business, leasing a swather \u2014 a farm instrument that cuts hay or small grain crops such as alfalfa or wheat and forms them into a windrow.\n\n\u201cI went around to neighbors, and my brother and I would do this custom work,\u201d Nunes recalls. He figured his whole life would be in agriculture. \u201cI never pictured myself running for office. I always wanted to be a winemaker and make cheese, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, agricultural life in California\u2019s Central Valley was changing dramatically. Besides the rain, water for the valley\u2019s farms largely came from California\u2019s Central Valley Project, a complex network of dams, reservoirs, canals, hydroelectric power plants, and other facilities, built over five decades. In 1992, Congress passed the Central Valley Improvement Act, sponsored by George Miller, then a Democratic representative from California\u2019s eleventh district, and Bill Bradley, a Democratic senator from New Jersey. The new law diverted at least 800,000 acre-feet of water from agricultural use to preserving wetlands. The Audubon Society called it \u201can ambitious effort to move federal water policy in a more balanced and sustainable direction.\u201d Farmers saw it as diverting water \u2014 water they had enjoyed access to for decades \u2014 out farther west, so far that it ended up in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAmong those farmers convinced that the federal government was taking usable fresh water and diverting it out to the sea in the name of environmentalism was young Devin Nunes. In his teen years and later when he owned his own farm, he found federal policies hitting home.\n\n\u201cThe only land that I could afford [to buy] was the land with the worst water,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cIt\u2019s been 15 years since I sold my land, and a lot of that land out there where I farmed just isn\u2019t being farmed anymore. It\u2019s basically turned back to desert \u2014 not sand, but dry scrub and tumbleweeds. It\u2019s sad to see. There\u2019s beautiful land out there, with very fertile soil\u201d \u2014 presuming, of course, that the soil gets enough water.\n\nIn addition to the fights over water use, Nunes\u2019s future path was shaped in part by an obscure critter, the Tipton kangaroo rat.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the early 1990s, enforcement of the Endangered Species Act grew increasingly controversial, as landowners and the government fought over protections for the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest. During this period, Taiwanese immigrant Taung-Ming Lin bought 700 acres of farmland west of Bakersfield, Calif., on the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service contended that it sent Lin a certified letter explaining that endangered species, including the Tipton kangaroo rat, lived on his land; they urged him to work with the service on a habitat-conservation plan. Lin insisted he never saw the letter.\n\nOn February 20, 1994, armed federal agents arrested Lin, charging that he had tilled land he allegedly knew to be the home of three endangered species: the San Joaquin Valley kit fox, the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and the Tipton kangaroo rat. Lin faced up to three years in jail and $300,000 in fines.\n\nThe soft-spoken immigrant, who spoke little English, turned into an unlikely symbol of government overreach and trampled property rights. The late Tony Snow wrote about Lin\u2019s case in his syndicated column, noting that \u201ca squadron of more than two dozen state and federal agents, accompanied by helicopters, descended on the farm.\u201d (Agents disputed that they used helicopters.) Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio program.\n\nThe controversy even caught the eye of Donald Trump. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, the future president told the story of Lin. \u201cThese regulations begin with the assumption that hardworking, thrifty people deserve to be treated like common criminals,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAnd they are all but designed to kill jobs and opportunity.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors ultimately decided to drop criminal charges after Lin agreed to pay $5,000 to a fund to preserve endangered species.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in politics because of what the government did to my family, to my region, to where I live and the people I represent.\u2019 \u2014 Devin Nunes\n\n\u201cWhen all this is happening, I\u2019m trying to make payments by the month,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cWe were the guinea pig. And that\u2019s what drove me into politics. I\u2019m in politics because of what the government did to my family, to my region, to where I live and the people I represent.\u201d\n\nBack in the early Nineties, Cathy Abernathy was chief of staff to Representative Bill Thomas, who would go on to become chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. She remembers Nunes as an enthusiastic teenager showing up at town halls, asking detailed questions about federal water policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a shock to see a young person so astute on federal policies!\u201d she says.\n\nAfter high school, Nunes attended the College of the Sequoias, a two-year community college in Visalia, and then he spent three years completing a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree at California Polytechnic State University, at San Luis Obispo. About a month after getting his master\u2019s degree, Nunes\u2019s grandfather passed away, and he started working with his uncle managing his grandmother\u2019s dairy farm \u2014 as well as working on his own farmland.\n\nIn 1996, Nunes\u2019s community college announced a controversial decision to sell the farmland used for the school\u2019s vocational training. Farmers had donated the land, and the college planned to use the profits from the land sale to build new buildings: \u201cbuilding more bureaucracy on campus,\u201d as Nunes saw it.\n\nOne of his former community-college professors heard that Nunes had worked at political campaign fundraisers during his time at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and he reached out, urging Nunes to help two students who planned to run against the sitting president on the college\u2019s board of trustees. But Nunes\u2019s experience had been vastly overstated by the rumor mill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a damn thing about running a campaign, I had parked cars and poured wine,\u201d Nunes recalls with a laugh.\n\nNunes speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill, March 24, 2017.\n\n\n\u2018Why Don\u2019t You Run?\u2019\n\nNunes agreed to help, but fate had a consequential twist ahead of him: \u201cLiterally the day of the deadline, the two guys who had been talking about running both backed out and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you run?\u2019\u201d\n\nNunes drove out to the farm of Ron Quinn. The father of a college friend and housemate, Quinn grew to become a mentor to Nunes and, as Nunes puts it, \u201ckind of like my godfather.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Oh yeah, you\u2019re going to win, and I\u2019m going to help you.\u2019 I thought he was going to tell me, \u2018No, don\u2019t run!\u2019\u201d Nunes says. \u201cIt\u2019s the little things that happen in life. If he had said \u2018You\u2019re out of your mind,\u2019 I would have never done it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was nervous because he was young,\u201d Quinn says. (At 22 going on 23, Nunes was younger than the average student at the College of the Sequoias.)\n\nI said, \u201cYour personality, and your stature, you\u2019re going to win. . . . We need younger generations, your generation, to start getting involved with what\u2019s going on in our community. We\u2019re an ag-based community. You grew up in agriculture. You know what kind of problems we\u2019re having. You\u2019re really schooled in this, you\u2019ll be really good at this.\u201d\n\nQuinn remembered a prophetic observation: \u201cI said, \u2018You never know what can happen after that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe defeated a guy who was in his sixties, a well-established real savvy guy,\u201d says John Zumwalt, vice president of the College of the Sequoias, who served as college-board president when Nunes was on the board. \u201cHe was a 22-year-old kid, and we were in our fifties and sixties, so we were . . .\u201d He paused to chuckle. \u201cReal skeptical of him when he first came on. It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize that this was a kid with potential. He ended up being a leader.\u201d\n\nOnce on the college board, Nunes played a key role in moving the agricultural vocational program from Visalia, where the property had been increasingly surrounded by housing, to a new, expansive college farm in Tulare.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe and another board member had the vision to see that if you put a farm down there and made it big enough, that someday it might be a college,\u201d Zumwalt says, meaning a new branch campus about 16 miles away. \u201cSure enough. He was driven to make sure the ag program was sound. It had been a hodge-podge when he first came in. Now it\u2019s a first-class program.\u201d\n\nThe college\u2019s Tulare center now consists of a 500-acre site that includes 220 acres of farmland.\n\nAs a young, up-and-coming Republican in one of the few remaining heavily GOP parts of the state, Nunes got to know, and built useful relationships with, lots of local Republicans. None would prove to be more consequential than former congressman Bill Thomas, the Republican who chaired the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee from 2001 to 2006 and represented a large portion of the valley. Another key player was Thomas\u2019s staffer Kevin McCarthy, who went on to run for Congress himself and is today the House majority leader.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Nunes\u2019s ambitions turned to Washington, perhaps a bit too early. He announced a bid in California\u2019s 20th congressional district against Democrat Cal Dooley, who had represented the region since 1990. Nunes, then only 25 years old, fell short of the Republican nomination by about 1,100 votes.\n\n\u201cHe just wasn\u2019t well known enough,\u201d Quinn says, pointing out that the district lines at that time covered some of Fresno\u2019s more urban, less agriculture-focused suburbs.\n\nIn 2000, Nunes volunteered on the presidential campaign of George W. Bush. He was torn between the desire to work for the administration and the desire to stay close to his family and farm. After Bush won, Nunes was appointed to his ideal job, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s state director of rural development.\n\n\u201cThat was the coolest job you could ever have,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cI was all over the state and still able to farm, and still able to serve on the community-college board.\u201d\n\nThe 2000 census added a U.S. House seat to California, and the state\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature set out to redraw the lines for maximum partisan advantage. But the process of creating safe Democratic-leaning seats left a large Republican-leaning chunk of the San Joaquin Valley that included less of Fresno. The 2002 election was the first under the new district lines. Nunes ran again, facing the top two primary rivals, state assemblyman Mike Briggs and former Fresno mayor Jim Patterson. Briggs and Patterson represented the Fresno area, while Nunes, who had now served in an influential USDA position, had the votes of Tulare County more or less to himself.\n\nNunes\u2019s campaign strategist for that 2002 race was Mark Abernathy. Cathy Abernathy, his wife, recalls:\n\n[Mark] advised Devin that water didn\u2019t poll highly with the average voter, so it was important to explain it. Devin insisted upon making it the issue in his campaign. He stuck to the issues of water and agriculture, and slowly climbed ahead over four months.\n\nNunes won the three-way primary with 37 percent, and the general election that November with 70 percent. Since then, Nunes has never won less than 62 percent of the vote; he ran unopposed in 2010.\n\nNunes with Senator Ted Cruz and other lawmakers at the State of the Union speech, January 30, 2018.\n\n\nWelcome to D.C.\n\nWhen Nunes took the oath of office, he was 29, the second-youngest member in the House of Representatives. Nunes recounts an early conversation with Thomas about being the fresh-faced kid in the hallways of the Capitol Building:\n\nI asked him, \u201cBeing this age, is anybody going to think lesser, or greater, one way or the other about me?\u201d And he said, \u201cYou see that card you\u2019ve got there?\u201d He pointed to my voting card. He said, \u201cEverybody got here some way just like you, and your vote counts as much as anybody else\u2019s. You\u2019re not going to have any problems.\u201d\n\nOf course, a preexisting relationship with the House Ways and Means Committee chairman doesn\u2019t hurt. And he also struck up a friendship with another particularly young member of the House Republican Caucus, a wonky numbers-focused Wisconsinite named Paul Ryan.\n\n\u201cDevin\u2019s been working on fiscal issues with me since he got to Congress,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHe was an early supporter of the Road Map,\u201d Ryan\u2019s far-reaching budget proposal. \u201cAnd he played a big role in advancing tax reform for years, long before we actually achieved it.\u201d\n\nFor most of his early terms in Congress, Nunes had little profile outside of his district and his colleagues \u2014 which was how his constituents liked it, seeing him as a tenacious fighter in their crusade for more water.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a person who can really focus,\u201d says Connie Conway, the former Republican minority leader of the California Assembly from Tulare. \u201cHe can be a bulldog. He\u2019s not backing down, the way some people have. In California, it\u2019s easy to get worn down by the [Democratic] majority and their constant criticism.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the San Joaquin Valley faced increasingly serious drought conditions. Year after year, Nunes kept pushing Congress and, in particular, his state\u2019s Democratic senators to provide relief to the region. He wanted to see more water flowing through the Central Valley Project canals to the valley farmers, and less steered west to the oceans. The House kept passing legislation, but it often died in the Senate, and the Obama administration signaled its opposition.\n\n\n\n\nNunes\u2019s persistence finally bore fruit in late 2016, when Congress passed and President Obama signed legislation that included $335 million for water-storage projects; the law also eased limits on moving water south of the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta to help San Joaquin Valley farmers. The bill\u2019s language was hashed out by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative McCarthy; it was one of the rare splits between Feinstein and fellow California Democratic senator Barbara Boxer, who called the bill \u201cugly,\u201d \u201cwrong,\u201d and \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\nJohn Boehner became House Majority Leader in 2005 and started arranging for GOP members to take trips to places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Nunes joined Boehner on those trips, which usually would occur twice a year. Nunes had declared his 2002 bid shortly after 9/11, and members of the extended Nunes clan, wearing the country\u2019s uniform, kept heading off to war.\n\nWhen Boehner became Speaker after the 2010 GOP wave, he put Nunes on the intelligence committee; by all accounts, he fit in fine. Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is now the ranking member on the intelligence committee and who has become one of Nunes\u2019s toughest critics, once had high praise for him, telling the Fresno Bee in April 2014, \u201cI have always been impressed by him. He works in a very bipartisan way.\u201d\n\nHe has found himself on a creaky, nearly century-old barge, loaded up with trucks and livestock, crossing the Danube River at a remote spot in Eastern Europe, and driving through the Balkans, following the paths of Syrian civil-war refugees.\n\nMembership on the intelligence committee meant that Nunes was soon traveling to far-flung corners of the earth, and he quickly made clear he wanted more than the usual embassy meetings and tours of capital cities. In 2011, he and Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas drove eight hours along the Indian side of the India\u2013Pakistan border, starting in Kashmir. He has found himself on a creaky, nearly century-old barge, loaded up with trucks and livestock, crossing the Danube River at a remote spot in Eastern Europe, and driving through the Balkans, following the paths of Syrian civil-war refugees.\n\nLast year, while visiting a North African country (he can\u2019t disclose certain details about his trips), Nunes\u2019s convoy, protected by about 25 members of a security force loyal to the head of state, encountered ten members of rival local police forces. A tense showdown ensued. Through the window of his bulletproof vehicle, Nunes saw \u201ctwo guys with 9 millimeters [pistols] pointed at each other\u2019s heads.\u201d Thankfully, after a few minutes, cooler heads prevailed, and Nunes\u2019s convoy was allowed to pass.\n\nIn 2014, Nunes wanted to meet with a representative of a Libyan faction that opposed the Muslim Brotherhood and that was not favored by the Obama administration. In a Middle Eastern country that wasn\u2019t Libya, Nunes returned to his hotel late at night from his scheduled meetings, waited for his security and embassy escort to leave, and then snuck out, grabbed a taxi, and headed to a secret meeting \u2014 with the entire leadership team of the faction.\n\n\u201cWe go off the beaten path, taking cars and trains,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cYou can only truly learn what\u2019s going on in a country if you talk to people outside the bubble. In my mind, if I meet with someone and they\u2019re just repeating the conventional wisdom or reading talking points, it\u2019s a red flag\u201d that there\u2019s something more to uncover.\n\nIn March 2014, Mike Rogers, then chairman of the intelligence committee, announced his intention to retire. The House Steering Committee decides most committee chairmanships, but the chairman of the intelligence committee is picked by the House speaker alone. Several members of the intel panel had more experience than Nunes did, but they had either already served as chairman or they were set to chair other important panels: Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas was expected to become the next chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Jeff Miller of Florida was already chairman of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, and Peter King of New York already chaired a key subcommittee of the Homeland Security\u00a0Committee.\n\nBoehner selected his longtime ally, and Nunes, at 41, became the youngest committee chairman in Congress.\n\n\n\n\nHis first day on the job as chairman was the day of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris, and he quickly earned goodwill from the panel\u2019s Democrats. Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the committee\u2019s former top Democrat, called Nunes a \u201cgood man\u201d in the Fresno Bee back in 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, he\u2019s hardworking, and he\u2019s taking his job very seriously.\u201d By December of that year, Nunes and ranking member Schiff had worked out a previously thorny disagreement on the Intelligence Authorization Act.\n\nNunes is an unlikely candidate to be, in Pelosi\u2019s term, a \u201cTrump stooge.\u201d He didn\u2019t endorse any of the Republican candidates for president in the 2016 primary, and he never had a conversation with Trump until the summer of 2016. Nor does Nunes share in Trump\u2019s skepticism that Russia would attempt to hack sensitive information at the DNC or try to influence the election. A month before the election, Nunes told reporters it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that Russia would target U.S. political organizations.\n\nNor is there much evidence that Nunes is a fan of Russia, or outside of the Republican foreign-policy mainstream. He supported trade-promotion authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, doesn\u2019t believe the country can sufficiently screen Syrian refugees, and opposed the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn 2014, he denounced the \u201cshameless propaganda\u201d of RT, the Kremlin\u2019s flagship international media outlet. And, in an op-ed in the Washington Times, he warned: \u201cWhile [Vladimir Putin] may be willing to sacrifice Russia\u2019s own economy for his geo-political ambitions, we cannot afford to be a mere bystander as his destabilizing actions begin to threaten the economies of the Baltics and other NATO allies, possibly including our own.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, he joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers urging the Obama administration to authorize the transfer of \u201clethal, defensive weapons systems to the Ukrainian military.\u201d In an appearance on CNN in April 2016, he criticized the Obama administration for being too soft with Putin:\n\nAfter the Georgian invasion, maybe we thought some diplomacy might work. Clearly, after the invasion of Crimea, that should have been a red line, and we immediately should have moved quickly in to bolster our NATO allies. But instead we continued to negotiate with the Russians, we continued to talk to the Russians, and then they invaded Eastern Ukraine. We missed that. Then we completely missed entirely when they put a new base with aircraft into Syria. We missed it, we were blind. . . . We misjudged Putin for many, many years.\n\nNunes joined Trump\u2019s transition team three days after the election and recommended James Mattis to be secretary of defense, and his congressional colleague Mike Pompeo to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nBut Nunes\u2019s past stances were forgotten as Democrats touted Russian meddling as the most satisfying explanation for the president\u2019s surprise victory and as President Trump publicly fumed about the FBI\u2019s investigation of his campaign. Nunes\u2019s relatively good relationship with the president, and his belief that the FBI and Department of Justice had abused their powers in the run-up to the 2016 election, spurred an avalanche of criticism \u2014 some fair, and much downright unhinged.\n\nIn November, Andrew Janz, a Democratic congressional candidate, unveiled a billboard that depicts Trump and Nunes on Putin\u2019s leash. In January, MSNBC contributor John Heilemann asked Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy on air, \u201cIs it possible that we actually have a Russian agent running the House Intel Committee on the Republican side?\u201d\n\nNunes is no Russian agent, but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t willing to lock horns with top officials in the intelligence community and federal law enforcement.\n\nNunes questions FBI director James Comey during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee in March 2017.\n\n\nThe FBI and the FISA Court\n\nThe FBI and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are going to need to make \u201cmajor changes,\u201d Nunes says.\n\nThey don\u2019t even know what hit them yet. I\u2019ve been trying to tell DOJ and FBI, \u201cLook, your best [move] is to get in front of this.\u201d In fact, I begged them. I said, \u201cLook, you guys, I didn\u2019t even want to come out with the memo. But if you guys aren\u2019t going to investigate this, if you\u2019re not going to appoint either a second special counsel or give us some confidence that something\u2019s going to happen . . . \u201d All they would do is say, \u201cWell, there\u2019s an IG investigation.\u201d That is not what I was talking about. There was a big disagreement between myself and my committee members [on one side] and the top people at DOJ and FBI [on the other]. They\u2019re a little bit in denial. And I think that the longer they stay in that position, crouched down, thinking they can weather this . . . They haven\u2019t seen anything yet. You can only imagine the amendments that are going to come on the floor come appropriations-bill time in a couple of months. It\u2019s going to be ugly. And by them not getting in front of it, it\u2019s going to make it worse.\n\nIn its initial application for a wiretap on Carter Page, the FBI told the FISA court, in a footnote: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d The description is technically accurate but painfully generic; we now know that opposition researcher Christopher Steele was being paid indirectly by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cThe footnote that they\u2019re so hot to talk about, from our perspective, that was evidence that they actually went out of their way to not tell the court,\u201d Nunes says, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s a cute lawyer trick to somewhere down the line be able to say, \u201cOh yeah, we did tell you.\u201d It was kind of like an escape hatch. Just come right out and say, \u201cHey judge, the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for this dossier, they hired this Christopher Steele guy to go talk to Russians.\u201d That\u2019s the right way to handle it, and that\u2019s what the American people expect, and if we\u2019re going to have secret courts, they damn sure should expect total and full transparency when something of this nature happens.\n\nThere\u2019s another detail indicating that an even less reliable source was involved in getting the information to the FBI. On February 8, former State Department special envoy to Libya Jonathan Winer wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that in late September 2016 he met with Sidney Blumenthal. Speaking of Blumenthal, Winer wrote: \u201cHe showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.\u201d Winer said he let Steele keep a copy of the Shearer notes, and \u201cI learned later that Steele did share them \u2014 with the FBI, after the FBI asked him to provide everything he had on allegations relating to Trump, his campaign and Russian interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nIn other words, at least some information was passed through notorious Clinton attack dog Blumenthal to Winer, who then passed it to Steele, who then passed it to the FBI. This is the same Sidney Blumenthal whom his colleagues\u00a0nicknamed \u201cGrassy Knoll\u201d for his paranoia\u00a0when he worked in the White House, who was rebuked in the courtroom for his false characterization of grand-jury proceedings during the Ken Starr investigation, who was obsessed with a mythical \u201cwhitey tape\u201d in the 2008 Democratic primary, and whom the Obama team deemed too dishonest and unethical to work in the State Department under Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn 2003, in a Slate essay titled \u201cInsidious Sid,\u201d Michael Isikoff wrote of Blumenthal: \u201cHe rearranges facts, spins conspiracy theories, impugns motives, and besmirches the character of his political and journalistic foes \u2014 all for the greater cause of defending the Clintons (and himself). . . . Distortion is standard fare for Blumenthal.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t prove that the entire Trump dossier is entirely false \u2014 only that one of the most dishonest figures ever to haunt Washington had a hand in assembling its material. It is very difficult to imagine a scenario in which the FBI would carefully consider statements from comparably controversial figures (say, Roger Stone or Alex Jones) alleging\u00a0crimes committed by Hillary Clinton.\n\nA key question before Nunes and his committee overlaps with an investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz. The IG\u2019s office is trying to determine why Andrew McCabe, deputy director at the FBI in autumn of 2016, appeared to take no action for about three weeks on a request to examine a batch of Hillary Clinton emails that contained classified information. The emails were discovered during an investigation of Anthony Weiner, the ex-husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. McCabe left the FBI in January; the IG report is expected sometime this spring. A Washington Post report on March 1 said that the IG\u2019s office has already concluded that McCabe leaked information inappropriately and then misled investigators.\n\nNunes sees a pattern: FBI senior leaders were moving cautiously and glacially on a matter related to Clinton, but they were determined to dig into Carter Page\u2019s electronic communications as quickly as possible.\n\nPut the FISA request alongside 1) McCabe\u2019s decisions, 2) the FBI chief of counterespionage Peter Strzok\u2019s softening of the language in James Comey\u2019s July 5 statement that he would not recommend prosecution of Hillary Clinton, and 3) the anti-Trump comments in texts between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page . . . and Nunes sees a pattern: FBI senior leaders were moving cautiously and glacially on a matter related to Clinton, but they were determined to dig into Carter Page\u2019s electronic communications as quickly as possible.\n\nHe lays out the core issue:\n\nThe obvious challenge here is, \u201cIs it ever okay to use the FISA court to open up a counterintelligence investigation into another campaign?\u201d That, in my book, is a big no-no, and when you go one step further and you use the FISA court to get a warrant on somebody within one campaign, using dirt from the other campaign, that is totally unacceptable. If the media would actually cover that, 80 percent of Americans would be on one side. Maybe 90.\n\nOn March 1, Nunes wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, citing the FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide. The guide states: \u201cAccuracy of information contained within FISA applications is of utmost importance. . . . Only documented and verified information may be used to support FBI applications to the court.\u201d Nunes asked Sessions whether those protocols were changed, and if not, what steps the DOJ or FBI had taken to hold accountable the officials who used the dodgy Steele dossier, with its unverified information, as part of the FISA application.\n\nAll of this would naturally be a formula for tension with the new FBI director, Christopher Wray, but Nunes characterizes his relationship with Wray as productive:\n\nI like Wray, and I told him, \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you to clean this up. We want to support you.\u201d But so far, we haven\u2019t seen it yet. That doesn\u2019t mean It\u2019s not going to happen. I think we need to give him a lot more time and space to see if he can perform. It\u2019s not like the guy walked into easy shoes to fill here, with all the problems that were left.\n\nNow Nunes seems to run into new controversies like clockwork, disputes and accusations that he dismisses as partisan nonsense. In April 2017, the House Ethics Committee opened up an investigation into claims that he had illegally disclosed classified information when he said he\u2019d found evidence to support the president\u2019s claim he\u2019d been illegally wiretapped at Trump Tower. (There seems to have been no wiretapping of Trump Tower, but the FISA surveillance did include wiretapping Page.) In December, the House Ethics Committee announced that it had consulted with classification experts in the intelligence community and concluded that the information that Nunes disclosed was not classified.\n\nIn February, Fox News reported that Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, had extensive contact last year with Adam Waldman, a Washington lawyer and a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch who was offering Warner access to former British spy and dossier author Christopher Steele. The report quoted text messages between Warner and Waldman. The Fox News report said the messages \u201cwere obtained from a Republican source.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported March 1 that Warner and the Senate panel chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, had met with House speaker Paul Ryan in February to complain about Nunes, blaming Nunes for the leak. But after the Times report came out, Burr told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that much of the paper\u2019s account was flat wrong. He denied that the Senate Intelligence Committee had concluded that Nunes or House Republicans were behind the leak of the Warner texts. He also denied that they he and Warner had raised their concerns with Ryan. \u201cWe met with Speaker Ryan to update him on our investigation,\u201d Burr told Raju. \u201cThat was it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not investigating Warner, we don\u2019t give a sh** about him,\u201d Nunes tells me. The copies of the texts had been sent by a law firm to the staff of the House Intelligence Committee, he says, and the staffers quickly realized they didn\u2019t want to start snooping in the communications of their Senate counterparts. \u201cNo member [of the committee] looked at them. The staff looked at them and said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to have anything to do with this.\u2019\u201d He said the documents were sent back to the law firm.\n\nNunes dismisses the accusation that the House Intelligence Committee has grown more divided and contentious on his watch: \u201cThere was a toxic environment on the Intelligence Committee for many, many years, because of the Iraq War and the intelligence leading up to the war. It started under [former chairman] Porter Goss and got worse, to the point where the committee didn\u2019t operate.\u201d\n\nThree of Nunes\u2019s predecessors as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee had a previous career tie to one of the agencies the committee oversees. By comparison, Nunes is a true outsider.\n\nThe tensions on the committee did alleviate somewhat during Obama\u2019s presidency, but it\u2019s worth remembering that for several years the chairman was Mike Rogers, who had spent five years as an FBI special agent, and the ranking member was Ruppersberger, whose home district includes the headquarters of the National Security Agency. The two men were, at least in the broadest sense, sympathetic to their former employers and key constituents.\n\nIn fact, three of Nunes\u2019s predecessors as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee had a previous career tie to one of the agencies the committee oversees: Rogers with the FBI; Texas Democrat Silvestre Reyes worked for the U.S. Border Patrol for 26 years; and Florida Republican Porter Goss spent a decade working in the clandestine services of the Central Intelligence Agency. By comparison, Nunes is a true outsider.\n\n\u201cThe more time that I\u2019ve been involved in this, [I\u2019ve learned that] the fewer people you have who come from the agencies or the area that\u2019s represented, the better off you are to oversee them,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that you can\u2019t learn if you spend time studying it.\u201d\n\n\nNunes doesn\u2019t expect the denunciations from Democrats or the on-background criticism from members of the agencies he oversees to cease any time soon. While amiable, he\u2019s not here to make friends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really judge this by, \u2018Is the committee bipartisan? Do people cooperate?\u2019 I don\u2019t really give a damn about that,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cWhat I care about is: Do you have members doing their work? Are they doing their work in an honest, hard-working fashion to get to the truth, whatever the truth is? Our job is to oversee these agencies, and when they go awry, to rein them in. That\u2019s our job. We\u2019re the legislative branch of government. We created these guys, and they\u2019re not above the law. And they\u2019re going to be reined in for as long as I\u2019m chairman.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "J.

Newman once shared an anecdote of watching a man stubbornly attempt to force a vending machine to accept a particularly tattered dollar bill. After one failed attempt too many, he finally exploded, \u201cGODDAMN Trudeau!\u201d The day PET died, September 28, 2000, my favorite radio chat show featured caller after caller spitting out some form of \u201cGood riddance,\u201d as the host sarcastically mourned the \u201cdearly departed.\u201d Books could (and have been) written about the precise reasons why the old man Trudeau was as loathed as he was; suffice it to say his unique style of imperious leftism saddled the nation with a heavy legacy whose burden was widely borne.\n\nPierre\u2019s adult son, Justin, was introduced to Canada at his father\u2019s funeral, giving a hammy eulogy (he literally began it \u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d) that grated like sandpaper on the radio-caller types, but the press spun it as Churchillian brilliance. It immediately became evident that a Justinian succession was going to be foisted on Canadians at some point or another, though it took Justin himself a while to clue in. After his father\u2019s death, the dauphin spent eight years wandering the landscape as a celebrity dilettante, doing nothing in particular and exerting scant effort to brand himself as politically curious in any way. After an underwhelming entry to parliament in 2008, he was abruptly made head of the Canadian Liberals in 2013, at a time when the party was in such desperate straits it had no choice but to break glass and embrace the foretold. His first years on the job were marked by near-constant gaffes of Dan Quayleian proportion.\n\nThe best American analogy I can offer is that Justin Trudeau\u2019s rise was like the 2016 presidential election encapsulated in a single person \u2014 the grim, monarchical \u201cinevitability\u201d of Hillary Clinton coupled with the \u201cIs this seriously happening?\u201d bizarreness of Donald Trump. To a great many Canadians, the notion that Justin Trudeau, Justin Trudeau, Pierre\u2019s dopey, silver-spoon kid, somehow wound up as prime minister evokes an incredulity akin to those who can\u2019t believe the host of The Apprentice now sits in the Oval Office.\n\nRuler of Canada since 2015, Trudeau has emerged a poster boy for what\u2019s now called the social-justice Left, and conservatives the world over have learned to hate him as a sort of human manifestation of \u201csafe spaces and checked privileges,\u201d as Stephen Daisley recently summarized. I must confess I have a hard time giving him even that much credit. Like everything else in his fortunate life, Trudeau\u2019s current identity as social-justice warrior par excellence seems like just one more thing he\u2019s blindly stumbled into, egged on by handlers and journalists much smarter than him.\n\nHis ghostwritten memoir, Common Ground (2014), and an equally outsourced 2015 speech at McGill University \u2014 both billed as revealing windows into his worldview \u2014 offered little hint of any ambitious progressive philosophy, and instead simply rationalized standard Liberal Party boilerplate. If his pre\u2013prime ministerial mind had any truly passionate preoccupation, it was appeasing French-Canadian nationalism \u2014 a dated, parochial concern his father nevertheless regarded as the existential purpose of Canadian politics.\n\nIn short, the most accurate read of Trudeau would posit him less a committed ideologue than a mediocre actor who hasn\u2019t fully learned his lines (which, incidentally, also describes one of his many short-lived pre-political careers). To put it another way, despite some predictions to the contrary, the future of progressive rule probably won\u2019t resemble Trudeau\u2019s all that much \u2014 it\u2019ll be far worse.\n\nIn more competent, determined hands, the postmodernist new-new-left ideology Trudeau is said to embody would present a far more aggressive threat to rights of free expression, conscience, and association than Trudeau\u2019s often muddled and confused administration has so far pursued. (One reason we hear so much about his virtue-signaling and PR stunts is that he doesn\u2019t seem to have much interest in actually governing.) This isn\u2019t to say the actions his government has taken to date, such as passing laws denying right of dissent on the transgender issue, making summer-job subsidies for students conditional on their employers\u2019 supporting \u201cthe right to access safe and legal abortions,\u201d and to shove identity politics into places where they manifestly do not belong, such as NAFTA negotiations and assessments of natural-resource projects, have not been awful in their own way. It\u2019s merely that the instincts inspiring such initiatives will manifest in far more sweeping, tyrannical fashion once held by a more ideologically committed and competent government.\n\nIn more competent, determined hands, the postmodernist new-new-left ideology Trudeau is said to embody would present a far more aggressive threat to rights of free expression, conscience, and association.\n\nSuch foreshadowing, incidentally, should serve as reminder of the inescapable importance of a robust system of checks and balances, particularly the oft-overlooked importance of anticipatory checks as a means of balancing the excesses of a future regime.\n\n\nOne of the most substantial critiques that deserves to be leveled at Trudeau\u2019s Tory predecessor, Stephen Harper, is that he gave the matter of safeguarding the future such little evident thought. Compared with the United States, the Canadian executive enjoys sweeping, unilateral power, yet Harper failed to entrench, in any branch of government, conservatives destined to outlast his personal control of the prime minister\u2019s office. He did not appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court, nor did he expend the political capital necessary to reform Canada\u2019s sclerotic, appointed Senate into an elected chamber where conservatives could exercise meaningful legislative influence, even under Liberal prime ministers. As a result, Trudeau\u2019s government today enjoys a free rein moderated only by its own amateurism.\n\nIt\u2019s a concern to keep in mind as Americans battle for control of their own Senate later this year. Republican control of that chamber is often spoken of exclusively in the context of President Trump \u2014 will it be submissive or assertive, and so forth. Yet because senators serve six-year terms and Trump\u2019s tenure beyond 2021 is hardly guaranteed, a strong conservative presence in the legislature provides not merely supervision for the present moment but insurance against the inevitable emergence of an American Trudeau, who, like most American things, will almost certainly prove more sophisticated and substantial than the Canadian version.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "A combination photo shows U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, March 8, 2018, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Mike Pompeo on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., February 13, 2018 respectively.

This has led to a consolidation of the industry, eliminating competition and ultimately boosting the big banks all the more.

So the victory in the Senate is a sign that moderate Democrats are beginning to side with conservatives who see Dodd-Frank as anti\u2013Main Street as much as it\u2019s anti\u2013Wall Street.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Senate floor to radio interviews, Democrats from Jon Tester (D., Mon.) to Gary Peters (D., Mich.) pointed to banks in their states hurt by the law and pledged to relieve the pressure. Even blue-state senator and former Clinton vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine (D., Va.) voted for the reform. While critics of the bill are claiming the moderate Democrats\u2019 votes came from reelection fears, rather than genuine concern about economic harm, the numbers don\u2019t back them up: Just seven of the Democratic \u201cyes\u201d votes were from senators running for reelection in Trump-won states, and three red-state senators facing reelection voted \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe reform focuses on community banks, which Dodd-Frank defines as those with less than $10 billion in assets. (\u201cBig\u201d banks have more than $250 billion in assets; mid-size banks fall in between.)\n\nLenders making 500 or fewer mortgages a year will now be exempt from mortgage-data reporting requirements. Critics of the bill claim it will allow such banks to discriminate against black or Hispanic borrowers; supporters retort that the rules are too costly to comply with, and that the reporting requirements are unlikely to cause a significant decrease in lending discrimination. The bill also exempts community banks from the Volcker rule, which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in certain types of proprietary trading \u2014 swapping their funds for profit \u2014 and restricts hedge-fund and private-equity investment.\n\nThe most controversial part of the reform, though, is its redefinition of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d (or \u201csystemically important\u201d) banks, which at present include institutions above $50 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank requires these institutions to have higher capital cushions and undergo \u201cstress tests,\u201d both ways of verifying that a bank can survive a sudden shock or absorb a certain amount of defaulted debt, and a \u201cliving will,\u201d a plan explaining how to \u201cwind down\u201d the bank in the event it fails.\n\nThe reform raises the threshold to $250 billion, freeing regional banks such as Fifth-Third and SunTrust. Critics say this ignores the fact that banks collapse together \u2014 so the smaller banks should have some verification of survivability too \u2014 while advocates have pointed out that Dodd-Frank was conceived with the mega-banks in mind, not the smaller ones caught up in the shockwaves.\n\nOverall, the reform is not a dramatic walk-back.\n\nOverall, the reform is not a dramatic walk-back. In an interview with Vice News, Barney Frank \u2014 a former congressman from Massachusetts and a co-author of the bill \u2014 pointed out that 95 percent of the original law is unaffected. While the typical anti\u2013Wall Street progressives such as Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Ver.) have criticized the reform effort as giving too much to Wall Street, Dodd-Frank was designed to protect the American economy from a very specific thing: bank failure. Resisting these changes from the platform of \u201cdown with Wall Street\u201d is to forget why Dodd-Frank exists and impose on it a new purpose.\n\n\nThe bill now faces the House, where it\u2019s likely to receive numerous changes. The House passed its own bill in June, the Financial CHOICE Act, but the legislation failed to leave committee in the Senate. The House\u2019s bill is much more severe than the Senate\u2019s and includes provisions that moderate Democrats are unlikely to support.\n\nHopefully the House can settle for a milder, but still effective, reform that Senate Democrats can endorse. Dodd-Frank is a deeply flawed law, and the Senate\u2019s rollback is a good step forward.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Luma Simms", "body": "A \u201cRefugees Welcome\u201d mat at an immigration rally in New York, City, March 3, 2017.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Carlo  people would prefer to remain safely in the land where they were born.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAs of mid January, there were five immigration proposals before Congress; here they are gathered in one chart so we can easily compare them. If we could reduce all the arguments to a single question, it might be: How much immigration is good for America? I think most people agree that some amount of immigration is good for our country, and many would argue that some other amount is too much and is therefore bad for America. Where the political parties differ is in their estimate of how much immigration is the optimal amount, whom to allow in, and how to manage the system. They differ on quantity, quality, and control. However, across both sides of the aisle, there is one underlying agreement and unstated assumption: that immigration is good for the immigrant.\n\nIt is valid for Americans, acting in their own interest, to have a discussion about the quantity, quality, and control of our immigration system. And yet as an immigrant, I know that we also need to grapple with other questions that don\u2019t normally take center stage in our public debates on immigration. I want to bring to the forefront a thought that may seem peculiar to many Americans: that immigration is not always an unqualified good. Through discussions with immigrants, I have found that in many cases, the answer is not yes; often it is a qualified yes, and it would help us all to understand why this might be the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration can be a good. But it is good, healthy, and fruitful \u2014 for the immigrant and the adoptive country \u2014 only insofar as the \u00e9migr\u00e9 makes the choice freely. Some will argue that, by default, everyone who comes here (legally or illegally) chooses to do so, since the very act of coming here is an act of free will. I say no: It\u2019s not necessarily a free choice.\n\nIn the Summa Theologiae (I-II.6), St. Thomas Aquinas writes that \u201cviolence is directly opposed to the voluntary.\u201d The word \u201cvoluntary\u201d denotes something arising out of one\u2019s own inclination, that which proceeds from the will. He goes on to say that what we do through fear is \u201cof a mixed character,\u201d voluntary and involuntary. Acting out of fear, \u201cinasmuch it is repugnant to the will,\u201d is involuntary. However, an act that \u201chinders a greater evil that was feared\u201d is voluntary, and therefore willed freely. This understanding of how the will works shows us that the decisions people make to leave their homelands are fraught with complexity, and that some people are here not out of their own free will. And even when they do leave voluntarily to prevent greater harm, leaving can still feel forced because the option to stay in the country of origin was unviable.\n\nWhen a person is trapped between political oppression, religious persecution, war, slavery, poverty, economic upheaval, etc. and the opportunity to flee elsewhere in order to survive, he will choose survival via emigration (legal or illegal). Therefore, an individual in this situation is not quite choosing freely. He makes his choice under duress \u2014 and that is not a truly free choice. As a result, it is not an unqualified good for either the immigrant or the adoptive country.\n\n\n\n\nIn some sense, we know this is happening. We see refugees in the Middle East by the millions fleeing their homelands. Some years back, we saw children coming in waves from Central America to escape violence and brutal gangs that target children for use in the sex and drug trades. There\u2019s no question that for many of these people, coming to America is the best thing that can happen to them.\n\nThe benefits are tangible. They go from chaotic lands to one where they can lead a tranquil life. They leave behind societies where deceit is necessary for survival, and they make their new homes in an orderly country governed by the rule of law. They escape crushing oppression under strongmen and societies built for the powerful and connected. They find respect and dignity in this new land. Hungry and downtrodden and with no economic or education prospects, they arrive in an America where there is plentiful food, material help, and opportunities available to those willing to work hard. Those persecuted for their religion find solace in religious freedom. For those of us fortunate to live in America, the physical and spiritual blessings are many. This happy outcome, however, lulls us into complacency and distracts us from the tougher moral and philosophical questions of immigration.\n\nWhen immigrants are primarily coming to the U.S. to flee violence and fearful conditions in their countries of origin, they are not weighing risks and benefits to make a well-reasoned choice. As new immigrants, they face unknown perils and are exposed to cultural forces that often contradict their own customs and beliefs, leading to family instability, fragmentation, and often dispersion, especially intergenerationally. When they forsake the land of their heritage, they lose their livelihood. Sometimes they lose the value of their education because they cannot practice the profession for which they trained. Some lose all their earthly possessions. They lose their communities and huddle in subcultures to survive cultural disorientation. They lose a sense of who they are and to whom they belong. In short, they are affected economically, morally, physically, psychologically, and socially in unpredictable and sometimes negative ways.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to immigration cannot only be that of the Good Samaritan: have mercy on the immigrant and the refugee and give him a home. That\u2019s the answer sometimes, but it\u2019s not sustainable.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to immigration cannot only be that of the Good Samaritan: have mercy on the immigrant and the refugee and give him a home. That\u2019s the answer sometimes, but it\u2019s not sustainable. The more merciful answer \u2014 the truly good answer \u2014 is to do everything we can to give immigrants and refugees a future and a hope in their own lands.\n\nThe answer to our immigration problems will never be resolved simply through domestic-policy decisions: expanding or restricting the number of immigrants; favoring some countries over others; choosing high-skill workers using a points system, or choosing low-skill workers to \u201cdo the jobs Americans won\u2019t\u201d; preventing an immigrant from sponsoring members outside of his immediate family; dithering over what \u201cimmediate family\u201d means; building walls or opening our border; passing laws to deter migrants either legal or illegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot even a combination of these policy ideas will resolve our immigration problem. Nor can we resolve them by a crass and facile plan that objectifies immigrants, like the one recently posed by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl in Politico Magazine, which recommended that individual citizens \u2014 rather than corporations \u2014 sponsor their own immigrants, put them to work, and reap the economic benefits of an immigrant of their own. (The original title of the essay was \u201cWhat If You Could Get Your Own Immigrant?\u201d After readers expressed outrage, Politico changed it to \u201cSponsor an Immigrant Yourself.\u201d)\n\nThe only lasting and just resolution is to help create a world where people of all nations can stay in the land of their heritage if they choose, where immigration is by choice, rather than by necessity. The goal is not to eliminate immigration altogether but to create a more just world for all peoples. A by-product of such a world might be reduced immigration, but it need not be the goal.\n\nWe have a responsibility to create a better world for everyone, not just ourselves. St. John Paul II said to his audience on World Day of Migrants and Refugees 2000:\n\nThe Church hears the suffering cry of all who are uprooted from their own land, of families forcefully separated, of those who, in the rapid changes of our day, are unable to find a stable home anywhere. She senses the anguish of those without rights, without any security, at the mercy of every kind of exploitation, and she supports them in their unhappiness.\n\nOur unity under God, the call to solidarity, our duty to respect the dignity of fellow human beings, our ethical obligation to love the stranger go beyond welcoming him in our midst. They also require a radical rethinking of our resignation to upheaval in far-distant lands. Rather, as St. John Paul II said, and I am pressing for here: \u201cIt includes the advancement of everyone\u2019s right to be able to live peacefully in his own country.\u201d\n\n\nWe should not accept a world where people are forced \u2014 through violence and fear \u2014 to leave their homeland. The peoples of the world deserve to live in their own lands.

Even now, left-wing action groups coalesce around students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as they lobby for increased gun control, and there has been nary a peep in opposition.\n\nAmong those groups is an ever-present progressive specter, a professional lobbying group in its own right: Planned Parenthood. Along with Everytown for Gun Safety, MoveOn.org, and the Women\u2019s March LA, Planned Parenthood has chipped in to help the students strategize for next month\u2019s March for our Lives rally.\n\nAccording to a recent\u00a0Buzzfeed report, Planned Parenthood is \u201cteaching and hosting trainings\u201d for young activists across the U.S., working with gun-control advocate and former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, and \u201chelping the students with logistics, strategy, and planning for next month\u2019s March for Our Lives rally and beyond.\u201d\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to National Review\u2019s request for clarification regarding the exact nature of its support for the Parkland students.\n\nBut, of course, there have been no charges that these activist groups are exercising improper influence over the political process. Not only are the NRA\u2019s attackers wrong to suggest that the NRA is somehow responsible for the Parkland shooting, but their outrage over its spending is so obviously selective.\n\nNewsweek, for example, pushed back against NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch by pointing out that the NRA spent $5 million on lobbying last year. And several outlets \u2014 not to mention progressive politicians \u2014 have noted the money that GOP politicians accept from the NRA.\n\nBut when Senate Democrats shot down a largely popular 20-week abortion ban last month, there was no Newsweek article noting Planned Parenthood\u2019s lobbying statistics. Nor do mainstream outlets ever point to the campaign contributions that Democratic politicians accept from Planned Parenthood and its close cousin NARAL.\n\nDuring the 2016 election cycle alone, Planned Parenthood\u2019s political-action arms shelled out over $38 million to elect Democratic politicians. In its 2016\u201317 annual report, the group reported spending $40 million on \u201cpublic policy,\u201d as well as upwards of $175 million in such nebulous categories as \u201cmovement building,\u201d \u201cstrengthening and securing Planned Parenthood,\u201d and \u201cengaging communities.\u201d Undoubtedly, much of this money is flooding into the pockets of those who will push for policies that benefit Planned Parenthood\u2019s bottom line by protecting abortion on demand.\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood also \u2014 and unlike the NRA \u2014 rakes in over half a billion dollars in government funding each year. The group then turns around and spends much of that money not only to fund abortion procedures for low-income women (albeit indirectly), but also to lobby the federal government for additional funding and elect Democratic politicians who will vote to eliminate restrictions on that funding, and on abortion itself.\n\nIf the Left and its friends in the media truly cared about the influence of \u201cdark money,\u201d they would bother to report this information about Planned Parenthood instead of enabling the group\u2019s efforts to masquerade as a non-partisan, run-of-the-mill health-care provider.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Arthur Herman", "body": "Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson addresses a joint news conference in Brussels, Belgium on December 5, 2017.  (Francois  the Trump administration, unconventional, assertive thinking about foreign policy is in; ineffectual, process-driven diplomacy is out.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOf all the abrupt comings and goings in this administration, the dismissal of Rex Tillerson is undoubtedly the most important \u2014 maybe one of the most important firings since Harry Truman fired Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War.\n\nBy dismissing MacArthur, Truman drew a firm line between military and civilian authority that no soldier since has dared to cross. By dumping Tillerson, Trump has sent a similarly unambiguous message to the entrenched bureaucracy \u2014 Foggy Bottom\u2019s version of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 and to America\u2019s political elites about the future direction of U.S. foreign policy, hopefully one that will outlast his administration.\n\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s stipulate a couple of things.\n\nFirst, Rex Tillerson is a man of deeply conventional mindset during a deeply unconventional time, a man with no understanding of the rapidly changing face of world trends, especially but not limited to the rise of China as an aggressively revisionist power; Iran\u2019s determined bid for regional hegemony, including getting nuclear weapons; and the fateful dynamic of Russia\u2019s reassertion of its imperial ambitions in Eastern Europe and against the West under Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, Trump almost certainly did not realize this when he appointed Tillerson secretary of state. He probably assumed Tillerson would bring a businessman\u2019s mindset to the job, as a hard-headed negotiator with a shrewd nose for good deals sharpened by years as a CEO of a global energy corporation, ExxonMobil. Above all, he assumed Tillerson would be someone like himself, who would immediately recognize the place of American interests in the world, and fight for those interests with energy and boldness.\n\nTrump thought he was getting a lion in Tillerson. Instead, he was getting a Saint Bernard. Like the breed, Tillerson may be large and imposing at first glance; but he is no fighter, least of all against the bureaucratic mentality that permeates the U.S. State Department.\n\nHere we can stipulate a third point. Virtually every secretary of state since Cordell Hull has suffered one of two fates. Either he or she becomes the president\u2019s representative to the bureaucracy \u2014 and when necessary the ruthless enforcer of the chief executive\u2019s will in Foggy Bottom \u2014 or he or she becomes the bureaucracy\u2019s representative to the president, and assumes the role of bringing the State Department\u2019s views to the chief executive\u2019s attention \u2014 even at times serving as an advocate of those views.\n\nThe latter is what happened to Tillerson. It\u2019s also what happened to Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice when they became secretaries of state \u2014 and Condi, interestingly, was one of the people who most strenuously worked to get Tillerson on the Trump team. She clearly recognized in Tillerson the man who could become the State Department\u2019s watchdog in the Trump cabinet, someone who would uphold its world view revolving around incrementalism and process, and who, when U.S. interests conflict with a globalist agenda favored by elites, e.g. on global warming or the Arab\u2013Israeli \u201cpeace process,\u201d would automatically side with the elites.\n\nThat view includes North Korea and Iran, countries that foreign-policy elites conventionally look at through the lens of nuclear non-proliferation instead of seeing both as dangerous rogue nations who need to be stopped in their tracks. According to reports in the Washington Free Beacon, it was precisely on the issue of Iran that Tillerson ultimately came a cropper. \u201cWhite House allies warned Tillerson\u2019s senior staff for weeks that [his] efforts to save the [Iran] nuclear deal and balk on Trump\u2019s key demands regarding the deal could cost Tillerson his job,\u201d says the Beacon, a prediction that came true on Tuesday.\n\nMike Pompeo promises to be the kind of enforcer Trump will need in order to guide U.S. foreign policy and Foggy Bottom in a more aggressively pro-American direction.\n\nWhat happens next? Tillerson\u2019s successor, Mike Pompeo, promises to be the kind of enforcer Trump will need in order to guide U.S. foreign policy and Foggy Bottom in a more aggressively pro-American direction, especially with regard to Iran, whereas Pompeo as a congressman was deeply skeptical of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal (the congressman\u2019s staff and I worked together on exposing the cash-for-hostage deal in a couple of NRO articles), and on China. He is also the perfect secretary of state to have on hand before the planned meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un.\n\n\nThe other place to keep a sharp eye out for changes in foreign-policy leadership is in the National Security Adviser\u2019s office.\n\nUnconventional, assertive thinking about foreign policy is in; ineffectual, process-driven diplomacy is out, at least under Trump. The result of this year\u2019s midterms may determine how long this new trend lasts, before the deep state and political elites try to recapture their   Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, is the author of 1917: Lenin, Wilson, and the Birth of the New World", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Victor Davis Hanson", "body": "President Trump sits at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office in January. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Kevin  creates hysteria, both rabid antipathies and fervent support.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral chaos surrounds President Trump. Few dispute that. All argue over the origins, causes, and nature of these wild reactions to our president.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Left\u2019s Hatred\nTake the Left\u2019s loathing of Trump that arises from three sources.\n\nFirst, Trump supposedly has no shame. The traditional leftist use of invectives such as \u201cracist,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201chomophobe,\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d appears to have had little effect on Trump \u2014 as it seems to have done on McCain (who in 2008 ruled out attacks on Obama\u2019s personal pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright) and Romney (who passed on standing down debate moderator and rank partisan Candy Crowley).\n\nMore likely, smearing Trump only energizes him to become even more combative and uncouth. In the past, when a progressive tagged a Republican politician as some sort of irredeemable or deplorable bigot, he often inched left in search of penance or to preempt further attacks.\n\nIn the past, when a progressive tagged a Republican politician as some sort of irredeemable or deplorable bigot, he often inched left.\n\nTrump seems to enjoy the tumult, on the strange principle that only fire can tamp down the bias and unprofessionalism of a mostly pampered and overrated media. Does he do so by diminishing the aura and grandeur of the presidency, at least as the office is traditionally defined? Maybe, but half the country is likely to think \u201cHow dare the media smear the president?\u201d rather than \u201cHow dare the president of these United States stoop to reply in kind to petty CNN reporters?\u201d\n\nSecond, of course, Trump is politically dangerous to progressivism. In military terms, he is a strategic B-52 on a deep mission. Trump targets the enemy\u2019s homeland, even as his opponents\u2019 far-flung and attenuated expeditionary armies bog down abroad.\n\n\n\n\nThe Obama era gave us the conventional banality that \u201cdemography is destiny.\u201d A supposedly 67 percent so-called white population would inevitably shrink into electoral insignificance, gnashing its teeth in its \u201cwhite privilege\u201d irrelevance.\n\nAll who declared themselves nonwhite (to the extent that is still possible in a racially mixed, intermarried, often assimilated and integrated America) would grow in number. And they would purportedly vote in accordance with their perceived appearances and tribal affiliations. That calculus would inevitably mean that states such as Georgia and Arizona would soon follow the paradigm of California, Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico: They\u2019d flip blue.\n\nDemocrats accordingly pushed open borders and identity politics to ensure such an electoral utopia. But Trump overflew them and start bombing Democratic strongholds to the rear in more important swing states: Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nBy emphasizing class more than race, Trumpism itself was a potentially more dynamic idea than proportional representation on the basis of superficial appearance. When a Latino landscaper, poor white machinist, or inner-city African-American clerk considers voting for Trump (if as much for cultural or protest reasons as from empathy for his person or approval of his message), he subverts some of the basis of the present progressive party \u2014 a pyramid of enlightened elites at the top adjudicating what is necessary for a broad foundation at the bottom, made up of nonwhites and the supposedly dependent poor. It does not take much of a defection of minority and poor voters to weaken the progressive project, when the percentages of white and working-class voters alienated from it are so large.\n\nEqually explosive is the syndrome in which middle-class moderates and independents are tired of being damned as privileged and biased, on the basis of their appearance \u2014 often by those who enjoy far more privilege and exhibit far more bias. For all the hype that the stereotypical Trump voter was uneducated and without a degree, Trump appealed as much to the college educated and professionals for what he at least was not, rather than for what he was.\n\n\n\n\nThird, Trump earns leftist disdain for being the anti-Obama, much as conservatives feared Obama for being the anti-Reagan. In other words, just as a charismatic Obama sought to overturn the entire Reagan revolution of low taxes, deregulation, smaller government, and strong defense by the sheer force of his person, so too Trump really does threaten to undo Obama\u2019s foreign policy, and energy, tax, regulatory, and education agendas.\n\nBut whereas Obama rammed down an unpopular Obamacare and lost the House in the 2010 midterms, it may be that Trump rammed down a popular tax cut that will not result in a 2010-like backlash. Under Obama, the Democratic party has become the progressive resistance. While heading hard left, it has left the center free to be reclaimed by opportunistic Republicans, as evidenced by substantial gains at the local, state, and congressional levels. Trump could make Obamism irrelevant \u2014 a historical footnote by the end of his first term. That would be especially ironic, given that Obama\u2019s \u201cpen and phone\u201d executive-order mode of governance proved so toxic for progressives in the tit-for-tat hands of Trump.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTrump Voters\nNever Trumpers often feel that Trump\u2019s latest escapes are embarrassingly excused as sophisticated \u201cthree-dimensional chess\u201d by Trump supporters. I have rarely found many Trump voters who believed that. More often, they shrug, saying they wish Trump would curb his tweets, rallies, and ad hominem outbursts.\n\nTo the extent that they do not object enough to Trump\u2019s behavior, it is not because they believe he is a chess master of political strategy. Rather, they assume that, for strange reasons, no one can quite predict the effects of Trump\u2019s weirdness, in a stifling politically correct society. More than half the nation has lost confidence in progressivism, the administrative state, and the Republican hierarchy and establishment. In the past, experts erred in thinking that Trump had so debased the candidacy, or the office, of the presidency that he was sure to implode. In that climate, his supporters are not about to believe that anyone can accurately fathom the ultimate effect of his so-called unpresidential behavior.\n\nWhere critics see chaos, some voters are likely to see clarity and comeuppance.\n\nOther Trump voters no doubt enjoy the ensuing blood sport. They feel that most of his targets have it coming and that the resulting chaos, within limits, is much-needed purging. Out of the daily conundrum, Trump nevertheless has managed so far to achieve greater prosperity at home and stability abroad than did Obama, while the reputation of a habitually prejudiced media is plummeting fast. Where critics see chaos, some voters are likely to see clarity and comeuppance.\n\nWhat would lose Trump his strategically located, and thereby winning, 46 percent of the voting public?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, Trump cannot abandon signature issues that separated him from his 16 primary rivals and helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in key swing states that Democrats had mostly taken for granted since 2008 and in many cases since 1992. For example, Trump cannot embrace amnesty and open borders masquerading as \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d or optional overseas interventions, or major new restrictions on the Second Amendment, or new expansions of pro-abortion laws. If he became a so-called globalist open-borders centrist, Trump could still win 46 percent of the 2020 vote but lose the purple belt from Ohio to North Carolina and with it the Electoral College.\n\nSecond, if Trump keeps boomeranging his own side, at some point his invective could become suicidal. His supporters don\u2019t mind if he descends to spar even with Alec Baldwin or the NFL. They will eventually tire of him if he cruelly continues to dog Jeff Sessions or H. R. McMaster. If his own messengers are the enemy, then at some point he\u2019ll lose the resonance of his message as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNever Trump\nForget for a moment the ethical and moral dimensions of the Never Trump conservative argument, and concentrate on its practical effect. Why did the conservative establishment that loathed Trump \u2014 much of it influential as measured by print and television exposure and by state and federal political offices \u2014 have so few consequences in 2016?\n\nAbout the same percentages of Republican voters chose Trump when the Republican elite was fragmented as went for McCain and Romney, when it was united. That raises unpleasant scenarios.\n\nWere Never Trumpers simply fewer in number and far less influential than they had supposed? Or was the small number of voters swayed by their antipathy more than offset by the greater number of voters energized to oppose Never Trumpism? Did those Tea Party or Reagan Democrat conservatives who did not turn out for a much-praised Romney cost Romney the election, while their enthusiasm in 2016 ensured victory for the much-attacked Trump?\n\n\n\n\nDid Trump\u2019s ascendance snap Never Trumpers into self-realization that they were not of the same ilk as even his reluctant supporters? Or did their frenzied loathing spark Trump\u2019s voters into seeing that his Republican haters were more interested in the style and class of conservativism than in its message and pragmatic ramifications for the American public?\n\nThere are other questions not fully addressed.\n\nOne: Is Trump\u2019s crudity really without precedent in the past? We know that prior presidents on occasion were as gross or grosser than Trump: JFK\u2019s callous seduction of teenage staffers in officio, LBJ\u2019s genitalia exposure, Clinton\u2019s Oval Office bathroom-sex antics, Obama\u2019s crude jokes about \u201ctea-baggers\u201d and the Special Olympics. Then there are the many scandals, from lying about Vietnam, to Watergate, to the recent weaponizing of the IRS, DOJ, and FBI.\n\nSo is the writ that even if Trump\u2019s buffooneries are no more crude than those of past presidents, they are uniquely daily events, rather than infrequent episodes? And is that frequency, rather than the degree of controversy, the reason that conservatives who once pushed Trump\u2019s agendas now condemn those policies as tainted \u2014 because of Trump\u2019s fingerprints on them? Were Clinton\u2019s agendas less of a danger than Trump\u2019s person, as if a hard progressive\u2019s Ivy League background and administrative-state comportment mattered more than the populist conservatism of a combed-over rabble-rouser?\n\nThe media from 2008 to the end of 2016 simply would have thought it racist to report that Obama as a senator did a smiling photo-op in 2005 with anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.\n\nSecond is the matter of media emphases. We\u2019ve never had a president whose media coverage was 90 percent negative. In the past, it would have been unthinkable for a Walter Cronkite to report that LBJ had used the n-word in a private White House conversation or dictated to aides while defecating. The media from 2008 to the end of 2016 simply would have thought it racist to report in detail that Obama as a senator did a smiling photo-op in 2005 with anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan in the basement of the Capitol or that he had damned Israel in a long-suppressed speech in praise of pro-Palestinian advocate Rashid Khalidi.\n\nIt may be the case that Trump is deemed unpresidential and unfit because his bad behavior is more frequent and extreme than that of past presidents, and that this assessment is not a result of virulently anti-Trump media bias. (If an Obama scandalous tree fell loudly in a forest devoid of media, did it really make a sound \u2014 or fall at all?) But so far, the Never Trump movement has not made such an argument convincingly. Trump voters now still believe that the mostly positive message matters more than the flawed messenger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, there are understandably legitimate differences in conservative attitudes toward Trump, the first U.S president without prior political or military experience and service. But should such acrimony extend to the Trump voter?\n\nIn attributing moral or ethical laxity to Trump voters, Never Trumpers sidestep the argument that in a Manichean world, not voting for Trump was a de facto vote for the alternative \u2014 a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton continuum. Is condoning Trump\u2019s antics by default the moral equivalent of its practical antithesis: ensuring a Supreme Court, economy, and foreign policy that would, in conservatives\u2019 views, radically injure millions of Americans for a generation?\n\nIf it were really unethical or foolhardy to vote for Trump, is it by extension far more unethical to serve Trump? In other words, are H. R. McMaster, Jim Mattis, John Kelly, Betsy DeVos, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pompeo far more morally suspect for empowering such a president, in a fashion that outweighs their principled notions of serving the country?\n\nIs it still sustainable to suggest that Trump is not a conservative but a dangerous liberal or demagogic wolf in conservative sheep\u2019s clothing? The doctrinaire conservative Heritage Foundation now claims that two-thirds of its proverbial 334 conservative agenda items have been already met by Trump \u2014 and at a pace far faster than that achieved even by former president Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth, are there Never Trump formulas for presidential candidates and issues that can translate formidable conservative local, state, and congressional successes to the White House, in a way that dozens of past Republican primary and general presidential candidates seemed unable to?\n\nFinally, is there any serious introspection as to why so many misjudged Trump\u2019s trajectory? After Trump\u2019s supposedly impossible election, many doubled down and suggested that he would soon be impeached, or quit, or prove non-conservative or impotently conservative. And the critics continue in this vein today. What was continually missed, and why, and how is such acknowledgment critical in offering believable assessments to come? Finally, if 10 percent of the party might threaten to sit out or leave due to either Trump\u2019s message or his person, would that matter to the 90 percent, given that the party has both won and lost presidential elections with a 90 percent Republican majority but not without voters in Midwest swing  Davis  contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "George Will", "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.,  January 20, 2018\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Reuters/Joshua  Supreme Court must strike down a California law that compels pro-life crisis-pregnancy centers\u2019 speech in violation of the First  routinely behave badly, but sometimes their mean-spiritedness comes to the Supreme Court\u2019s attention.\u00a0On Tuesday, it\u00a0will\u00a0hear oral arguments concerning the constitutionality of measures that California\u2019s government has taken to compel pro-life entities to speak against their own mission.\n\nCrisis-pregnancy centers are nonprofit facilities usually owned and operated by people with religious objections to abortion. Some centers are licensed medical facilities providing pregnancy testing, ultrasound examinations, medical referrals, prenatal vitamins, etc. Other centers are unlicensed because they provide only nonmedical services (self-administered pregnancy-testing kits, parenting-preparation training, baby clothes, diapers, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nA 2015 California law requires licensed crisis-pregnancy centers to tell clients (in pamphlets, in waiting-room signs) this: \u201cCalifornia has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care and abortion for eligible women.\u201d Unlicensed centers are required to notify clients that the center \u201cis not licensed as a medical facility by the state of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.\u201d\n\nSo, government compels licensed centers to provide free advertisements for government-provided abortions. And government compels unlicensed centers to say \u2014 in large fonts, in as many as 13 languages, even on their own websites \u2014 that they do not have medical providers that the government itself says, by not requiring them to be licensed, are not necessary for the services they provide. The government\u2019s obvious nasty purpose is to make the unlicensed centers\u2019 clients unnecessarily uneasy.\n\nCalifornia tailored the law to target only crisis centers: It exempts from the compelled-speech requirements all women\u2019s-health-services providers that dispense abortifacients. The crisis centers are incorporated as religious organizations and their mission is dictated by the content of their beliefs. The pro-choice government is targeting the centers to exercise one-sided influence on some women\u2019s choices. The Cato Institute\u2019s Ilya Shapiro, author of an amicus brief supporting the crisis centers, says it is telling that California has no comparable law requiring abortion providers to post advertisements for adoption agencies or other alternatives to abortion.\n\nCalifornia tailored the law to target only crisis centers: It exempts from the compelled-speech requirements all women\u2019s-health-services providers that dispense abortifacients.\n\nNeither the 2015 law\u2019s legislative history nor the state\u2019s brief in defense of the law provides any evidence for the state\u2019s charge that the centers \u201cconfuse,\u201d \u201cmisinform,\u201d or otherwise harm women. And the law clearly has nothing to do with ensuring informed consent by clients of the crisis-pregnancy centers.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose reasoning is frequently novel and whose rulings are frequently reversed, upheld California\u2019s law on the ground that government often can regulate the practice-related speech of professionals it licenses. The Supreme Court has never embraced this carve-out from the First Amendment, which would give government an open-ended power to require whomever the government deems a \u201cprofessional\u201d to communicate whatever message the government favors.\n\nPro-choice defenders of California\u2019s patently content-based and discriminatory law should consider the following. Suppose a pro-life state government were to require all publicly and privately funded abortion providers to advertise on their premises the locations and services of crisis-pregnancy centers. Or even to post the following accurate information on their premises, websites, and advertisements:\n\nEighteen days after conception, the unborn baby\u2019s brain begins to form. At about three weeks, the heart begins to beat, circulating the baby\u2019s blood. At six weeks, brain waves are detectable and at seven weeks, the baby is kicking. By week nine, the baby can suck his or her thumb and move his or her head. From weeks ten through 13, bones harden and teeth, fingerprints, and fingernails begin to form. At 26 weeks, the spinal cord and pain receptors are in place for pain transmission to the brain.\n\nA pro-life government\u2019s point in compelling the placement of this factual notice would be not just to inform women contemplating having an abortion but to incline them against doing so. The abortion providers would be compelled to disseminate a message contrary to their beliefs about the morality of abortion. This would be (as Shapiro says of California\u2019s compelled-speech law targeting the crisis centers) government putting \u201cits thumb on the scale in a social debate, by conscripting individuals to help spread a particular message.\u201d\n\n\nAs the Supreme Court has held, freedom of speech means freedom to choose what to say \u2014 and what not to say. The crisis-pregnancy centers have a right that California\u2019s bullying government also has and that it would do well to exercise more often: the right to remain silent.\n\n\u00a9 2018, Washington Post Writers   Will is a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning syndicated columnist.

The chance of extraditing any of the accused from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is zero.\n\nSome of the Russians\u2019 Keystone Cops efforts to disrupt the election favored Donald Trump (as well as Bernie Sanders). Yet Mueller\u2019s team made it clear that the Russians neither colluded with any U.S. citizens nor had any material effect on the election\u2019s outcome.\n\n\n\n\nBut from here on out, there will be ironies, paradoxes, and unintended consequences with just about everything Mueller does.\n\nIs it now time to prosecute foreigners for attempting to interfere with a U.S. election? If so, then surely Christopher Steele, the author of the Fusion GPS dossier, is far more culpable and vulnerable than the 13 bumbling Russians.\n\nSteele is not a U.S. citizen. Steele colluded with Russian interests in compiling his lurid dossier about Donald Trump. Steele did not register as a foreign agent. And Steele was paid by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to find dirt on political rival Trump and his campaign.\n\nIn other words, Steele\u2019s position is far worse than that of the Russians for a variety of reasons. One, he is easily extraditable while the Russians are not. Two, his efforts really did affect the race, given that the dossier was systematically leaked to major media and served as a basis for the U.S. government to spy on American citizens. Three, unlike with the Russians, no one disputes that American citizens \u2014 Hillary Clinton, members of the Democratic National Committee, and anti-Trump partisan Glenn Simpson and his Fusion GPS team \u2014 colluded by paying for Steele\u2019s work.\n\nMueller\u2019s team has also leveraged a guilty plea from former Trump national-security adviser Michael Flynn for making false statements to FBI investigators. If the Flynn case is now the Mueller standard, then we know that a number of high-ranking officials are vulnerable to such legal exposure.\n\nDepartment of Justice official Bruce Ohr deliberately omitted on federal disclosure forms the fact that his wife, an expert on Russia, worked on the Fusion GPS dossier.\n\nSteele himself probably lied to the FBI went he claimed he had not leaked the dossier\u2019s contents to the media.\n\nHillary Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills likely lied to FBI investigator Peter Strzok (who had also interviewed Flynn) when they claimed they had no idea that Clinton was using a private and illegal email server until the story went public. In fact, Abedin and Mills had communicated with Clinton over the same server \u2014 as did then-president Barack Obama, who likewise denied that he knew about the improper server.\n\nMueller\u2019s existential problem has been with him from the start. Due to the shenanigans of his discredited friend Comey and a rabid media, he was appointed to investigate crimes that did not exist.\n\nFormer FBI director James Comey likely lied to Congress when he claimed that his exoneration of Clinton came after he had interviewed her. We now know from documents that he drafted a statement about the conclusion of the investigation even before he met with her.\n\nAs far as obstruction charges go, Mueller has other possible targets. Former attorney general Loretta Lynch met secretly with Bill Clinton on a jet parked on a tarmac in Phoenix shortly before the Justice Department closed the probe of Hillary Clinton and chose not to pursue charges against her. Comey said Lynch asked him not to use the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d when discussing the Clinton email probe. Text messages between Strzok and fellow FBI official Lisa Page suggest that Lynch knew in advance about the conclusions Comey would reach in the investigation.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nMueller is under enormous pressure to find collusion between the Trump team and Russia, or to find that the Trump team obstructed justice by trying to hide such collusion. But neither likely happened. Mueller was appointed at a time of national hysteria, brought on by partisan journalism based on a leaked dossier \u2014 itself a product of a discredited British agent working with Russian sources while being paid by the Clinton campaign.\n\nWorse still, the effort to hide the origins and the use of that dossier to obtain court permission to spy on American citizens may be a classic case of obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller\u2019s existential problem has been with him from the start. Due to the shenanigans of his discredited friend Comey and a rabid media, he was appointed to investigate crimes that did not exist. But if they did exist, collusion and obstruction were committed by those associated with the Clinton campaign and even by members of the Obama administration.\n\nInvestigating any possible crimes committed by members of the Clinton campaign or the Obama administration apparently is taboo, given the exalted status of both. But every time Mueller seeks to find incidental wrongdoing by those around Trump, he only makes the case stronger that behavior by those involved in the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration should be investigated.\n\n\n\n\nIf such matters are not treated in an unbiased manner, we are not a nation of equality under the law, but a banana republic masquerading as a democracy.\n\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tribune Content Agency,  Davis  contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "(Joshua  House aide Kellyanne Conway violated federal law by engaging in political advocacy during a pair of cable-news appearances last year, according to the U.S. Office of the Special Counsel (OSC).\n\nIn a report released Tuesday, OSC special counsel Henry Kerner indicated that Conway\u2019s\u00a0advocacy \u201cfor and against candidates\u201d in the Alabama special election constituted a violation of the Hatch Act, which prevents executive-branch employees \u2014 save for the president, vice president, and a few other high-ranking officials \u2014 from participating in certain political activities.\n\n\nThe violations stem from a pair of appearances, one on CNN\u2019s\u00a0New Day and another on Fox News\u2019 Fox  Friends,\u00a0in which Conway disparaged Democratic Alabama senate candidate Doug Jones.\n\n\u201cFolks, don\u2019t be fooled.

But far more important than what he has said is what Trump has done. That same caveat applies to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nStart with two givens: Vladimir Putin is neither stupid nor content to watch an aging, shrinking, corrupt, and dysfunctional \u2014 but still large and nuclear \u2014 Russia recede to second- or third-power status. From 2009 to 2015, in one of the most remarkable and Machiavellian efforts in recent strategic history, Putin almost single-handedly parlayed a deserved losing hand into a winning one. He pulled this off by flattering, manipulating, threatening, and outsmarting an inept and politically obsessed Obama administration.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Obama presidency and the tenures of Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Russia made astounding strategic gains \u2014 given its intrinsic economic, social, and military weaknesses. The Obama reaction was usually incoherent (Putin was caricatured as a \u201cbored kid in the back of the classroom\u201d or as captive of a macho shtick). After each aggressive Russian act, the administration lectured that \u201cit is not in Russia\u2019s interest to . . . \u201d \u2014 as if Obama knew better than a thuggish Putin what was best for autocratic Russia.\n\nA review of Russian inroads, presented in no particular order, is one of the more depressing chapters in post-war U.S. diplomatic history.\n\nJust watching the film clip of Hillary Clinton presenting the red, plastic Jacuzzi button to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva remains painful, more so than even George W. Bush\u2019s simplistic, reassuring commentary after he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes. Under the Obama-Clinton reset protocols, Russia was freed from even the mild sanctions installed by the Bush administration, imposed for its 2008 Ossetian aggressions. As thanks, in early 2014, Russia outright annexed Crimea. It used its newfound American partnership as an excuse to bully Europe on matters of energy and policy, confident that under American reset, it would face little NATO pushback.\n\nRussia assumed de facto control over large sections of eastern Ukraine. Its aggression sent nations of Eastern Europe and the Baltic States into a panic and raised fears of another Ukrainian-like intervention \u2014 thereby wresting pro-Russians concessions on the premise that it was nearby and unpredictably dangerous while the U.S. was distant and predictably inert. Russia succeeded in helping to dismantle previously negotiated U.S. missile-defense arrangements with the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nRussia since 2013 had sought to interfere in U.S. elections with impunity, so much so that as late as October 18, 2016, on the eve of the anticipated Clinton landslide, Obama mocked any suggestion that an entity could ever successfully warp the outcome of a U.S. election. (\u201cThere is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America\u2019s elections. There\u2019s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I\u2019d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.\u201d)\n\nAfter a near 40-year hiatus, Russia was invited into the Middle East by the Obama administration. It soon became the power broker in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.\n\nAfter a near 40-year hiatus, Russia was invited into the Middle East by the Obama administration. It soon became the power broker in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq and to some extent offered passive-aggressive support for Israel and Turkey \u2014 a position of influence that it retains to this day and that would now be hard to undo. It posed as a \u201chelper\u201d to the Obama administration with Iran and helped broker the disastrous Iran deal \u2014 and then used U.S. acquiescence to Iran to fuel the ascendance of the Iran-Hezbollah-Assad crescent.\n\nUnlike the United States, Russia had no need to maintain the nuclear umbrella, which protected the clients of the U.S. post-war alliance. Despite America\u2019s nuclear responsibilities, Russia convinced the Obama administration to cut back radically on our stockpile of deployable nuclear weapons. Such promised reductions in deliverable weapons came at a time of massive U.S. defense cuts and cancellations, and delays in missile defense.\n\nRussia was relieved by Obama\u2019s efforts to stall fracking and make huge swathes of American territory off-limits for U.S. oil and gas exploration \u2014 as this would tighten global oil markets and enhance Russian petroleum export profits. The Obama administration inexplicably approved sale of a sizable portion of scarce U.S. uranium holdings to a Russian company, despite the fact that it was known that investors connected with the Kremlin and uranium interests had paid Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech in Moscow. In additions, the chairman of the so-called Uranium One consortium gave $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation, a fact that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not disclose, even though she had promised (during her confirmation process) to reveal all such possible conflicts of interest.\n\nMost significantly, the Obama administration had created a false orthodoxy of d\u00e9tente, a politically correct Lala Land, in which to question any of these lopsided Russian advantages was to be considered idiotic or unpatriotic.\n\n\n\n\nMitt Romney learned that in the third 2012 presidential debate when he was tagged as a Cold War hack by a snarky Barack Obama for even suggesting that an opportunistic and conniving Russia was our chief geostrategic rival. Even when Putin became arrogant and greedy in his winnings, and finally, mostly through hacking, helped to collapse the disastrous Russian-reset misadventure, Hillary Clinton looked back on her role in Russian reset and made the astonishing claim that it had been a success: \u201cI think it was a brilliant stroke, which in retrospect it appears even more so, because look at what we accomplished.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama revealed himself with an open-mic promise to outgoing Russian puppet president Dmitri Medvedev, which, by any reasonable logic, could only be explained as a promise by Obama to retard U.S. missile-defense efforts in Europe in exchange for good Russian behavior during Obama\u2019s reelection bid. (\u201cOn all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it\u2019s important for him to give me space. . . . This is my last election. . . . After my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d) Had Donald Trump been caught in such a private conversation offering a Russian president a quid pro quo \u2014 massaging future U.S. national defense policy in a pro-Russia direction in exchange for Russian behavior that would help Trump\u2019s electoral chances \u2014 he would probably be facing impeachment on grounds of real Russian collusion.\n\nBy the 2016 campaign, however, amid allegations of Russian hacking of Democratic and Clinton campaign communications, the Obama administration could no longer see its failed reset as \u201ca brilliant stoke.\u201d As a result, the architects of one of these embarrassing concessionary policies became not just embarrassed; she pointed to Trump\u2019s loud bombast as proof that he\u2019d colluded with and appeased the Russians. And so began the real collusion between the Clinton campaign and elements in the U.S. government to smear Trump as a Russian patsy.\n\nThe odd result of such failed reset policies and bought opposition research was a yarn that the neophyte and recklessly talking Donald Trump was a clever Russian lackey. Yet Trump\u2019s strategic, defense, and energy policies, and his later appointments of realist Russian skeptics \u2014 such as General James Mattis, General H. R. McMaster, Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo, and, yes, Rex Tillerson \u2014 were anathema to Moscow.\n\nThe Trump administration has armed Ukrainians, reentered the Middle East to bomb ISIS, squared off against Russia, and decimated Russian mercenaries in Syria. Trump also has ensured that the U.S. is well placed to usurp Russia as the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u00a0within about twelve months.\n\nIn just its first year, the Trump administration has armed Ukrainians, reentered the Middle East to bomb ISIS, squared off against Russia, and decimated Russian mercenaries in Syria. Trump also has ensured that the U.S. is well placed to usurp Russia as the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u00a0within about twelve months. He upped the defense budget, ordered the updating of the nuclear arsenal, bantered NATO members to increase their defense contributions, and traveled to Eastern Europe to bolster Western solidarity,\n\nGiven the media dismissal of Donald Trump and its eagerness to canonize Barack Obama\u2019s eight years with another eight of Hillary Clinton, Russia by late 2016 went from a deity to a demon. It was reinvented as Mitt Romney\u2019s enemy of liberal democracy, and, after the election, served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s excuse for losing the election \u2014 and Putin became the new ally and collaborator of Donald Trump!\n\nThus spread the fertilizer that fed the national hysteria leading to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate a crime \u2014 active collusion with the Russians to warp an election \u2014 that likely did not exist. And if it did exist, it was probably committed by Hillary Clinton, her campaign, members of the Obama administration, and the miscreants of Fusion GPS. After months of politicized special-counsel investigations, together with House and Senate investigations, Americans are only now being apprised of what we always should have known from the beginning:\n\n1) Russia implants chaos as cheaply as it can inside the U.S. How bold it is depends on how much it worries about a U.S. response. During the Obama reset tenure, it felt there were no repercussions and thus few bounds to its disinformation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n2) Like the Obama administration and the Hillary Clinton campaign, Moscow was convinced that Hillary Clinton would win the nomination and would be a shoo-in during the general election. Predictably, Russia invested comparatively meager resources to encourage pro-Sanders and pro-Trump campaign efforts to stir up trouble. It may have hacked into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails, and perhaps it even found access to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private, illegal, and deleted emails to embarrass the likely future president and perhaps to find avenues for threats of future blackmail against her. Note well, that if the sure thing had happened \u2014 the election of Hillary Clinton \u2014 then no one but the Russians might have known, and possibly disclosed at a time and under conditions of their choosing, the shenanigans of Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, and his Russian sources.\n\n3) The result of the Russian-fed, Clinton-bought Steele dossier is as depressing as was the earlier Russian wins from the reset: The gullible and partisan FBI hierarchy is now discredited and compromised. The intelligence agencies, politicized under John Brennan and James Clapper, may soon share the embarrassments of the FBI. The critical FISA-court protocols have been undermined by deceit and untruth. The highest echelons of the Obama administration were probably complicit in surveillance of political opponents, spying that was predicated on Russian sources for a bogus dossier, and some Obama officials may well have committed felonies by unmasking the names of U.S. citizens and leaking them to the press.\n\nThe highest echelons of the Obama administration were probably complicit in surveillance of political opponents, and some Obama officials may well have committed felonies by unmasking the names of U.S. citizens and leaking them to the press.\n\n\nThe verdict on Russia, the Obama administration, and the Clinton campaign is now becoming clearer. Russian reset resurrected Putin\u2019s profile and hurt U.S. interests. It grew out of a partisan rebuke of the Bush administration\u2019s perceived harshness to Russia and was later massaged to help Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign by granting Russia concessions in hopes of a foreign-policy success that would lead to perceived calm. Russia deliberately inserted itself into the 2016 election, as it had in previous elections, because 1) it had suffered few if any prior consequences, 2) it wanted to sow chaos in the American political system, and 3) it saw a way to warp Clinton\u2019s efforts to smear Donald Trump, first, no doubt to compromise a likely President Clinton, and, in unexpected fashion, later to undermine an actual President Trump.\n\nAt very little cost, Russia has embarrassed American democracy, played the media for the partisans they are, completely discredited the Clinton campaign and name, and created a year of nonstop hysteria to undermine the Trump administration.\n\n\nAnd it is not over  Davis  contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin D.

There are two ways to understand that sentence, and both apply: Among major news publications, the Times regularly exhibits an unparalleled level of illiteracy on the subject of firearms, and it exhibits comparable illiteracy on practically no other subject. Even on such self-acknowledged weak spots as American religion, the Times rarely sinks to the level of outright stupidity that characterizes its coverage of firearms and related crimes.\n\nE.g., this from Michael D. Shear:\n\nPresident Trump \u2014 under pressure from angry, grieving students from a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last week \u2014 ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas.\n\nA bump stock does not convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon, and there were no automatic weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting. Bump-firing is a (nifty but largely useless) rapid-firing technique, not a technology. Bump stocks do make it easier to bump fire, but they are neither necessary nor sufficient. Bump-firing is something that must be learned, and it can be achieved without a bump stock: Some shooters use rubber bands, some use their belt loops, and some use no accessory at all. Beginning shooters, who often have poor grips, bump-fire accidentally from time to time, and bump-firing does not even require a semiautomatic weapon \u2014 you can bump-fire a revolver, if you work at it.\n\nOr you could just learn to shoot really fast.\n\nIf it is the case that bump stocks \u201cconvert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons,\u201d then some inexperienced shooter \u2014 I\u2019m assuming Shear is not a gun nut \u2014 ought to be able to simply install one on an ordinary semiautomatic rifle and achieve a fully automatic rate of fire. I\u2019ll make Shear and his editors at the Times a public wager: that no New York Times writer or editor without prior training in bump-shooting can achieve a fully automatic rate of fire (about 700 rounds per minute on the M4 carbine, the AR-15\u2019s military cousin) from an ordinary AR-15 equipped with a bump stock. I\u2019ll provide the rifle, the ammunition, and the range time. All Michael D. Shear of the Times has to do is show up and then write up what happens.\n\n\nShear and his Times colleagues write routinely about \u201cassault weapons,\u201d a meaningless term inasmuch as there is no generally agreed-upon definition of \u201cassault weapon.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t stop such Times stalwarts as Thomas Friedman from writing, with mystifying confidence: \u201cThey know full well that a common-sense banning of all military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, or mandating universal background checks for gun buyers or to prevent terrorists and the mentally ill from buying guns, would not curb the constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d Friedman doesn\u2019t know what he thinks he knows full well, much less what gun-rights activists \u201cknow full well.\u201d This illiteracy, too, is worth unpacking.\n\nIf by \u201cassault weapon\u201d he means rifles of the sort included in the 1994 ban \u2014 which, it is worth remembering, had no measurable effect on crime \u2014 then what he is talking about is semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines. (One of the major defects of the 1994 ban was its poorly conceived definitions, but, most broadly, that\u2019s what it was designed to limit.) Prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines would mean prohibiting the sale of the majority of rifles sold in the United States\u00a0 \u2014 the vast majority, in all likelihood. AR-style rifles alone account for about one in five rifle sales.\n\nIf we include semiautomatic handguns with detachable magazines \u2014 and why wouldn\u2019t we, given their much greater prominence in crime? \u2014 then what Friedman proposes is a prohibition on something like 80 percent or more of the firearms sold in the United States. Friedman may not see how that conflicts with the Second Amendment, but the courts do.\n\nWhich other constitutional rights (free speech? freedom of the press?) would Friedman be comfortable to see revoked based on an American citizen\u2019s appearance on a secret government list without charges, legal process, or recourse?\n\nHe could also use a refresher in due process: We already forbid terrorists to buy firearms; what Friedman is talking about is people who are suspected of wrongdoing or who, in the case of the no-fly list, simply share a name with someone suspected of wrongdoing. I wonder which other constitutional rights (free speech? freedom of the press?) Friedman would be comfortable to see revoked based on an American citizen\u2019s appearance on a secret government list without charges, legal process, or recourse.\n\nFriedman, warming to his self-indulgent, self-righteous mode, writes: \u201cThey know full well that most voters are not asking to scrap the Second Amendment, but for common-sense gun laws that could prevent or reduce more school shootings and would not interfere with any decent Americans\u2019 right to own guns for hunting, sports or self-protection.\u201d Setting aside that bit of constitutional illiteracy \u2014 the Second Amendment isn\u2019t about hunting or sport shooting; does anybody really think that the No. 2 item on the Bill of Rights is about a hobby? \u2014 Friedman does not seem to know that semiautomatic rifles, including AR-style rifles, are in fact among the most common hunting and sport-shooting firearms.\n\n\n\n\nFor hunters of everything from coyotes and other small predators to feral hogs, AR-style rifles are extraordinarily common. And a fair number of big-game hunters use similar rifles in more powerful calibers, for example Wilson\u2019s popular semiautomatic hunting rifles. Functionally, the only difference between a semiautomatic hunting rifle and the more common .223 AR-15 rifles is that the hunting rifles are much, much more powerful. Until recently, the .223 round was prohibited for hunting deer and other sizable game, not because the AR-15 is a \u201cweapon of war\u201d but because the caliber was considered insufficiently powerful to use humanely on deer.\n\nA thinking man with a working knowledge of the actual U.S. firearms market might have considered the fact that there is no way to ban nefarious black AR-15 rifles without also prohibiting common hunting rifles (never mind that the AR-15 is a common hunting rifle) or \u2014 sillier still \u2014 prohibiting the modestly powered \u201cmilitary\u201d guns while leaving the much more powerful hunting rifles on the market. But that thinking man would probably have a hard time writing for the Times, which apparently is opposed to thinking at all on this subject.\n\nSo-called assault rifles are so rarely used in crimes that the federal government doesn\u2019t keep separate data on them. Actual military weapons \u2014 fully automatic rifles and other ballistic exotica \u2014 are statistical unicorns when it comes to violent crime.\n\nAll long guns (which is to say, all rifles and shotguns) combined account for a tiny fraction of the firearms used in violent crimes in the United States; so-called assault rifles are so rarely used in crimes that the federal government doesn\u2019t keep separate data on them. Actual military weapons \u2014 fully automatic rifles and other ballistic exotica \u2014 are statistical unicorns when it comes to violent crime. Do you know which firearms are most commonly used to commit crimes? The most common ones.\n\n\nOur progressive friends enjoy boasting of their purportedly evidence-based approach to social problems, but when it comes to firearms, it is pure Kulturkampf. Firearms, in their view, are an atavistic enthusiasm for rural primitives and right-wing militia nuts, a hobby that must be tolerated \u2014 if only barely \u2014 because of some vestigial 18th-century political compromise. And that is why the Times can publish observations such as this one from psychiatrist Amy Barnhorst \u2014 \u201claws designed to preserve the civil liberties of people with mental illness place limits on what treatments can be imposed against a person\u2019s will\u201d \u2014 without even bothering to try to account for the fact that we also have some laws, right there in the Bill of Rights, that limit the ways in which government can impose on other civil rights, including the right to keep and bear arms. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t even understand the right protected in the Second Amendment as a civil right.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the Times remains unembarrassed by routinely displaying on this subject a level of ignorance that would cause its editors to blush in shame if the subject were, say, Shia\u2013Sunni relations or the geography of Togo.

In the aftermath of the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, House Democrats are making another attempt at banning so-called assault weapons. A \u201csupermajority\u201d (156 of 193) of House Democrats have signed on, leaving no doubt as to the party\u2019s move left on gun control. The bill, called the \u201cAssault Weapons ban of 2018,\u201d is a non-starter \u2014 at least so long as Republicans control the House \u2014 but it\u2019s a mistake to simply write off any proposal backed so overwhelmingly by one side of the aisle. This debate isn\u2019t going away.\n\nSo let\u2019s deal with he bill on the merits, beginning with taking on its inherently deceptive name. The bill calls for a \u201cban\u201d on both \u201csemi-automatic assault weapons\u201d and \u201clarge capacity magazine feeding devices\u201d (magazines holding more than ten rounds). But then \u2014 in the very next paragraphs \u2014 it exempts every single weapon and magazine lawfully possessed before the enactment of the law.\n\nIn other words, the assault-weapons ban isn\u2019t a ban at all. It would leave tens of millions of guns and magazines on the streets. In fact, nobody actually knows the number. Rifle sales have skyrocketed. Counting rifles made and distributed in the U.S. only (in other words, not counting imports), the number has increased from 1.6 million in 2007 to 4.2 million in 2016. During that time, the AR-15 has been among the most popular rifles sold in the U.S.\n\nIn other words, even if the proposed \u201cban\u201d were enacted, a person who wanted an AR-15 could find an AR-15. A person who wanted a large-capacity magazine could find a large-capacity magazine.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \u201cassault weapons\u201d is also inherently deceptive. The drafters include within the definition not just the scary-looking, military-style rifles such as the AR-15 but also semi-automatic pistols that can \u201caccept a detachable magazine\u201d and have at least one common additional feature such as a threaded barrel. The proposed ban also includes semi-automatic shotguns with, among other things, a pistol grip, a fixed magazine that accepts more than five rounds, or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of any size.\n\nThis is the worst kind of gun control. Any measure that preserves the ability of criminals to access guns while restricting the access of law-abiding Americans is a measure that fundamentally impairs the very purpose of the Second Amendment. For the law-abiding, the existing stock of tens (hundreds?) of millions of weapons and magazines would instantly become more expensive. Yet with the slightest premeditation, a criminal could easily circumvent the ban. It\u2019s a simple matter, in fact, to make your own high-capacity magazine.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s sheer speculation that a ban on so-called assault weapons would reduce mass shootings, reduce gun suicides, or reduce overall gun violence. Rifles are rarely used in \u201cnormal\u201d gun crimes (blunt objects and fists kill more people), and you don\u2019t need an AR-15 to kill yourself (rifle suicides are rare). And as ample, grim experience shows, you don\u2019t need an AR-15 to commit a horrific mass killing. America\u2019s worst school shooting \u2014 the Virginia Tech massacre \u2014 was committed with handguns, and the list of deadly handgun shootings is long and sad.\n\nMass shooters are among the most committed criminals in the entire United States. They often fantasize about their attacks for years and plan them for months. They can find an AR-15. Yet an AR-15 isn\u2019t an indispensable weapon for a spree killer. They have options.\n\nAt best, then, the argument is that making an AR-15 slightly more difficult to obtain won\u2019t make spree killings less common, but it might make spree killings less lethal. Again, that\u2019s more speculation, assuming that the most committed killers 1) can\u2019t get their hands one of the tens of millions of legal weapons still on the streets; and 2) that a man with a semi-automatic pistol isn\u2019t just as deadly as a man with a rifle. Neither assumption is warranted.\n\nIn fact, experience with the previous federal assault-weapons ban demonstrates that any benefit gained by decrease in crimes committed with one type of weapon is often offset by increases in crimes committed with other weapons, leaving no net benefit. Here\u2019s the key language from a comprehensive study of the impact of the federal assault-weapons ban:\n\nWe cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation\u2019s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury, as we might have expected had the ban reduced crimes with both AW [assault weapons] and LCMs [large-capacity magazines].\n\nAnd that study is based on a world where tens of millions fewer assault magazines and large-capacity magazines were in circulation. The facts on the ground have changed, substantially, since 2004.\n\nPolice officers need 15 rounds in a pistol to defend themselves, but I don\u2019t need 15 rounds to defend myself? How is that coherent?\n\n\nBut we have to offset the known and undeniable negatives against the entirely speculative positive effect. Millions of law-abiding Americans would find it more difficult to obtain guns and magazines that would match the foreseeable criminal threat. Indeed, the necessity of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines to confront the criminal threat is illustrated by the proposed ban itself, which exempts law-enforcement officers. Police officers need 15 rounds in a pistol to defend themselves, but I don\u2019t need 15 rounds to defend myself? How is that coherent?\u00a0\n\nAn assault-weapons non-ban does nothing to address the underlying causes of mass shootings. It does nothing to empower citizens or police to respond to troubled individuals before they pull the trigger, and it does nothing to enhance the ability of citizens to defend themselves once engaged. In fact, it may well put the armed citizen at a meaningful disadvantage. It\u2019s not the answer to mass killings. It\u2019s not even \u201can\u201d answer.

Becerra went quite poorly for those hoping the Court would endorse California\u2019s effort to impose speech restrictions on pro-life pregnancy centers. The Justices took turns pointing out obvious unconstitutional applications of the law, questioning whether California had gerrymandered its law to target pro-lifers, and wondering about the quantum leaps in First Amendment doctrine that would be required to sustain the law.\n\nBut the most important exchange \u2014 and the one that is indicative of a longer-term problem for the pro-abortion side in a range of speech and religion cases \u2014 related to whether the law was even needed in the first place. Supporters of pregnancy-center speech restrictions often claim that the laws are needed because pregnancy centers use deceptive advertising and other tricks to mislead women. California itself had argued that its law was necessary so that pro-life centers do not \u201cattract women into their facilities based on confusion or deception\u201d about their services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a rather glaring problem with this argument. If pregnancy centers engaged in the kind of behaviors used to justify these laws \u2014 such as fraud, false advertising, practicing medicine without a license, or impersonating a doctor \u2014 then that behavior could be prosecuted using general laws that make such behaviors illegal regardless of the topic of speech. And surely blue-state attorneys general who hope to have a political future in the Democratic party (such as Respondent Xavier Becerra, and his predecessor, now-Senator Kamala Harris) would be eager to bring such cases both to protect women and to please their base. Yet there is no record that they ever even tried, which severely undercuts the claimed need for a special restriction on speakers who talk about pregnancy options.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s lawyer probably expected to be questioned on this topic, but he may have been taken aback by the identity of the Justice who pressed him: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He should not have been surprised \u2014 Justice Ginsburg, after all, joined an opinion several years ago in McCullen v. Coakley (the Massachusetts abortion-clinic buffer-zone case) taking Massachusetts to task for failing to identify \u201ca single prosecution brought under [existing] laws within at least the last 17 years.\u201d That case was a 9-0 loss for the government that was trying to use a new, targeted law to regulate speech where it could have achieved its goals with existing, speech-neutral laws.\n\nAt the NIFLA argument, Justice Ginsburg appeared focused on a similar problem for California, asking whether California had \u201cever brought charges against any of these places for false and misleading advertising?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTo his credit, California\u2019s lawyer began his answer with the truth: that the state had not brought such charges under its law that already makes false advertising illegal for everyone. But, in an effort to suggest there was still a problem to be solved, he added, \u201cI believe that the city and county of San Francisco has, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat last part is likely false \u2014 at least in relation to the recent pregnancy-center controversies, San Francisco has not brought charges against pregnancy centers for false and misleading advertising. Instead, San Francisco actually behaved much like California did: It complained about alleged false advertising, never pursued any charges, and then used its own complaining as a basis to pass a special law targeting the speech of pro-life pregnancy counselors. That law is at issue in another pregnancy-center speech case that is right behind NIFLA v. Becerra at the Supreme Court, called First Resort, Inc. v. Herrera. The court in First Resort explained how San Francisco wrote a letter about alleged false advertising, but does not suggest that any charges were actually brought. With my colleagues at the Becket Fund and co-counsel from Locke Lord, I represent First Resort \u2014 and no such charges have been brought.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s error is easy enough to understand, and it reveals a problem that has plagued the pro-abortion side of speech and religion cases at the Supreme Court for the past several years. He presumably knew that San Francisco had made noise about alleged false statements, but had missed that they had never actually even tried to enforce the generally applicable law, instead proceeding to target pro-life speakers for special restrictions. In short, San Francisco cried wolf, and it looks like California\u2019s lawyer may have mistakenly fallen for it.\n\nBut as in McCullen, Justice Ginsburg seemed keenly aware of the difference between merely complaining about an ideological opponent and actually having proof of a real problem that needs to be solved by restricting speech. Other recent decisions in pregnancy-center cases confirm that Justice Ginsburg\u2019s instinct is correct. In a parallel case, the Fourth Circuit recently noted the absence of any proof of any actual harm: \u201cAfter seven years of litigation and a 1,295\u2013page record before us, the City does not identify a single example of a woman who entered the Greater\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0Center\u2019s waiting room under the misimpression that she could obtain an abortion there.\u201d And in striking down a similar Montgomery County, Maryland, statute, Chief Judge Deborah K. Chasanow found that, although she had given the county years to prove its case, the government\u2019s arguments failed because of \u201cthe lack of any evidence that the practices of [pregnancy centers] are causing pregnant women to be misinformed which is negatively affecting their health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNor are the pregnancy-center cases isolated instances of wolf-crying. For many years and over a series of cases involving Hobby Lobby, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other religious groups, advocates told the Supreme Court that the contraceptive mandate was necessary to protect a compelling interest in women\u2019s health. But when pressed by the Supreme Court, the Obama administration ended up admitting that there were actually many other ways for women to get contraceptives. And a new study by the Guttmacher Institute actually finds that the mandate was not compellingly important after all, as it brought \u201cno changes in contraceptive use patterns among sexually active women.\u201d So much for that argument.\n\n\n\n\nAnd despite overheated claims that the Hobby Lobby decision would open the floodgates to a raft of religious-liberty claims by businesses and others, recent studies show nothing of the kind actually occurred.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a pattern here: In order to pass a law or try to win a lawsuit, over-the-top claims are made about why the government needs to restrict the speech or free exercise of an ideological opponent or the sky will fall. But when the proof comes in, the claims turn out to be false or vastly overstated.\n\nCrying wolf may work well for political purposes, for raising money, or for convincing partisans on one side to enact a law. But our system of adversarial litigation \u2014 with its requirements of sworn evidence, candor to the court, and discovery \u2014 is actually well equipped to tell the real wolves from the imagined ones. Credibility is being burned with each episode in which the claimed problem turns out to have just been an excuse to target one\u2019s opponents. And Justice Ginsburg\u2019s questions show that, while she supports legalized abortion, she still understands that the First Amendment protects people on all sides and requires governments to only restrict speech when it actually has a compelling need to do so.

You\u2019re trusted and valued.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that Trump will decide to have a summit with North Korea and not consult his secretary of state before announcing it. If you\u2019re secretary of state, you\u2019re usually either in Foggy Bottom or overseas. At any given moment, this president can jump on Twitter and announce to the world that you\u2019re wasting your time.\n\n\nI told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man\u2026\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017\n\n\n\n\nSo utter contempt and disregard for a man trying to enact the president\u2019s own policies. Who does the president think Rex Tillerson is, Jeff Sessions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe Trump\u2019s problems with Tillerson stem from no preexisting relationship. (Think about it, when was the last time a president had a secretary of state who he had no previous working relationship with?) Ideally, a president and secretary of state have something of a mind-meld so that the secretary can negotiate effectively on the president\u2019s behalf. Perhaps Pompeo, having spent so much more time with Trump than Tillerson, will know where Trump\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d are and be more effective at helping Trump reach agreement with other countries.\n\nPerhaps Pompeo will we welcomed at Foggy Bottom; some State Department employees are desperate for a change. We all ought to wish him well, and wish Gina Haspell well as the new CIA director. But one can\u2019t help but wonder if in a year or so Pompeo will find himself in a similar situation \u2014 trying to offer diplomatic advice to an inherently undiplomatic president who doesn\u2019t like being told what to  Posts", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew C. Mccarthy", "body": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (right) talks with Rep. Trey Gowdy during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, November 14, 2017. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Aaron P.  should appoint a Justice Department prosecutor to investigate the  good for the goose . . .\u201d is more an understandable impulse than a useful rule of thumb in legal controversies, particularly legal controversies in which an error has been made.\n\nThe White House and congressional Republicans have watched in ire as the Trump administration has been tied in knots by the no-boundaries Mueller investigation. \u201cOkay,\u201d they\u2019re thinking, \u201cnow, it\u2019s payback time.\u201d There appear to have been highly irregular investigative tactics used in probing the Trump campaign \u2014 particularly, but not exclusively, by the Obama administration. Why not, then, appoint another special counsel to squeeze the squeezers? Why not turn the tables?\n\n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nOriginal Sin: A Prosecutor but No Crime\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made a foundational error in appointing Robert Mueller to be special counsel to investigate . . . well . . . um . . . come to think of it, that was the error:\u00a0The investigation has no parameters, and thus no  conducted by prosecutors are supposed to be rooted in known crimes\u00a0\u2014 or, at the very least, articulable suspicion that known crimes have occurred. Under the governing regulations, to justify the appointment of a special counsel,\u00a0those crimes must form the basis for two salient findings: (1) that the Justice Department has a conflict of interest so severe that it cannot conduct the investigation in the normal manner, and (2) that it is necessary to appoint, from outside the Justice Department, a quasi-independent prosecutor. This special prosecutor is to be given a grant of investigative jurisdiction limited to the crimes that the Justice Department is too conflicted to investigate \u2014 and no other crimes, unless the special counsel explicitly requests, and the Justice Department grants, an expansion of jurisdiction. (See here, where I address Paul Manafort\u2019s claim that his indictment violates regulations limiting special-counsel jurisdiction.)\n\nAs we have repeatedly observed (see, e.g., here, here, and here), Rosenstein failed to adhere to the regulations, appointing Mueller to conduct a counterintelligence investigation. Because counterintelligence is not lawyer work, and because the objective of counterintelligence is to gather information about a foreign power, not to build a criminal case against a suspect, prosecutors are not ordinarily assigned to counterintelligence investigations. In the Mueller appointment, then, counterintelligence is camouflage for something that should never happen: a special counsel unleashed to hunt for crimes to prosecute despite the absence of known crimes warranting appointment of a special prosecutor.\n\nCollusion with Russia? That is so two tweets ago!\n\nSo now, predictably, we have this absurdity: A special counsel, whose purported mandate is to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible Trump-campaign \u201ccollusion\u201d in it (whatever that means), is looking into whether Jared Kushner\u2019s financial woes\u00a0influenced Trump-administration policy towards Qatar.\n\nCollusion with Russia? That is so two tweets ago!\n\n\n\n\nMind you, there may be good reasons to probe Kushner\u2019s possible self-dealing as an adviser to his father-in-law, the president \u2014 and, for that matter, Kushner\u2019s reported failures to disclose significant foreign contacts during his background check (which clearly complicated his ability to qualify for a security clearance). Similarly, it may well be that scheming by Paul Manafort and Richard Gates with a Kremlin-connected Ukrainian political party in the dozen years prior to the 2016 campaign should be scrutinized. The point, however, is that these matters have nothing to do with Russian interference in the election. There is no reason our $29 billion\u2013per\u2013annum\u00a0Department of Justice could not have investigated them without the administration-crippling appointment of a special counsel.\n\nNow it is Republicans on the verge of the same mistake, which would inevitably lead to similar abuses and the paralysis of critical government functions.\n\nThe Goodlatte-Gowdy Call for a Special Counsel\n\nTwo House Republican heavyweights, Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Oversight Committee chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, have penned a letter\u00a0to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein seeking the appointment of another special counsel. The quasi-independent prosecutor they envision would\n\nreview decisions made and not made by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, including but not limited to evidence of bias by any employee or agent of the DOJ, FBI, or other agencies involved in the investigation; the decisions to charge or not charge and whether those decisions were made consistent with the applicable facts, the applicable law, and traditional investigative and prosecutorial policies and procedures; and whether the FISA process employed in the fall of 2016 was appropriate and devoid of extraneous influence.\n\nI\u2019ve highlighted \u201cthe investigation\u201d because, among other problems with the letter, it is not clear whether the chairmen are referring only to the Trump-Russia investigation. Clearly, that elusive probe (taken over by Mueller in May 2017) is the main focus of the letter. But Goodlatte and Gowdy also mention the possibility that bias infected \u201cdecisions to charge or not charge\u201d; that suggests that they also have in mind the Clinton-emails investigation \u2014 a probe involving the other 2016 presidential candidate, in which no indictment was filed despite strong evidence of felony wrongdoing. Though I do not agree with the Goodlatte-Gowdy proposal of a second special counsel, the chairmen are wise (if I am reading them right) to combine consideration of the Clinton and Trump probes. The disparate treatment they were given \u2014 kid gloves for the former, unrestrained zeal for the latter \u2013 is among the most disturbing elements of the controversy.\n\nThe patent flaw in the Goodlatte-Gowdy proposal is the same one that plagued Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Mueller: There is no triggering crime.\n\nBefore explaining my disagreement with them, I must first observe that Chairmen Goodlatte and Gowdy, along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), continue to perform an invaluable service in exposing investigative irregularities and demanding accountability. Where I part company with them is not over whether we need an investigation; it is over whether that investigation should be done by a special counsel.\n\nThe patent flaw in the Goodlatte-Gowdy proposal is the same one that plagued Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Mueller: There is no triggering crime. As I\u2019ve repeatedly shown, that is the condition precedent for a special-counsel appointment under the governing regulations. I suspect that is why Goodlatte and Gowdy do not discuss the application of the regulations \u2014 \u00a0they breezily claim that \u201cthe relevant Federal regulations provide\u201d for the appointment of a purportedly \u201cindependent Special Counsel,\u201d but they do not try to demonstrate that this is so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not so.\n\nInvestigative Excesses Are Usually Not Crimes\n\nIt is very bad for investigators to exhibit bias, to allow bias to taint their exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion, to depart from Justice Department guidelines, and to provide unverified information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court). But none of these things is a crime \u2013 at least, not obviously so.\n\nThere is no criminal statute addressing bias on the part of agents and prosecutors. We all have biases. It would not be possible to have bias-free investigators. Even if investigators unprofessionally act on their biases, this does not necessarily mean the investigative decisions they make are indefensible on the merits \u2014 so proving prejudicial bias is difficult.\n\nAs for departing from Justice Department guidelines, such guidelines typically come with a disclaimer that deviations from the guidelines are not grounds for criminal or civil action. Indeed, such a disclaimer appears at the very beginning (introductory section 1-1.000) of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Manual:\n\nThe Manual provides only internal Department of Justice guidance. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter civil or criminal. Nor are any limitations hereby placed on otherwise lawful litigative prerogatives of the Department of Justice.\n\nWhy do we have guidelines and manuals? Because we want our law-enforcement officers to operate within clearly legitimate boundaries, not constantly to test the margins of their lawful authority. Having guidelines encourages this. It provides a standard for internal discipline when excessive or abusive conduct occurs. But if deviations from guidelines were to become a basis for legal action, including criminal prosecution, one of two things would happen: The guidelines would be repealed, or they would be rewritten in a broadly permissive manner, endorsing investigative behavior that might be justifiable in exigent circumstances but would be grossly inappropriate the rest of the time. If we want to have meaningful guidelines, the trade-off is that guidelines departures cannot lead to lawsuits \u2014 although they must lead to administrative discipline, including termination if the misconduct is serious enough.\n\nFinally, it is a serious dereliction for the FBI and Justice Department to provide the FISA court with unverified information, such as the allegations in the Steele dossier (which, based on what is publicly known at present, were essentially uncorroborated). As explained in a letter\u00a0Chairman Nunes sent to Attorney General Sessions last week, it is a violation of the FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide\u00a0to include anything other than \u201cdocumented and verified information\u201d in FBI applications for FISA-court surveillance warrants.\n\n\n\n\nAll that said, there is a big difference between (a) giving a court information that is unverified because it has not been adequately corroborated and (b) knowingly giving a court information that is false. The former is abusive; the latter is felony obstruction of justice.\n\nIt is highly unusual for FISA surveillance applications to be debated in public, as have the ones that targeted former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It is not at all unusual, however, for FBI agents and prosecutors to be accused of including inaccurate information in applications for criminal-law surveillance warrants \u2014 claims nearly indistinguishable in kind from the claim that the FBI and Justice Department included dubious Steele-dossier allegations in the FISA warrant applications. These criminal-law claims are such a commonplace that our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has established tests for evaluating them \u2014 asking such obvious questions as: whether the allegedly inaccurate information was, in fact, inaccurate; whether, if inaccurate, the information was necessary to the showing of probable cause; and whether the inaccurate information was provided to the court in good-faith error (e.g., an agent reasonably credits an informant who turns out to be wrong) or in a conscious effort to deceive.\n\nIn the vast majority of instances where wrong is done, the wrong involves an overzealous error made in good-faith belief that incriminating evidence would be found.\n\nIf a court has been given faulty information in a criminal case, the remedy is that evidence derived from the warrant is suppressed. Concededly, this \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine does not have a counterintelligence analogue \u2014 once our intelligence agencies know something they should not have learned, we can\u2019t tell them to \u201cun-know\u201d it. The point, nevertheless, is that the remedy of suppression is preferable to subjecting officials to punishment because, in the vast majority of instances where wrong is done, the wrong involves an overzealous error made in good-faith belief that incriminating evidence would be found. Thankfully, intentional frauds on the court are unusual \u2014 although, as my friend Kevin Williamson has chronicled (e.g., here) they do happen. (I\u2019ve noted the same on occasion.)\n\nSimilarly, criminal defendants seeking to have warrant evidence suppressed routinely claim that agents and prosecutors withheld material information that should have been disclosed to the judge \u2014 just as it has been claimed (quite correctly) that the Clinton campaign\u2019s connection to the Steele dossier should have been disclosed to the FISA judges. Again, such failures to disclose, even when wrong, are generally based on erroneous judgment calls about whether disclosure was required under criminal-law discovery rules, which can be a complex question. Frauds on the court are highly unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I am not arguing that law-enforcement officials never commit criminally actionable obstruction of justice; just that it is very rare. It is much more common that officials screw up than that they malevolently break the law. This is a distinction to which we must be sensitive: If police and prosecutors came to believe enforcement errors would lead to prosecutions or civil lawsuits against them, they would refrain from taking any but the most uncontroversial enforcement actions. In another context, Heather Mac Donald has written compellingly about this phenomenon as \u201cthe Ferguson effect.\u201d To discourage policing is to erode the rule of law, imperiling societal peace and prosperity.\n\nGood-Faith Grounds for the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nIt is not inconceivable that crimes have been committed by investigators in the Trump-Russia investigation. Currently, however, there are not concrete grounds to conclude that they were. (I am addressing only what is raised in the Goodlatte-Gowdy letter. I am not addressing potentially illegal leaks of investigative or classified information, which the letter does not specifically address, and which the Justice Department says it is already probing.) Without concrete grounds for a criminal investigation, a special-counsel appointment could not be justified.\n\nIf there was a good-faith basis for the FBI and Justice Department to investigate possible Trump\u2013Russia ties of a corrupt nature, it would be very difficult to prove that investigators broke the law in conducting their investigation \u2014 in contrast to proving that they engaged in abusive excesses that call for administrative discipline but not prosecution. One need not accept the politically inflated Trump\u2013Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative in order to acknowledge that there was a basis for an FBI investigation. One need not endorse abusive investigative tactics in order to acknowledge that it would be very challenging to establish that they amounted to prosecutable crimes.\n\n\n\n\nCandidate Trump made alarmingly ingratiating statements about Vladimir Putin, a murderous anti-American dictator (whose regime is suspected of still more assassination attempts on Western soil, carried out just this weekend in Britain). During the campaign, Trump praised Putin as a strong \u201cleader,\u201d and when asked about Putin\u2019s political assassinations, Trump countered that \u201cour country does plenty of killing also.\u201d Once, he even expressed hope that the Kremlin\u2019s agents would find former Secretary Clinton\u2019s deleted State Department emails. While this was a very dumb thing to joke about, it was not a call for hacking, as many Trump detractors insist \u2014 it was a political jab calling attention to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s security carelessness and destruction of thousands of government files.\n\nWith that as the mood music, Trump brought Manafort and Gates into his campaign at a very high level. They had notorious ties to Kremlin-backed Ukrainians. Those ties are not speculation;\u00a0they are established fact. Moreover, Trump publicly identified Carter Page, an obscure Kremlin apologist, as one of his campaign\u2019s handful of foreign-policy advisers. Simultaneously, the FBI was alerted\u00a0that the Russians might be in possession of thousands of hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton, and might have made a point of communicating this claim to George Papadopoulos, another of the few identified Trump foreign-policy advisers.\n\nThen the bureau was approached by Christopher Steele. Far from being unknown to the FBI, this former British spy was a proven asset, having provided information that helped the bureau crack the FIFA soccer case \u2014 the Obama Justice Department\u2019s most significant international corruption and racketeering prosecution. Steele alleged that Trump was involved in a corrupt conspiracy with Russia, in which Manafort, the point man, was using Page as an intermediary. Because of his prior work with the bureau, Steele would not have been ignored by the FBI, regardless of the Clinton campaign\u2019s sponsorship of his work \u2014 that would have been a reason to be skeptical, but not dismissive. The bureau also would have taken the claims themselves seriously \u2014 not necessarily believing them, but looking into them \u2014 given the preexisting reasons for concern: Trump\u2019s pro-Putin rhetoric; the backgrounds of Manafort, Gates, and Page; and the report about possible Russian involvement in hacked Democratic emails.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear: None of this would excuse the FBI\u2019s failure to verify Steele\u2019s information before presenting it to the FISA court. None of this would justify the failure to inform the FISA court that Steele\u2019s dossier was an opposition-research project commissioned by the Clinton campaign. None of this establishes Trump\u2013Russia \u201ccollusion,\u201d nor does it erase the fact that such collusion exists less as reality than as a political narrative to rationalize Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss. Moreover, to acknowledge the reasonableness of FBI and Justice Department concerns about the Trump-Russia information just outlined is only to raise more questions about the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s tanking of the Clinton-emails case, which featured solid evidence of crimes, not mere suspicion.\n\nThere were good-faith reasons for concern about ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian regime.\n\nMy point is simply this: It would not be credible to claim that the Trump-Russia investigation was fabricated out of whole cloth. Even stipulating that the top FBI/DOJ hierarchy was biased against Trump, and thus too quick to credit sensational allegations of Trump wrongdoing, there were good-faith reasons for concern about ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian regime. These reasons do not prove that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic emails; that Carter Page was a Russian agent; that Manafort and Gates were choreographing a Trump\u2013Russia conspiracy; or that Trump\u2019s Russia rhetoric was anything more than a political novice\u2019s effort to do what American administrations have been doing for decades \u2014 seek better relations with Moscow.\n\nAgain, if there were good-faith grounds for the FBI and Justice Department to look into Trump\u2013Russia ties, it becomes very difficult to imagine that investigative excesses transformed into criminal misconduct. And without crimes, there is no basis in the regulations to appoint a special counsel.\n\n\n\n\nAssign a Solid U.S. Attorney, Not a Special Counsel\n\nClearly, there needs to be an investigation. Goodlatte and Gowdy are entirely right about that. Regardless of whether there is a solid basis for a criminal investigation, the Justice Department is always responsible for ensuring the integrity and lawfulness of its own operations \u2014 it must investigate credible allegations of misconduct by its component agencies, including the FBI. Goodlatte and Gowdy are also right to suggest (as I believe they have) that the contemplated investigation should scrutinize the handling of the Clinton-emails probe \u2014 how it comported, or failed to, with Justice Department practices and policies. The chairmen are right yet again that the jurisdictional limitations on Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s very able inspector general, make it impossible for him to conduct the investigation that is needed.\n\nNeither, however, should that investigation be conducted by a special counsel.\n\nThe special counsel is a pernicious institution that operates outside the procedures and discipline of a normal U.S. attorney\u2019s office \u2014 where the merits of every case must be weighed against those of every other in the competition for limited investigative and prosecutorial resources. Special-counsel appointments should be resisted whenever possible. Indeed, with Robert Mueller already \u2014 and inevitably \u2014 straying far afield from his original \u201ccollusion\u201d inquiry, we should be discussing how that investigation can be limited and brought to a just conclusion; we should not be encouraging the launch of yet another special-counsel extravaganza. Never again should a special-counsel investigation be commenced in the absence of concrete evidence that a crime has been committed \u2014 a crime that serves to cabin the special counsel\u2019s investigation lest it become a fishing expedition without end.\n\nHere is what should be done. Attorney General Sessions should assign a U.S. attorney from outside Washington to conduct a probe of how the Clinton-emails and Trump-Russia investigations were handled by the Justice Department and FBI. A good model would be John Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut just confirmed by the Senate. In 2008, when he was that office\u2019s deputy U.S. attorney, he was assigned\u00a0by Bush Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the Bush administration\u2019s program for interrogating high-level terrorist detainees, specifically, the possible destruction of evidence\u00a0of the CIA\u2019s mistreatment of prisoners. Durham, a highly regarded career prosecutor, was permitted to continue in this capacity when the Obama Justice Department expanded his inquiry. The investigation was closed without charges in a credible, professional manner in 2011.\n\nUnder my proposal, the designated U.S. attorney would handle this investigation along with the rest of the work of his or her office \u2014 this would not be a prosecutor whose only assignment is to pursue a single target or set of targets, and who thus faces great pressure to file charges, no matter how far afield from the original focus of the investigation, in order to justify the appointment. Unlike the inspector general, the U.S. attorney would have full jurisdiction to convene a grand jury; investigate any crimes attendant to the Clinton-emails and Trump-Russia probes; issue subpoenas and seek other court process (such as search warrants) to secure evidence; and prosecute any violations of law by persons inside or outside of government.\n\nAs in any investigation, the U.S. attorney would also have the discretion not to file charges, and to refer any government officials found to have engaged in misconduct for administrative discipline. The attorney general could further require that the U.S. attorney file a report about the investigation\u2019s findings. This report could be shared with Congress; it could also be released to the public to the extent consistent with laws and guidelines that control the disclosure of investigative information regarding uncharged persons. (Obviously, information about charged persons, if any, would be disclosed in connection with their prosecutions.)\n\nSome will argue that my proposal fails to ensure the \u201cindependence\u201d enjoyed by special counsels brought in from outside the government, such as Robert Mueller. My first reaction is to ask: Was there ever a prosecutor more independent than Patrick Fitzgerald? Yet he was not brought in from the outside: When the Valerie Plame leak controversy broke, rather than ensure the appearance of independence by recruiting a former prosecutor from private practice, the Bush Justice Department decided to place an investigation of the Bush administration in the hands of the Bush-appointed U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois \u2014 Fitzgerald, who was given the assignment by then\u2013deputy attorney general James Comey. As Scooter Libby can attest \u2014 having been indicted for process crimes even though investigators had determined there was insufficient evidence to charge the actual leaker, Richard Armitage \u2014 the Bush administration was cut no slack by Fitzgerald, then a career prosecutor who is remembered for conducting a hyper-aggressive probe.\n\nMost of the ways special counsels exhibit independence are not salutary.\n\n\nThat example aside,\u00a0the\u00a0principal failure of \u201cwe need an independent prosecutor\u201d argument is that special counsels are not independent. Just like U.S. attorneys, they answer to the attorney general (or deputy AG if the AG is recused). Mueller is effectively independent only because Rosenstein has chosen to be passive; by the Constitution and regulation, Mueller reports to Rosenstein, who could assert more active supervision. Meanwhile, most of the ways special counsels exhibit independence are not salutary \u2014 particularly their propensity to expand the duration and scope of investigations that most prosecutors would drop if the original rationale for opening the investigation had proven fruitless.\n\nChairmen Goodlatte and Gowdy are right: The investigators need to be investigated. But we do not need a special counsel to do it. There is no reason that Attorney General Sessions cannot structure a probe that can be credibly conducted by the Justice Department\u2019s standard investigative arrangement: the FBI, in conjunction with a U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. While some recent errors by federal officials have deservedly drawn rebuke, these institutions typically do solid, professional work, uninhibited by partisanship.

Tobin", "body": "Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon speaks during a campaign rally for Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore in Midland City, Alabama, December 11, 2017. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Jonathan  himself creates a different set of problems.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOnly a few months ago, it seemed as if Steve Bannon\u2019s plan to take over the Republican party wasn\u2019t just a fantasy. After he left the White House last summer, the former presidential adviser was talking big about a new version of the Tea Party \u2014 the uprising that knocked off several mainstream Republicans earlier in the decade. This time it would be orchestrated by the populists at Breitbart.\n\nBut Bannon staked everything on Roy Moore\u2019s campaign to represent Alabama in the Senate. Moore beat the establishment pick in the primary, and in doing so forced many Republicans, including President Trump, to back Moore in the general election. The defeat of the deeply flawed former judge \u2014 who, between the primary and the general election, was credibly accused of sexual misconduct in years past \u2014 was the beginning of the end for Bannon\u2019s plans.\n\n\nThe loss of a safe Republican Senate seat woke up the conservative movement and the party to the potential cost of Bannon\u2019s plans. More to the point, it woke up Trump, who after a year in office has a better appreciation of the value of a GOP Senate majority than perhaps he did when Bannon was running his presidential campaign.\n\nThe fruits of that realization were on display last week, when a Bannon recruit bowed to pressure from Trump and pulled out of a Nevada primary against incumbent senator Dean Heller. Danny Tarkanian had Bannon\u2019s support and made it clear he wasn\u2019t happy about giving up the chance to upend a relative moderate. But after the president tweeted that Tarkanian should run for an open House seat rather than engage in a bitter primary that would probably weaken the Republicans\u2019 chances in the general, the challenger felt he had no choice but to do as he was told.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of the tweet made two things clear. The first is that Bannon\u2019s chances for leading a populist revolt are officially over. The second, if it wasn\u2019t already obvious, is that the Republican party now belongs to Donald Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to throw his weight around in a manner that reflects Mitch McConnell\u2019s vision for how to pick Senate candidate has to cheer the GOP establishment. It could also make it easier for Republicans to hold on to their Senate majority in 2018 or even add to it, thanks to the large number of red-state Democrats running for reelection.\n\nBut this is far from assured. To the contrary, the fact that the GOP is now Trump\u2019s party, rather than one that can defend its congressional majorities on ideological or traditional partisan lines, is exactly why it might lose ground in November.\n\nThat the Republicans are all working for Trump in one way or another has been painfully obvious since the 2016 GOP convention in Cleveland. While a few Never Trump dissidents continue to speak out on the right, almost all have ceased pretending to have any affection for the party. The few Republican officeholders who are actively opposing Trump, such as Ohio governor John Kasich, Senator John McCain, and especially Senator Jeff Flake, do not labor under any delusion that they are anything but lonesome dissidents whose views are out of touch with those of the GOP electorate. Flake might be flirting with a quixotic run against Trump, but he openly admits he\u2019s not running for reelection to the Senate because he knows he has no chance of winning a Republican primary.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a painful irony to being the party of Trump: The president\u2019s flaws overshadow the GOP\u2019s merits \u2014 but his popularity with his base does not transfer to other Republican candidates. Thus, in the end, perhaps 2018 will be no exception to the rule that midterm elections are brutal for the party in control of the White House and Congress.\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans can hope that a booming economy and success against ISIS will mean more to voters than do the endless speculation about collusion with Russia and the White House scandals that lead the news every night. But Trump dominates the political conversation in such a way as to ensure that every other topic is overwhelmed by the 24/7 news cycle, and social media that can talk of little else.\n\nThis is not to say that Trump is losing ground in the polls. He\u2019s actually gaining slightly or at least holding his own in surveys of presidential approval. But as the GOP saw last week in a Pennsylvania district that Trump carried easily in 2016, his popularity among the GOP base doesn\u2019t apply to others. Trump campaigned in the district, but his appearance was about him, not the doomed GOP candidate.\n\nThat\u2019s a sobering thought for Republicans who know that Trump\u2019s unpopularity in much of the country is a heavy burden for their candidates to carry. While Trump still retains the support of most of his 2016 voters, the dynamic of a midterm election means that all the passion is on the side of the opposition, not the GOP activists who administered a shellacking to President Obama in 2010 and 2014.

American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council 31, William Messenger \u2014 the National Right to Work Foundation attorney representing Janus \u2014 asserted that Illinois law and the state union contract violate Janus\u2019s First Amendment rights by making him pay AFSCME in order to keep his job, because the union uses his money to engage in political speech in public, at grievance proceedings, and through contract negotiations.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Janus and his supporters have stuck to the same basic message: It\u2019s unconstitutional to compel public employees to fund a union\u2019s political speech as a condition of employment, and since everything public-sector unions do affects public workers, public spending, and public services, all of their spending is political.\n\nEven with help from the Court\u2019s liberal justices, AFSCME lawyer David Frederick was unable to make much of a counterargument, admitting that a win for Janus would reduce the unions\u2019 political power, conceding that mandatory fees should be restricted to fewer uses, and warning that a ban on mandatory fees may \u201craise an untold specter of labor unrest throughout the country.\u201d\n\nJudging from the heated rhetoric that public-sector-union bosses have directed at Janus since the Supreme Court agreed to consider his case, they don\u2019t expect to convince Justice Neil Gorsuch, the only justice who was not on the Court when a similar case resulted in a 4\u20134 tie in 2016. Instead, union officials seem to be building a narrative meant to frighten workers into sticking with them.\n\nUnion officials seem to be building a narrative meant to frighten workers into sticking with them.\n\n\u201cThey are not making a legal argument in front of the Supreme Court.

They don\u2019t care about the First Amendment. They all care about making more money and having more wealth, at the expense of all of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the face of ruthless, dishonest attacks against their freedom to come together in strong unions, working people are drawing the line,\u201d Saunders said in a press release last Monday. \u201cWe stand united in fighting a rigged system that rewards the super-wealthy at everyone else\u2019s expense.\u201d\n\nAFSCME paid Saunders a total of $356,224 in 2016, according to the union\u2019s latest annual disclosure available from the U.S. Department of Labor. Saunders is compensated at the expense of Janus and other public employees from whose paychecks AFSCME deducts mandatory \u201cfair share\u201d fees.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling in favor of Janus would not restrict any worker\u2019s ability to join, pay, or otherwise participate in a labor union; aside from ending the unions\u2019 practice of taking forced fees from non-members, a victory for Janus wouldn\u2019t change the contract items public-employee unions can collectively bargain for, nor would it restrict a single union organizing, negotiating, or protesting tactic. You\u2019d never know any of this from listening to Saunders or the presidents of the nation\u2019s other giant public-sector unions.\n\n\u201cThis case isn\u2019t about Mark Janus \u2014 it\u2019s a ruse funded by the Kochs, the Bradleys, the DeVoses, and other anti-union oligarchs to deny working folks the opportunity for a better life,\u201d said American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, whose 2017 pay from the teachers\u2019 union totaled $492,563.\n\n\u201cThe Janus case is nothing but a bald attempt by rich CEOS to use the highest court in the land to cut down our unions,\u201d Richard Trumka, who was paid $315,368 as president of the AFL-CIO last year, said at a rally last weekend in Philadelphia. AFSCME and AFT are two of the AFL-CIO\u2019s largest member unions.\n\n\u201cThe corporate special interests behind this case are dead set on eliminating the rights and freedoms of working people to organize, to negotiate collectively and to have any voice in working to better their lives,\u201d National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said. \u201cThis is a blatant slap in the face of educators, nurses, firefighters, police officers and all public servants who make our communities strong and safe.\u201d\n\nTaking hundreds of dollars per year in mandatory fees from teachers in nearly two dozen states enabled NEA to pay Eskelsen Garcia $348,732 last year and $512,504 the year before that.\n\n\u201cThe anti-worker extremists behind this case want to divide working people, make it harder to pool our resources, and limit our collective power,\u201d Service Employees International Union president Mary Kay Henry said in September, when the Supreme Court announced it would hear the Janus case.\n\nSweeping condemnations of \u201ca rigged system,\u201d \u201crich CEOs,\u201d \u201canti-union oligarchs,\u201d \u201ccorporate special interests,\u201d and \u201canti-worker extremists\u201d undermine the hair-splitting distinctions union lawyers try to make between political and apolitical spending when defending mandatory fees in court; it\u2019s clear that union leaders believe their activism is inextricably linked to their ability to coerce fees from non-members.\n\nWhile Messenger argues that mandatory public-sector union fees are spent on political activism that dissenting workers shouldn\u2019t be forced to support as a condition of employment, Saunders, Trumka, Weingarten, Eskelsen Garcia, and Henry imply that dissenting workers should be forced to pay unions because of their activism.\n\nDemocrats and left-wing activist groups \u2014 beneficiaries of more than $1 billion in union spending from 2010 to 2016 \u2014 are similarly energetic in their defense of mandatory public-sector union fees, often repeating the same language the unions use to avoid discussing mandatory fees directly.\n\n\u201cIn Janus v. AFSCME, we are witnessing the culmination of the billionaires\u2019 anti-worker agenda,\u201d wrote far-left Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who was endorsed by AFSCME, AFT, NEA, and several other powerful labor unions in the 2017 race for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cThe case before the Supreme Court on Monday threatens the freedom of millions of Americans working in the public sector to bargain for decent pay, better benefits, and a voice in their workplace,\u201d Neera Tanden, president of the union-funded Center for American Progress, wrote at USA Today.\n\n\u201cThe Right intends to use Janus to gut public-employee unions, weakening what is the strongest constituency in organized labor. This in turn will greatly diminish labor\u2019s strength as a progressive force,\u201d wrote a contributor at AFSCME-sponsored online magazine Working in These Times.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) called the Janus case \u201cthe latest case in a years-long assault by powerful right-wing billionaires against workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is an attack on workers\u2019 rights backed by wealthy corporations,\u201d Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) wrote on Twitter.\n\nWith Messenger\u2019s oral arguments and all of the exhibits filed on his behalf, Janus may not have needed anything further to prevail when the Supreme Court issues its decision in his case this spring. But if a worker arguing that AFSCME is an inherently political organization that he shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay wanted to show why he felt that way, he couldn\u2019t ask for much better than the behavior of the union and its left-wing allies last week.\n\n\nShould Gorsuch vote with the four justices who sided against mandatory public-sector union fees in 2016, AFSCME, AFT, NEA, and SEIU will still be able to engage in outspoken progressive activism \u2014 but they\u2019ll have to do so without taking money from the teachers and other public employees who disagree with their agenda.\n\n\u2014\u00a0Jason Hart is\u00a0a health and labor policy analyst in central Ohio.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David French", "body": "Parents and students attend a demonstration calling for more gun control in Coral Springs, Florida, February 18, 2018.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Jonathan  should state this moral truth while remaining humble, aware that we don\u2019t know how we would have responded in a crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn the entire horrible history of modern mass shootings, have government failures ever been so comprehensive and so heartbreaking as those that led up to school massacre in Parkland, Fla.? The FBI received a precise tip and failed to act. Local law enforcement was called to the shooter\u2019s home dozens of times. Local law enforcement received a precise tip and failed to act. Many mass shooters wave red flags. The Parkland shooter did everything but call police and tell them the date and time of his attack. It would have been difficult for him to make his intentions more clear.\n\nThen, yesterday, the story got even more heartbreaking. When the news of the attack first broke, millions of Americans wondered if there was security on campus, and if so, what security did as the attack unfolded? Well, it turns out that there was a law-enforcement officer on campus. He \u201cresponded\u201d to the shooting, and did nothing. At the critical moment, he stayed outside. The Miami Herald has the details:\n\n[Scot] Peterson \u2014 named school resource officer of the year for Parkland in 2014 \u2014 was in another building, dealing with a student issue when the shots sounded. Armed with his sidearm, Peterson ran to the west side of Building 12 and set up in a defensive position, then did nothing for four minutes until the gunfire stopped, the sheriff said.\n\nBroward County sheriff Scott Israel said that he was \u201csick to his stomach\u201d about Peterson\u2019s failure. Asked what Peterson should have done, Israel replied: \u201cWent in. Addressed the killer. Killed the killer.\u201d\n\nAn armed and trained officer hovered outside. Waiting. While children died. There is no excuse.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell that to Twitter. For some folks there is one narrative \u2014 and one narrative alone \u2014 that should dominate public discourse: Ban assault weapons. So the unjustifiable had to be justified. It was a suicide mission, they said. How could a cop with a handgun take on a killer with an AR-15? This proves that a good guy with a gun can\u2019t stop a bad guy with an \u201cassault rifle.\u201d Besides, who are you to judge? If you\u2019ve never been in combat, you don\u2019t know what that fear is like.\n\nLet\u2019s be very clear. Every single person who puts on a uniform and pledges to protect their community \u2014 either in combat overseas or under fire at home \u2014 is indicating by their choice that they are willing (not wanting, willing) to lay down their lives. That is their job. When the crisis hits, that is their purpose. It\u2019s what we expect of soldiers in environments that are far more intense. It\u2019s what we expect of cops when the shots ring out. If you have doubts about your ability to do that job, don\u2019t put on the uniform.\n\nEven so, there are some people in uniform who will fail that test. Infantry soldiers wilt under fire, even when their brothers\u2019 lives hang in the balance. One cop will hang back when another charges forward. When every molecule in your body is screaming for you to live, to protect yourself, it takes immense strength to expose yourself to mortal danger. Simply put, until you\u2019ve felt true fear, you don\u2019t really know how you\u2019d react.\n\nCultivating courage is a complex and difficult task. Some armies are better at it than others. Some civilizations are better at it than others. And no sane army or civilization relies merely on the inherent goodness or virtue of their warriors to maintain resolve. Courage comes through inspiration \u2014 we aspire to do great things \u2014 but it can also come through fear. There are soldiers or cops who ultimately fear shame more than death. They fear condemnation. Some fear punishment.\n\nThat\u2019s why armies throughout history have celebrated valor and punished cowardice. There is a carrot and a stick. Great sacrifice brings great honor. Abject cowardice brings severe sanction. Failure carries with it a deep sense of shame. Adjust that balance \u2014 remove the shame of failure \u2014 and you risk draining courage from your culture.\n\nFailure carries with it a deep sense of shame. Adjust that balance \u2014 remove the shame of failure \u2014 and you risk draining courage from your culture.\n\nWe can and should state this moral truth while remaining deeply humble and self-aware. There is a world of difference between stating, \u201cThat cop should have intervened\u201d and puffing out your chest and declaring, \u201cI would have done better.\u201d You can imagine the kind of person you want to be, and you can dream of being a hero, but many imaginary warriors have turned tail at the sound of the guns. Simply put, you don\u2019t truly know how you\u2019ll respond to a crisis until you\u2019ve been in a crisis.\n\nIn other words, we can understand his failure even if we cannot justify that failure. To fail to understand is to fail to grapple with fallen humanity. To justify it is to surrender to that fallen nature and normalize cowardice.\n\nFailure is not inevitable. Courage is possible. Killers with assault rifles? Cops have taken them on before. Just ask the Capitol Police who engaged the man who tried to massacre congressional Republicans in Alexandria, Va. An AR-15 does not render a man bulletproof. There were unarmed students and teachers inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who exhibited greater courage than did the armed officer who had promised to protect them.\n\n\nThe gun-control debate is growing truly twisted if it becomes necessary to excuse cowardice to advance public policy. It is entirely acceptable for law-abiding gun-owning Americans to demand that the government do its job before considering sweeping new restrictions that will primarily impact people who\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Part of law enforcement\u2019s job is to follow up on specific tips and warnings. Part of its job is to ask specific men and women in uniform to lay down their lives to protect the public.\n\nYes, men may be cowards. No, none of us know how we would respond to a crisis until we face that ultimate test. But none of the events in Parkland have taught me to trust others to protect my family. And certainly none of the events in Parkland have built my trust in government.

Google the words \u201cTexas blue wave,\u201d in fact, and you will reap a digitized and passionate wave of hopes and dreams that might knock you out of your chair.\n\nAlso, as an aside, I should clarify that I have nothing against Beto O\u2019Rourke. I would never vote for him, given that he has a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and a \u201cvision\u201d for single-payer health care, and a host of other half-baked ideas \u2014 including one he recently abandoned that involved mandating a year of government service, despite the fact that people already de facto serve the government by forking over income taxes.

Texas needs to be more like Illinois or New York!\u2019\n\nMy problem, however, is this: Why is it that, time and time again, Democrats and media players look at the wild success of Texas \u2014 a state that is growing and thriving and drawing people who are fleeing Illinois, New York, and other blue states \u2014 study it a for bit, scratch their chins like a herd of drunk professors, and then say, \u201cAh, yes. Texas needs to be more like Illinois or New York!\u201d? I myself fled a blue state five years ago, and I can tell you that I didn\u2019t move to Texas so that it could be more like Illinois. (Illinois, much to its chagrin, recently joined New York and New Jersey to make up the top three in the latest United Van Lines survey of America\u2019s most-fled states.)\n\nScoff if you will, but Texas, as state residents are famous for reminding anyone who will listen, is a glorious place. I\u2019m always a bit shocked to hear someone new to the state \u2014 and there is always someone new, often from San Francisco or Silicon Valley or Brooklyn or what have you \u2014 confessing their shock and alarm that they\u2019ve actually moved to . . . gasp . . .

This is not a partisan point. It\u2019s as true of Republicans as it is of Democrats, as a general rule \u2014 though it wouldn\u2019t shock me if it\u2019s more acute in more Democrats than Republicans for the simple reason that Democrats tend to invest more in the power and nobility of government than Republicans do. Politicians are prone to thinking the country needs them where they are (or in some higher office).\n\nNo doubt the reasons for this belief are complicated and numerous. Sometimes it may even be true. Churchill believed he was the indispensable\u00a0man, and for a time he certainly was. But most of the time, I think it\u2019s fair to say that this mindset is derived from a bundle of rationalizations. They like being the center of attention. They like power. They like \u201cbeing in the room where it happens,\u201d to borrow a phrase from the song. And, often, they\u2019ve got no place else to go, to borrow another from An Officer and a Gentleman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, they stick around longer than they should.\n\nConsider Nancy Pelosi. The House minority leader will be 78 next week. She was first elected to the House in 1987. No doubt she has many legislative accomplishments under her belt. She was also the first female speaker of the House. But is there any doubt that it\u2019s time for Pelosi to pack it in?\n\nWhile I\u2019m no fan of hers for ideological reasons, this isn\u2019t an ideological or partisan point. She\u2019s simply an albatross for the Democratic party. Dave Weigel writes:\n\nThe GOP tried to tie [Conor] Lamb to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the San Francisco liberal and subject of countless Republican attack ads over the past 10 years. Lamb said he would not support her for speaker if Democrats won the House, undercutting the GOP criticism.\n\nYet Republican groups still plastered the Pennsylvania airwaves with her image, highlighting polls that had her favorability in the district at 25\u00a0percent.\n\nA day after the election, Republicans made clear they will be relentless in using Pelosi as a cudgel against Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to also talk about what would happen if Nancy Pelosi became speaker again,\u201d said Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the party\u2019s whip.\n\nPelosi took Lamb\u2019s apparent victory as proof that the attacks no longer connected, dismissing questions about her popularity.\n\n\u201cHe won. If he hadn\u2019t won, you might have a question. But he won,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is kind of sad. Yes, it\u2019s true that the GOP effort to effectively tie Lamb to Pelosi failed insofar as Lamb won. But the GOP\u2019s messaging didn\u2019t work because Lamb effectively severed himself from Pelosi by saying he wouldn\u2019t vote for her for speaker. Weigel offers powerful evidence that Pelosi is in denial. He reports:\n\nIn interviews over the past month with 16 Democrats running for Congress, none said affirmatively that they would support Pelosi for speaker.\n\nIf Pelosi retired from Congress (or from leadership), the Democrats would be more likely to take back the House. But she can\u2019t see it \u2014 or won\u2019t acknowledge it. Pelosi\u2019s rejoinder, and her overall attitude, will be the stuff of Downfall videos if the Democrats fail to take back the House.\n\n\nNow, in the grand tradition of National Review, you could make an argument that conservatives, as opposed to Republicans, should hope Pelosi comes to her senses and steps down for the good of her party. Why? Because virtually any plausible replacement of the San Francisco Democrat would be an improvement since, at least rhetorically, they would be marginally more conservative. The trade off, of course, would be that a Democrat-led Congress would deal a far more devastating blow to the conservative legislative agenda.

They rely on the idea that government (or some other large organization) is both profoundly evil and profoundly competent, particularly at keeping secrets. Sometimes the former may be true, but the latter virtually never is. Conspiracy theories also rely on the belief that objectively bad outcomes are subjectively intended. It\u2019s like trying to read the world like a work of literature, where all actions foreshadow future events.\n\nThat\u2019s why I tend to avoid conspiracy theory in favor of what one might call character theory. Character is destiny, as Heraclitus observed, and it serves as a far more reliable guide than feverish dot-connecting of disparate events.\n\nIt is President Trump\u2019s character that leads me to think he didn\u2019t do it, at least not in a way the impeachment-hungry mob hopes he did.\n\nOh, I think he\u2019s morally capable of having done it. As a candidate he publicly called on the Russians to (further) hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s server and release the missing emails. He is the one member of his administration incapable of condemning Russian president Vladimir Putin or his regime. Indeed, his instincts are to hail Putin\u2019s \u201cleadership.\u201d\n\nIt is President Trump\u2019s character that leads me to think he didn\u2019t do it, at least not in a way the impeachment-hungry mob hopes he did.\n\nNor do I think Trump surrounded himself during the campaign with people who would have talked him out of collusion (save for then-senator Jeff Sessions). Saying that his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is not overly scrupulous would be a mind-bending understatement. And Trump\u2019s son Don Jr. has already admitted a) that he met with a Russian emissary and b) that he didn\u2019t care where anti-Clinton dirt came from.\n\nBut while they may have been willing to coordinate with the Kremlin, I\u2019m not at all certain they would have been able to pull it off \u2014 and keep it a secret. Everything we know about the Trump campaign is that it was a shambolic moveable feast of warring egos, relentless leaks, and summary firings. But we\u2019re supposed to believe that everyone maintained total secrecy about Russian collusion?\n\nMore implausible, we\u2019re supposed to believe that Trump has never let it slip, in private or public? The man admitted he fired FBI director James Comey to thwart the Russia investigation. Indeed, his blunders are what invited the investigation in the first place.\n\nSo why, you might ask, is Trump so obsessed with stopping Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia probe? I have three mutually reinforcing theories.\n\nFirst: Trump thinks the probe is unfair. He knows he didn\u2019t personally collude and feels unjustly accused. Second, it\u2019s a blow to his ego, because he thinks it robs him of credit for what he believes was a landslide victory. (It wasn\u2019t.) And third, he fears Mueller might find something else. Perhaps Trump\u2019s not nearly as rich as he claims. Maybe his business practices (or those of his family), particularly with regard to Russia, would not withstand close legal scrutiny. One explanation for why Trump always flattered Putin on the campaign trail is that he thought he would lose the election, so why foreclose future business opportunities?\n\nFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon matter-of-factly told author Michael Wolff: \u201cThis is all about money laundering.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s \u201cpath to .\u00a0.\u00a0. Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr. and Jared Kushner,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cIt\u2019s as plain as a hair on your face.\u201d Tellingly, the president has said he might fire Mueller if he looks into his family\u2019s finances.\n\n\nThese three factors add up to an explanation for why Trump insists the whole Russia investigation is a witch hunt and why he can\u2019t stop obsessing over it. It\u2019s not the only explanation, but it\u2019s more consistent with what we know of Trump\u2019s character than the current conspiracy theories, which depend on us believing he\u2019s a villainous mastermind.\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tribune Content Agency,   Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Clarke D.

Hellerstedt decision impedes the ability of states to protect fetal life and maternal  and settling the law are among the most important responsibilities of the Supreme Court in the American constitutional system, and something the Court is frequently called on to do. \u201cUltimately it is this Court\u2019s responsibility\u00a0to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the scope of its own holdings,\u201d as Justice William Brennan said more than a quarter of a century ago.\n\nIt is extraordinary, therefore, to see the Court perpetuate and aggravate decades of legal confusion of its own making, as it has done through its decision in Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016). Five Justices in Hellerstedt threw out health and safety regulations for Texas abortion clinics by adopting a new version of the \u201cundue burden\u201d test, by which the Court gave power to judges to decide whether state regulations impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s decision to choose abortion. Sooner or later, this persistently troublesome area of American constitutional law is bound to come back to the Court, and that may happen later this year.\n\n\n\n\nThis confusion goes back 45 years, to Roe v. Wade, by which the Court assumed authority to approve or disapprove \u2014 directly or through the lower federal courts \u2014 every abortion law in the country. In 1983, a decade after Roe, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor criticized the Court for its inconsistent application of Roe in cases over the preceding decade. Nine years later, the Court substantially changed Roe and created the \u201cundue burden\u201d test in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).\n\nThe late Justice Antonin Scalia predicted then that the new test would sow confusion, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. How a burden is determined to be \u201cundue\u201d in any case is entirely subjective. An \u201cundue burden\u201d seems to look at the justification for the burden, while a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d seems to look at only the extent of the burden.\n\nA year after Casey, the Court compounded the problem by adding a \u201clarge fraction\u201d factor to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test. For more than two decades, the federal courts struggled to determine what was a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of \u201crelevant\u201d cases showing a \u201csubstantial obstacle.\u201d\n\nIn January, abortion advocates asked the Supreme Court to review a case from Arkansas that tests whether any evidence is needed to claim that a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of women seeking abortion face a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d (Planned Parenthood v. Jegley). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed a lower-court injunction against a state regulation of chemical abortion because the court had \u201cdone no math\u201d to demonstrate that a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of women would likely be affected. That case has been prematurely appealed, and the justices should not hear it unless and until the factual record has been sufficiently developed.\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in Hellerstedt, the Court once again changed the \u201cundue burden\u201d test, by granting federal judges, for the first time, the power to personally review the \u201cbenefits and burdens\u201d of health and safety regulations, imposing a subjective standard that can be heavily influenced by the personal views of the judge. It is a highly speculative endeavor when federal judges review, as they often do, state abortion laws before they have gone into effect.\n\nUsing Hellerstedt as a sword, abortion clinics have now reopened attacks against abortion regulations across the country. In courts in Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas, more than a dozen cases are pending that challenge state abortion regulations \u2014 including laws that were upheld by the Supreme Court before Hellerstedt.\n\nThe confusion sowed by Hellerstedt isn\u2019t limited to health and safety standards for clinics or to hospital admitting policies after abortion complications, the specific issues involved in the case. Some pending cases seek to extend Hellerstedt to strike down basic medical-licensing and credentialing requirements. In Alabama and Indiana, parental-notice or consent statutes, an issue supposedly settled by prior Supreme Court decisions, have been challenged. Although the Court has twice upheld a physician-only law (that only physicians can do abortions), such laws in Maine and Montana are now facing court challenges. Waiting periods, which the Court previously upheld in Casey, are being challenged in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, and Tennessee.\n\nThe ambiguity in Hellerstedt seems intentional.\n\nHellerstedt has reopened 45 years of abortion law and interpretation. Before Hellerstedt the Court looked at the impact of specific abortion laws. Now Hellerstedt suggests that abortion advocates can, as they are now doing in Louisiana, challenge a number of state laws taken together, for their cumulative impact on abortion \u201caccess.\u201d\n\nFive justices in Hellerstedt said there wasn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d evidence of the need for Texas\u2019s health and safety regulations, though there was significant evidence in the record. Law professor Mary Ziegler, author of After Roe, notes that Hellerstedt \u201coffers little guidance about how much (or how good) the proof must be before lawmakers can regulate.\u201d That is a serious obstacle for legislators and public-health officials.\n\n\n\n\nThe ambiguity in Hellerstedt seems intentional. If the Court in June 2016 lacked enough votes to impose a broader injunction against state abortion regulations, the justices could effectively do the same thing by issuing a vague opinion that enabled abortion clinics to reopen challenges to parental laws, informed-consent laws, and waiting periods, knowing that sympathetic federal judges could shut down the laws for years, if not indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of Hellerstedt, Americans United for Life, where I serve as senior counsel, published Unsafe, a 200-page report (backed up by 250 pages of data) documenting that 227 abortion providers in 32 states were cited for more than 1,400 health and safety deficiencies between 2008 and 2016. By ruling as they did in Hellerstedt, the justices left unresolved the problem of substandard conditions and providers in dozens of abortion businesses across the country.\n\nWith Hellerstedt, the Court has neither clarified nor settled its abortion doctrine. Confusion prevents state and local officials from effectively doing what the justices have repeatedly said the states have the authority to do: protect the states\u2019 interest in fetal life and maternal health.

At this point, that question should be put to the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel \u2014 in the federal government, it\u2019s the lawyers\u2019 lawyer. To get down to brass tacks: May the president of the United States be charged with obstruction based on non-criminal discretionary acts that are unquestionably within his constitutional authority as chief executive?\n\n\n\tReaders of these columns may recall that I opposed the appointment of a special counsel and have argued that the appointment was illegitimate. This has nothing to do with Robert Mueller, who has had a distinguished law-enforcement career for which he is justly admired. It has to do with first principles and clear regulations. As a matter of principle, the law-enforcement arm of government must operate on a presumption of innocence. Therefore, in this country, a prosecutor should be assigned only if there is strong evidence that a crime has been committed; in the absence of such evidence, a prosecutor should never be assigned to investigate whether an American may have committed some unknown crime.\n\n\n\tThis, as we\u2019ve repeatedly observed, is reflected in the regulations that control when the Justice Department may appoint a special counsel. The question should never come up unless there is some \u201ccriminal investigation or prosecution\u201d that creates a conflict of interest for Justice Department leadership. A special counsel may be appointed only for purposes of this \u201ccriminal investigation or prosecution.\u201d In the absence of strong evidence of a crime, there is no basis for a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tThe Russia Investigation\u2019s Two Components\n\tThe Russia investigation, as it has been amorphously defined by the Justice Department (in March 20, 2017, testimony by former FBI director James Comey and in the May 17, 2017, order appointing Mueller by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) has two components.\n\n\n\tThere is, first, the overarching counterintelligence investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. As we have pointed out many times, a counterintelligence investigation is not a criminal investigation, and therefore cannot legitimately predicate the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe objective of a counterintelligence investigation is to collect intelligence about the actions and intentions of a foreign power to the extent they may affect American interests. The aim is not prosecution. Indeed, prosecution can undermine counterintelligence since the latter relies on secrecy (counterintelligence investigations are highly classified), while the former mandates public disclosure of allegations, evidence, and witnesses. Consequently, while Justice Department prosecutors are routinely assigned to criminal investigations, they are not assigned to counterintelligence investigations \u2014 government lawyers get involved when intelligence agents need the assistance of court process, such as warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\n\n\tThe second component of the Russia investigation is studiously vague. It was described by then-director Comey as an inquiry into \u201cthe nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\tThere are a couple of salient things to notice here. First, this was not a standalone investigation; Comey explicitly described it as included within the just-described counterintelligence probe of Russian election interference \u2014 i.e., it was not described as a criminal investigation. Second, what is outlined here is not a predicate for a criminal investigation: It is not a federal crime to have \u201clinks\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 to the Russian government; and whatever the equally slippery word \u201ccoordination\u201d may mean, there can be no federal crime unless (a) \u201cRussia\u2019s efforts\u201d transgressed some penal law (e.g., anti-hacking statutes) and (b) the \u201ccoordination\u201d rose to the level of knowing complicity in that transgression (e.g., conspiracy to commit hacking).\n\n\n\tEven if one believes that the Putin regime had a strong preference for Donald Trump, such support is not a concern of prosecutors unless criminal laws are broken.\n\n\n\tEven if one believes that the Putin regime had a strong preference for Donald Trump (personally, I believe the Kremlin hoped to sow discord and create havoc regardless of who won), such support is not a concern of prosecutors unless criminal laws are broken. And even that would not implicate \u201cindividuals associated with the Trump campaign\u201d in the absence of strong evidence that they aided, abetted, or conspired in the law-breaking.\n\n\n\tBottom line: What Comey described, and Rosenstein later adopted in defining Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction, was not a criminal investigation or prosecution, nor did it provide a factual basis for a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n\n\n\tWhat should have happened here is what should always happen. The FBI should have proceeded with its counterintelligence investigation of Russian interference in the election, and because such investigations are classified, not a word should have been said about it publicly. Then if, in the course of that non-criminal investigation, strong evidence of crimes was uncovered, that evidence should have been referred to the criminal-investigative arms of the FBI and the Justice Department. At that point, if the strong evidence of crime pointed at Trump-campaign associates or even the president himself, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should have recused himself (because of his involvement in the Trump campaign), and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should have appointed a special counsel to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute the crime that had been uncovered.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tWhy a Special Counsel?\n\tThis is not what happened. Mueller was appointed in the absence of strong evidence of a crime that would legitimately trigger a criminal investigation or prosecution. Since that should not have happened, one must ask: Why?\n\n\n\tIn a column on Thursday, I argued that the Obama administration saw the Russia probe as an opportunity to paralyze President Trump. As I noted in the column, the motivation for this could have been sinister or public-spirited \u2014 how you see it probably depends on what you think of Obama and Trump. President Trump\u2019s political opponents would have seen the Russia probe as a chance to strangle his capacity to govern and pursue his agenda; some investigators who suspected that the disturbing allegations in the Steele dossier were true, even if they had not and probably could not be proved, may have harbored good-faith concern that Trump could be blackmailed by Russia.\n\n\n\tRegardless of the motivation, the scheme to sustain the Russia investigation even after Obama left office and Trump was in a position to end it had three parts: (1) important information about the investigation needed to be withheld from the new president; (2) Trump had to be led to believe he was not under investigation (even though he was central to the investigation) so that he would not feel threatened by the investigation; and (3) Trump had to be admonished about respecting the independence of law-enforcement, to instill the fear that if he invoked his constitutional authority to shut down the investigation, he would be accused of obstruction.\n\n\n\tThis audacious strategy worked for four months, but it was done in by its core contradiction: It called for informing the president that he was not a suspect when he clearly was.\n\n\n\tSince the FBI, with the encouragement of Obama holdovers in the Justice Department, was being outrageously public about the existence of the counterintelligence probe and the fact that the Trump campaign was being investigated, the president naturally wanted it to be equally public that the FBI director had assured him he was not under investigation. The refusal of the FBI director to absolve the president was not tenable: Since he should not have said anything publicly about the investigation at all, it made no sense that he would publicly say things suggestive of Trump\u2019s guilt yet refuse to reveal that he had privately told Trump and Congress that Trump was not a suspect.\n\n\n\tComey\u2019s refusal to absolve Trump naturally led to greater focus on the alleged misconduct he appeared, by implication, to be a suspect in: \u2018collusion with Russia.\u2019\n\n\n\tThis refusal to absolve Trump naturally led to greater focus on the alleged misconduct he appeared, by implication, to be a suspect in: \u201ccollusion with Russia.\u201d But after many months, no evidence of actionable, criminal collusion had emerged. Trump understandably saw himself being whipsawed: There was no crime and he had been told he was not a suspect, yet the FBI was conducting itself as if there had been a shocking crime in which he was the main suspect.\n\n\n\tConsequently, Trump fired Comey, but he did not shut down the Russia investigation. The administration badly botched the explanation for Comey\u2019s firing (and amateurishly failed to anticipate the fervid Democratic opposition to it). The president\u2019s true rationale for the dismissal was the dichotomy between the director\u2019s public and private posturing; the point was not to halt a counterintelligence probe of Russian election-meddling, which continued apace.\n\n\n\tRemember: The Obama strategy was to straitjacket Trump by making him the focus of a continuing investigation, even if there was no apparent crime and even though Trump, as president, had the power to end the investigation. With Comey now sidelined, the only way to continue exploiting the Russia counterintelligence investigation for this purpose was to get a special counsel appointed.\n\n\n\tThis is no doubt why Comey went to such inappropriate lengths \u2014 the leaking to the media of a government memo involving his communications with the president about an investigation \u2014 to try to instigate the appointment, as he has testified. (\u201cI asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d) The administration\u2019s appalling mishandling of Comey\u2019s removal, which had Rosenstein reeling as the target of Democratic and media wrath, induced the deputy attorney general to submit. Mueller was appointed, and Trump is stuck with the investigation for as long as it lasts.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tWeakness of the Collusion Case\n\tThe ultra vires appointment of a special counsel provides a structure for keeping the president under investigation notwithstanding his ostensible authority over the Justice Department. Nevertheless, it cannot paper over the fatal weaknesses of the underlying case.\n\n\n\tIt has long been manifest that there is no criminal \u201ccollusion with Russia\u201d case. If there had been, there would have been no need for the legerdemain of conducting a criminal probe surreptitiously, under the label of \u201ccounterintelligence.\u201d\n\n\n\tIt is now clear that the collusion narrative was catalyzed by an unverifiable dossier of rank, anonymous hearsay, commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign and compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who lied to the FBI about his communications with the media \u2014 which the bureau should have anticipated since, as a mercenary retained by an opposition-research operation working for Democrats, Steele\u2019s job was to get Mrs. Clinton elected, not to investigate Russia. These facts were kept from the FISA court when the Justice Department and the FBI used the dossier to seek surveillance warrants. It increasingly appears that the officials who made these judgments may have more to answer for than the Americans on whom they were spying.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tWeakness of the Obstruction Case\n\tThis brings us to the other focus of the Mueller investigation, obstruction. From a prosecutor\u2019s standpoint, obstruction has two advantages over \u201ccollusion with Russia\u201d: (1) It is an actual statutory crime, and (2) it is unquestionably within the scope of a special counsel\u2019s jurisdiction. (See section 600.4(a) of the Code of Federal Regulations.)\n\n\n\tWe do not know everything the special counsel knows, but as publicly understood, the obstruction allegation against Trump seems to be based on two, or perhaps three, incidents: (a) the request that Comey drop the criminal investigation of former national-security adviser Michael Flynn, (b) the firing of Comey, and (c) an impulse to fire Mueller. The third is difficult to take seriously because, if it happened, it is at most an unconsummated directive: White House Counsel Donald McGahn reportedly declined to carry out an order to fire Mueller that he had not gotten directly from the president. So let\u2019s deal with the first two.\n\n\n\tThere is no legal doubt that a president may obstruct justice by the performance of illegal acts aimed at corruptly influencing legal proceedings. The plan to bribe Watergate witnesses in the Nixon impeachment proceedings and the subornation of perjury in the Clinton impeachment proceedings are illustrative. It is anything but clear, however, that a president may be found guilty of obstruction based on the performance of legal acts that are patently within his constitutional authority.\n\n\n\tIn connection with Flynn, we must note that prosecutorial discretion is an executive power. In our system, all executive power is vested in the president. Thus, federal prosecutors who exercise discretion hundreds of times a day in weighing the merits of continuing investigations or filing charges are exercising the president\u2019s power. They are delegates; they do not have power of their own. It would therefore be absurd to suggest that they are authorized to exercise the president\u2019s power but the president is not. The president had no less authority to weigh in on the merits of continuing the Flynn investigation than his Justice Department and FBI subordinates had.\n\n\n\tClearly, it would be better if a president did not get involved in criminal cases. That, however, is because of prudential policy aimed at protecting the public integrity of the legal system; there is no legal prohibition against it.\n\n\n\tClearly, it would be better if a president did not get involved in criminal cases. That, however, is because of prudential policy aimed at protecting the public integrity of the legal system; there is no legal prohibition against it. Moreover, the president is constitutionally empowered to end a criminal investigation or prosecution by issuing a pardon or ordering that it be shut down. Since our law thus allows the president to obstruct an investigation conclusively, it is specious to contend that criminally actionable obstruction occurs if he merely requests that the investigator exercise discretion in a suspect\u2019s favor. That is especially the case when, as here, (a) the president did not demand that the investigation be closed; (b) objectively, there was a very good argument on the merits that Flynn did nothing wrong but had suffered mightily; and (c) the investigation nevertheless continued \u2014 and Flynn was eventually prosecuted \u2014 without any presidential interference.\n\n\n\tAs for Director Comey, he was a subordinate executive officer. As such, he served at the pleasure of the president, who did not need a reason to remove him. Even if we assume, as I do, that Trump fired Comey over his handling of the Russia investigation, the president undeniably had the authority to do this.\n\n\n\tIt is worth repeating that the Russia investigation is a counterintelligence probe; it was not a judicial proceeding or a criminal investigation. Counterintelligence probes are not conducted to enforce the law through judicial proceedings; they are conducted to inform the president of threats posed by foreign powers. The president may shut them down at will, and doing so does not obstruct justice in any way.\n\n\n\tSignificantly, Trump did not terminate Comey because the Russia investigation was being conducted; he did it, again, because Comey publicly intimated that Trump was a suspect but refused to disclose his assurances that Trump was not a suspect. While I think it was unwise to fire Comey, this was hardly an irrational basis for doing so. In fact, it is a basis that would have been less controversial had the president been forthright about it, rather than disingenuously relying on Rosenstein\u2019s memo (which based the justification for removal on the director\u2019s public statements about the Clinton emails case).\n\n\n\tWhile Trump could have ordered the Russia investigation to be shut down, Comey\u2019s dismissal clearly was not intended to have that effect. Far from being obstructed, the investigation has continued despite the director\u2019s dismissal and replacement. That is to be expected, since the rubber-meets-the-road work of such an investigation is done by counterintelligence agents, not by the FBI director.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tHave the Office of Legal Counsel Resolve the Obstruction Question\n\tThat, in any event, is my view of it \u2014 which is worth what you\u2019ve paid for it. By contrast, an analysis that would really matter is that of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. By federal regulation, it is the task of OLC to prepare formal opinions on questions of law for the attorney general, which opinions are binding on the executive branch, including the Justice Department, subject to the approval of the attorney general and, ultimately, the president.\n\n\n\tI do not believe a president can commit an obstruction crime by lawful actions that are within his discretionary authority under the Constitution \u2014 although I do not doubt that a president could be impeached for abusing his discretionary authority. (Concrete example: A president would not commit obstruction by mass-pardoning a category of dangerous offenders, but Congress could well decide that doing so was an abuse of power worthy of impeachment and removal.) But my view is hardly unanimous. Other analysts contend that ostensibly lawful presidential acts shed their legitimacy if corruptly motivated and therefore qualify as obstruction \u2014 i.e., as corrupt endeavors to influence official proceedings.\n\n\n\tWho is right? That is a straight legal question of critical importance. Under federal law, the attorney general (or his deputy if, as here, the AG is recused) routinely delegates the OLC to prepare formal legal opinions for the purpose of guiding prosecutors and other government officials, and these opinions may be published for the benefit of the three branches of government, the bar, and the public. So why not let the OLC settle the matter?\n\n\n\tAn OLC opinion would be invaluable guidance for Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller. An OLC opinion would help clarify whether there truly is a basis for an obstruction allegation against President Trump. This would either lift a cloud of suspicion that makes it very difficult for a president to govern, or put Trump and future presidents on notice of what seemingly lawful presidential actions carry the hazard of potential legal jeopardy.\n\n\n\tLet\u2019s get to the bottom of this. If there are real grounds for accusing the president of criminal misconduct, he and the American people should know what they are. If there are no such grounds, the Justice Department should make it known that President Trump is not the subject of a criminal investigation.\n\n\n\t\u2014 Andrew C.

But his biggest asset hasn\u2019t been his iron grip on Russian politics, it\u2019s been the fecklessness and passivity of his Western counterparts in the face of his outrageous actions. Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion who has lived in exile in the West since 2013, wrote on Facebook that Putin, like most dictators, prefers playing poker to chess. \u201cYou can win at poker with a weak hand if your opponents play foolishly and keep folding their cards.\u201d\n\nIt was to plan a better series of future moves against Putin that Kasparov and Thor Halvorssen, the leaders of the Human Rights Foundation, assembled a collection of 30 anti-Putin experts in New York last Friday. Called PutinCon, the event featured everyone from former intelligence officials to a former Red Army veteran to former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara to Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption crusader who was blocked from the presidential ballot in Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Russia.\n\n\n\n\nAll of them agreed that the West should confront Putin and take serious measures to counter his increasingly brazen behavior. According to British foreign secretary Boris Johnson, this behavior now includes the stockpiling of the deadly nerve agent Novichok, recently used against Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy granted asylum in Britain, and his daughter Yulia.\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, an opponent of Putin\u2019s who is exiled and now lives in Switzerland, says that Russia has become a gangster-run state. Speaking of the attack on the Skripals, he told the BBC, \u201cEither Putin has given his consent to this operation, or he doesn\u2019t control the secret service to such an extent they can do it without his approval.\u201d The FSB, the successor to the Soviet Union\u2019s old KGB secret police, has seized complete control over Russia\u2019s security apparatus. The FSB is now more powerful than the KGB was at the time of Stalin \u2014 and much more independent from the Kremlin.\n\nAccording to Khodorkovsky a group of up to 100 people in Putin\u2019s orbit have \u201clearned to manipulate\u201d Putin \u201cquite effectively.\u201d He said the only way to hurt Putin and his gang is to \u201cundermine his reputation\u201d in the eyes of the Russian public and to focus efforts on attacking the overseas wealth of Putin cronies. In 2015, French economist Thomas Piketty and a group of his colleagues estimated total Russian wealth overseas at $800 billion.\n\nIan Birrell, writing for Britain\u2019s Mail on Sunday yesterday, noted the irony of Putin cronies trashing Western values but yet trusting the rule of law in their own country so little that they send billions of dollars abroad. \u201cThey stash their cash in our banks, buy our properties, fight legal battles in our courts and send their children to be educated in our schools.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nToomas Ilves, who served as president of Estonia from 2006 to 2016, told the PutinCon audience that he was personally sickened when he learned that the daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov graduated from his alma mater, Columbia University in New York City.\n\nIlves and Swedish economist Anders Aslund, who is now a scholar at Washington\u2019s Brookings Institution, says there are clear paths available to the West to attack Putin\u2019s cronies. They note that most Western nations don\u2019t permit anonymous investments that allow assets to be concealed. The two big exceptions are Britain and the United States.\n\nA month before he left office in June 2016, in the wake of the Brexit victory, British prime minister David Cameron organized an international conference to combat anonymous offshore ownership, including some 36,000 properties in London with a value of $156 billion. The rest of Britain has some 70,000 anonymously owned properties. \u201cThis is why you have all those properties in Belgravia standing empty,\u201d Aslund told the PutinCon audience. He estimates that Putin\u2019s inner circle exports some $40 billion to $50 billion in assets overseas every year.\n\nFollowing his 2016 conference, Cameron pushed eleven countries to increase their transparency, but he then suddenly resigned. His successor, Theresa May, hasn\u2019t followed through on the issue. In the wake of the nerve-agent attack on the Skripals, it\u2019s time for her to act: She should ban anonymous shell corporations from buying up property in Britain.\n\nThe United States could also do a lot more. In December 2016, the Wall Street Journal revealed that under the \u201cattorney-client privilege . . . tens of billions of dollars every year move through opaque law-firm bank accounts that create a gap in U.S. money-laundering defenses.\u201d\n\nFreezing the assets of Putin\u2019s oligarchs would send a message that the West is finally serious about confronting Russia\u2019s misbehavior.\n\n\nThis is where the Trump administration can prove its critics \u2014 who accuse it of being soft on the Russians \u2014 wrong. In August, Trump signed into law a bill calling for far-reaching investigations into \u201csenior foreign political figures and oligarchs in the Russian Federation\u201d \u2014 including \u201cspouses, children, parents, and siblings\u201d \u2014 and their assets in such popular real-estate markets as Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Palm Beach, New York, and Los Angeles. Stepping up those probes and actually freezing the assets of Putin\u2019s oligarchs would send a message that the West is finally serious about confronting Russia\u2019s misbehavior.\n\nThe incredible flow of assets out of Russia into Western safe havens is a clear vulnerability in Putin\u2019s authoritarian system. At a minimum, the West should prohibit law firms from acting as banks and also prohibit real-estate entities from effectively acting as banks for the oligarchs. Anonymous purchasers should no longer be able to hide their activities. It is only through moves like this that the West will get the attention of Putin and his cronies.

For starters, despite a near-unanimous tone of media coverage praising the old Assault Weapons Ban and pointing to it as the solution to mass shootings, a new\u00a0Washington Post/ABC News poll\u00a0finds Americans are about evenly split on the idea.\n\nSpecifically, the poll finds \u201c50\u00a0percent in support and 46\u00a0percent opposed, a stark contrast from the 80\u00a0percent support for the ban in 1994, the year it was enacted. The current level of support is little different from 51\u00a0percent in 2016.\u201d\nFor those who believe that there\u2019d be widespread rejoicing if the federal government tried to ban the most popular rifle in America, these numbers should serve as a timely dose of cold water. They come, remember,\u00a0in the immediate aftermath of a terrible attack. In 1994, 80 percent of Americans wanted to ban certain rifles absent any recent abominations. Today, after an unusual number of heinous events, only half do. Given that the right to bear arms is explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, these numbers simply won\u2019t cut it. Consider, by way of comparison, that seven out of ten Americans think abortion should be illegal in the second trimester, and yet it remains legal almost everywhere.\nThe outlook looks similarly grim for those who think they can just \u201cwait it out\u201d until those recalcitrant older voters die off. Per CNN, poll after poll reveals that younger voters are not in fact more pro-gun control than are older voters:\nWhile any one survey result for a subsample that is as small as those under the age of 35 could be an outlier, the average of nine surveys tells us a lot. In the average survey, 50% of Americans said they were for stricter gun control. The same nine polls found on average that 49% of Americans under the age of 35 were for stricter gun control. In other words, the difference was statistically insignificant.\nI also checked to see if more recent surveys during this five-year period suggested any sort of uptick in support for stricter gun control among younger adults. There wasn\u2019t. The last four surveys conducted by CNN discovered that 50% of those under 35 were for stricter gun control. That\u2019s identical to the 50% of all Americans who said they were for gun control in the same surveys.\nOver the last few decades, Americans have become far less interested in gun control.

It could change tomorrow, for all we know, but as it stands now, this is a preemptive surrender on several issues.\n\n\n\tThe enforcement component is fine, as far as it goes \u2013 there\u2019s no E-Verify, but the White House decided months ago not to push that, thinking it would be a bridge too far for Democrats, since it impacts illegals who are already here.\n\n\n\tBut the amnesty and chain migration components are fatally flawed. The fact that the amnesty would include a path to citizenship (i.e., the beneficiaries would eventually get green cards like regular immigrants) is fine with me \u2013 if you\u2019re going to amnesty illegal aliens, just rip off the band-aid and get it over with.\n\n\n\tInstead, the issue is the size of the amnesty, or rather the universe of people who would be amnestied. If \u2013 as the White House promised just days ago \u2013 the amnesty were confined to those who now actually have DACA work permits (or even those who had them but didn\u2019t renew), administering the amnesty would be relatively straightforward. All those people are already in the DHS database, and even if they were all re-examined as part of the amnesty process (to weed out the fraudsters that snuck past Obama\u2019s eagle-eyed DHS), it could still be done relatively quickly and with minimal disruption of the work of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the DHS component that deals with green cards, work permits, and the like.\n\n\n\tBut going beyond DACA beneficiaries to those who could have applied but didn\u2019t is a different thing. It\u2019s not just a difference in degree, but in kind. A whole new process will have to be set up for the 1 million additional people who would be expected to apply. The other work of USCIS would grind to a halt, delaying other legal immigration applications, as happened when DACA was originally implemented (and remember that Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty was smaller than what Trump is proposing). In addition, there would be an opportunity cost, with USCIS unable to pursue many urgently needed administrative reforms.\n\n\n\tWhat\u2019s more, expanding the amnesty beyond DACA beneficiaries is morally dubious. The reason they have a compelling case for amnesty before all enforcement measures and in place and legal immigration curbed is that not only did they arrive here as minors but they voluntarily came forward and provided their information to the government. Those who chose not to do so should not be granted the same extraordinary act of mercy.\n\n\n\tThen there\u2019s the legal immigration \u201ccuts.\u201d The outline says that no new applications for the visa lottery and the chain-migration categories would be accepted, limiting family immigration to spouses and minor children. Great! But it also provides for the continuation of those categories (and reallocation of the lottery visas) until the admission of all 4 million people on the current chain-migration waiting lists. This is the same gimmick that was in the Hagel-Martinez amnesty bill in 2007 \u2013 and the estimate at the time was that it would take 17 years before all those people got their green cards. In other words, legal immigration would not actually be reduced until after President Kamala Harris\u2019s successor took office.\n\n\n\tThe Cotton and Goodlatte bills both grandfather people on the waiting list who were within one year of getting their green card applications adjudicated, and refund the application fees for everyone else. This is a reasonable measure, since as the date gets closer, people might be selling property and whatnot as part of their relocation planning.\n\n\n\tBut to wait almost two decades before there\u2019s any reduction in legal admissions is absurd. First of all, if we\u2019re going to amnesty close to 2 million illegal aliens (and maybe more, since past estimates have proven so woefully wrong), that needs to be offset by immediate reductions elsewhere. What\u2019s more this would be yet another example of the other side getting what it wants up front, with promises of things we want in the future. As Popeye\u2019s friend J. Wellington Wimpy might have said, \u201cI will gladly reduce immigration on Tuesday for an amnesty today.\u201d\n\n\n\tThe White House has botched the DACA issue, cutting Bob Goodlatte\u2019s House bill off at the knees and making it more likely that either there will be no bill at all or that any final bill the president signs (which is guaranteed to be even weaker than this) will fatally demoralize Republican voters in November.

That was what Congressman K. Michael Conaway (R., Texas) announced yesterday evening, in the course of explaining that the committee has ended the investigative phase of its probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Republican-controlled committee also found, Conaway added, that \u201cthe Russians did commit active measures\u201d against the U.S. election and would continue attempting to do so in the future. But the committee majority rejects \u201cthe narrative that they were trying to help Trump.\u201d\n\n\nThe conclusion of the investigative phase means the committee has ceased interviewing witnesses and will now finalize its written report, currently said to be a 150-page draft. The final report, Conaway said, would address the four topics on which the committee\u2019s investigation focused: Russian meddling in the election, the U.S. government\u2019s response to that meddling, links between the Putin regime and both major-party campaigns, and leaks of classified information.\n\nRepresentative Conaway has taken the lead in this aspect of the committee\u2019s work since last April, when Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) stepped aside. Democrats had accused Nunes of leaking classified information. Nunes, who has since been cleared by the House Ethics Committee, had announced at a news conference that the Obama administration had collected intelligence on associates of Donald Trump (and perhaps Trump himself) during the transition following the 2016 election.\n\n\n\n\nThe Intelligence Committee is deeply divided along partisan lines. It took the ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, little time to rip the decision to end the investigation. By what he described as \u201cending its oversight role,\u201d Schiff said, the committee\u2019s Republicans had elevated \u201cthe interests of protecting the president over protecting the country.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the president pounced on the announcement. Monday night produced an all-caps tweet:\n\n\nTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018\n\n\nThis reaction, naturally, will amp up the Democrats\u2019 storyline that committee Republicans have been colluding with the White House from the start. Nevertheless, Schiff\u2019s clamor to continue the investigation is at least as driven by partisanship as the GOP decision to close it.\n\nThe House probe has run parallel to the investigation conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s mini-empire of 17 lawyers and scores of federal agents. The Mueller probe has ensued for ten months, after taking over a counterintelligence investigation that had already been ongoing for over a year. (It was in September 2015 that the FBI first advised the Democratic National Committee that its computer network may have been hacked.)\n\nNote that a congressional committee has at its disposal considerably less investigative authority and resources than do prosecutors. Yet, despite charging four men who were both associated with the Trump campaign and in contact with Kremlin-tied operatives, Mueller has not alleged any criminal conspiracy between the Trump associates and the Putin regime.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos have pled guilty to lying to investigators. Richard Gates has pled guilty to lying to investigators and to a minor conspiracy charge involving his lobbying work on behalf of a Kremlin-backed Ukrainian political party, mostly between 2004 and 2014. And Paul Manafort, who was indicted with his partner, Gates, on these charges unrelated to the 2016 campaign, is awaiting trial later this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Mueller has also filed an indictment against 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies for conducting influence operations, primarily through social media, directed at the 2016 election and its aftermath. Those operations, which appear remote from the original hacking allegations that spurred the counterintelligence investigation, were but a drop in the ocean of campaign messaging. Moreover, some of Russia\u2019s shenanigans predated Trump\u2019s entry into the race, and some were directed against Trump. To the extent there were supportive entreaties toward the Trump campaign, these are alleged to have been unsolicited, not conspiratorial.\n\nThese results of Mueller\u2019s probe have obviously informed the committee majority\u2019s conclusion that Putin\u2019s support for Trump is more the stuff of Democratic political narrative than reality. For what it\u2019s worth, I drew a similar inference when Mueller indicted the Russian nationals:\n\nThe Kremlin hoped to sow discord in our society and thus paralyze our government\u2019s capacity to pursue American interests. The Russian strategy was to stir up the resentments of sizable losing factions. It is not that Putin wanted Trump to win; it is that Putin figured Trump was going to lose. That is why the Kremlin tried to galvanize Trump supporters against Clinton, just as it tried to galvanize Sanders supporters against Clinton, and Trump supporters against Cruz and Rubio, during the primaries. It is why the Russians suddenly choreographed anti-Trump rallies after Trump won. The palpable goal was to promote dysfunction: Cripple a likely President Clinton before she could even get started, wound President Trump from the get-go when he unexpectedly won, and otherwise set American against American whenever possible.\n\nOf course, the Mueller investigation is continuing and we are privy to neither its inner workings nor the non-public information it has assembled. By all outward appearances, however, the special counsel lacks evidence of actionable collusion with Russia. As I have stressed, if he had such a case, he would have induced his cooperating defendants to plead guilty to a conspiracy, explain the criminal nature of any collusion, and implicate other conspirators.

But what happened on the fourth of this month in the cathedral city was far from a bloodless Agatha Christie crime. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the center of the city has landed them in the hospital, where they remain critically ill. Also hospitalized was a police detective who was one of the first officials to enter the Skripal home after the attack. The discovery that the nerve agent Novichok was used in the assassination attempt has also led dozens of residents of Salisbury, including people who dined in the same restaurant as the Skripals, to face the possibility that they too have come into contact with the nerve agent.\n\nThe release of such a deadly nerve agent in a crowded city has done many things, not the least of which is to throw a clear line into the middle of Great Britain\u2019s political and public life. Prime Minister Theresa May and her government swiftly concluded (at the advice of the intelligence agencies) that the only possible culprits could be the Russians. But the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, was never going to give up a life of allegiances that easily. Both Corbyn and his closest adviser and spokesman, Seumas Milne, are the sort of leftists who do not so much hate modern Russia as feel let down by it \u2014 failing, as it did, to hold together in its glorious USSR form.\n\n\n\n\nSince becoming leader of his party, Corbyn has done a great deal to try to recast himself as ready for his potential incarnation as prime minister. Corbyn and his camp present his years of chumming up to IRA terrorists as \u201cpeace-making.\u201d He is pals with every available anti-Semite at home and in the Middle East \u2014 but this is only evidence of yet more \u201cpeace-making.\u201d As for his unyielding fealty to every Marxist despot from Castro to Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 it\u2019s just part of his endless search for equality and fairness for all.\n\nOf course the hard beliefs that actually lurk beneath such bromides occasionally become apparent. In recent days they have risen to the surface.\n\nThe first instinct of Corbyn when Her Majesty\u2019s Government fingered Russia as the culprit was to call for evidence. No bad thing in itself, but one gets the sense that, for Corbyn, the evidence might never be quite enough to justify his reaching a conclusion he would gladly put off until at least such a date as people stop asking. And then there was the politicking. Americans are no strangers to the use of the Russians as a means to pursue domestic political goals. But even American politicians would probably not stoop so low as to make use of a nerve-agent attack in an American city to score partisan points.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s second instinct \u2014 after providing smoke for Russia \u2014 was to attack the Conservative party for allegedly having taken money from dodgy Russians. Party funding is almost as much of a mess in the U.K. as it is in the U.S. (the one advantage being that the sums in Britain are infinitely smaller). But political parties are not allowed to take money from people who are not British citizens. Corbyn issued blanket attacks on the Conservatives for taking money from U.K. citizens who were born in Russia: We should deem this a slimy generalization, just as we would if \u2014 whenever problems erupted from the Indian subcontinent \u2014 the Conservatives attacked Corbyn for taking donations from British citizens who happened to be from Pakistan.\n\nBut the most fascinating aspect of the hill that Corbyn showed himself willing to die on (and polls suggested that if not dying, he is certainly suffering for his stance) is one that came from a lobby briefing. Last week, as Corbyn was taking flak for his stance, Seumas Milne was quoted telling journalists:\n\nI think obviously the government has access to information and intelligence on this matter which others don\u2019t; however, also there\u2019s a history in relation to WMD and intelligence, which is problematic to put it mildly.\n\nPast intelligence failures will obviously keep coming back to haunt intelligence services and governments in Britain and America for years to come. But it was the norm, until recently, for people in public life \u2014 especially those aspiring to public office \u2014 to at least view the intelligence services as being on their side. Principally because they were seen to be on the side of the national interest.\n\n\nIt was the norm, until recently, for people in public life \u2014 especially those aspiring to public office \u2014 to at least view the intelligence services as being on their side.\n\nIn Jeremy Corbyn and his spokesman, we have a different type of figure: people who view their country\u2019s intelligence services as though they are enemies. The fact that the same people have a tendency to view any and all of the nation\u2019s enemies as friends may be entirely coincidental. Or it may not. Either way it is a reminder of how dangerous it is that people who should be sitting in their family basement wearing tin hats are only a few government slip-ups away from controlling the state they have always   Murray is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kyle Smith", "body": "Marjory Stoneman Douglas student Cameron Kasky (left) asks Senator Marco Rubio if he will continue to accept money from the NRA during a CNN town hall meeting in Sunrise, Florida, February 21, 2018.  (Michael   journalists are using the student activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a mouthpiece for their gun-control message.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn the aftermath of the Parkland massacre, student activists achieved remarkable levels of fame almost instantaneously: Emma Gonz\u00e1lez already has nearly 1 million Twitter followers, for instance, and her fellow student David Hogg has more than 300,000. Both have become familiar faces on television.\n\nLike all Americans, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School kids have every right to express their ideas. But they aren\u2019t being given so much airtime by the media because they\u2019re policy experts. Hogg revealed in an appearance on MSNBC Monday morning that he didn\u2019t even know how the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, got his job. He described Israel as an appointee of Florida governor Rick Scott: \u201cThese elected officials,\u201d he said, \u201care the boss of these sheriff personnel and just like the president is the boss of the FBI, Governor Rick Scott is essentially the boss of Scott Israel, the sheriff, and as such he should be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFactually, Hogg\u2019s argument was just plain wrong: Israel is not an appointee of the governor; he was directly elected by the voters of Broward County. As a matter of logic, it failed too: Shouldn\u2019t accountability fall first on those closest to the scene \u2014 such as the cops who were actually present during the shooting \u2014 only to attenuate rather than grow stronger as it gets farther up the chain of command? Absolving those in an immediate position to stop the attack while attacking those farthest from the shooting looks like rank partisanship. (Israel is a Democrat who speaks out against the NRA, while Scott is a Republican who has largely agreed with it.)\n\nMSNBC, CNN, and other media outlets didn\u2019t see the pitfall that comes with making public spokesmen out of random citizens who happen to be present at a newsworthy event: Non-professionals may make elementary errors that undermine their authority. There\u2019s a reason ordinary folks, especially children, are not normally invited on TV to discuss complicated legal and political matters. Moreover, as the media learned to their chagrin with their elevation of Cindy Sheehan to national-celebrity status, once given a megaphone, citizens might start to stray off message and embarrass their boosters. Hogg on Saturday called for a spring-break boycott of Florida, which doesn\u2019t sound like an idea he thought through.\n\nThe reason television has made stars out of Hogg and Gonz\u00e1lez is obvious: They are telegenic, sympathetic vehicles for a message media personalities wish they could get away with openly espousing themselves. (\u201cI get so angry talking to these gun nuts,\u201d Piers Morgan said in a revealing moment on British morning television today.) Just as an op-ed editor at a newspaper can showcase his opinions without his name ever appearing in print by his selection of which articles to publish, the TV media keep giving airtime to students like Hogg because they\u2019re saying all of the things the media\u2019s nominally neutral hosts believe but don\u2019t otherwise feel comfortable saying. Katy Tur, George Stephanopoulos, and Wolf Blitzer can\u2019t passionately lecture the audience about why they think gun policy is crazy in this country, so they put the students on camera to say it. They\u2019re simply laundering their opinions through these kids.\n\nAs they deploy these students to advance their own interests, the media are overestimating their own importance \u2014 and their own attention span.\n\nYou may find something dismaying about grieving students being exploited for the purpose of advancing a media crusade. Or you might call the Parkland students inheritors of a grand tradition of Americans who use their personal experience to push for social change. But as they deploy these students to advance their own interests, the media are overestimating their own importance \u2014 and their own attention span. They are convincing themselves that their relentless effort to push American opinion to the left on guns is succeeding, but all that the polls are really measuring right now is the amount of media interest in the gun issue. Previous polling suggests that any surge in support for more gun control will be short-lived. Enthusiasm for more gun laws spiked in the days after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, but within two years support for gun rights reached an all-time high: \u201cAs the media has lost interest in gun issues, public opinion has reverted to its previous trend,\u201d which was gradually increasing support for gun rights, reported FiveThirtyEight.com.\n\nI should clarify my position on the gun debate: I don\u2019t care. Ban assault weapons? I don\u2019t care. Ban large-capacity magazines? I don\u2019t care. Raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms to 21, or even 25? I don\u2019t care. Would any of these policy changes make a difference, though? I doubt it. Even if all semi-automatic long guns were to be banned, I think mass shooters would simply switch to pistols. You can kill a lot of people with one pistol and a satchel full of ten-round magazines. And pistols are much easier to conceal than long guns.\n\nMy guess is that gun-control advocates such as the ones who run virtually every mainstream news organization would grudgingly agree that policy-tinkering such as the kind proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein (no more sales of rifles with pistol grips, folding stocks, etc., but also no effort to take out of circulation the millions of such weapons already on the streets) wouldn\u2019t make America a safer place. So why do they work themselves into such a febrile state about the minutiae of what will constitute a legal rifle going forward? Why are they suddenly so eager to punish Amazon and Roku for hosting the streaming channel NRATV, which nobody had heard of until the New York Times discovered it in a whip-up-some-hysteria piece on February 21? The Times offered no evidence that the NRA\u2019s channel, one of some 1,800 available on Roku, has much of a viewership.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy proposals aren\u2019t the real aim of the anti-gun crowd. What they\u2019re thinking is: We must strike a blow against gun culture. We must punish gun owners in general by doing something that annoys them. This is the Democratic obverse of Trumpian bully culture: It\u2019s public policy reduced to public shaming. It\u2019s insult theater. The politics of id. Is America really going to be made safer by shaming the First National Bank of Omaha into no longer issuing an NRA-branded Visa card? How is forcing through an increase of from 2 to 10 percent on the price NRA members pay for a United or Delta flight to the group\u2019s annual convention supposed to decrease gun deaths?\n\nThese petty slights are all meant to redefine the NRA as outside the mainstream, activists say on Twitter. It seems more likely that NRA members, and gun owners in general, are going to perceive a concerted attack on gun culture and vote accordingly. Progressives don\u2019t have a plan for stopping mass shootings. So they\u2019re falling back on venting at gun owners, and they\u2019re using the children of Parkland to do it.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Theodore Kupfer", "body": "House Speaker Paul Ryan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Aaron P.  should, but lawmakers are more likely to wring their hands and whine.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf Donald Trump\u2019s public statements can be trusted, then the world is quickly approaching a trade war. Last Thursday, the president announced his intention to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, later adding that he\u2019d make no exceptions for the exports of even our closest allies. This means that Canada will be hit with the same penalty as, say, China (though the White House has since floated using the tariffs as a bargaining chip in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement). In response, some of those allies threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods: of course metal, but also, said Jean-Claude Juncker of the EU, Levi\u2019s jeans, bourbon, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Fine, Trump said on Twitter, you can tax our bikes; we\u2019ll simply tax your cars.\n\nAdd to the mix Trump\u2019s insight that trade wars can be \u201cgood and easy to win,\u201d and the tit-for-tat, beggar-thy-neighbor model is riding high. So far, it is just a rhetorical war. Most observers agree that there is some distance between what Trump believes, what he says, and what he ultimately does. But the dueling announcements are a plausible dry run for the real thing. What starts with steel moves to motorcycles; Kentucky bourbon finds itself priced out of Europe while in America, steel producers raise their prices, companies that use steel lay off their employees, and consumers pay double for a can of beer.\n\n\nWhile many of Trump\u2019s policy statements wander in search of a consistent position, his position on protectionism is one of the few he has held steadily over the years. With free-trader Gary Cohn resigning from the White House, Trump seems likely to seek counsel from protectionists such as Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, which makes protectionist action all the more likely. If Trump does what he says, retaliations from around the world will beget more retaliation until an outside force stops the self-destructive cycle.\n\nCould that force be Congress? More properly put, shouldn\u2019t it be? Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\u201d As Jay Cost chronicles on the homepage, the legislative branch first used that power as little more than a tool to dispense favors to favored regions of the country before ceding it to the executive over the years. That abdication persists, he notes, \u201ceven in instances (such as this aluminum-and-steel case) where there is no compelling or immediate foreign-policy mandate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed tariff is dubiously justified on national-security grounds for the purposes of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act and the stipulations of the World Trade Organization. But it is a naked protectionist grab, a cynical ploy for support from steel magnates and their union employees. It\u2019s a move that Congress could stop him from making.\n\nPlenty of high-ranking congressional Republicans oppose the measure. Protectionism is one of Trump\u2019s issues that haven\u2019t exerted much pull on the rest of the party (though it has prompted a rethink of trade policy in certain intellectual circles). Statements from concerned representatives and senators abound: Paul Ryan, whose home state builds Harleys, issued a stern one Monday, while various committee chairmen have insisted on the need for \u201ctargeted\u201d action against offenders \u2014 a clear shot at Trump\u2019s \u201cMake Metal More Expensive\u201d policy, which targets Mexico, Canada, Germany, and China alike. Kevin Brady and Orrin Hatch, who lead the committees with jurisdiction over trade in the House and Senate, are avid free-traders. Behind the scenes, reports Politico, congressional Republicans are both \u201cfrantically lobbying Trump to reconsider\u201d his move and \u201ceven considering legislative action to try to stop him if he refuses.\u201d\n\nCongress could reassert its constitutional authority to impose tariffs, say Colin Grabow, a trade-policy scholar at the Cato Institute, and Clark Packard, a trade-policy scholar at the R Street Institute, by passing a bill introduced by senator Mike Lee (R., Utah). Lee\u2019s bill, the Global Trade Accountability Act, would require congressional approval in the form of an up-or-down vote on all significant tariffs. That bill is \u201cthe intellectual North Star of a lot of trade wonks,\u201d Packard tells National Review.\n\nWill congressional cowardice determine our course? Or will the GOP stick to the free-trade position that it has supported for decades?\n\nThe question, however, is whether Congress will follow Polaris\u2019s direction if the president has charted another path. Will congressional cowardice determine our course? Or will the GOP stick to the free-trade position that it has supported for decades?\n\nThis Congress has an instinct to run for the tall grass when the voting gets tough \u2014 witness the lack of action on health care in 2017, or the party\u2019s nonexistent agenda for 2018. Such inaction has political consequences: In a country where the president is legislator in chief, and with that president not afraid to sic his voters on uncooperative congressmen of his own party, opposing a policy the president supports seems politically suicidal (or at least inconvenient). Against that backdrop it is difficult to imagine Republicans standing openly against Trump, let alone working with Democrats to secure a veto-proof majority for a bill that limits presidential power.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other options besides an open legislative revolt. Packard suggests a more limited version of the Lee bill that, rather than rewriting all trade-remedies laws, would require congressional approval only for tariffs that are justified on national-security grounds under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Even if Trump imposes the tariff, Congress could pass a continuing resolution that declined to fund the collection of such duties.\n\nThat would require a Congress committed to its principles, ready to play its constitutional role, and willing to take meaningful steps to curtail presidential power. Which is to say it\u2019s a fanciful idea. As Yuval Levin has written, the current \u201cweakness of Congress is a result of dereliction and of a growing confusion about the role of the institution.\u201d Congress may yet pursue legislative solutions to rein in Trump, but it seems likelier that they\u2019ll fulminate, wring their hands, and try to convince the president to recant his earlier statements.

Instead, think of them as dye markers of how our cultural politics and the nature of the two parties have changed over time.\n\nIn the 1990s, it was common for Democrats to fret over both illegal and legal immigration. \u201cAll Americans,\u201d President Clinton said in his 1995 State of the Union address, \u201care rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Jordan, the civil rights icon and onetime Democratic congresswoman, headed a commission which concluded that legal immigration rates should be modestly cut.\n\nMeanwhile, countless Republicans championed immigration. \u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a single problem that would be solved by shutting off the supply of willing and eager new Americans,\u201d then-House majority leader Dick Armey said in 1995. \u201cIf anything . . . we should be thinking about increasing legal immigration.\u201d\n\nAfter a 1995 meeting with the National Restaurant Association, newly elected House speaker Newt Gingrich said, \u201cI think we would be a very, very self-destructive country if we sent negative signals on legal immigration.\u201d\n\nBack then, boosting legal immigration was seen by many on the left as a sop to big business. The ruling industrial class allegedly wanted a reserve army of cheap labor. As recently as 2015, avowed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders sounded downright Bannonesque in telling Vox that \u201copen borders\u201d was a \u201cKoch brothers proposal . . . a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States.\u201d\n\nSanders is an intriguing example of how political and cultural currents swirl around us. He won his first bid for Congress in 1990 in part because he received the full-throated endorsement of the National Rifle Association. Sanders, the former mayor of Burlington, Vt., was noncommittal on an assault-weapons ban while his GOP opponent, Peter Smith, flip-flopped and came out in favor of a ban.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Peter Smith vs. Bernie Sanders,\u201d the NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre explained. \u201cIt is about integrity in politics.\u201d\n\nThis history was just one reason why it was amusing to listen to LaPierre at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week railing against the \u201csocialists\u201d determined to grab everyone\u2019s guns. The man who helped launch the most prominent American socialist since Norman Thomas suddenly thinks socialism is an existential threat to liberty.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nOn the immigration front: Democrats are increasingly invested in permissive policies in large part because they\u2019ve bought into the theory that diverse populations are their key to electoral victories going forward. In dialectic fashion, Republicans are increasingly invested in restrictive policies in large part because they\u2019re chasing after ever-larger segments of the white vote.\n\nAs for firearms: Democrats passed an assault-weapons ban in September 1994. Even Bill Clinton credited that decision as one of the chief reasons the GOP took back the House two months later.\n\nTrue or not, the more important consequence was that gun rights increasingly became a partisan issue, and the NRA had little choice but to become an adjunct of the GOP. The dynamic became centrifugal, with Democrats and Republicans becoming ever more defined by the issue.\n\nAll of these changes were driven by facts on the ground. To listen to Democrats, Republicans support gun rights because the NRA tells them to. In reality, Republicans support gun rights because their voters tell them to, just as Democratic voters tell their representatives the opposite.\n\nBut guns and immigration are not simply drivers of polarization, they are examples of its power. Politics has become a lifestyle, part of the \u201cBig Sort\u201d driving so much in our culture. That\u2019s why the NRA\u2019s marketing these days has so little to do with gun policy and so much to do with smash-mouth cultural resentments.\n\n\nThese days, if you\u2019re a Democrat, you\u2019re likely to be a down-the-line Democrat on a host of unrelated issues. Same if you\u2019re a Republican. Like our representatives, many of us won\u2019t buck party orthodoxy on any matter of importance.\n\nLiberals such as Sanders have talked about \u201ctwo Americas\u201d for generations, but they worked on the assumption that this divide was class-based.

United States (1997) and New York v. United States (1992), the Supreme Court has ruled that the Tenth Amendment forbids federal \u2018commandeering\u2019 of state governments to help enforce federal law. Most of the support for this anti-commandeering principle came from conservative justices such as the late Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in Printz.\u201d\n\nPrintz correctly bars federal conscription of state and local officials and Washington\u2019s commandeering of their resources. Nobody wants ICE agents to dragoon local cops into joining immigration raids, against their wishes and those of their commanders and civilian overseers. Nor should ICE abandon its own vehicles and seize, say, NYPD squad cars in order to corral MS-13 killers.\n\nInstead, ICE officers want city and state governments to alert them before releasing alien criminals, so they can be taken into federal custody, for adjudication, punishment, or deportation. But California law SB 54 prohibits such communications with ICE, even among local or county authorities (and even private employers) who want to help federal officials remove criminal aliens from their communities and workplaces.\n\n\u201cRather than allow ICE officers to do their jobs at the jailhouse, they [\u2018lawless open-borders radicals\u2019] force these officers to conduct far more dangerous arrests elsewhere \u2014 where violent criminals may reside and where children can be caught in the crossfire,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Wednesday morning in Sacramento as he unveiled an anti-fugitive-state lawsuit against California.\n\nAlso, while Washington, D.C., should tolerate mayors and governors who prefer not to assist ICE, it correctly should expect that they will not scream, \u201cICE is coming. Head for the hills!\u201d in advance of federal crime-fighting  Printz, \u201cThe real issue is that these mayors and governors are violating federal law themselves by obstructing justice and aiding and abetting people to remain in this country illegally,\u201d says Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor and author of Licensed to Lie: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice. \u201cThe feds are not asking these local and state officials to do the feds\u2019 jobs, just to do their own and not violate federal law.\u201d\n\nAs Heritage Foundation legal analyst Hans von Spakovsky observes, \u201c8 U.S. Code \u00a71373 prohibits states and local jurisdictions from preventing their law enforcement officials from exchanging information with federal officials on the citizenship status of individuals they have arrested or detained.\u201d\n\n\nVon Spakovsky adds:\n\nSanctuary cities are trying to prevent federal officials from finding out about criminal alien murderers, rapists, and other violent criminals that these cities would apparently rather release than have picked up and deported so they cannot further victimize Americans. Section 1373 doesn\u2019t force local law enforcement officials to notify federal officials when they detain an illegal alien; it simply says that local governments can\u2019t ban law enforcement officials from doing so.\n\n\u201cCongress can require state, local, or university police to tell federal agents when they arrest an immigrant present in the country illegally,\u201d Washington-based constitutional lawyers David Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley argued in the Los Angeles Times. \u201cSanctuary policies create Balkanization on an issue with important foreign policy implications and corresponding potential for diplomatic embarrassment,\u201d they added. \u201cAs the Supreme Court affirmed in Arizona v. United States (2012), \u2018the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government\u2019 because it \u2018touch[es] on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump, his administration, and his supporters should explain and popularize the expression \u201cfugitive cities.\u201d They carefully should measure the human toll of this outrageous phenomenon. And, once armed with these data, they should give the local, county, and state officials who facilitate this mayhem the option to stand down.

I tend to be more sympathetic to the populist and nationalist impulses than some other conservatives. But I also recognize that, over the long term, every political movement is destined to end in failure and disillusionment. The open question is whether populism has any success and does any good before that inevitable reckoning. And then, if it has success, whether it gets to indulge its worst impulses and do damage on the way down.\n\nIn the meantime, however, there are a few ways liberals and technocrats can handle the populist challenge. It\u2019s worth exploring them in broad terms.\n\n\nPassive resistance: Wait for populism to fall on its face.\n\nYou may not wait long. Because technocratic liberalism did such a thorough job progressively stigmatizing populist ideas as low-status, marginal, and cretinous, the ranks of populist political movements are overstuffed with marginal, low-status cretins. Even if the voters empower them in protest of, say, a Hillary Clinton, surely the charlatans and jerks in the populist movement will immediately reveal their rank incompetence and be swiftly removed from office.\n\n\n\n\nTo change the metaphors, it\u2019s altogether possible that a little bit of populism will have the effect of inoculating the whole system. Perhaps the Trump years will be so obviously a disaster that no one will want to try anything like it again.\n\nTriangulation: Take the criticism to heart and take some of populists\u2019 issues on board.\n\nThis is the strategy of adjusting liberalism in order to save it. You can compromise with populism to a degree, in the name of preserving democracy. Perhaps you find trade barriers economically inefficient, but you can at least accept them as being the result of the democratic process. Perhaps you can enthusiastically accept the populist demand for Britain to regain its political sovereignty, and by doing so guide it to maintain the closest possible trading relations with Europe. Perhaps you can protect your broadly tolerant society, and maintain the racial and religious diversity your policies have created, by slowing down the rate of future immigration and strengthening a core national culture until it has assimilative power.\n\nBrinksmanship: Assimilate the worst features of populism in order to defeat it.\n\nFinally, you could determine that the stakes are existential and dig in for a ferocious battle. If you believe that populism and nationalism will, if unimpeded, vitiate your democracy, destroy your freedom to express your views, fill your society with an irrational fear of foreigners, and make your country an authoritarian nightmare, you could . . . opt to do all those nasty things on behalf of liberalism. Don\u2019t like the democratic verdict? Ignore it. Or delegitimize it as the product of nefarious Russian interference. Think the populists are leveraging digital platforms to advance their agenda? Make legal-sounding threats until Silicon Valley transforms itself into the de facto speech police and ministry of propaganda for the liberal order. Encourage your most unstable people in utter hysteria and accept that a few of them may try to shoot congressman or assault people in the streets on behalf of the liberal world order. Make memes celebrating them.\n\n\n\n\nThere are risks to each of these strategies and each is not always applicable. Some say Brexit is falling on its face. But that cause is now led by Theresa May, a prime minister who campaigned for remaining in the European Union, and the difficulties she has run into can be attributed to her half-heartedness or her willingness to compromise with figures such as Philip Hammond, her chancellor of the Exchequer. May certainly isn\u2019t the leader the Brexiteers would have chosen. You could put your faith in the boorish incompetence of populists and yet still see them preside over periods of economic growth and increased popularity. That\u2019s been the result in Poland so far.\n\nI always like to bet on human fallibility, so I think the strategy I take to be the wisest in this instance \u2014 democratic triangulation \u2014 will be left mostly untried.

Mccarthy", "body": "Carter Page addresses the audience during a presentation in Moscow, Russia, December 12, 2016.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Sergei  column that posted last night is an in-depth analysis of the Schiff memo, the response of House Intelligence Committee Democrats to the Nunes memo published by committee Republicans. I offer a variety of reasons why the response principally proffered by the committee\u2019s ranking member, Representative Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), fails to defend the issuance of FISA court surveillance warrants against an American citizen tied to the Trump campaign, Carter Page, in a counterintelligence investigation seeking to probe suspected ties between Donald Trump and Russia. The warrant was issued based on uncorroborated hearsay allegations from unknown sources, compiled in the so-called Steele dossier. The FBI and Justice Department failed to disclose that these allegations were generated by an opposition-research project commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs I argue in the column, the Schiff memo leaves no doubt that the key allegation supporting issuance of the warrant is the Steele dossier\u2019s claim that, while on a well-publicized trip to Moscow in July 2016, Page met with two top Putin regime operatives, Igor Sechin and Igor Divyekin. Page credibly denies the meetings; former British spy Christoper Steele\u2019s claim that they happened is based on unidentified hearsay sources that he concedes he never confirmed; and all indications are that the FBI never corroborated them. In congressional testimony, Former FBI director James Comey described the dossier\u2019s allegations about Donald Trump as \u201csalacious and unverified.\u201d Furthermore, according to a memo published by two senior Senate Judiciary Committee members \u2014 Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) \u2014 then-director Comey conceded that the Bureau did not corroborate Steele\u2019s sources and relied on the fact that Steele had given the FBI reliable information in the past. (See Grassley-Graham memo, p.2.)\n\nAt the Washington Examiner, Byron York picks up on something I wish I had highlighted: The Schiff memo\u2019s focus on past Russian intelligence efforts (in 2013) to recruit Page to become an agent for Russia. As Byron notes, the Schiff memo claims that \u201cSteele\u2019s information about Page was consistent with the FBI\u2019s assessment of Russian intelligence efforts to recruit him and his connections to Russian persons of interest.\u201d\n\nThe fact that a foreign power is trying to recruit an American to become an agent for that foreign power is not a sufficient basis to issue a surveillance warrant against the American under FISA. It would, of course, be sufficient to issue a warrant against the foreign spies who are making the recruitment efforts, but it is not enough for a warrant against the American citizen who is the target of the recruitment effort.\n\nTo get a surveillance warrant under FISA (i.e., the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as codified at Title 50, U.S. Code, Sections 1801 et seq.), the FBI and the Justice Department must establish probable cause that the person to be monitored under the warrant is acting as an active, purposeful agent of a foreign power \u2014 not that the foreign power hopes to turn him into such an agent.\n\nFISA defines \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d \u2014 as that term is applicable to \u201cU.S. persons\u201d (i.e., American citizens and permanent-resident aliens) \u2014 as a person who:\u00a0\n\n(A) knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;\n\n(B) pursuant to the direction of an intelligence service or network of a foreign power, knowingly engages in any other clandestine intelligence activities for or on behalf of such foreign power, which activities involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;\n\n(C) knowingly engages in sabotage or international terrorism, or activities that are in preparation therefor, for or on behalf of a foreign power;\u00a0\n\n(D) knowingly enters the United States under a false or fraudulent identity for or on behalf of a foreign power or, while in the United States, knowingly assumes a false or fraudulent identity for or on behalf of a foreign power; or\u00a0\n\n(E) knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) or knowingly conspires with any person to engage in activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).\n\n(See Section 1801(b)(2)(A)-(E), emphasis added.)\n\nEven assuming the FBI and Justice Department could prove that efforts were being made to recruit a U.S. person to become an agent of a foreign power, that would not come close to the probable cause showing required under FISA. If the government wants to establish that an American is a foreign agent, it must demonstrate that the American is knowingly engaged in clandestine activity on behalf of the foreign power that is so egregious it very likely constitutes a serious federal felony \u2014 e.g., terrorism, sabotage, or using false identities while spying on behalf of the foreign power.\n\nTo date, after dueling memos from Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, plus the Grassley-Graham memo from the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have only one allegation regarding Page that approaches the statutorily required showing that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power: the Steele dossier\u2019s claim that Page met separately with Sechin and Divyekin, and discussed with them, respectively, a corrupt quid pro quo to end sanctions against Russia, and the possibility that the Kremlin would provide the Trump campaign with damaging information (\u201ckompromat\u201d) against Hillary Clinton (along with a warning that Trump should be careful dealing with Russia because the Kremlin had kompromat on him, too).\n\nIn light of the legal standard that applies, it is inconceivable that the FISA warrant would have issued in the absence of this uncorroborated hearsay allegation \u2014 which is exactly what FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe stated in December 2017 House Intelligence Committee testimony (a Nunes memo assertion (at p.3, para.4) that the Schiff memo does not attempt to rebut), and exactly what is reported in the Grassley-Graham memo (at p.2: \u201cThe bulk of the application consists of allegations against Page that were disclosed to the FBI by Mr. Steele and are also outlined in the Steele dossier\u201d). Schiff may be right that there were several layers of information in the warrant application about what Russia was doing regarding the election and Russia\u2019s efforts to recruit foreign agents \u2014 including Page. But specifically with respect to Page, who was targeted for surveillance and as to whom the government was legally required to show probable cause that he was a knowing, active agent of a foreign power, without the Sechin/Divyekin allegation, there could have been no basis for the warrant.\n\nOne last point of law that is covered in more detail in my column. FISA also requires the FBI and Justice Department to satisfy the court that surveillance \u2014 highly intrusive eavesdropping on the phone, email, text, and other communications of the alleged agent of a foreign power \u2014 is necessary because the information sought \u201ccannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques.\u201d (See FISA, Section 1804(a)(6)(C).) Such techniques include interviewing the alleged foreign agent.\n\nThe Schiff memo acknowledges that the FBI has interviewed Page numerous times over the years, including as late as March 2016 \u2014 six months before the FISA warrant. Yet, the Schiff memo fails to explain that Page was a government cooperator in a 2013 investigation of Russian spies, and that his information was used to prosecute the spies. In fact, this is the very matter in which the Russians were trying to recruit Page. I pointed out this out in responding to the Schiff memo\u2019s precursor, a letter from the Intelligence Committee\u2019s senior Democrat, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York:\n\nOn the question of criminality, I note that many commentators point to Page\u2019s involvement in a prior FBI investigation involving Russia, and darkly observe that he \u201cwas on the Bureau\u2019s radar screen for years\u201d before the October 2016 FISA warrant application \u2014 as if this supposition were a substitute for FISA\u2019s legal requirement of proving criminal activity. But the 2013 investigation into which Page stumbled was a case of Russian agents trying to recruit him as a source. Far from doing anything criminal, Page appears to have cooperated with the FBI and Justice Department to nail the Russian spies. (See the Justice Department\u2019s complaint in United States v. Buryakov, at pp. 12\u201313 \u2014 Page is \u201cMale-1,\u201d whom the Russian spy Victor Podobnyy refers to as an \u201cidiot,\u201d and whose 2013 interview by the FBI is described in paragraph 34.) Again, we don\u2019t know everything the FBI knows, but based on what we have been told, it appears that in the prior case, Page worked with the United States against Russia; that does not jibe with the allegation in the FISA warrant application that he worked with Russia against the United States.\n\nConsider these two facts. First, there is no public indication that Page has ever been unwilling to speak to federal investigators or has ever lied to them in the many times he has been interviewed \u2014 unlike, say, Christopher Steele, who was terminated as an informant for violating his agreement about press contacts and for apparently lying to the FBI about speaking to the media. Second, the FBI and Justice Department quite understandably wanted to know whether Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin but were unable to verify Steele\u2019s hearsay claim that he had.\n\nThere is no public indication that Page has ever been unwilling to speak to federal investigators or has ever lied to them in the many times he has been interviewed.\n\nWith those things in mind, I will close here with the same questions I asked in the column posted last night:\n\n\nWhen Steele brought the FBI his unverified allegations that Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin, why didn\u2019t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance?\n\nGiven that it is a requirement of federal FISA law that the FBI and Justice Department demonstrate that surveillance is necessary because alternative investigative techniques have been tried and have failed, or would fail if tried, what did the government agents and lawyers tell the FISA court about why interviewing Page would not yield the information they were seeking?", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mairead Mcardle", "body": "ProLife Democrat Dan Lipinski Wins Illinois Primary\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPro-life Democrat Dan Lipinski snatched a narrow victory on Tuesday over newcomer progressive\u00a0Marie Newman in the Chicago-area district he has held for seven years.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for the incumbent candidate, who leads by less than two percentage points with 97\u00a0percent of precincts reporting.\n\nNewman, who argued Lipinski\u2019s views are out of date, garnered powerful professional allies, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Verm.), who is popular in the district.\u00a0 Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Human Rights Campaign, EMILY\u2019s List, MoveOn.org, and former Obama advisor David Axelrod also lent their support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance we wake up in recount mode,\u201d Newman told her supporters Tuesday evening.\n\nThe race was seen as a litmus test for Democrats for whether pro-life candidates are still welcome in the party.\n\nLipinski is against abortion and voted against same-sex marriage and Obamacare, moves that his opponent said make him not a \u201ctrue Democrat.\u201d He refused to endorse Barack Obama for re-election in 2012.\n\nMany in his own party have blasted his views, calling him \u201cone of the worst.\u201d Even the\u00a0Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not endorse him this time around.\n\n\u201cDan Lipinski may have a D next to his name \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t have true Democratic values,\u201d said NARAL president Ilyse Hogue. \u201cHe\u2019s consistently undermined the rights of women, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lipinski is known around the neighborhood and supported by many labor groups, including\u00a0Illinois AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cCompromise is essential to getting things done,\u201d he said last week.\u00a0\u201cAnd the party and the country cannot afford a Tea Party of the left.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cif it means that you have to support abortion to be a Democrat, a lot of people will walk away,\u201d said Kristen Day, the Democrats For Life executive director.\n\nLipinski does not face much competition in the general election, as the candidate running on the Republican side of the ballot is\u00a0the former head of the American Nazi Party and\u00a0has been disowned by his own party.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jibran Khan", "body": "(Yves  If foreign investment in the U.S. is arbitrarily blocked through executive order, half the purpose of corporate-tax reform is defeated.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn Monday, President Trump issued an executive order to block Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s takeover of Qualcomm before the two companies had even made a deal. In the order, the president says that \u201cthere is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited .\u00a0.\u00a0. might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201d The move seems to have worked, given that Broadcom withdrew and terminated its $117 billion bid on Wednesday morning. What this evidence entails is highly unclear.\n\nBroadcom and Qualcomm are major players in the mobile-technology space. The two companies produce much of the silicon that powers laptops, phones, and tablets. Despite Broadcom\u2019s Singapore corporate headquarters, it is largely an American company and started as a division of Hewlett-Packard in the 1960s. The company plans to move its headquarters to the U.S. next month, quite possibly as a result of corporate-tax reform. In fact, Broadcom\u2019s CEO announced the move at the White House this past autumn, standing beside President Trump as he did so.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the latest in a long line of trade restrictions that the administration has taken in the name of national security. Each has been fast-tracked unilaterally by means of Cold War\u2013era statutes, including the recent steel and aluminum taxes. The Trump administration has been quietly blocking international business deals via a Treasury Department panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), that is chaired by Steven Mnuchin. In the case of Broadcom, the president chose the much more visible route of issuing an executive order as well. Why did this call for such visibility? Trump will be in San Diego next week; it is entirely possible that he wants to claim \u201cvictory\u201d at Qualcomm\u2019s offices.\n\nMany have argued that the block allows Qualcomm to remain ahead of China\u2019s Huawei as the market leader in 5G technology; indeed, even the Wall Street Journal endorses the Trump executive order on those grounds, despite its stance against the steel and aluminum tariffs. The Journal editors argue that a Broadcom merger would have meant that Qualcomm\u2019s 5G technology effectively ceased, because Broadcom is in the habit of deprioritizing spending on research and development. That claim does not hold up to scrutiny. Qualcomm is currently the market leader in 5G technology, which \u201cis a core piece of the franchise Broadcom is trying to purchase,\u201d according to an analyst with Bernstein Research before the deal was blocked, and 5G expansion was the stated reason for Broadcom\u2019s interest in the merger. Furthermore, Qualcomm has incurred costly fines and lawsuits that are likely to take a toll on the company and that Broadcom\u2019s cash influx would help pay for.\n\nTrump\u2019s most prominent Senate ally on trade, Senator Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), while praising the executive order on the Senate floor, laid out the other argument, \u201cthat China has been rapacious about trade and very smart. They look for places where they can steal our best technology.\u201d That argument is based on the fact that Broadcom works with Chinese companies .\u00a0.\u00a0. but so does Qualcomm. In fact, so do just about all tech companies. Perhaps Schumer and Trump believe Singapore to be part of China, but it is no more so than Geneva is part of France. (Even if the company were not mostly American, which it is, Singapore is a staunch ally anyway.)\n\n\n\n\nThere are fears that the continual denials issued by CFIUS will lead to a chilling effect on international investment. With the expectation that approval for mergers and acquisitions will be denied by Washington, foreign companies may simply decide against the uncertainty of making investments in the U.S., and other countries could retaliate by erecting regulatory barriers against American firms.\n\nThe Broadcom-Qualcomm merger would have been the largest in tech history. It was likely to run into antitrust issues, especially given that the two companies between them produce most smartphone components. The deal might have been stopped in its tracks by antitrust regulators, but in that case at least the reasons would have been transparent.\n\nSuch abuse of executive authority cheapens appeals to national security and advances Congress\u2019s abdication of its own authority.\n\n\nIt is dangerous that national-security authority is invoked to justify any measure to stop something that the president does not like. Abuse of that authority cheapens appeals to national security and advances Congress\u2019s abdication of authority by encouraging unilateral decision-making from the executive branch. It seems likely to me that the order is driven by Trump\u2019s \u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d instincts, dressed up in the rhetoric of national security for easy implementation and buy-in from the ideologically unmoored. What\u2019s more, Trump is not alone.

But it\u2019s a surprise that the president should endeavor to repeat throughout the midterm elections if he hopes to bolster his first term with any legislative achievements beyond tax reform.\n\n\n\n\nThe presidential tweet\u2019s conciliatory tone is an unfamiliar one, especially in light of Romney\u2019s sustained public opposition to Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016. In March of that year, Romney delivered a major speech urging Republicans to vote strategically in order to deny Trump an outright majority of delegates heading into the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which would have opened the possibility of a non-Trump compromise candidate winning the Republican nomination. Unlike many leaders on the right, who slowly came to embrace the unconventional candidate, Romney persisted in vocally opposing Trump even after he had secured the nomination.\n\nIn May of 2016 \u2014 after Trump had won the Indiana primary and all but locked up the nomination \u2014 Romney explained his rationale in steadfastly opposing the GOP nominee to the Wall Street Journal:\n\nI wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn\u2019t ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world. . . . I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak, but that\u2019s how I can sleep at night.\n\nRomney went on to skip July\u2019s Republican National Convention. Later, he denounced Trump\u2019s comments on the infamous Access Hollywood tape that emerged just a month before the November election.\n\nAll of this makes Trump\u2019s immediate support for Romney\u2019s Senate campaign fairly puzzling. Trump has never been known for receiving public criticism with grace \u2014 whether those volleys come from perceived enemies on the left or would-be allies on the right. Despite being the standard bearer of the GOP in 2016, Trump often refused to support the Senate campaigns of Republicans who didn\u2019t embrace his own candidacy as enthusiastically as he wished. Indeed, in the weeks before his inauguration, some speculated that Trump had entertained the possibility of Romney\u2019s nomination as secretary of state \u2014 only to spurn him and choose Rex Tillerson \u2014 as a way to exact revenge for Romney\u2019s failure to endorse his candidacy.\n\nIn fact, both during and after the 2016 elections, Trump appeared to revel in attacking Republicans who expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership of the GOP. The laundry list of Trump\u2019s rhetorical onslaughts against members of his own party has grown too lengthy to explore in great detail, but no Republican daring enough to criticize him has been left unscathed \u2014 and that includes Romney, whom Trump personally attacked on over a dozen occasions during the course of 2016 alone.\n\nRepublican Senate candidates\u2019 lack of gusto for Trump\u2019s campaign, however, didn\u2019t end up being terribly detrimental to them in the 2016 elections \u2014 at least, not as detrimental as hardcore Trump supporters insisted it would be. Many Republican incumbents even ran ahead of Trump in their home states: from Ron Johnson in Wisconsin to Marco Rubio in Florida to Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman, among others.\n\nAnd Romney will surely be no exception in Utah, with or without the president\u2019s endorsement. In 2016, the state did go to Trump, but over 20 percent of Utah voters supported third-party candidate Evan McMullin, the largest share of the vote he received in any state, by far. Utah is a conservative state, but it\u2019s not a Trump state, and from the looks of Romney\u2019s opening salvo in the campaign, he knows it.\n\nHis young candidacy has already been fascinating, if only for what it has revealed about both Trump and Democrats. Some on the left insist that Romney\u2019s willingness to accept Trump\u2019s endorsement proves he\u2019ll never dare to oppose the president on anything. Those expecting Romney to arrive on the Senate floor as the newly minted Republican anti-Trump will likely be disappointed, yes, but to large swathes of the left, any failure to loudly condemn Trump\u2019s every word is equivalent to abetting his supposed attempts to overthrow our Republic.\n\nBy every indication, Romney will tread a middle course, and there\u2019s no evidence that he has bowed obsequiously to Trump since 2016 in order to win the president\u2019s support. For example, Romney didn\u2019t hesitate last August to roundly condemn the president\u2019s failure to single out white nationalists and neo-Nazis for criticism after the alt-right\u2019s Charlottesville rally.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Romney\u2019s campaign-announcement video contained a few lines that could very easily be taken as a critique of the president. For instance: \u201cUtah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington. . . . Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the word. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion. And on Utah\u2019s Capitol Hill, people treat one another with respect.\u201d And several outlets have reported this week that sources close to Romney say that, as senator, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to publicly critique the president as he sees fit.\n\nEven so, the president\u2019s quick embrace of Romney \u2014 appearing to set aside the vitriol of 2016 \u2014 seems to suggest that he\u2019s willing to overlook past transgressions for the sake of building a Republican coalition capable of winning the midterms. If that\u2019s the case, that calculation would be a huge shift for Trump, and a welcome one for GOP lawmakers handcuffed by the slim Senate majority and concerned about losing the House to Democrats in November.\n\nAs senator, Romney wouldn\u2019t hesitate to publicly critique the president as he sees fit.\n\nPerhaps Trump has realized that, if he wishes to sign major legislation into law beyond last December\u2019s tax reform, he\u2019ll need more than 51 GOP senators to get the job done. Alternatively, perhaps the president suspected that Romney might be able to win in Utah even without his support and wanted to preempt that possibility by getting on board early so that he can claim credit come November.\n\n\nRegardless, urged on by his ever-present desire for victory, Trump should take the same good will he\u2019s managed to muster toward Romney and apply it to the campaign of every viable Republican candidate, regardless of past feuds. After all, he knows better than most how to wield the undeniable power of his persona and the loyalty of his base to drum up broader support on the campaign trail, and he\u2019ll be especially successful in doing so if he focuses on last year\u2019s popular tax-reform legislation \u2014 and Republicans\u2019 undeniable success in confirming conservative judges \u2014 rather than his own petty grudges.\n\nIf he follows such a course, Donald Trump would be doing the Republican party a huge favor.

But then again, President Obama was in the middle of a recession as opposed to an economic boom. President George W. Bush, hardly an exemplar of budgetary restraint, took nearly five times as long to run up his first trillion dollars of red ink.\n\n\n\n\nWe now owe more than $21 trillion in debt, more than 100 percent of GDP, and roughly $65,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country. With annual deficits projected to exceed $1 trillion for as far as the eye can see, the debt is expected to top $23 trillion within a decade. From there the sky is the limit as the unfunded liabilities of programs such as Social Security and Medicare kick in.\n\nOne might hope that this rising flood of red ink would concern someone in Washington. Instead, Congress is preparing to pass an omnibus spending bill that will make things dramatically worse.\n\nThe $1.3 trillion spending bill will fund much of the federal government for the fiscal year that began October 1 of last year. Yes, you read that right: Congress is voting on a funding bill for a year that is already half over. And if the bill fails to pass by Friday, we will once again face the prospect of a partial government shutdown.\n\nConcerns over the debt, spending, and the size of government are distinctly out of fashion in Trump\u2019s Washington. But ignoring the consequences of government profligacy won\u2019t make them go away.\n\nBut as ridiculous as the process may be, the omnibus bill is far worse. We likely won\u2019t know everything that is in the bill until after it\u2019s passed. Some items, such as funding for President Trump\u2019s border wall, anti-abortion riders, and $900 million for a rail-and-tunnel project connecting New York and New Jersey that is opposed by President Trump, are still being negotiated, even as the House prepares to vote as early as today. It is unlikely that more than a handful of members will have actually read the bill before the vote.\n\nThat won\u2019t stop the bill from passing on a bipartisan basis, of course, because it will be stuffed with plenty of goodies for both parties. Overall, it will increase federal spending by the largest amount since 2009. Democrats are reportedly set to get a $63 billion increase in domestic discretionary spending, including a $15 billion bailout for insurance companies under Obamacare. Meanwhile, Republicans will receive $80 billion in additional spending on the Pentagon. And the bill for all this will fall to our children and grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the omnibus passes, we can expect a parade of members of both parties appearing on television to congratulate themselves for finally having done their job. The omnibus will be hailed as a model of bipartisan cooperation and example of what Washington can accomplish if Democrats and Republicans simply put aside inconvenient things like principles and work together. Then they can all hurry home to campaign. Let the good times roll.\n\nConcerns over the debt, spending, and the size of government are distinctly out of fashion in Trump\u2019s Washington.

Now Trump has few good  are dead and thousands wounded after an intensive bombing campaign in Eastern Ghouta by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Images of bloodied children, carnage, and destroyed homes have made the rounds across major media outlets. Opinion pieces have slowly started to roll out questioning President Trump\u2019s decision to remain removed from the conflict, with criticism coming most notably from two former Obama State Department appointees, Evelyn Farkas and Frederic Hof, writing in The Atlantic.\n\nThis is nothing more than an attempt to confuse the fact that Obama, not Trump, is responsible for the worsening bloodshed in Syria.\n\n\n\n\nSyria has been in a state of civil war since March 2011. More than 500,000 have been killed and millions remain displaced in one of the worst humanitarian crises in the modern era. European governments have been destabilized from the millions of refugees who have fled, seeking safety. How did the United States let it get this bad? Because President Obama offered no leadership as Syria descended into chaos and the world is now forced to face the aftermath of that mistake.\n\nObama\u2019s decision to remain clear of Syria was calculated. Looking for a major foreign-policy achievement, the president wanted to cement his legacy by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. Negotiators from Tehran issued a warning to Washington that no deal would happen if the United States became embroiled in the Syrian civil war. Presented with the opportunity to secure the nuclear deal, Obama and his team decided to \u201clead from behind\u201d in Syria, leaving other nations to deal with the issue.\n\nUnfortunately, the Iran Deal had the consequence of significantly accelerating strife in Syria. By freeing up hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctioned money, Tehran was able to prop up Assad and his murderous regime, to the generous tune of $6 to $35 billion a year, according to the U.N. special envoy to Iran, Staffan de Mistura. Oil, foot soldiers, and munitions followed. Worse, Iran was able to provide substantial funding to its proxy group, Hezbollah, whose radical Islamist fighters poured into Syria to support Assad.\n\nObama\u2019s lack of leadership in Syria also left other actors to fill the gap. Seeing an opportunity to advance his goal of returning Russia to global-power status, Vladimir Putin sent soldiers and military support to the Syrian regime in 2015. Moscow continues to help train Assad\u2019s forces and has partaken in airstrikes. Russia-Syrian joint forces have conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Eastern Ghouta alone.\n\nEven as Russia stepped up its influence alongside Iran and Hezbollah, and the situation continued to deteriorate, President Obama kept America on the sidelines. Syrians faced the meat grinder of the Assad regime, and Washington apparently didn\u2019t feel obligated to highlight the atrocities. The Obama administration remained silent on Iran and Hezbollah\u2019s frequent attacks on civilian populations.\n\nWhile images of ISIS beheading American captives splashed across television screens worldwide, the Obama administration remained mired in passivity.\n\nSurprisingly, Washington even curtailed the use of military force against radical Islamist groups such as ISIS. While images of ISIS beheading American captives splashed across television screens worldwide, the Obama administration remained mired in passivity. Former CIA director Mike Morrell disclosed that fear of environmental harm, from the destruction of ISIS\u2019s oil wells, kept the U.S. from waging a full-fledged campaign to destroy the terror group and its financing mechanisms. So we launched strikes on individual trucks rather than oil wells or  Obama\u2019s inaction on this front wasn\u2019t the worst of his blunders. Previously, the president had set a \u201cred line\u201d warning the Syrian government that the United States would not accept the use of chemical weapons in the conflict. \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,\u201d Obama noted in August 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBut the red line vanished. The world watched in shock as Assad slaughtered his own people using chemical weapons, testing the former president\u2019s response. Obama condemned the attack and expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d over the situation, but no tangible concessions from Assad or military response followed. He proved his own \u201cred line\u201d to be an empty threat, shattering American credibility.\n\nWith Obama\u2019s missteps, one is right to ask what Trump has done since he\u2019s taken office. To start, he has loosed the rules of engagement to allow our troops to be less constrained when combating radical Islamist terrorist groups. ISIS remains on the run in both Syria and Iraq and has lost more than 98 percent of its territory, mostly since Trump took office.\n\nThe authoritarian regimes in Iran and Russia have also been put on watch. In a recent major escalation, United States forces killed or wounded more than 300 Kremlin-backed guns for hire near the city of Deir al-Zor, in Syria. Assailants attempted to launch an assault on an American base and were obliterated in a clash more deadly than any single occasion during the cold war. Trump offered no apologies or condolences to Putin after it was revealed that dozens of fighters were Russian citizens, fighting under the guise of mercenaries.\n\n\n\n\nMost significantly, the Trump administration has stood firm on its stance that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable. Emboldened by Obama\u2019s feeble response, Assad launched a chemical attack on the Syrian city of Khan Shaykhun in April 2017. More than 80 were killed, with hundreds injured including women and children.\n\n\n\n\nThe United States responded immediately, launching 59 Tomahawk missiles at Shayrat Airbase and wiping out approximately 20 percent of the Assad regime\u2019s airpower. Thankfully, these actions made clear that the current administration will take decisive measures to ensure that chemical weapons are not normalized.\n\n\nDespite these firm actions from the current administration, Trump can do only so much. President Obama ceded too much control to Iran and Russia, and further American involvement would probably initiate a major military confrontation. So when you see the humanitarian catastrophe blare across your television, remember that President Obama is the reason we cannot do more. America\u2019s hands remain tied from past failures.\n\nBlaming the current Syria situation on President Trump is both dishonest and unscrupulous. Obama\u2019s handling of Syria was disastrous. Expecting Trump to fix the mess overnight is ridiculous. He and his team are now attempting to uphold international law and halt the worsening humanitarian crisis.

The question the U.S. Supreme Court will consider\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0is whether Cilek\u2019s expressive shirt impermissibly interfered with Minnesota\u2019s interest in maintaining \u201cpeace, order and decorum\u201d at polling places.\n\nMinnesota forbids voters from wearing in a polling place political badges, buttons, or other insignia designed to \u201cinfluence and impact\u201d voting, or \u201cpromoting a group with recognizable political views,\u201d even if the things worn do not refer to any candidate or issue on that day\u2019s ballot.

Cilek\u2019s T-shirt featured the Gadsden Flag (\u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d) and a small tea-party logo. He also sported a button, from a group worried about voter fraud, that read \u201cPlease I.D.

It is, however, a bit much for Minnesota to forbid passive expression of political \u2014 very broadly defined \u2014 allegiances not associated with any person or issue being voted on. What about a shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity\u201d? Those words, which a guide for University of California employees says can constitute a \u201cmicroaggression,\u201d could trigger fainting spells among voters at polling places sniffing for the reek of unchecked white privilege.\n\nAnd what about a T-shirt with a pristinely unpolitical message (e.g., \u201cI despise cocker spaniels\u201d) that might disturb some sensitive souls in a polling place? The Supreme Court can try to enunciate what is unimaginable \u2014 clear standards concerning every conceivable language use in a hypersensitive America. Or the court can give its squint of strict scrutiny to all such polling-place laws, many of which will not pass muster. Otherwise, polling-place officials will have broad discretion to lay down the law, if it can be dignified as law, on an ad hoc basis concerning what is and is not a \u201crecognizable\u201d political view or \u201cundue\u201d influence.\n\n\nThe First Amendment was ratified in 1791. One hundred and twenty-eight years passed before the court confronted a case \u2014 three cases, actually \u2014 squarely concerning freedom of speech. Dealing disgracefully with residues of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s wartime semi-totalitarianism, the court held: During wartime, the government can restrict speech that could \u201ccreate a clear and present danger\u201d of evils that Congress has the power to prevent. And the guarantee of free speech does not protect printing leaflets urging disruption of the war effort. And Wilson\u2019s administration did not violate the amendment when it imprisoned Eugene Victor Debs \u2014 he had received 6 percent of the presidential vote as the Socialist Party\u2019s candidate in 1912 \u2014 because he made an anti-war speech.\n\nNowadays, the court frequently adjudicates speech controversies because governments eagerly embrace sinister rationalizations for \u201cbalancing\u201d free speech against competing values, to the detriment of free speech. Hence the court should affirm Cilek\u2019s admirably prickly resistance to Minnesota\u2019s officiousness.

To be sure, they both draw on some of the same political trends, notably a distrust of elites and an upsurge of popular anger over evident failures of public policy such as illegal immigration. But opposition to Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union has been the firm belief of a large and passionate number of voters, sometimes a plurality, in U.K. politics ever since Britain joined in 1973. Trumpism, on the other hand, is a very recent phenomenon (even if long germinating). Also, though Brexit may be proving hard to achieve, it\u2019s a clear and well-defined idea: that Britain should leave the EU to regain its former status as a self-governing democracy. Trumpism, however, is a work in progress, which, as in the paintings of some modern artists, may not even exist as a distinct concept in the mind of the artist.\n\nDespite these differences, however, both Trump and Brexit have inspired the same sort of derangement syndrome. And, as it happens, both such syndromes have been triggered by the same event in the past few days \u2014 namely, the crisis arising from the poisoning of the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the picturesque English cathedral town of Salisbury. As soon as the broad facts were known and the suspicion formed \u2014 in part because Russian television gloated unbecomingly over it \u2014 that President Putin\u2019s Russia was behind this attempted murder, two opinions began to be heard.\n\n\n\n\nThe first was that President Trump would remain silent on the matter and fail to offer any real support to Theresa May and the Brits. Very quickly this criticism lost its conditional tone, and it began to be asserted that Trump had actually failed to offer such support. Whole days had gone by and he had still failed to condemn Putin \u2014 and, of course, we all knew why that was, didn\u2019t we? He was in Putin\u2019s pocket and didn\u2019t want to discommode his ally/co-conspirator/boss.\n\nSo what was the timetable?\n\nSkripal and his daughter were found comatose and apparently dying on a park bench in Salisbury on the afternoon of Wednesday, March 7. On Monday, March 12, Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons that according to British experts the Skripals had been poisoned by a nerve agent that Russia had developed. This meant, she said, either that the Russian state had launched a direct attack on Britain or that it had lost control of a potentially catastrophic poison. She demanded a reply from the Russian government by\u00a0midnight\u00a0of Tuesday, March 13. No satisfactory explanation was forthcoming, and on Wednesday, March 14, May declared that it was overwhelmingly likely that the Russian state had directly attacked Britain. She then announced a series of anti-Russian sanctions.\n\nTwo days before that, however, when May was giving her first statement to the Commons, leaving open the question of whether this had been a Russian attack or a loss of control over their stockpiles, Jon Sopel of the BBC asked in a tweet whether there would now be from Trump a \u201ccondemnation\u201d of the attack, as it was a case of \u201cSo far silence from Britain\u2019s closest ally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThat was echoed in the London Times on the 13th \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0i.e., the day before May\u2019s second and more conclusive statement \u2014 in a statement from former foreign secretary and Labour moderate David Miliband: \u201cIt is very significant\u00a0and very worrying, frankly, that the White House has not felt able to point the finger at Russia in the last seven or eight days.\u201d\n\nIn the same edition of the Times, Alex Massie in an op-ed dealt briskly with the awkward problem that Rex Tillerson had condemned the Russian actions in the clearest terms: \u201cWhen Rex Tillerson, in one of his final acts as US secretary of state, condemned Russian aggression in Wiltshire it was obvious that he was barely speaking for his badly understaffed department, let alone for the US administration as a whole.\u201d He concluded gloomily that \u201calliances are based on reliability and no one, least of all its friends, can rely on this American administration.\u201d Anne Applebaum (of whom more later) in the Washington Post joined in this chorus. And Anthony Lane, writing in The New Yorker, had an even more severe judgment on the Tillerson case.\n\nYes, Tillerson had been admirably \u201crobust\u201d in his criticism of Russia\u2019s attack in Wiltshire, he wrote, but that outspokenness had led to serious consequences for him: \u201cHe lost his job.\u201d Of course, we learned almost immediately that Tillerson had been fired three days\u00a0before\u00a0condemning Russia. But that alone would not necessarily have satisfied those suffering from Trump derangement syndrome. They might well have argued that his firing meant that he was now finally free to defy Trump and condemn Putin \u2014 if Trump had not himself condemned Russia in strong terms even as they were writing.\n\n\n\n\nAsked by journalists on Tuesday the 13th (in the interval between May\u2019s two statements), he told the cameras that he would be talking to Theresa May later in the day but that until then: \u201cIt seems to me they think like it\u2019s Russia and I would certainly take that finding as fact. If we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\u201d\n\nTrump says this in about three different ways in the course of 39 seconds. He was widely reported in the American media as having \u201chedged\u201d his support, but in\u00a0the video you can see that he\u2019s saying exactly what May was saying at that time, with the sole qualification that he\u2019s waiting to hear what she has to say to him personally. When they had the conversation later that day, Tuesday the 13th again, the White House put out a report expressing solidarity with the U.K. and stating that \u201cPresident Trump said that the US was with the UK all the way.\u201d That was followed on Wednesday\u00a0and Thursday\u00a0by two statements from the State Department condemning Russia, another from Ambassador Nikki Haley at the United Nations, and above all by a joint statement \u2014 from the U.S., the U.K., France, and Germany \u2014 that called the poisoning of the Skripals \u201cthe first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War. It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and any such use by a State party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all.\u201d In the middle of all these condemnations both the U.S. and the U.K. announced additional sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhich brings me to Brexit \u2014 and to Brexit Derangement Syndrome. In a sort of non-musical counterpoint to the denunciations of Trump, many of the same critics were developing an argument that Brexit meant that Britain was now isolated, alone, and without allies in the face of this Russian assault.\n\nIn a sort of counterpoint to the denunciations of Trump, many critics were developing an argument that Brexit meant that Britain was now isolated.\n\nThere was a little cognitive dissonance in these jeremiads because their authors wanted to suggest both that EU states such France and Germany would no longer be reliable allies for Britain post-Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0that nonetheless they would be much more reliable allies than Trump\u2019s America. The first of these melodies got a brief overture when a spokesman for President Macron described the called British response of anti-Russian sanctions \u201cfantasy politics,\u201d seeming to suggest that the French took the matter lightly. But he was quickly slapped down by Macron himself, who declared that he accepted the British view that the Russians were responsible for the poisoning, that it was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d that there had to be European and transatlantic unity in response, and that France would shortly announce measures in response.\n\nAnne-Elisabeth Moutet in the Telegraph brilliantly explained this turnabout, giving a historical\u00a0tour d\u2019horizon\u00a0of French attitudes, pointing out that, at least since de Gaulle, France has liked to be a reliable ally but a\u00a0difficult\u00a0one, so that its support would not be taken for granted. In general, however, the main theme concerning Brexit was that, in different ways, Britain had isolated itself from allies and therefore from its own security.\n\nThus Alex Massie\u2019s o-ped in the Times, mentioned above, was entitled \u201cBrexit Leaves Us Lonely in a Dangerous World,\u201d and after some reflections on the terrible silence of Trump, it developed this theme:\n\nAt the very moment when the UK needs a reliable partner in Washington it encounters the first \u201cAmerica First\u201d president since the Second World War. And it does so at the precise moment when it is cutting ties with its erstwhile continental partners. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Yes, we wish to maintain close working relationships and alliances with our European neighbours with whom we still have many common interests, but the unavoidable fact remains that a Britain leaving the EU is less well-placed to press the case for firm action against Russia than a Britain that was still a member would have been.\n\nAnne Applebaum in the Washington Post pressed home the same argument in a column entitled \u201cThe nerve agent attack on British soil has exposed London\u2019s isolation.\u201d Indeed, she considers that the Russian attack may even have been prompted by Brexit:\u00a0\u201cMore ominously, it may have been designed to expose Britain\u2019s new isolation: Now that it is leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom no longer has a set of allies it can rely upon to help craft a response.\u201d\n\nAnd she added: \u201cIf the point was to expose British isolation, it has succeeded.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, that was early in the week. Two days later the French, the Germans, and the Yanks were all lined up with the Brits to denounce Russia and to declare solidarity with the U.K. in a joint statement. That was a major development, and it was followed by an announcement of additional U.S. sanctions. But in another somersault \u2013 this time the reverse of Macron\u2019s \u2013 the new German foreign minister in Merkel\u2019s shaky coalition diluted this commitment and said that the Salisbury crisis was a \u201cbilateral\u201d dispute between Britain and Russia, and not a matter for the alliance as a whole. That was certainly a retreat from the joint statement of a few days before and arguably a breach of the solidarity it had proclaimed. But it seemed to have less to do with Brexit than with the drift of the new German government, in which the Social Democrats have more influence over foreign policy, towards a friendlier relationship with Russia \u2013 a \u201cdifficult partner\u201d but a necessary one, as the minister put it. And Berlin is indeed currently quarreling with its other partners in Central Europe, who are proving difficult in that they are resisting Russo-German plans to build a second Nordstream pipeline that would enable Moscow to service Germany with energy while cutting Central Europe out. On this matter, as it happens, the isolated Brits are supporting the Central Europeans.\n\nAnd there was a more general problem with the commentaries lamenting the isolation of Brexit Britain. They left out an extremely important aspect of European solidarity, namely, NATO, which is the main (and for practical purposes, the sole) organization for the defense of Europe. Not only is Britain a member of NATO, but the country is its single most important European member. That is true not only because the U.K. makes a stronger military and financial contribution to NATO than does any other European power, but also for reasons of geography: Germany and France are between the U.K. and the only power threatening European security, Russia. They need Britain far more than Britain needs them in the security realm. That alone makes them reliable allies, if not necessarily active or eager ones. And contrary to Massie\u2019s argument, that reality is not likely to change because the Brits want to set their own tax rates, regulations, and trading rules.\n\nThat leaves hanging Ms. Applebaum\u2019s argument that the U.K.\u2019s isolation born of Brexit prompted the attack. Given the allied support since given to Britain, that seems either a very severe Russian miscalculation or a mistaken analysis by the columnist. What, then, did prompt the attack (other than that Salisbury was where their target lived)? One clue lies in Applebaum\u2019s list of possible responses that the Brits could make to the attack. As she rightly says, it\u2019s hard to come up with sanctions that are both fast and effective. The longer-range sanctions on suspect Russian investment in London are doable, however, and I am more optimistic than she that something serious will now be done. New laws have recently been put in place to police hot and mafia money, and the latest Whitehall briefings in the Sunday newspapers suggest that they will shortly be activated against Putin cronies and oligarchs. We\u2019ll see.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne immediate sanction Applebaum mentions in passing, though, is that Britain \u201ccould reinforce its troops on the Russian border, in the Baltic states.\u201d That proposal leads to the thought that maybe the U.K.\u2019s existing \u201cleading role\u201d (alongside that of the Dutch and the French) in NATO\u2019s enhanced forward presence in the Baltic states was a possible motive for the Russian attack. For the Brits have been more willing than most NATO members to commit troops to the region to deter a Russian incursion \u2014 and that\u2019s very likely to be a bone in Putin\u2019s throat. In other words, it was Britain\u2019s commitment to its European allies that prompted the Russian attack rather than what Applebaum and Massie see as its isolation and estrangement from them.\n\nApplebaum and Massie get some unexpected (and doubtless unwelcome) support, however, from Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. He claims that the Brits are confecting the chemical-poisoning charges against Russia to \u201cdeflect attention\u201d from their difficulties in the Brexit negotiations with the EU. I doubt that he\u2019s suffering from any kind of syndrome, though. More plausibly, he\u2019s exploiting the Brexit derangement syndrome of the Remainers in the West to do some deflecting of his own \u2014 deflecting attention from the Russian threat to the independence of the Baltics and the Kremlin\u2019s real reasons for its reckless breaches of national sovereignty and international law.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rich Lowry", "body": "aren\u2019t divided because of Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf only Joe McCarthy had lived to see this moment, when it is suddenly in vogue to attribute large-scale events in American politics to the hand of Russia and to inveigh against domestic subversion.\n\nRobert Mueller released an indictment of 13 Russians for crimes related to their social-media campaign to meddle in our internal affairs in the run-up to and aftermath of the 2016 election.\n\nMueller obviously isn\u2019t a McCarthyite, and can\u2019t be held responsible for the hysteria \u2014 and hopeful expectations of an impeachment-level event \u2014 that has built up around his work. His indictment is, as far as anyone can tell, rigorously factual. That\u2019s probably the point of it \u2014 to create a record of an episode that we should want to know as much about as possible and prevent from ever happening again.\n\nThe Russia campaign was a shockingly cynical violation of our sovereignty. President Donald Trump would do himself and the country a favor by frankly denouncing it. But the scale of the operation shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated. In the context of a hugely expensive, obsessively covered, impossibly dramatic presidential election, the Russian contribution on social media was piddling and often laughable.\n\nThe Russians wanted to boost Trump, but as a Facebook executive noted, most of their spending on Facebook ads came after the election. The larger goal was to sow discord, yet we had already primed ourselves for plenty of that.\n\nThe Russia campaign was a shockingly cynical violation of our sovereignty.\n\nDoes anyone believe, absent Russian trolls on Twitter and Facebook, that we were headed to a placid election season involving an incendiary, mediagenic former reality-TV star bent on blowing up the political establishment and a longtime pol who had stoked the enmity of Republicans for 30 years and was under FBI investigation?\n\nIf you read the Mueller indictment, you might think the Russians were everywhere, not only advertising on Facebook (\u201cTrump is our only hope for a better future\u201d; \u201cOhio Wants Hillary 4 Prison\u201d) but organizing rallies around the country. But it\u2019s not clear these rallies even came off.\n\nThe New York Post couldn\u2019t find any evidence of planned pro-Trump and anti-Hillary rallies in New York \u2014 not exactly a swing state \u2014 in June and July of 2016. Pictures and videos that appear to be from Russian-initiated pro-Trump \u201cflash mobs\u201d in Florida show a handful of people in various cities. This at a time when Trump was routinely holding rallies with thousands of people that garnered lavish media coverage.\n\nThe biggest Russian rally success appears to have been an anti-Trump event in New York after the election; it drew 10,000 people. This hardly means that the #resistance was corrupted by Russian influence. Without Kremlin involvement, half a million women marched against Trump in Washington, D.C., and more than 3 million around the country.\n\nThe Russians didn\u2019t do anything to us that we weren\u2019t doing to ourselves, although we were doing it on a much larger, more potent scale. The Russians are just aping the arguments we are already having with one another, and the sewerish level of much of the discussion on social media.\n\nThe New York Times ran a report the other day on Russian bots, in the immediate aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, posting on Twitter about gun control. It\u2019s hard to believe that this is going to rip apart the American body politic when many perfectly respectable, red-blooded Americans themselves advocate for gun control, and often in the immediate aftermath of shootings.\n\nIn a better world, Trump would be less defensive about the Russian investigation, and his opposition would be less obsessively invested in it (at least until such time that it produces a genuine bombshell). We should seek to shut down Russian influence as much as possible, without losing perspective. We aren\u2019t divided because of Russia; we\u2019re divided because we have genuine, deeply held differences. The fault, to the extent there is one, isn\u2019t with the bots, but with ourselves.\n\n\u00a9 2018 by King Features   Lowry is the editor of National Review.

But contrary to how they were portrayed in the media, these were not two stories; they were one story.\n\nIllinois\u2019s third district runs from the southwest side of Chicago to the suburbs on the\u00a0western and southwestern sides of the city, extending into DuPage and Will counties. Lipinski more or less inherited the district from his father, Bill Lipinski, first elected to Congress in 1983. It\u2019s safe Democratic turf, safer than its D+6 rating by Charlie Cook would suggest; there hasn\u2019t been a Republican congressman in this neighborhood since 1975. According to David Nir at DailyKos Elections, the district went 58.3 to 40.4 for Barack Obama in 2008, 55.9 to 42.6 for Obama in 2012, and 55.2-39.9 for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Hillary carried 74.3 percent of the vote in Cook County, 53 percent in DuPage County and 49.95% in Will County; in the entire rest of the state, she carried only 8 out of 99 counties, 5 by a majority and none others with 60 percent of the vote. Mark Kirk also lost all three counties in 2016. Lipinski ran unopposed in 2016, and in a Republican wave years of 2014 and 2010 he won with\u00a064.6 percent and\u00a069.7 percent\u00a0of the vote; his 29-point margin of victory in 2014 was the\u00a0worst of his career. With Republicans scrambling to hold previously safe Republican turf in 2018, spending money and grassroots effort to take out Lipinski could hardly be a lower priority.\n\nBut the safety of his district is also why progressives wanted Lipinksi replaced. Among the dwindling number of Democrats who describe themselves as being pro-life, Lipinski is \u2014\u00a0as Alexandra DeSanctis has noted\u00a0\u2014 one of the few with a voting record of actually putting some deeds behind his words, and the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List poured six-figure money and scores of volunteers into the district in the hopes of preserving even a small foothold for the pro-life movement in the Democratic party, bragging that its canvassers had reached 23,000 people. Pro-choice activists did the same, with presidential hopefuls like Kirsten Gillibrand (herself a former \u201cBlue Dog\u201d now reinventing, or revealing, herself as a Berniecrat) denouncing Lipinski:\n\n\nMy friend @Marie4Congress is running in #IL03 against a Democratic incumbent named Dan Lipinski. He\u2019s anti-choice, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ \u2013 and Marie\u2019s primary is in exactly one week.\n\n\u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) March 13, 2018\n\n\nEnter Arthur Jones. A 70-year-old self-described \u201cwhite racialist\u201d and former leader of the American Nazi Party, he first ran for mayor of Milwaukee on the National Socialist White People\u2019s Party ticket in 1976, and has made five prior efforts to run for Congress. As The Atlantic\u2018s Elaine Godfrey\u00a0notes,\n\nWhen he ran in 1998, the Cook County Republican Central Committee\u00a0denounced\u00a0his candidacy, saying it would be a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d if he was nominated. That year, the GOP nominated Robert Marshall for the seat\u2014who once called drunk driving a \u201cgrossly overblown\u201d problem and began a League of Men Voters to advocate for fathers in custody battles. (Marshall lost.) Most recently, Jones filed to run in the 2016 Republican primary, but the Illinois State Election Board\u00a0threw out\u00a0his petition in response to a GOP challenge, citing invalid signatures.\n\nBut in 2016, Republicans couldn\u2019t recruit an opponent for Lipinski; kicking Jones off the ballot left him unopposed. Similar dynamics were at work this year, while Jones flew under the radar, going door-to-door to collect the required signatures. He touted his foreign-policy goal \u2014 \u201cending America\u2019s wars in the Middle East, which he says primarily serve the interests of Israel\u201d \u2014 which makes him sound more like a Democrat.\n\n\n\nIllinois Republicans have denounced Jones loudly in the most vigorous terms to anyone who would listen, but without an opponent, all they could do was tell people to boycott the unopposed primary:\n\n\nThe Illinois Republican Party has sought to distance itself from Mr. Jones in recent weeks, blanketing the district with campaign fliers and robocalls urging voters to \u201cstop Illinois Nazis,\u201d according to a robocall script provided by the party. Mr. Jones said he had received three robocalls himself.\n\n\u201cArthur Jones is not a real Republican \u2014 he is a Nazi whose disgusting, bigoted views have no place in our nation\u2019s discourse,\u201d Tim Schneider, the Illinois Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. He said the party had urged voters \u201cto skip over his name when they go to the polls\u201d and moving forward planned on \u201cvehemently opposing Jones with real campaign dollars.\u201d\n\n\nThis is where Lipinksi\u2019s primary comes into the picture. Because Illinois has an open primary system, so Republican voters could cross over into the contested race rather than pull the lever for the Nazi. And a pro-life Democrat with national pro-life groups campaigning for him and prominent national Democrats denouncing him is a candidate that more Republicans could in good conscience support.\u00a0As The Intercept\u2018s Ryan Grim reported:\n\nSophia Olazaba, a field manager for the Newman campaign, said she doesn\u2019t doubt that some Republican voters crossed over. \u201cEven when we were canvassing, a lot of homes have had both Jeanne Ives and Dan Lipinski signs, so those people could have crossed over,\u201d she said, referring to the GOP gubernatorial candidate whose entire campaign was premised on her opposition to legal abortion.\n\nAnother volunteer, Sabrina Ithal, also from the 3rd district, mentioned that the open primary format could have actually worked in their favor: \u201cI converted quite a few Republicans who voted Democrat for the first time in 30-40 years today.\u201d\n\nIf you wanted to advance Republican policy priorities in IL-03, you were better off backing Lipinski, an occasional ally on a few topics, than engaging in the pointless Republican primary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, over 90,000 votes were cast in the primary, more than 47,000 of them for Lipinski. Turnout on the unopposed GOP side was not even reported by many sources, although people did come out to vote because there was a contested GOP primary for Illinois Governor; Decision Desk\u2019s Brandon Finnigan reports that Jones got just 16,181 votes, likely many of them people just pulling the party lever without knowing more than the (R). This is a far cry from the 64,000 votes for Lipinski\u2019s opponent in 2014, and even recognizing the difference between county and district lines, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to the 48,000 votes cast in the Rauner-Ives race in DuPage County, 38,000 in Will County, and 130,000 in Cook County (Ives carried DuPage and Will, Rauner carried Cook).\n\n\nBy contrast, Democratic Congressman Danny Davis, under fire for his embrace of notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, got 77,858 votes, winning his primary in Illinois\u2019s seventh district by a 50,000 vote margin. That won\u2019t stop Democrats, who spent much of the last decade downplaying the importance of ties to extremists in Chicago politics, from dining out on the GOP\u2019s failure to keep Jones off the ballot.\u00a0 But the reality is that Jones is a blip in a district that Republicans won\u2019t contest, and Republican voters mostly ignored him or crossed over to back Lipinski.\n\nAnd maybe if Democrats want to marginalize and draw support away from extremists in the Republican fold, they could learn a thing or two from Dan   McLaughlin is an attorney practicing securities and commercial litigation in New York City, and a contributing columnist at National Review", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mairead Mcardle", "body": "National security adviser H.R.

Has Donald Trump selected a crazed warmonger to be his national-security adviser? Is Bolton going to lead us down the path to foolish war? Far from it.\n\nBolton is not \u2014 as some in the media would have you believe \u2014 a mere flame-throwing Fox News \u201ctalking head.\u201d He\u2019s a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He\u2019s on the board of trustees of the National Review Institute. He\u2019s a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He\u2019s a conservative hawk, yes, but he\u2019s squarely in the mainstream of conservative foreign-policy thought.\n\n\nHe\u2019s not extreme. The reaction against him, however, is. Moreover, the reaction betrays a sad reality: The foreign-policy Left still hasn\u2019t learned the lessons of the recent past.\n\nTo put it simply, all too many people view the challenge of North Korea and Iran something like this: There is a clearly safer path, including engagement, talks, and continued fidelity to the Iran deal; and there is a clearly more dangerous path \u2014 saber-rattling, increased sanctions, public advocacy for regime change. All right-thinking people should seek more engagement with North Korea. All right-thinking people should support the Iran deal.\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cclearly safer\u201d argument always has a short-term advantage. When choosing between less risk of war and greater risk of war, there is a proper default preference for less risk and a presumption in favor of making immediate moves toward peace. When dealing with jihadist regimes like Iran\u2019s or evil regimes like North Korea\u2019s, however, the problem is that every single path is perilous.\n\nMiscalculate in favor of war, and you risk an unnecessary bloodbath \u2014 one that America would win, but at immense cost in blood and treasure. Miscalculate in favor of peace, and you risk \u2014 God forbid \u2014 American cities in flames, a genocidal nuclear exchange in the Middle East, or (perhaps most likely) future military confrontations with aggressive and hostile foreign powers that we can\u2019t truly win because of their own nuclear shield. Remember the words of Krishnaswamy Sundarji, former chief of staff of the Indian army: \u201cOne principal lesson of the Gulf War is that, if a state intends to fight the United States, it should avoid doing so until and unless it possesses nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nWorld history is littered with both kinds of mistakes, and our recent histories with both Iran and North Korea indicate that bipartisan policies of engagement, negotiation, and forbearance have not, in fact, moderated either regime. Iran continues to export jihad, work to kill Americans, and ally with our Russian rival to engineer a bloodbath in Syria \u2014 even as the Iran \u201cdeal\u201d fails to deliver on Obama\u2019s dream of somehow bringing Iran into the community of nations. North Korea is well on its way to developing a nuclear first-strike capability that threatens the mainland United States.\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the American intelligentsia lives in a world where the \u201chawks\u201d \u2014 those who supported the Iraq War \u2014 are discredited, while the \u201cdoves\u201d \u2014 those who presided over American foreign policy while Syria burned, ISIS rose, and North Korea tested its nuclear weapons \u2014 are not. Yet didn\u2019t Barack Obama himself have to turn hawkish by the end of his second term? Didn\u2019t he reinsert American ground troops in Iraq and put boots on the ground in Syria? Didn\u2019t he keep American troops in Afghanistan during every single day of his presidency and expand the American military footprint in Africa? It turns out that American inaction helped destabilize the Middle East and dramatically elevated the jihadist threat.\n\nMoreover, we should not exaggerate John Bolton\u2019s aggression. To be a hawk isn\u2019t to see war as a first resort. It\u2019s to see war as a realistic option \u2014 an option that ideally makes diplomatic overtures more urgent and effective. As the most powerful nation on the face of the earth, we should not conduct our diplomacy as if we fear war more than our potential foes do.\n\nEven one of the pieces that the New York Times cites to justify its alarm \u2014 Bolton\u2019s 2017 Wall Street Journal article analyzing military options in North Korea \u2014 contains this key sentence: \u201cThe U.S. should obviously seek South Korea\u2019s agreement (and Japan\u2019s) before using force, but no foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nA quarter-century of American nonproliferation policy has failed.\n\nThis is a sensible statement, indicating both the desire for agreement with key allies and the necessity of national self-defense, and the Times fails to effectively grapple with the truth underlying Bolton\u2019s essay \u2014 a quarter-century of American nonproliferation policy has failed.\n\n\nI\u2019m not arguing for a strike against North Korea. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly, war with North Korea would risk loss of life on a staggering scale. And even if future developments force Bolton to urge a strike \u2014 and the president agrees \u2014 it\u2019s imperative that the administration seek the approval of Congress before launching any new military action. It is, however, simply wrong to believe that engagement and appeasement don\u2019t carry their own profound risks.\n\nA nuclear-armed Iran is far more dangerous than John Bolton. A North Korea capable of incinerating American cities is far more dangerous than John Bolton. The question is how we prevent those truly \u201chorrifying\u201d risks. The foreign-policy debate is frequently between hawks and doves, and in the last administration, the doves repeatedly failed.

If so, the GOP has an odd way of showing affection. Green cites a lack of Republican criticism of Trump, the president\u2019s continued popularity within the party, and Trump\u2019s rescue of incumbent Nevada senator Dean Heller from a primary challenge. All true. But when it comes to the president\u2019s priorities and the nationalist-populist style of politics he represents, Trump and the Republican Congress could not be farther apart.\n\nTrump won the nomination and the presidency after distinguishing himself from the party in four ways. Since Ronald Reagan, Republicans have tended to support global economic integration, immigration, democratic internationalism, and entitlement reform. And yet Trump opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, called to renegotiate NAFTA, and wanted tariffs on China. His 2015 immigration plan championed a wall across the southern border, workplace enforcement, an end to birthright citizenship, and a tripling of border and customs agents. He repudiated the Iraq war and questioned the future of NATO. He swore that Social Security and Medicare would be off-limits. His brashness, colorfulness, insults, willingness to transgress norms, humor, novelty, and lack of political experience separated him from the GOP pack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program and its avatar won three Great Lakes states that had been missing from the Republican column for a generation. Trump also came within striking distance in Minnesota and New Hampshire. Obviously, we do not know the exact relation between Trump\u2019s nationalism and populism and the roughly 78,000 votes in three states that gave him an Electoral College victory. But the unexpected shape of his upset suggests that the trademark Trump issues of immigration, trade, nonintervention, and retirement security played some role both in attracting support for him and depressing turnout for Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet the 16 months since the election have seen the gradual, fitful, and partial regularization of Trump into the GOP that predated and opposed him. Until recently, the president and congressional leadership were aligned: They seated a justice and lower-court judges, rolled back Obama-era regulations, failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, and passed a large tax cut. Trump\u2019s foreign policy also became more conventionally Republican. He bombed Syria, turned down his criticism of NATO, maintained a troop presence in Afghanistan despite his instincts to withdraw, and increased defense spending. The signature Trump policies \u2014 including the travel ban, exit from the TPP and the Paris Climate Accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 were greeted with friendly skepticism from party elites. By the end of 2017, one would have thought the party would change Trump more than he would change it.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened. Instead, both Trump and the GOP seem to be reverting to form: Trump has pressed for changes to legal immigration, visited prototypes for the border wall, called for the death penalty for opioid dealers, and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as against China, amid anxiety and dissent and resistance from congressmen of his own party. Trump\u2019s instincts and impulsiveness have driven him to re-embrace the portfolio that delivered his electoral coalition at the very moment Republicans in Congress want nothing so much as to return to their districts, publicize the tax cut, and vainly attempt to divorce their campaigns from national politics. And so we are faced with the oddity that Trump\u2019s approval rating is creeping upward even as Democrats press their midterm advantage.\n\n\n\n\nTrump and the Republicans operate according to different hierarchies of values. To the degree that his behavior can be categorized by a single idea, Trump\u2019s most singular policies address the question of sovereignty: Who rules? Here, in America, the people rule, or are supposed to. Trump\u2019s rhetoric defines the people as American citizens, regardless of racial or ethnic identity. The domestic objective of his presidency is to reassert popular control over judges, bureaucracies, and elected officials. The extent of sovereignty must be defined, which is why we have borders and require a wall to protect a porous one. And national sovereignty is important, too. That is why America must reestablish its privileges and ability to maneuver vis-\u00e0-vis multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, international agreements, and the World Trade Organization.\n\nIf I had to choose a guiding principle of congressional Republicans, it would be freedom. The freedom of the individual to live the life he chooses, the freedom of people and goods and services to move across borders, the freedom to work, spend, and invest as one sees fit, the freedom of people around the world to govern themselves.\n\nNow, sovereignty and freedom are not necessarily in conflict. They overlap, and they can move in tandem. They often have done so in American history. But one must also balance the other. A sovereign without regard for freedom would be unjust, and increasing social and economic freedom can lead to the loss of sovereignty. The thrust of populist politics since 2016 indicates that voters believe that the mix of sovereignty and freedom is out of whack, that national and democratic sovereignty must be upheld even if it means tighter regulation of the global economy and especially of global migration.\n\nA sovereign without regard for freedom would be unjust, and increasing social and economic freedom can lead to the loss of sovereignty.\n\nAt its most politically successful, the party of Trump pits miners, hard hats, farmers, soldiers, veterans, and public-safety officers against CEOs, bankers, lawyers, doctors, bureaucrats, professors, and educators. Yet none of Trump\u2019s personal or policy decisions occasioned as much intra-party pushback, including a high-profile resignation, as the imposition of tariffs. Not only do Republicans seem largely ignorant of the fact that Donald Trump\u2019s political instincts are better than their own, they also refuse to learn.\n\nThis divergence between Trump and the Republicans is apparent in the $1.3 trillion government-funding bill. If there is one thing every American knows about Donald Trump, it is that he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Yet Republican congressmen, most of whom adhere to pre-Trump views of immigration, secured only $1.6 billion for the project. Democrats are crowing. \u201cDemocrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law,\u201d Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cThe bill does not allow any increase in deportation officers or detention beds.\u201d Part of the responsibility for this setback goes to Trump, who seems to have been disengaged from the negotiations until the last minute. But the main reason the money isn\u2019t there is the fact that congressional leadership had neither the desire nor the stomach to fight for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething similar has happened with trade. Whatever the economic consequences of Trump\u2019s protectionism \u2014 and they could be bad \u2014 it cannot be denied that this is the issue on which he has been most consistent over 30 years in the public eye. Nor can the political appeal of siding with domestic manufacturers over multinational corporations be ignored by anyone who has seen Democrats rhetorically position themselves on the side of the American worker since 1992. By dividing trades and construction-union membership against leadership in 2016, Trump called forth the Reagan Democrats who had vanished from the scene, and convinced millions of white working-class voters to defect from the Obama coalition.\n\n\nThey can just as easily switch back, of course. When I visited the websites of the two candidates in the recent Pennsylvania special election, I was struck that it was the Democrat, rather than the Republican, who highlighted infrastructure, opioids, and protecting entitlements, three topics of keen interest to Trump voters. By neutralizing the hot-button cultural issues of guns and abortion, and highlighting Rick Saccone\u2019s support for right-to-work and other pro-business measures, Conor Lamb reappropriated the economic program that Donald Trump used to win PA-18 by 20 points. He won\u2019t be the last Democrat to do so.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Washington Free Beacon.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Doran", "body": "Hillary Clinton at a \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d rally in Concord, N.H., February 6, 2016.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Brian  a textbook example of denial and projection, Trump foes in and out of government wove a sinister yarn meant to take him down.\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBarack Obama keeps a close watch on his emotions. \u201cI loved Spock,\u201d he wrote in February 2015 in a presidential statement eulogizing Leonard Nimoy. Growing up in Hawaii, the young man who would later be called \u201cNo-Drama Obama\u201d felt a special affinity for the Vulcan first officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise. \u201cLong before being nerdy was cool, there was Leonard Nimoy,\u201d the eulogy continued. \u201cLeonard was Spock. Cool, logical, big-eared and level-headed.\u201d\n\nIt is the rare occasion when Obama lets his Spock mask slip. But November 2, 2016, was just such a moment. Six days before the presidential election, when addressing the Congressional Black Caucus, he stressed that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, threatened hard-won achievements of blacks: tolerance, justice, good schools, ending mass incarceration \u2014 even democracy itself. \u201cThere is one candidate who will advance those things,\u201d he said, his voice swelling with emotion. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of his candidacy, is opposition to all that we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe open display of emotion was new, but the theme of safeguarding his legacy was not. Two months earlier, on July 5, in Charlotte, N.C., Obama delivered his first stump speech for Hillary Clinton. He described his presidency as a leg in a relay race. Hillary Clinton had tried hard to pass affordable health care during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, but she failed \u2014 and the relay baton fell to the ground. When Obama entered the White House, he picked it up. Now, his leg of the race was coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019m ready to pass the baton,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know that Hillary Clinton is going to take it.\u201d\n\nBut he was less certain than he was letting on. Hillary Clinton was up in the polls, to be sure, but she was vulnerable. Three weeks earlier, on June 15, a cyberattacker fashioning himself as Guccifer 2.0 had published a cache of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). They proved, as supporters of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders had long alleged, that the DNC had conspired with the Clinton campaign to undermine their candidate. Sanders was still withholding his endorsement of Clinton for president, even though her nomination as the Democratic candidate was now a foregone conclusion. At the very moment when Clinton had expected the Democratic party to unite behind her, its deepest chasm seemed to be growing wider. In contrast to Clinton, Obama held some sway over the Sanders insurgents. He came to Charlotte to urge them to support Clinton against their shared enemy, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.\n\nThe insurgency was not the only Clinton vulnerability on Obama\u2019s mind. He had come to Charlotte, in addition, to deflect attention from the news conference that James Comey, the director of the FBI, had held that morning in Washington, D.C. The investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server was complete, Comey announced. The FBI would recommend no criminal charges \u2014 that was the honey. But Comey administered it with a dose of vinegar. He dwelled on Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified material in such detail that it sounded as if he was laying the foundation for an indictment. The decision not to charge Clinton, his statement signaled, was an exercise in prosecutorial restraint, not a true exoneration.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of the voters, Clinton\u2019s twin email travails \u2014 the hack of the DNC and the investigation into her server \u2014 were two faces of a single problem. Call it \u201cClinton, Inc.\u201d Sanders and Trump were painting Clinton as Wall Street\u2019s darling, the establishment candidate. She was the greatest defender and a prime beneficiary of a rigged political and financial system. Comey\u2019s statement had played directly into the hands of the Sanders insurgents. It left the distinct impression that laws are for the little people; they simply don\u2019t apply to Hillary Clinton, because, well, she\u2019s Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhich points to Obama\u2019s third and final job at Charlotte: humanizing the queen. \u201cI saw how she treated everybody with respect, even the folks who aren\u2019t, quote/unquote, \u2018important,\u2019\u201d Obama testified. He enlarged Clinton\u2019s humility before the crowd, because it was invisible to the naked eye. With his jacket and tie off, the cuffs of his sleeves turned, and a winning smile spread from ear to ear, Obama came to loan Hillary Clinton his common touch.\n\nPassing the baton to her was a team effort, however. It demanded hard work from countless enablers. These included not just Democrats but also many Republicans, who shared the conviction that Trump represented an extraordinary threat to our democracy. Desperate times call for desperate measures. To block Trump, Clinton\u2019s supporters bent rules and broke laws. They went to surprising lengths to strengthen her while framing him \u2014 both in the sense of depicting him in a particular light and of planting evidence against him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoe Friday \n\nWhen it comes to ongoing FBI criminal investigations, presidents typically refrain from describing their preferred outcomes. They fear the appearance of exerting undue influence over Lady Justice. But in the case of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email abuses, Obama made an exception. \u201cShe would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy,\u201d he remarked in a TV interview in April 2016. She has displayed \u201ca carelessness in terms of managing emails,\u201d he allowed. \u201cBut I also think it is important to keep this in  but careless, said the commander in chief, describing Hillary\u2019s use of a private email server. Three months later, Comey, in a Vulcan mind-meld with his boss, arrived at an identical conclusion.\n\nWell-intentioned but careless, said the commander in chief. Three months later, the FBI finished its investigation, and James Comey arrived at an identical conclusion. \u201cAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information,\u201d he said in his July 5 statement, \u201cthere is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d Well-intentioned but careless \u2014 Comey was locked in a Vulcan mind-meld with his boss.\n\nAs a political move, highlighting Clinton\u2019s intentions was astute. It had a commonsense feel. Americans instinctively take intentions into account when determining guilt. As a strict matter of law, however, it was vapid. The mishandling of classified information falls into the category of a \u201cnon-intent crime.\u201d It\u2019s a type of objective recklessness, like running over a pedestrian while blowing through a red light. Violations of this sort trigger criminal liabilities regardless of the offender\u2019s state of mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut let\u2019s assume that some clever lawyer in the Department of Justice discovered a very learned and superficially compelling rationale for applying Obama\u2019s fictive standard of intent. Even so, Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t clear the hurdle. The sheer volume of classified material the FBI recovered from her server constituted proof of intent. \u201cFifty-two email chains . . . contain classified information,\u201d Comey said.\n\nParticularly damning was the form this material took. It is impossible to paste a classified document into an unclassified email accidentally, because the three computer systems (Unclassified, Confidential/Secret, and Top Secret) are physically separate networks, each feeding into an independent hard drive on the user\u2019s desk. If a classified document appears in an unclassified email, then someone downloaded it onto a thumb drive and manually uploaded it to the unclassified network \u2014 an intentional act if ever there was one.\n\nOne of Clinton\u2019s emails suggests that downloading and uploading material in this fashion was a commonplace activity in her office. In June 2011, a staffer encountered difficulty transmitting a document to her by means of a classified system. An impatient Clinton instructed him to strip the classified markings from the document and send it on as an unclassified email. \u201cTurn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure,\u201d Clinton instructed.\n\nOn three separate occasions staffers got sloppy and failed to strip the \u201cnonpapers\u201d of all markings that betrayed their classified origins. The FBI recovered one email, for example, that contained a \u201cC\u201d in parenthesis in the margin \u2014 an obvious sign that the corresponding paragraph was classified \u201cConfidential.\u201d When an agent personally interviewed Clinton, on July 2, he showed her the document and asked whether she understood what the \u201cC\u201d meant. For anyone who has ever held a security clearance, \u201cC\u2019s\u201d in the margins are more ubiquitous than \u201cC\u2019s\u201d on water faucets \u2014 and no more baffling. But Clinton played the ditzy grandmother. She had simply assumed, she said, that the \u201cC\u201d was marking an item in an alphabetized list.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2,500-year life of the alphabet, this was a first: a list that started with the third letter and contained but a single item. The explanation was laughable, but any sensible answer would have constituted an acknowledgement of malicious intent. Her only out was the \u201cwell-intentioned but careless\u201d script that Obama had written for her. In other words, she lied to the FBI \u2014 a felony offense.\n\nBefore she ever told this howler, however, Comey had already prepared a draft of his statement exonerating her. The FBI let Hillary Clinton skate.\n\nIf Comey had followed the letter of the law, the trail of guilt may have led all the way to Obama himself.\n\nBut give Comey his due. If he had followed the letter of the law, the trail of guilt may have led all the way to Obama himself. As Andrew C. McCarthy has demonstrated at National Review Online, Obama used a dummy email account to communicate with Clinton via her private server. Did this make Obama complicit in Clinton\u2019s malfeasance? Anyone in Comey\u2019s position would have thought twice before moving to prosecute her \u2014 and not only because the case might have ensnared the president himself. The FBI must enforce the law, but it must also be seen to be enforcing it. As a rule, these two imperatives buttress each other. During the 2016 election, Comey faced extraordinary circumstances. If he had followed the law to the letter, he would have toppled the leading candidate for president and decapitated the Democratic party. Clinton\u2019s supporters, more than 50 percent of the electorate, would have erupted in outrage, screaming that a politicized FBI had thrown the election to Donald Trump.\n\nGuarding the bureau\u2019s reputation for impartiality is a serious concern. But it is nevertheless a thoroughly political concern. Comey would have us believe that it was a unique moment in his career, the singular entry into the political arena of an otherwise apolitical servant of the law. Truth be told, Comey loves being in the thick of it, but not because he is a partisan brawler. He is not. It is the drama that he relishes \u2014 the grand stage. His favorite role is that of Joe Friday, the no-nonsense lawman, the guardian of legal processes before the encroachments of dirty politicians.\n\n\n\n\nJoe Friday, however, was a simple detective, a confirmed bachelor, content to live quietly with his mother and his parakeet. And, of course, he was a TV fiction. In real life, humble straight shooters get clobbered with a brick before they ever reach the limelight. In real life, snagging the big part often requires the equivalent of leaving a bloody horsehead in the producer\u2019s bed.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMcCabe and the Lovers \n\nAnd it requires a supportive staff. Midyear Exam, the codename for the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, relied on a team of men and women with the right stuff \u2014 a quality that is hard to define but easy to recognize.\n\nThe right stuff did not require strong Democratic credentials, but they certainly helped. Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI, led the team. McCabe was not your FBI gumshoe of old. He spent no time in his younger days chasing bank robbers in Des Moines. He was part of a new breed \u2014 the post-9/11 FBI leadership, for whom the career fast track was counterterrorism. He came of age at the intersection of law enforcement with national security, shuttling between D.C. and New York. Along the way, he developed a valuable personal network. His wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a Virginia state-senate seat in 2015. The political organization of Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s very closest associates, gave her nearly $500,000.\n\nPerhaps more important than having Democratic credentials was having a heightened understanding of the needs of senior leadership \u2014 in the FBI, certainly, but also in the DOJ. Right across the street from the J. Edgar Hoover Building sat Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She would be scrutinizing Midyear Exam in every detail. And not just Lynch. Hillary Clinton herself would be watching closely \u2014 and would be brought in for questioning, too. Being willing and able to treat her with kid gloves was essential. She \u201cmight be our next president,\u201d team member Lisa Page reminded Peter Strzok, the agent in charge of Midyear Exam. Referring to Clinton\u2019s upcoming FBI interview, Page wrote, \u201cThe last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLike McCabe, Strzok had pursued a career at the nexus of law enforcement and counterterrorism. But he was less overtly political. A John Kasich sympathizer, he was by nature a middle-of-the-roader, and a Republican-leaning one, at that. Clinton left him cold. But Trump left him even colder \u2014 and his active personal life helped concentrate his mind on that antipathy. Strzok was having an affair with Page, who was an FBI lawyer on McCabe\u2019s staff. Both were married. Page\u2019s politics were typical of highly educated people in D.C.: She detested Trump and his supporters. He is \u201ca loathsome human being,\u201d she texted to Strzok, who readily agreed. After Trump captured the nomination, hostility to him quickly became part of their private idiom.\n\nIf \u201cthe ultimate aphrodisiac,\u201d as Henry Kissinger famously claimed, is power, then wielding it together with an illicit lover must be the pinnacle of eroticism. Together, Strzok and Page explored the power of secrets, routinely leaking to the press to shape political outcomes. \u201cStill on the phone with Devlin,\u201d Page texted to Strzok, referring to former Wall Street Journal national-security reporter Devlin Barrett. Big news about the Hillary Clinton email story was breaking when Devlin and Page were on the phone together. \u201cYou might wanna tell Devlin he should turn on CNN, there\u2019s news on,\u201d Strzok texted back.\n\nPage: He knows. He just got handed a note.\n\nStrzok: Ha. He asking about it now?\n\nPage: Yeah. It was pretty funny.\n\nInfluencing the nation\u2019s politics was routine. And ridiculously easy: one quick call to \u201cDevlin,\u201d and boom! The world changed.\n\nMcCabe and the two lovers demonstrated the very essence of the right stuff: a breezy comfort with bending the law to the demands of politics.\n\nDeploying secrets for political effect \u2014 deciding which to keep, which to tell, and how to tell them \u2014 was a task that they approached with alacrity. The ultimate goal, of course, was not propping up Hillary Clinton so much as maximizing the power and autonomy of the FBI. In pursuing this goal, McCabe and the two lovers demonstrated the very essence of the right stuff: a breezy comfort with bending the law to the demands of politics.\n\nThey honed their skills on Midyear Exam. As that test ended, an even bigger one loomed before them. At the end of July, Comey and McCabe would officially open an investigation into Russian meddling in the election, including possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. On July 5, the day of Comey\u2019s press conference on Clinton\u2019s emails, a former British spy, Christopher Steele, flew to Rome to meet an old FBI contact. The information he brought had weighty implications for the impending investigation. But neither the information nor the implications are what we have been led to believe.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Super Spy \n\nSteele \u2014 a former British spy and a Russia expert \u2014 was working on contract to Fusion GPS, a Washington-based public-relations firm, which, in turn, was on contract to a D.C. law firm, which, in turn, was on contract to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC. Steele, that is to say, was working for Hillary Clinton. His job, among other things, was to collect opposition research on Trump from his network of Russian sources.\n\nWhen Steele arrived in Rome, his famous \u201cdossier\u201d did not exist. The dossier, as we have come to know it, is some 17 reports that he compiled between June and December 2016. In early July, Steele had been working on the Clinton account for only a few weeks and had written but one report, dated June 20. It claimed that Trump was Vladimir Putin\u2019s Manchurian candidate. \u201c[The] Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting, and assisting Trump for at least 5 years,\u201d Steele reported. Putin\u2019s goal was \u201cto sow discord and disunity both within the US itself, but more especially within the Transatlantic alliance.\u201d The Russian leader supported Trump, mainly, by supplying \u201cvaluable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nPutin had offered lucrative financial contracts, but Trump had turned them down. The wily Russian, however, had managed to get his hooks into Trump due to the American\u2019s \u201csexual perversion.\u201d During a visit to Moscow in 2013, Trump had hired prostitutes to stay with him in the same hotel suite used by the Obamas on one of their trips. The FSB, Russia\u2019s secret police, had fitted the room with cameras and recording equipment. Trump had the prostitutes defile Obama\u2019s bed by putting on a \u201cgolden shower\u201d performance for him. All of it was caught on tape.\n\nEarthshaking news: Vladimir Putin was blackmailing Donald J. Trump. No doubt, Steele\u2019s FBI handler rushed this report to his superiors in Washington, D.C. They, in turn, raced it straight to Obama\u2019s desk. Sorry, wrong. According to the New York Times, Steele\u2019s explosive revelations wound their way to the J. Edgar Hoover Building only slowly. It took weeks before they appeared in Strzok\u2019s in-box. Why?\n\nMike Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA, helps explain the delay. Morell did some digging into Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier and shared the results of his research at a public forum in Washington, D.C., in March 2017. Steele, according to Morell, did not have direct access to the Russians whom he labeled as his \u201csources\u201d \u2014 people who included former officers in the FSB. He \u201ccommunicated\u201d with them, if that is the right word, through paid intermediaries, who paid the so-called sources.\n\nThe chances of Steele having been played were thus great. Morell explained it like this:\n\nIf you\u2019re paying somebody, particularly former FSB officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they\u2019re going to call you up and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s have another meeting, I have more information for you,\u201d because they want to get paid some more.\n\nThis process, Morell said, \u201ctakes you nowhere.\u201d\n\nSteele\u2019s report was, in a word, junk. And Morell, the man who expressed that opinion, was not just a seasoned intelligence professional; he was also a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton for president. Nor did Steele\u2019s FBI handler in Rome set off an alarm in Washington, because he, presumably, was also a seasoned professional who knew junk when he saw it. And he had many additional reasons to doubt the veracity of Steele\u2019s reporting \u2014 reasons that Morell refrained from broaching. How, for example, could Steele be sure that the former FSB officers in his network were fully retired? The convoluted pipeline between Moscow and London gave Russian intelligence too many opportunities to inject disinformation into the flow of reports to London.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not neglect the glaring issue of plausibility. When in the history of the rivalry between the West and Russia has it been possible for a British spy to call up sources in Moscow and gain immediate access to the deepest secrets of the Kremlin? Steele, relying only on his wits, unearthed gems the likes of which glittered only in the dreams of the CIA, Mossad, and MI6, the greatest intelligence-gathering organizations on earth. To believe that tale, we must assume that Steele, like James Bond, is no ordinary secret agent. He\u2019s a super spy.\n\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the little matter of Steele\u2019s personal bias. According to one well-informed associate, Steele was \u201cpassionate about\u201d preventing Trump from winning the election. His financial incentives, of course, oriented him in exactly the same direction. He was a paid piper \u2014 and he got paid only for collecting information detrimental to Trump. Isn\u2019t it possible \u2014 likely, even \u2014 that his shadowy paymasters in the demimonde of the Clinton campaign were calling the tune?\n\nSteele\u2019s reports certainly harmonized beautifully with the campaign\u2019s propaganda. On June 2, in a speech in San Diego, Hillary Clinton unveiled her main line of attack on Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy. His ideas, she said, were \u201cdangerously incoherent.\u201d In fact, they weren\u2019t \u201ceven really ideas \u2014 just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.\u201d Particularly mystifying was his attitude toward the Russian dictator: \u201cHe said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he\u2019d give him an A. . . . I\u2019ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.\u201d\n\nBut the demimonde wasn\u2019t about to leave it to mental-health professionals. It hired instead a British super spy. He immediately explained that Putin was extorting Trump. Two weeks after that, he flew to Rome to share his explanation with the FBI. By the time he left Rome, his handler might not have guessed that the Clinton campaign was funding the spy\u2019s work. The political nature of Steele\u2019s mission, however, would have been obvious.\n\nIn Rome on July 5, the FBI was beginning to acquire a new secret. But it was not the one contained in Steele\u2019s report. The Clinton campaign, the FBI would soon learn with certainty, was intent on framing Trump as Putin\u2019s puppet. That secret was truly explosive \u2014 and perhaps thrilling for the two lovers on McCabe\u2019s staff. In time, all of them \u2014Strzok, Page, McCabe, and Comey \u2014 would all mishandle it, damaging their careers irreparably. In July, however, they were not yet in a rush to ruination. The team with the right stuff cautiously watched and waited. Not until September would they take their fateful missteps.\n\nHillary Clinton greets supporters at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pa., July 28, 2016.\nThe Birth of the Collusion Thesis\n\nOn July 22, WikiLeaks released the largest cache of DNC emails. The plan behind the hack now became clear: to sabotage the Democratic National Convention, which opened in Philadelphia on July 25. While Clinton was organizing a celebration of Democratic unity, Guccifer 2.0 was working to flood the convention floor with enraged Bernie Sanders insurgents. In the event, Clinton managed to prevent the protests from ruining the convention. But they did damage her theater of power \u2014 and they also handed Trump a fresh opportunity to broadcast his \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d theme. He took obvious delight in the rage of the Sanders followers. \u201cAn analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates,\u201d Trump tweeted on the eve of the convention.\n\nThe statement hit Clinton like an iron bar to her kneecap. The thought that a malevolent foreign actor was helping Trump deliver the blow only increased the pain. Most observers assumed that Russian state-backed hackers stood behind Guccifer 2.0 (an assumption that has grown stronger with time). If Trump felt sheepish about benefiting from such people, he hid it well. \u201cI will tell you this, Russia. If you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said on July 27, referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s messages that the FBI never recovered during its investigation of her private server.\n\nIn the eyes of his supporters, Trump\u2019s appeal to Putin was a stage whisper, a mock gesture \u2014 and a pointed dig at Clinton. In her rush to hide emails from the FBI, Trump implied, she had delivered them up to Putin on a platter. But his brand of humor was lost on Clinton and her team. To them, the appeal to Putin was sinister. \u201cI just think that\u2019s beyond the pale,\u201d said Clinton loyalist and former CIA director Leon Panetta. To shame Trump before the voters, the campaign shifted its rhetoric perceptibly. In June, Clinton had depicted Trump\u2019s attitude toward Putin as irrational. Now the two were said to be in a partnership \u2014 a \u201cbromance\u201d was how John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, described it. \u201cThis has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,\u201d said senior Clinton policy aide Jake Sullivan. \u201cThis has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national-security issue.\u201d\n\nShaming was all well and good, but it only resonated among committed voters. Winning the election required convincing independents that Trump was more than just a passive beneficiary of the DNC hack; he had to be an accomplice. Clinton\u2019s campaign thus posted five questions on its website:\n\n1. What\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s fascination with Vladimir Putin?\n\n2. Why does Trump surround himself with advisers with links to the Kremlin?\n\n3. Why do Trump\u2019s foreign policy ideas read like a Putin wish list?\n\n4. Do Trump\u2019s still-secret tax returns show ties to Russian oligarchs?\n\n5. Why is Trump encouraging Russia to interfere in our election?\n\nEach question was followed by a short answer, leading to the inevitable conclusion that Trump was actively conspiring with Putin.\n\n\n\n\nAnd so, the collusion thesis was born. The website did not spell out the details of the conspiracy, but the campaign\u2019s demimonde left nothing to the imagination. Christopher Steele had discovered Russian \u201csources\u201d who painted a vivid picture of the plot. Putin had decided against releasing the compromising videos of Trump. The Manchurian candidate was proving just too beneficial to Russia. In fact, a full-blown alliance had formed between Putin and Trump. Based on their \u201cmutual interest in defeating . . . Hillary Clinton,\u201d they struck a grand bargain: Putin would help elect Trump, who would deliver a supine American policy on Ukraine and NATO defense.\n\nThe super spy\u2019s network was remarkable. His Russian sources were as close to Trump as they were to Putin. \u201cAn ethnic Russian close associate\u201d of Trump\u2019s \u201cadmitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy\u201d between him and the Russians. Another source revealed more: The DNC hack was carried out \u201cwith the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of his campaign team.\u201d There it was: the proof the Clinton campaign needed. The great crime against Hillary Clinton was a joint Russian-American operation, and Trump was in on it from the beginning.\n\nSteele\u2019s startling discoveries hardly stopped there. But before revealing more, let\u2019s pause and consider the purpose of his reports. How, precisely, did his direct employer, Fusion GPS, use them?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Super Duo\n\nTo hear Glenn Simpson tell it, his company, Fusion GPS, is a research organization. \u201cWhat we do is provide people with factual information,\u201d he told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August 2017. \u201cOur specialty is public record information.\u201d In truth, Simpson\u2019s true specialty is not research but persuasion \u2014 more specifically, persuasion of reporters. He has a talent for convincing journalists to publish stories, true or not, that benefit his clients. In short, he is a public-relations flack.\n\nBut Simpson is no ordinary PR man; he\u2019s a super flack. In the first decade of this century, he was in his early forties and working as an investigative journalist for the Wall Street Journal. He was reaching the pinnacle of his profession just as the Internet was gutting the print media. Simpson, however, had a marketable talent. \u201cI call it journalism for rent,\u201d he said at a public forum in August 2017. Journalism as we once knew might be dead, but deep-pocketed clients still needed to get stories into the press. And they needed to block other stories from being published. Simpson knew almost every member of the Washington press corps personally, and he understood the constraints under which they worked \u2014 what it took to get a story past an editor. He handed them canned articles. They got scoops; he got happy clients.\n\nWhen pitching stories on Trump-Putin collusion, Simpson eventually discovered the great benefit of placing Christopher Steele directly in front of reporters. In September and October, he would fly the spy from London to the United States so the two of them could brief major media outlets as a team. Before that, in July and August, Simpson did not have the benefit of Steele\u2019s physical presence. But neither was he alone. He still had the super spy\u2019s reports \u2014 James Bond in a briefcase.\n\nCon men stoke the greed of their marks by letting them catch glimpses of suitcases bulging with cash. Simpson gave his marks a sense that he was similarly loaded \u2014 but with valuable information, not money. \u201cIn September 2016, Steele and I met in Washington and discussed the information now known as the \u2018dossier,\u2019\u00a0\u201d wrote Jonathan Winer, in the Washington Post. A former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, Winer admitted passing Steele\u2019s information to his superiors. \u201cI was allowed to review, but not to keep, a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department,\u201d he explained. Simpson, we infer, would let journalists catch a glimpse of the super spy\u2019s \u201craw intelligence.\u201d Then he would quickly take the document back \u2014 because, you understand, it was just too sensitive to leave lying around.\n\nIf journalists feared that Steele\u2019s startling reports (such as, for example, the one about the golden shower) contained Russian disinformation, Simpson had a well-rehearsed spiel at the ready to reassure them. He inadvertently shared it before the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. Steele, Simpson explained, had a \u201cstandard presentation\u201d for journalists to explain how he avoided falling prey to the diabolical Russians. Sliding into the first person, he rattled off Steele\u2019s lines:\n\nI was the lead Russianist at Ml6 in the final years of my career. And I was previously stationed in Moscow. And I speak Russian. And I\u2019ve done Russian  issues all my life. And the central problem when you\u2019re a Russian intelligence expert is disinformation, and that the Russians have . . . a long history and an advanced capability in disinformation. And so . . . before we go any further, I just want you to know that . . . this is . . . the fundamental problem with my profession. And it should be assumed that in any sort of intelligence gathering . . . there will be some disinformation. And I\u2019m trained to spot that and filter it out, but . . . you should understand that . . . no one\u2019s perfect.\n\nSimpson staked the credibility of the dossier on just one thing: Steele\u2019s super awesomeness.\n\nSimpson then switched to the first-person plural. Perhaps, when briefing journalists, this was the point at which he would speak, in his own voice, as the leader of the talented and experienced team at Fusion GPS:\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve essentially filtered out everything that we think is disinformation, and we\u2019re not going to present that to you here. We\u2019re going to present to you things that we think come from credible sources, but we\u2019re not going to warrant [sic] to you . . . that this is all true.\n\nSimpson staked the credibility of the dossier on just one thing: Steele\u2019s super awesomeness. On his own, Simpson would have been flacking salacious rumor, but paired with Steele, he was briefing \u201ccredible intelligence.\u201d Together, they became a super duo.\n\nThe purpose of the dossier would change over time. In July and August, the goal was not to get Steele\u2019s reports directly into the press. Nobody knew better than Simpson, a highly experienced reporter, that Steele\u2019s claims were unverifiable and, therefore, unprintable. The best he could achieve was an article that reinforced the main suppositions of the collusion thesis \u2014 \u00a0an article such as \u201cTrump and Putin: A Love Story,\u201d which David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, wrote and published in early August. \u201cPutin,\u201d sees in Trump a grand opportunity,\u201d Remnick explained. \u201cHe sees in Trump weakness and ignorance, a confused mind. He has every hope of exploiting him.\u201d\n\nRemnick stopped just short of claiming that Putin was actually blackmailing Trump, but his depiction of their relations matched, in general, the story that emerged from Steele\u2019s reports. Remnick took pains, for example, to instruct readers:\n\nThe gathering of kompromat \u2014 compromising material \u2014 is a familiar tactic in Putin\u2019s arsenal. For years, the Russian intelligence services have filmed political enemies in stages of sexual and/or narcotic indulgence, and have distributed the grainy images online.\n\nDid Remnick personally rely on a Fusion GPS briefing? We do not know. Jane Mayer, a staff writer for the New Yorker, recently confessed that she received a briefing, in September, directly from super spy himself \u2014 so the potential for communication certainly existed. Regardless of what inspired Remnick, his approach represented a win for Simpson. If, with the help of the dossier or any other tool of persuasion, he could convince journalists that Putin was blackmailing Trump with compromising videos, then it was just that much easier to convince them to report stories about, say, the danger to the Western alliance that Trump represented \u2014 a story that would require nothing more than stringing together a few quotes from Trump with a few ominous warnings from foreign-policy experts. The dossier, in short, helped Simpson sell a master narrative.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA Diabolical Mastermind\n\nBy choosing to convince voters that Trump was somehow an accomplice to the DNC hack, the Clinton campaign had set itself a difficult challenge: defining the role of Putin\u2019s American partners in crime. After all, the hack did not require the assistance of a Tom Cruise character. No one broke into DNC headquarters, crawled through a ventilator shaft, rappelled from a cable, and slid a disk into a hard drive. The hackers carried out the operation unilaterally, electronically, and probably from offshore. They required no accomplices on American soil.\n\nSteele solved this problem by finding \u201csources\u201d who revealed that the crucial contributions of Trump\u2019s team came in the planning stages. As it turns out, Steele reported, the idea to hack the DNC actually originated from the American side. It was Trump\u2019s team that defined the objective of the operation: \u201cleaking the DNC e-mails to Wikileaks during the Democratic Convention\u201d in order \u201cto swing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hillary Clinton and across to Trump.\u201d\n\nThis report solved half of the Clinton campaign\u2019s problem: It established Trump\u2019s guilt. But a conspiracy can\u2019t grab the popular imagination if it is devoid of actual conspirators. Here again, the super spy\u2019s \u201csources\u201d came to the rescue. On the day-to-day level, the job of managing the Trump-Putin collusion fell to Paul Manafort, who, at that time, was still Trump\u2019s campaign manager. But Manafort was not the architect of the DNC hack. Fortunately, the super spy was running a mole who was able to identify that criminal genius. The plot, Steele reported, \u201cwas conceived and promoted by Trump\u2019s foreign policy adviser Carter Page.\u201d\n\nHere the super spy\u2019s vaunted ability to filter out Russian disinformation appears to have failed him. Carter Page (who is no relation to Lisa Page on McCabe\u2019s team) played a negligible role in the campaign. The Trump people had placed him on a team of foreign-policy advisers, to be sure, but they had thrown the group together in haste to counter the accusation that the campaign lacked an expert bench. Page did not know Donald Trump personally. He worked in finance, with a focus on investing in Russia\u2019s energy sector, but he had no notable achievements to his name. A former boss described him, very unkindly, as \u201ca gray spot,\u201d a man \u201cwithout any special talents or accomplishments.\u201d\n\nSteele\u2019s allegations against Page make sense only in a Marvel Comics universe. Carter Page: by day, a mild-mannered businessman; by night, a diabolical mastermind.\n\nThe role that the super spy ascribed to Page may have been absurd, but what choice did he have? The conspiracy needed a face. That person had to have plausible connections to Russia plus a certain amount of visibility. In Trump\u2019s orbit, there were only two candidates: Manafort and Page. Manafort\u2019s ties, however, were to Ukraine, not Russia \u2014 and he was too well known. He had been working in Washington since the Reagan era.\n\nPage, by contrast, had direct connections to Russia, having lived in Moscow for some three years. The modesty of his career was actually a plus, because Clinton\u2019s propagandists could present it as shadowy rather than unsuccessful. For an unknown, Page was surprisingly visible. His trip to Moscow in July 2016 had received significant press attention, not least because he had expressed opinions in favor of rapprochement with Russia and critical of American foreign policy.\n\nWith the aid of Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign rolled out their master narrative on Trump-Putin collusion. A new orthodoxy immediately gripped the establishment press, which amplified the overwrought propaganda, complete with suggestions of dirty deals, dark conspiracies, and blackmail. It was Jeffrey Goldberg, the national correspondent (now editor) of The Atlantic, who first trumpeted the new line. In his aptly titled article, \u201cIt\u2019s Official: Hillary Clinton Is Running against Vladimir Putin,\u201d Goldberg alleged that Trump \u201chas chosen . . . to unmask himself as a de facto agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet,\u201d Franklin Foer of Slate examined the matter from the Russian side: \u201cVladimir Putin has a plan for destroying the West \u2014 and that plan looks a lot like Donald Trump,\u201d he wrote. David Remnick\u2019s article discussing Putin\u2019s affinity for grainy sex videos made identical points. All three authors noted, with grave concern, the Russian ties of Paul Manafort and . . . Carter Page.\n\nWith the exception of Fox News, the broadcast media beat the same drum. CNN might not have accused Page of masterminding the hack of the DNC, but it recognized a dangerous man when it saw one. On August 8, for example, it devoted a long segment entirely to Page. \u201cWhat\u2019s really remarkable here,\u201d Jim Sciutto, CNN\u2019s chief national-security correspondent told anchorman Wolf Blitzer, is that Page\u2019s positions \u201cmatch almost word for word the positions of the Kremlin, on, for instance, alleged U.S. orchestration of pro-democracy in and around Russia. And that is sparking concern from Russia experts and former policy makers even inside the GOP.\u201d\n\nSo Page was \u201csparking concern\u201d even among Never-Trump Republicans? How ominous! But imagine how much more ominous it would have sounded if journalists could have reported that Page was also sparking concern in the FBI! At that moment, John Brennan, the director of the CIA, was doing his damnedest to hand journalists precisely that story.\n\nCIA director John Brennan testifies on Capitol Hill, June 16, 2016.\nA Ventriloquist and His Dummy\n\nWhile the establishment press was singing in harmony with the Clinton campaign, a cacophonous debate erupted inside government. At the end of July, James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, said at a public forum that the intelligence community was not \u201cready yet to make a call on attribution\u201d \u2014 not ready, that is, to attribute the DNC hack to Putin. Clapper was also unready to say that the intention of the hackers was to get Trump elected. The goal, he said, may simply have been \u201cto stir up trouble.\u201d When combined with similar comments by other intelligence officials, Clapper\u2019s statements undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s efforts to brand Trump as Putin\u2019s active accomplice.\n\nEnter John Brennan. In early August, Brennan launched a personal campaign to force a consensus in support of Clinton\u2019s propaganda. Before long, Clapper became his partner in this effort. They would succeed, however, only after the election \u2014 and then only by establishing an ad hoc and highly unorthodox intelligence-assessment team. To man the team, Brennan and Clapper handpicked a small number of analysts, tasking them with reaching a consensus before the inauguration of Donald Trump. The team, no surprise, did not disappoint. In January 2017, it produced the \u201cconsensus\u201d that Brennan had been trying to orchestrate for the previous five months. By then, it was still useful as a propaganda tool against President Donald Trump, though it had arrived far too late to help Hillary Clinton win the election.\n\nOf course, Brennan has never admitted his political motives. On the contrary, according to an in-depth Washington Post investigation (based on interviews with either Brennan himself or people very close to him), the CIA director claimed to be in possession of eye-popping intelligence reports about the DNC hack. These reports supposedly \u201ccaptured Putin\u2019s specific instructions on the operation\u2019s audacious objectives \u2014 defeat or at least damage the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and help elect her opponent, Donald Trump.\u201d Yet even if this intelligence trove actually did exist and truly did convince the CIA director, it obviously did not have the same persuasive impact on his colleagues, as evidenced by Brennan\u2019s failure to deliver a consensus assessment of Putin\u2019s motives.\n\nIn his mission to transform the intelligence community into an official choir of the Clinton campaign, Brennan ran up against a 6\u20197\u2033 wall in the form of James Comey. According to the New York Times, in August 2016, \u201ca critical split\u201d emerged between \u201cthe CIA and counterparts at the FBI, where a number of senior officials continued to believe . . . that Russia\u2019s cyberattacks were aimed primarily at disrupting America\u2019s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected.\u201d As a component of this disagreement, Brennan may also have pressured Comey to investigate possible collusion with Russia by aides and associates of Trump.\n\nBy law, the CIA cannot spy on Americans; only the FBI has the authority to investigate citizens. But the CIA can share reports with the FBI about efforts by foreign agents to suborn individual Americans, and it can strongly urge the bureau to take action on the basis of those leads. Brennan, it would appear, did just that in July 2016.\n\nThat was the moment when the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Russian efforts to influence the Trump campaign. As we mentioned, Peter Strzok, who had been in charge of Midyear Exam, took charge of this investigation, too. The genesis and scope of it, however, is shrouded in a fog of deliberate misinformation. From the little we know, the probe seems to have centered on George Papadopoulos, a young foreign-policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Acting mostly on his own initiative, Papadopoulos reached out to Russians in the hopes of brokering a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. In the process, he may have bumped into Russian intelligence agents.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s activities took place, primarily, in London \u2014 a part of the world where the CIA has greater reach than the FBI. How did Comey come to learn of them? The answer is unclear, but certain clues point to Brennan.\n\nOne of these is Brennan\u2019s own testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in March 2017. The CIA, he explained, had shared certain information with the FBI \u2014 an apparent reference to the Papadopoulos leads. This was information, he said, \u201cthat required further investigation by the bureau to determine whether or not U.S. persons were actively conspiring, colluding with Russian officials.\u201d Was Brennan taking responsibility for kick-starting the investigation into the Trump campaign? He seemed to be saying that he had dropped the Papadopoulos file on Comey\u2019s desk and said, \u201cInvestigate Trump!\u201d\n\nIf this supposition about the origins of the investigation in July is correct, it may also help explain Brennan\u2019s behavior in late August, when he grew increasingly exasperated with Comey. In an effort to gain allies, Brennan turned to friends in Congress for help. With the blessing of Obama, he organized a series of briefings for the so-called Gang of Eight \u2014 the Democratic and Republican leaders in both chambers of Congress, and the chairs and ranking minority members on the Senate and the House intelligence committees. According to the New York Times, Brennan told these senior lawmakers that he \u201chad information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president,\u201d a view that was not supported by an authoritative intelligence assessment.\n\nObama and Brennan explained the briefings as an effort to forge bipartisan unity in the face of the Russian threat. But if Brennan couldn\u2019t force a consensus inside the intelligence community, how could he possibly convince Republicans and Democrats to join hands \u2014 during a polarizing election, no less?\n\nDemocratic lawmakers became the ventriloquist\u2019s dummies, moving their lips mechanically as  CIA director Brennan spoke.\n\nThis high-minded bipartisanship was simply cover for a highly partisan move. The true motive of the briefings was to ventriloquize the Democrats on the Hill. If Brennan himself had gone public with his claims about Putin, he would have called down attacks on himself for passing off Clinton propaganda as an official intelligence assessment \u2014 and for meddling, as the director of the CIA, in domestic politics. Democratic lawmakers who received his briefings, however, operated under no such constraints. They were perfectly free to pass along Brennan\u2019s views to the public as their own. They became the ventriloquist\u2019s dummies, moving their lips mechanically as the CIA director spoke.\n\nBrennan placed one of them center stage. On August 25, he gave a briefing that differed from the others; he tailored its content especially to the bare-knuckle politics of its recipient, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. During the 2012 election, Reid had assisted President Obama by falsely claiming that his Republican presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, had paid no taxes for ten years. When later asked if spreading a false rumor wasn\u2019t reminiscent of McCarthyism, Reid responded, \u201cThey can call it whatever they want. Romney didn\u2019t win, did he?\u201d With the certain knowledge that Reid, who was in any case retiring after the 2016 election, would do whatever it took to win, Brennan indulged his own partisan political passions. He told Reid, according to the New York Times, \u201cthat unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election.\u201d\n\nIf Reid\u2019s response is anything to go by, Brennan did much more than that: He briefed the senator on information taken directly from Steele\u2019s dossier; and he complained about the recalcitrance of the director of the FBI. Two days after the briefing, Reid wrote a letter to Comey, which he immediately shared with the press. Claiming there was mounting evidence of\u00a0\u201ca direct connection between the Russian government and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d Reid demanded that the FBI launch an immediate investigation. The American people, he wrote, deserve all the facts \u201cbefore they vote this November.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign, Reid continued bluntly, \u201chas employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.\u201d He was particularly concerned with Trump associates who may have served as what he called \u201ccomplicit intermediaries\u201d between the Russian government and hackers. \u201cThe prospect of individuals tied to Trump, Wikileaks, and the Russian government coordinating to influence our election raises concerns of the utmost gravity and merits full examination.\u201d In an unmistakable reference to Steele\u2019s reports on Carter Page, Reid informed Comey that \u201cquestions have been raised\u201d about a Trump adviser who allegedly \u201cmet with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow.\u201d\n\nServing as Brennan\u2019s dummy, Reid publicized the Marvel Comics rendering of Carter Page, and he demanded that the FBI launch an investigation on the basis of it. Before long, Comey would obey.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C., July 5, 2016.\nThe Cutout\n\nShortly after Reid\u2019s letter, Obama asked the FBI for an update on its investigation of Russian tampering with the election. The president, Lisa Page texted to her lover Peter Strzok, \u201cwants to know everything we\u2019re doing.\u201d The text probably refers to Obama\u2019s preparations for the G-20 meeting in China, where he personally lodged a complaint with Putin about the Russian hacking. But the request is intriguing. Obama was engaging the FBI just as it stood ready to use the allegations of the Steele dossier as a basis for broadening its investigation of Trump. When Comey informed Obama about \u201ceverything we are doing,\u201d did he discuss the Carter Page allegations? Did he note their source, Christopher Steele? And what about the president himself? Did Obama nudge Comey to comply with the demands of Brennan and Reid?\n\nWhatever signals the president may have sent, McCabe and his lovebirds certainly began supporting the efforts of Brennan and Reid to paint Trump as Putin\u2019s puppet. The form of support was nuanced and clandestine. If Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had contacted their favorite reporter, Devlin Barrett, and leaked the fact that a Trump adviser was coming under investigation, the leak would have implicated the FBI. Trump and his supporters would then have castigated Comey, accusing him of intervening in politics. To avoid such problems, the lovers used a pair of cutouts \u2014 intermediaries who laundered the FBI\u2019s information in the same way that Reid had laundered information for Brennan.\n\nWho better to play this role than the super duo, Simpson and Steele? Either directly or through an intermediary, Strzok shared with Steele the news of the impending investigation of Carter Page. He did so with the certain knowledge that Steele would channel it to Simpson, who, in turn, would incorporate it into his standard press briefings. (FBI representatives would later deny having used Steele as a cutout with the press, but their self-defense, as we shall see below, is demonstrably false.)\n\nThe experience of the journalist Julia Ioffe demonstrates how diligent Simpson was at spreading the news that Strzok was surreptitiously feeding him. In mid September, Ioffe published a profile on Carter Page for Politico. \u201cAs I started looking into Page,\u201d she relates, \u201cI began getting calls from two separate \u2018corporate investigators\u2019 digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians.\u201d One of those investigators was, presumably, Simpson; the other one probably represented another dank corner of the Clinton demimonde. Both emphasized an allegation that came directly from Steele\u2019s dossier: namely, that Page, during his trip to Moscow in July, had met with Igor Sechin, who is a key Putin ally and the chairman of the Russian state oil company. The \u201ccorporate investigators,\u201d however, now had something else to push, something new and very newsworthy: \u201cThe FBI was investigating Page.\u201d\n\nAs knowledge of the FBI\u2019s interest in Carter Page spread, Steele\u2019s credibility soared. To exploit the opportunity, Simpson flew Steele to the United States to brief select media outlets in person. Thanks to the information that McCabe\u2019s team was leaking to the press through Steele, Simpson could repackage the super spy. No longer just a former MI6 operative working as an \u201cindependent\u201d researcher, Steele was now a trusted colleague of the FBI\u2019s. He possessed unique insight into the fears of American counterintelligence officials about Trump\u2019s nefarious relations with Putin.\n\nFor the first time, Steele agreed to go on the record as a quoted source for journalists. This round of briefings generated an article, written by veteran Yahoo reporter Michael Isikoff. Entitled \u201cU.S. Intel Officials Probe Ties between Trump Adviser and Kremlin,\u201d it focused, naturally, on Carter Page. Isikoff reported that American officials had \u201creceived intelligence reports\u201d that Page had met with Sechin. \u201cAt their alleged meeting,\u201d Isikoff reported, \u201cSechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.\u201d A Western intelligence source? That would be Christopher Steele. By identifying the super spy in this manner, Isikoff disguises (wittingly or unwittingly) Steele\u2019s identity as a Clinton operative and as the author and disseminator of the reports in question. The moniker had the added benefit of making Steele seem to work for a Western government, creating the illusion of transatlantic trepidation about the cunning Carter Page.\n\nConfirmation of the article\u2019s central claims came from two other sources. The first was a \u201csenior U.S. law enforcement official,\u201d who told Isikoff that Page\u2019s meetings in Moscow were \u201cbeing looked at.\u201d Would that be Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, or Lisa Page? The second confirmation came from \u201ca congressional source familiar with . . . briefings\u201d that lawmakers had received about Carter Page\u2019s meetings in Moscow. Would that be Harry Reid? Whether these were indeed the correct identities, it is obvious where Isikoff found his sources: on Glenn Simpson\u2019s Rolodex. Here was a story processed and canned in Fusion GPS\u2019s information factory. All Isikoff had to do was add water and shake. His sources were all part of a single network conspiring to hoodwink the public.\n\nWhy did Comey participate in this fraud? Perhaps it was to get Brennan and Reid off his back. On the risk side of the ledger, the dangers were minimal. Today the Isikoff article is a fingerprint on a hot bullet casing, irrefutable proof placing the FBI at the scene of the crime. But in September 2016, the chances of anyone ever tying the bureau to it were negligible. Although the article announced with great flourish the opening of an investigation into Carter Page, it\u2019s not even clear that, at this point, Page was truly an official target of the probe.\n\nThe important thing to Brennan and Reid was helping Hillary Clinton win the election. What they desired most from the FBI was a public statement that the Trump team was under investigation for conspiring with Putin. With the Isikoff article, Comey didn\u2019t fully satisfy them, but he threw them a bone.\n\nOn the reward side of the ledger, he showed Hillary Clinton and her friends that he was, despite everything, a team player. And his contribution to the team effort was indeed significant. The FBI\u2019s leaks were indispensable in giving super-flack Glenn Simpson a stable of seemingly independent sources willing to go on the record about the grave concern sweeping the Western world about, of all people, Carter Page.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe speaks at a press conference, July 20, 2016.\nGet Carter\n\n\u201cMr. Page is not an advisor and has made no contribution to the campaign,\u201d said a Trump spokesman in reaction to the media storm over the Isikoff article. If Carter Page thought this disavowal would return some normalcy to his life, he was sadly mistaken. It actually put a target on his back. So long as he was officially affiliated with the Trump campaign, Comey would no doubt hesitate to seek a surveillance warrant, for fear of laying the FBI open to the charge of engaging in politically motivated spying. After the disavowal, Comey had more room for maneuver. He therefore gave the go-ahead to seek a surveillance warrant.\n\nWidening the probe to include Page carried a little additional risk for Comey, but not much. If Clinton were to win the election, as everyone expected, then she would never punish him for the move. If Trump were to win and learn about the probe, it would certainly enrage him. But the investigation could also be useful as leverage. Peter Strzok put it well in a text to Lisa Page a month earlier. On August 15, 2016, referring to the possibility of a Trump victory, Strzok wrote:\n\nI want to believe the path u threw out 4 consideration in Andy\u2019s [McCabe\u2019s] office \u2014 that there\u2019s no way he gets elected \u2014 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event u die be4 you\u2019re 40.\n\nStrzok, presumably, was saying that a counterintelligence operation against Trump and his team would give the FBI leadership a species of job insurance, similar to the job insurance that J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed in his day. Presidents dared not fire Hoover, because he kept a black book on them all.\n\nStrzok\u2019s team began the process of seeking a surveillance warrant on Carter Page from the court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA. The FISA court\u2019s proceedings are not public, because they treat top-secret intelligence. To seek a warrant against Carter Page required the FBI to show probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. In preparation for the warrant application, the FBI flew Steele to Rome for a face-to-face meeting with his main FBI contact. According to the New York Times, the handler told Steele that the FBI \u201cwould pay him $50,000\u201d if he \u201ccould get solid corroboration of his reports.\u201d It was an incriminating admission. Steele\u2019s reports on Page\u2019s Moscow trip were two months old. The U.S. government \u2014 that is, the FBI and the CIA \u2014 hadn\u2019t produced an iota of corroboration \u2014 and yet on the basis of those stale reports, it had suddenly decided to target Page as a probable agent of a foreign power.\n\nWhy? Because without the Carter Page who appeared in the Steele dossier \u2014 without the Marvel Comics villain, there existed no credible intelligence pointing to a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Putin. If the investigation was to be sufficiently broad to dig up dirt on Trump, it had to include the fanciful allegations against Page. These, however, were impossible to corroborate \u2014 because they were fictive. They did, however, include one claim that, if shorn of context, wasn\u2019t as transparently silly as the others: namely, that Page had met with Sechin, the chairman of the Russian state oil company. To be sure, Steele\u2019s report of the meeting contained the outlandish claim that Page had negotiated with Sechin on lifting American sanctions against Russia. But if McCabe\u2019s team were to downplay this aspect as much as possible and focus instead on whether the meeting actually took place (it didn\u2019t) \u2014 well, that could make it appear like a worrisome allegation calling out for a sober follow-up.\n\nThe super spy sprang into action. He tapped his daisy chain of paid Russian informants, and before McCabe\u2019s team submitted the FISA warrant application, he produced some short reports supposedly confirming the meeting with Sechin. Steele discovered in his network another \u201csource\u201d: the friend of one of Sechin\u2019s friend, who had heard from Sechin and from Sechin\u2019s personal assistant that indeed Sechin had met with Page. Confirmation?! The \u201csource\u201d also reported that Sechin offered Page, in return for Trump lifting of U.S. sanctions on Russia, a personal reward: a 19 percent stake in the Russian state-owned oil company \u2014 a haul worth millions upon millions, or probably billions.\n\nNo mere criminal mastermind, Page was master negotiator as well! Cartoonish depictions such as this constitute the primary basis on which the FBI made the case that Page was probably a foreign agent and that, in addition, he had probably broken American law \u2014 the legal standard for issuing surveillance warrants. The application for a warrant against Page is locked behind a top-secret classification. But McCabe testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that without Steele\u2019s information, the FBI could not have secured a surveillance warrant. And according to Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, who have read the original warrant application and the three renewal applications, \u201cthe bulk\u201d of the material on which the FBI made its case against Page came in the Steele dossier. What is more, the application contained, in the words of the two senators, \u201cno additional information corroborating the dossier allegations\u201d \u2014 no additional information, that is, except for one newspaper article: the Isikoff piece.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s team supported an application based primarily on Steele\u2019s allegations by offering the judges an article that itself was based solely on Steele\u2019s reports.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlfa Shmalfa \n\nPlacing Page under surveillance marked the high point of the cooperation between McCabe\u2019s team and the super duo Simpson and Steele. But nefarious partnerships are prone to unravel; and when they do, they unravel quickly. Only ten short days after McCabe\u2019s team pulled the wool over the eyes of the FISA-court judges, Simpson and Steele broke off relations with the FBI in a fit of anger and bitterness.\n\nRelations started to fray amid an effort by the super duo to stage a repeat of their Isikoff triumph. At some point in October, Simpson brought Steele to the United States for a second round of in-person briefings with major news outlets. Unfortunately, not one of these outlets has seen fit to disclose the subject of the briefings, so their precise details are sketchy. Still serving as FBI cutouts, the super duo probably updated reporters on the FISA warrant application and other aspects of the Trump-Russia investigation. If so, they may have intended for that information to serve as filler in articles about a new scoop that Simpson was offering reporters. A journalist whom Fusion GPS briefed at that time subsequently told the Washington Times that Simpson was pushing a story about a secret computer link-up between Trump and a Russian bank.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, news of the link-up had started to see the light of day thanks to the \u201cclassified\u201d briefings that Brennan had organized for trusted Democrats on Capitol Hill. Intelligence officers disclosed, in the words of the Times, \u201cthe possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump,\u201d including \u201ca mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin.\u201d John Brennan had designed those briefings to be leaky, so it should come as no surprise that word of the Alfa Bank investigation flowed directly to Fusion GPS.\n\nFollowing the winning formula that had produced the Isikoff article, Simpson provided reporters with the scoop. At first, the plan proceeded flawlessly. Franklin Foer of Slate ran a breathless story about the secret communications between the servers. Do we know with certainty that Foer\u2019s information came directly from Fusion GPS? No. It\u2019s certainly possible that, as we saw in the case of Julia Ioffe, some other agent emerged from the shadows of the Clinton demimonde to serve it up to him. Whatever the source of the information, Foer thought he might just have discovered the greatest piece of incriminating evidence yet \u2014 and Hillary Clinton agreed.\n\nThe Clinton campaign called on the FBI to investigate.\n\nThe speed and enthusiasm of her endorsement suggest more than a measure of coordination. She immediately sent out not one, but two tweets flagging Foer\u2019s piece. One of them attached a statement from her campaign, which added heart palpitations and comic-book imagery to Foer\u2019s breathlessness. Slate\u2019s discovery of a \u201csecret hotline,\u201d the statement said, might unlock the mystery behind Trump\u2019s love for Putin, and it might also explain why Russia was \u201cmasterminding\u201d cyber theft designed \u201cto hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d The Clinton campaign called on the FBI to investigate.\n\nClearly, this was the cue for McCabe\u2019s lovers to chime in. Their role was to affirm by means of a leak that the FBI was taking very seriously this threat to national security, investigating with all the diligence that the American people expect of their premier law-enforcement agency. Foer\u2019s story came out on October 31 \u2014 a week and a day before the voters went to the ballot box. If McCabe\u2019s team had stuck to the script, the media would have spent the final week before the election talking of nothing but the \u201csecret hotline\u201d that connected Putin to the lair of his evil minion high atop Trump Tower.\n\nBut McCabe\u2019s team double-crossed Steele and Simpson \u2014 or so the super duo must have felt. On the same day the Slate article appeared, the New York Times reported that the FBI had investigated the link between Alfa Bank and Trump Tower. The Bureau, the Times said, had concluded \u201cthat there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\u201d This single sentence wiped out weeks of diligent work by Fusion GPS. As if to console Simpson and Steele, the article did reveal that the FBI, all summer long, had been conducting an investigation into the potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. And the Times even disclosed details of the probe \u2014 information that came courtesy, one assumes, of briefings from Fusion GPS.\n\nBut to Simpson and Steele the inclusion of those details was the bitterest of consolation. The damage the Times visited on their propaganda campaign was not limited to undermining the Alfa Bank story. The article included two additional facts, each as destructive as the other: The FBI\u2019s wide-ranging investigation into Trump had revealed no collusion with Putin, and the FBI did not even believe that Putin was trying to get Hillary Clinton elected. In a convulsive fit of journalistic integrity, the Times had rejected Fusion GPS\u2019s master narrative \u2014 and it had done so on the basis of authoritative leaks from the FBI. Someone in the J. Edgar Hoover Building had dropped a pallet of bricks on Simpson and Steele. Who?\n\nFBI director James Comey testifies on Capitol Hill, July 7, 2016.\nThe Return of Joe Friday\n\nThe collapse of the \u201csecret hotline\u201d story was part of a larger falling-out between the FBI and the super duo \u2014 and not by any means the most important part. The event that truly doomed their relations was an announcement, on October 28, that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. And the character standing at the center of that decision was James Comey.\n\nThe bureau had learned that Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\u2019s trusted right hand, had forwarded thousands of emails to a computer in her home, which Anthony Weiner had put to personal use. Weiner was a former congressman, and he was Abedin\u2019s husband. But he was also a criminal under investigation by the FBI. In her \u201cwell-intentioned but careless\u201d use of government correspondence, Abedin had streamed thousands of official emails to the laptop of a pedophile.\n\nJames Comey\u2019s July statement closing the Clinton email case coincided with Guccifer 2.0\u2019s release of the DNC emails, and it helped build the impression of Hillary Clinton as the entitled CEO of Clinton, Inc. This reopening of the case, coming just a week before the election, was also timed for maximum visibility and carried a similar political valence. It was the third in a string of blows that Clinton received in the final stage of the election. The first came at a September 11 memorial commemoration in New York, where she had stumbled badly and seemed to faint, raising doubts about her stamina and health. On October 7, WikiLeaks published the first trove of emails stolen, presumably by Russian intelligence, from her campaign manager John Podesta. The emails were further grist for the mill of those who argued that Bill and Hillary Clinton were running a Tammany Hall for the 21st century. With Clinton stumbling, both literally and figuratively, the director of the FBI seemed determined to knock her back down.\n\nWhat was he thinking? Comey now claims that he assumed Hillary Clinton would win. He feared that, after the election, people would come to learn that he had hidden the issue of Abedin\u2019s laptop from the public, and they would accuse him of giving unfair consideration to Clinton. That calculation may indeed have been part of his thinking. But he may also have been hedging against a Trump victory. The announcement about the laptop was a card that he could play to ingratiate himself to Trump \u2014 to offset the damage of the leaks about the Russia investigation. On top of those machinations, there was the old story: Comey\u2019s love of the spotlight. Here he was again in a national drama playing the entirely principled and apolitical lawman. He was in Joe Friday heaven.\n\nFor their part, Clinton and her camp read the FBI director\u2019s move as treachery most vile. In a scream of rage masquerading as a letter to Comey, Harry Reid spoke for the team. Comey, he wrote, was breaking the law by engaging in partisan political activity in support of Trump. Whereas Comey never hesitated to publicize damaging \u201cinnuendo\u201d against Clinton, he was protecting Trump from public humiliation. \u00a0\u201cIt has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,\u201d Reid fumed. \u201cThe public has a right to know this information.\u201d To underscore that point, he published the letter immediately.\n\nGlenn Simpson and Christopher Steele shared the sense of betrayal. Simpson later testified to the House intelligence committee:\n\nAt that point I felt like the rules had just been thrown out and that Comey had violated . . . one of the more sacrosanct policies, which is not announcing law enforcement activity in the closing days of an election. . . . We decided that if James Comey wasn\u2019t going to tell people about this investigation that, you know, he had violated the rules, and [it] would only be fair if the world knew that both candidates were under FBI investigation.\n\nSo Simpson and Steele \u201cbegan talking to the press.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the super duo brought about the end of their secret partnership with McCabe\u2019s team. The bureau expects its cutouts to behave as cutouts: that is to say, they must launder secrets. Sensitive and classified information must never appear in the press in a form that betrays its FBI origins.\n\nComey announced the reopening of the Clinton email case on Friday, October 28. Simpson moved quickly. He arranged a Skype interview between Steele, who was now back in London, and David Corn, a veteran journalist at Mother Jones. On October 31, Corn reported that \u201ca former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence\u201d told him \u201cthat in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on . . . Russian sources, contending that the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump \u2014 and that the FBI requested more information from him.\u201d The FBI response, Steele told Corn, was \u201cshock and horror.\u201d In August, the FBI asked for more of Steele\u2019s memos. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on.\u201d To ensure that Corn understood the nature of the inquiry, Steele shared with him the text of the reports that he had given to the Bureau.\n\nSteele\u2019s decision to expose his partnership with the FBI gave McCabe\u2019s team no choice but to terminate the relationship. The break-up was ugly, but its very messiness would later prove useful. In late 2017, congressional investigators would begin questioning the FBI\u2019s senior leaders about the role Steele had played as a cutout. The senior leaders would point to the break-up as proof of the FBI\u2019s integrity. Steele, they said, had been lying all along to the Bureau about his work with journalists. McCabe\u2019s team had no idea that he was funneling the FBI\u2019s secrets to the media. It was the Mother Jones interview that alerted them to Steele\u2019s duplicity; the moment it became clear, they immediately terminated the relationship.\n\nWe have a word to describe the use of fabricated evidence to make an innocent man appear guilty: The Obama administration framed Carter Page. But not only Carter Page. The Obama administration framed Donald Trump.\n\nThis alibi won\u2019t wash. McCabe\u2019s team was fully aware, in September, that Steele stood behind the Isikoff article. In fact, the appearance of \u201ca senior U.S. law enforcement official\u201d in the article implicates McCabe\u2019s team more or less directly. In short, Steele\u2019s FBI handlers were aware of his role in leaking information at that time, and it caused them no consternation. On the contrary, after the Isikoff article, the FBI drew Steele even closer, flying him to Rome and offering him $50,000. His work as a cutout received further tacit commendation when McCabe\u2019s team used the Isikoff article to dupe the FISA-court judges.\n\nThe troubles that eventually befell Steele and McCabe\u2019s team have no bearing on the simple facts: They worked as partners in prosecuting a campaign of innuendo against Carter Page in September, and again in placing him under surveillance in October. What is more, the surveillance order went beyond McCabe\u2019s team, to the highest levels in the FBI and the DOJ. James Comey had to sign off on that decision \u2014 and that fact implicates him in a serious abuse of power.\n\nSteele\u2019s description of Carter Page\u2019s activities in Moscow is comical. We have a word to describe the use of fabricated evidence to make an innocent man appear guilty: The Obama administration framed Carter Page. But not only Carter Page. According to Steele\u2019s dossier, Page was in Moscow to cut a deal on another\u2019s behalf: He was an emissary \u2014 the trusted agent of Donald Trump. Without Steele\u2019s allegations against Carter Page \u2014 without, that is, the story of Page negotiating with Sechin to remove the sanctions \u2014 there was no credible allegation of a Trump-Putin conspiracy. The FBI, therefore, carried out a campaign of innuendo against Donald Trump in September. And the Obama administration placed him under investigation in October, if not earlier. The Obama administration framed Donald Trump.\n\nSecond Sight\n\nDuring the Watergate scandal, the press popularized the phrase \u201cthe non-denial denial.\u201d The Nixon White House had a special talent for issuing statements that sounded like categorical denials of allegations but that, upon close parsing, affirmed them to be true. In the matter of the Steele dossier, Obama officials, some of their allies in Congress, and senior leaders in the FBI have developed an analogous ploy: the \u201cnon-verification verification.\u201d These are statements that distance the speaker from the laughable fantasies of the Steele dossier while still affirming that the tale of collusion it weaves must be taken seriously.\n\nThe unrivaled master of the move is John Brennan. In a recent appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Brennan defended the FBI\u2019s use of the Steele dossier in its FISA warrant application. He railed against the FBI\u2019s critics, whom he depicted as partisan hacks. He played the role of sober intelligence professional. Expressing his personal appraisal of the dossier when he was still director of the CIA, he said, \u201cThere were things in that dossier that made me wonder whether or not they were, in fact, accurate and true.\u201d\n\nExactly what things? Was it the dossier\u2019s view of Page as the diabolical mastermind of the DNC hack that struck the CIA director as credible? Avoiding the dossier\u2019s specific allegations, Brennan maintained his front and asserted, with the somber tone of a button-down national-security professional, that Steele\u2019s reports contain valuable intelligence leads. \u201cI think Jim Comey has said that it contained salacious and unverified information,\u201d Brennan continued. \u201cJust because it was unverified didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe non-verification verification is central to the distinctive nature of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of power. Most of our debate has focused on how the FBI used the Steele dossier to validate the investigation of Carter Page. This issue is important, to be sure, but it must not deflect us from seeing that the reverse is also true: The administration deliberately used the investigation of Page to validate the dossier.\n\nConsider, again, the coy Brennan. When questioners push him to explain what in the Steele dossier he finds compelling, he habitually takes shelter behind secret sources \u2014 evidence hidden behind a classified screen, where only he, the chief intelligence professional, was permitted to see it. \u201cI was aware of intelligence . . . about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether . . . those individuals were cooperating with the Russians . . . and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [or] cooperation occurred.\u201d\n\nBrennan\u2019s somber and self-righteous appeal to hidden secrets is the oldest con in the book.\n\nJohn Brennan sees things that we cannot see. If he indeed has access to secrets that transform stories from Marvel Comics into the stuff of everyday reality, then he has done a very poor job of explaining what they are. Moreover, no disinterested intelligence professional has supported him. Brennan\u2019s somber and self-righteous appeal to hidden secrets is the oldest con in the book. Just replace his top-secret computer monitor with a crystal ball or dried chicken bones, and his scam is the same one that Gypsy fortunetellers ran on superstitious peasants in early-modern Europe, or that soothsayers were operating in Homer\u2019s Greece.\n\nWith respect to the framing of Trump, however, the second-sight scam required elaborate orchestration, the work of many hands. The key was the double-tracking of the dossier. Hillary Clinton\u2019s enablers channeled it simultaneously into the press and into the government. They then recruited people inside government to verify to the outsiders that it was a serious document, a guide to the intelligence that reporters were not allowed to see. Without this double-tracking and official or quasi-official authentication, journalists would never have believed that they were catching a glimpse of what Brennan and the FBI saw in their crystal balls \u2014 pardon me, their top-secret monitors. And without leaks about investigations, journalists would have had no dossier-related news to report. Official statements that the dossier \u201cwas being looked into\u201d transformed it into a legitimate topic for reputable news outlets.\n\nThis con failed in its primary goal of preventing the election of Trump, but it was nevertheless a partial success. It instilled in a significant portion of the American public the conviction that Trump indeed conspired with Putin. This conviction is especially prevalent among the lofty-minded \u2014 a class of people that includes Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\nThe bipartisan character of the delusion was the greatest factor that legitimated the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged relations with Russia. The lofty-minded have greeted every indictment that Mueller has handed down as confirmation of their collusion delusion. In reality, those indictments only prove that a phalanx of crack investigators armed with nearly unlimited resources, a grand jury, and an expansive mandate can draw blood almost at will. If a similar phalanx were to target Hillary Clinton and the shenanigans surrounding the Clinton Foundation, how much blood would flow? In other words, Mueller\u2019s indictments are just the latest form of the non-verification verification.\n\nRegardless of Mueller\u2019s intentions, his probe serves as precisely the kind of \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that Strzok seems to have been discussing with his lover, Lisa Page, in August 2016. Trump cannot shut down the Mueller probe and excise the rot in the DOJ and the FBI without appearing to obstruct justice. In practical terms, then, the Mueller probe is the cover-up.\n\nOf course, the lofty-minded refuse to see it this way. The political damage that Mueller\u2019s team is inflicting on Trump helps explain why a surprising number of people mount passionate and sincere defenses of the dossier and the super spy who compiled it. The logic of partisan politics will always lead a significant percentage of people to insist, with varying degrees of true belief, that a sow\u2019s ear really is a silk purse. But partisanship is not by any means the only factor at work here. Even people with well-deserved reputations for intellectual seriousness passionately defend the integrity of Christopher Steele, a man whom the New York Times insists on calling, despite all contrary evidence, \u201ca whistleblower.\u201d\n\nFor a complete understanding of the dossier\u2019s tenacious hold on lofty minds, one must supplement conventional political analysis with psychology. What we are witnessing is nothing less than a textbook case of denial and projection \u2014 the most perfect case imaginable.\n\nThe event that shaped the dossier more than any other was the hack of the DNC. Guccifer 2.0 first began releasing documents on June 15. A week later, Steele produced his first report. The Hillary Clinton that emerged from the DNC emails was preternaturally unsuited to a populist moment. Here she was: the Hillary Clinton who made high-priced speeches to Wall Street on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. Here was the co-executive of the international slush funds of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. Here was the power-hungry political boss who worked with the DNC to fix the Democratic primaries. Clinton\u2019s supporters instinctively understood the size of the wound that the hack opened up, and they worked frantically to cauterize it \u2014 which meant deflecting attention from the greed, entitlement, and sleaze that characterized Clinton, Inc.\n\nThe dossier quickly became a tool for denying the deficiencies of Bill and Hillary Clinton, projecting them onto Donald Trump. Is Bill Clinton a sexual predator? That\u2019s nothing. Trump pays teams of prostitutes to pee on him! Did Hillary Clinton preside over the failed \u201creset\u201d with Russia? That\u2019s nothing. Putin is blackmailing Trump, and he fears Hillary! Did Bill Clinton pocket a $500,000 fee for a speech he gave in Moscow, shortly before the sale of American uranium to Russian interests? That\u2019s nothing. Trump\u2019s been dependent on Putin for years! Do the emails from the DNC prove that Hillary Clinton rigged the primaries? That\u2019s nothing. Trump conspired with Putin to rig the entire election!\n\nIn the wake of the DNC hack, leading figures in the press and senior officials in the Obama administration faced a choice. They could depict Carter Page as he really was: an unknown man of modest accomplishments who played no role of note in the Trump organization. Or they could conspire with Fusion GPS to promote the fiction that he was a sly operative in a sinister network. In a fateful choice, they opted for dishonesty and deception over truth.\n\nOnce the enablers of Hillary Clinton compromised their own integrity, they internalized her program of denial and projection. Their own egos are now invested in perpetuating it. To avoid owning up to their shortcomings, they insist, in ever-shriller tones, on the personal integrity of the super spy and the credibility of his reports. The mere acknowledgement of a simple truth \u2014 that the \u201cdossier\u201d is junk \u2014 would constitute an admission either of deep professional malfeasance or of gob-smacking gullibility.\n\nChoose your poison, Hillary enablers: You duped people and thereby abetted a gross abuse of power; or you were yourself badly duped.\n\nChoose your poison: You duped people and thereby abetted a gross abuse of power; or you were yourself badly duped. That is the dilemma that the lofty-minded now face. The choice is excruciating. It requires abandoning satisfying self-images and embracing painful self-truths \u2014 while also handing a well-deserved victory to a hated political enemy. As a consequence, the Steele dossier has proved to be as consequential as it is asinine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Greatest Denier\n\nOf course, no one is in deeper denial than Hillary Clinton herself. After she had conceded to Trump on the night of the election, Obama called her. Taking the phone, she said, \u201cMr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nSorry, no doubt, that the baton had fallen to the ground once again. Sorry that she would not be the first female president. Sorry that she would not hold the reins of power. But was contrition an aspect of any component of her sorrow?\n\n\nIf there is one thing Hillary Clinton does not do well, it is contrition. In an interview last September, she clung to the fiction that the election was stolen. Her belief that Trump conspired with Putin was absolute. \u201cThere certainly was communication, and there certainly was an understanding of some sort,\u201d Clinton said. She had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Putin sought a Trump victory, that there was \u201ca tangle of financial relationships\u201d between Trump and Russia, and that Trump\u2019s associates \u201cworked really hard to hide their connections with Russians.\u201d Were those, in her mind, clear signs of collusion? \u201cI\u2019m convinced of it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe will remain convinced until the day she dies. The alternative, a rigorous examination of conscience, is too painful to contemplate.

But the adage about marriage is often true of politics: What is not said is more destructive than what is said.\n\nFor example, over the last 18 months the president has said and done a number of things that warranted dissent from Republicans \u2014 not just from party leaders, but from rank-and-file legislators, pundits, and other commentators. But the dogs did not bark, opting to stay silent.\n\n\n\n\nWe need not take up too much space quibbling over specifics. All one need do is play the \u201cWhat if Obama said this?\u201d game to see that the moral arc of the GOP has bent toward President Trump.\n\nThen, a few weeks ago, the president proposed sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs and heaped praise on the benefits of trade wars. Suddenly, Congress and much of the conservative commentariat rose up in protest.\n\nTrump\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who reportedly almost resigned last summer over the president\u2019s morally equivocating response to a neo-Nazi rally, apparently found tariffs a nobler hill to die on.\n\nAs a free-trader, I welcome this response. But just imagine you\u2019re a run-of-the-mill Democratic congressional candidate looking to unseat a Republican who never spoke up about Trump\u2019s \u201cs***hole countries\u201d remark, the unfolding drama over Stormy Daniels, Trump\u2019s endorsement of Roy Moore, his attacks on the First Amendment, or his flirtation with cutting off aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico because of a spat with the mayor of San Juan.\n\nHow easy it would be to say: \u201cMy opponent never objected to these things, but when Trump tried to save manufacturing jobs, he leapt to his feet to protest at the bidding of the same fat-cat free-traders and globalist big businesses that outsourced so many of your jobs. My opponent is okay with the president endorsing and campaigning for an accused child molester, but he will fight to the death to keep cheap Chinese steel from pouring into this country.\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s a dumb economic argument \u2014 steel tariffs would cost more American manufacturing jobs than they\u2019d save \u2014 but it\u2019s a great political one.\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one illustration of the Republican dilemma. The president divides the Right while he unifies the Left. Praise Trump on his controversial statements and you risk alienating suburban Republicans, particularly women. Criticize Trump and you risk not only his wrath, but also the wrath of the portion of his base that demands rhetorical fealty to Trump in all things. Because this constituency has disproportionate influence in conservative media and GOP primaries, the safest course of action is often silence, or some clever dodge like, \u201cI don\u2019t respond to tweets.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has created a kind of collective-action problem for itself. By making these individual decisions out of self-interest in the moment, the party as a whole ends up getting pulled in a direction not of its own choosing.\n\nVoters don\u2019t judge parties on their lists of principles, but on their real-world priorities. Not objecting to something sends as clear a signal as objecting does. It\u2019s fun to listen to Republicans vent off the record, but most Americans don\u2019t get to hear any of that. They do hear the silence, however.\n\nAnd so does Trump. Over the weekend, the president floated a fairly obvious trial balloon, tweeting, \u201cThe Mueller probe should never have been started,\u201d and calling it, in all caps, a \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not shocking that the president would want to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, but he has never attacked him directly before. The usual suspects cheered on Trump, while most of the party was silent.\n\nOne of the few exceptions was Senator Lindsey Graham, who said firing Mueller would be the \u201cbeginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d House speaker Paul Ryan offered a lackluster response through a spokesperson: \u201cMr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said . . . nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOff the record, Republicans often say they\u2019re afraid Trump responds to being told not to do something by doing it out of spite. That\u2019s a real concern. But it\u2019s not an excuse.\n\nIf Trump does fire Mueller and a constitutional crisis ensues, the previously silent, suddenly angry Republicans will be asked why they\u2019re speaking up now.

The FBI cannot possibly police itself.\n\nBalderdash, declared Democrats. How dare you question the patriotism and professionalism of federal agents. Don\u2019t you Republicans profess to like law enforcement? The political components of the Justice Department are rotten to the core. The career civil servants, on the other hand, are the brave bulwark against Trump\u2019s impulsive, lawless, amateurish authoritarianism.\n\n\nThen, Wednesday, the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) recommended firing FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe for allegedly misleading investigators about his contacts with the media in the late stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is working on a report that reportedly will be highly critical of McCabe, and the findings apparently triggered the OPR\u2019s review.\n\nMcCabe, readers may recall, is a favorite target of President Donald Trump. McCabe has been a central player in the FBI investigations of Hillary Clinton, Russian election interference, and potential Russian ties to the Trump campaign. He\u2019s a potential witness in the obstruction investigation against Trump. Trump believes that McCabe is biased against him, in part because McCabe\u2019s wife received substantial campaign assistance from Clinton friend (and former Virginia governor) Terry McAuliffe during her failed run for the Virginia state senate in 2015. Here are two Trump tweets from December:\n\n\nHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\n\n\u2014 Donald J.

Republicans online were supporting the inspector general and the proud and nonpartisan civil servants in the OPR. Democrats online were decrying the allegedly obvious political corruption of the review process, a corruption that now had seeped into the permanent bureaucracy of the DOJ. And then, when the attorney general fired McCabe late Friday night, the Left truly erupted. No tweet better captured the fury than former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s:\n\n\nWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.

Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\n\n\u2014 Donald J.

No one knew the actual evidence, yet their rage and certainty were undiminished.\n\nBut that\u2019s pretty much par for the course. Remember, we\u2019ve just exited a news cycle where the public, pundits, and politicians opined authoritatively about the legality and credibility of FISA applications they hadn\u2019t read. \u00a0Instead of waiting for comprehensive reports or reviewing source documents, they sallied forth into online battle relying mainly on two shoddily written, hopelessly partisan memos from a terribly compromised House committee.\n\nAt this point American political hypocrisy is boundless. The same people who would parse and condemn Barack Obama\u2019s public statements about ongoing investigations now urge us to ignore Trump\u2019s tweets. Meaningless venting, they say. Conversely, the same people who told us that Obama\u2019s public pronouncements had no impact on the good professionals at the FBI and IRS now tell us that Trump\u2019s tirades are proof positive of political influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd Friday-night news dumps? Well, they\u2019re suspicious only if we don\u2019t like the news.\n\nOne of the most loathsome political stunts in recent memory was the claim of the Democratic Senate majority leader in 2012 that Mitt Romney had not paid income taxes for ten years. He made the claim without any foundation, and it was patently false. Yet he repeated the claim time and again, hammering home an idea that the wealthy Romney escaped his civic obligations while the rest of us schmucks paid our fair share. After the election, when the extent of Harry Reid\u2019s perfidy was known, a reporter asked him if his tactics were \u201creminiscent of McCarthyism.\u201d\n\nHis answer? \u201cThey can call it whatever they want. Romney didn\u2019t win, did he?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fought a political culture war, and Harry Reid won. Or perhaps it\u2019s better to say he was but one teacher among many. He was just another politician who taught us that winning isn\u2019t just everything. It\u2019s the only thing. Lie all you want. Argue against the very claims you just made. If you have standards, make sure they\u2019re double standards. But if you win, then the accolades will roll down from the heavens. Your critics can be dismissed as those messy elitists who just don\u2019t like your \u201ctone\u201d or \u201cstyle.\u201d And you\u2019re doing it for a good cause. Always, you\u2019re doing it for a good cause.\n\nI don\u2019t know yet if the DOJ\u2019s decision to terminate McCabe was correct. I haven\u2019t seen the evidence.

That may be a violation of campaign-finance laws if Trump did not report it as an in-kind contribution. Beyond that, it reveals the contempt with which Trump treats the public. There was no affair, but Cohen had a sudden urge to make a charitable contribution to Stormy? And now Trump is suing Daniels \u2014 in the amount of $20 million \u2014 for breach of the confidentiality agreement, though the official Trump position is that the agreement doesn\u2019t exist.

Mr. Trump, who stresses that winning is the only virtue he upholds, should admire that.\n\n\n\n\nThe same cannot be said of Summer Zervos, one of the 16 women who accused Trump of groping after the release of the Access Hollywood tape. If you recall, Trump claimed that all of the women were lying and that he would sue them after the election. Zervos, who was a contestant on The Apprentice, has now received the go-ahead from a judge for her lawsuit to proceed. She said he groped. He called her liar. She is suing for defamation. Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that his depiction of Zervos as a liar was \u201cpolitical speech clearly protected by the first amendment.\u201d The judge rejected that argument and, citing the Paula Jones precedent, noted that no president is immunized against suits for purely private acts. This could open the door to sworn depositions, and possible further suits.\n\nAnd because character is destiny, yet another Trump acquaintance, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, is also attempting to invalidate her secrecy agreement. Thanks to Donald Trump, we\u2019ve learned that the gossip magazines have a practice called \u201ccatch and kill\u201d for stories they want to suppress. The parent company of the National Enquirer apparently performed this service for Trump, paying McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story.\n\n\nNevertheless, McDougal seems ready to tell her tale, and Daniels will tell hers (including allegations of threats emanating from Trump world).

Sanborn Elementary School, the sharp Midwestern wind blew children\u2019s shamrock bowler hats into the street. A procession of several dozen decorated lawnmowers waited on the nearby grass, and a contingent of kilt-clad bagpipers warmed up in the parking lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne particularly enthusiastic village resident brought along a white Great Pyrenees dog, whose fur was tinted green for the occasion, and an amateur saxophonist repeatedly played \u201cWhen Irish Eyes Are Smiling,\u201d smoothing out the off-key notes just a bit with each rendition.\n\nAnd Harold stood in the middle of it all \u2014 matching the crowd\u2019s festive flair in her own lime-green scarf and sparkly shamrock earrings \u2014 clearly at home in the bustle and thrum as Palatine residents finished their hasty preparations. The swirl seemed second nature to her, and why wouldn\u2019t it be? She has already excelled in a much more intense atmosphere: In 2003, she was Miss America.\n\nHarold was born and raised in Champaign, Ill., and though her stint as Miss America over a decade ago sent her traveling across the country, she\u2019s now back home in the Prairie State, hoping to serve as its next attorney general, and as the first Republican to hold the office in over a decade.\n\nAlong with the Palatine Township Republican Association, Harold marched in the parade to meet members of the community ahead of the March 20 primary elections. \u201cPeople always remember when you show up at their parades and when you don\u2019t,\u201d Harold tells me as we begin walking the parade route. \u201cThey view it as a proxy for if you\u2019re willing to work hard for their vote.\u201d\n\nIf the children of Palatine could cast ballots, Harold would surely win their votes in a landslide on Tuesday. \u201cIf you have no candy, no kid wants to shake your hand. Your message is candy on a day like today,\u201d she says when she arrives, armed with a bag of the stuff. Her strategy seemed to work with children and adults alike. One man on the sidelines called out after her, \u201cI vote for the candidate who gives me the most candy!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAs the parade swept through the streets of Palatine, the former Miss America had to jog to catch up with volunteers holding her banners. Consistently, she lingered to talk with residents: \u201cYou should never ride in the parade; always walk. It\u2019s important to make a one-on-one connection.\u201d\n\nHarold says she first began to consider herself a conservative when she was a student at the University of Illinois. \u201cI know that\u2019s not the usual course of events,\u201d she tells me with a chuckle. After graduation, Harold was dead-set on going to Harvard Law School but needed to find a way to pay for it. And so she did, in a very unusual style: She entered the Miss America pageant in 2003 \u2014 and emerged the victor.\n\nThough perhaps few realize it, winners do more than wear crowns and gowns and smile for the camera. Harold\u2019s official platform as Miss America was preventing youth violence and bullying, and she deferred law school for a year to travel across the country, speaking to students, teachers, and parents about practical ways to identify and stop bullying in schools.\n\nHer dedication to the issue stemmed from her childhood experience of being a victim of bullying and harassment \u2014 often as the result of her mixed-race background: white on her father\u2019s side and both African American and Native American on her mother\u2019s. \u201cWhen I won Miss America, it was still at a time in which people didn\u2019t take the issue of bullying in schools all that seriously,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey sometimes viewed it as an adolescent rite of passage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHarold went on to graduate from Harvard Law in 2007, and has since worked full time as a lawyer. Now, she wants to take what she has learned both from the law and as Miss America to improve her home state, which she thinks has been plagued by corruption for much too long.\n\nIn her view, current attorney general Lisa Madigan \u2014 daughter of notorious Democratic-party boss Mike Madigan, who has been speaker of the Illinois house since the 1970s \u2014 has squandered the unique authority and the resources of the office. Instead of keeping her promise to lessen both public and private corruption, particularly in Chicago, Madigan has helped her friends and targeted her enemies.\n\n\u2018Political corruption in Illinois is not a partisan issue,\u2019 Harold insists.\n\n\u201cPolitical corruption in Illinois is not a partisan issue,\u201d Harold insists. \u201cPolitical leaders in both parties have abused their positions of power and created cynicism in our state that has undermined people\u2019s view of our government.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Madigan said she planned to seek a fifth term, but when Harold announced her own candidacy a month later, the current attorney general dropped out of the race. Before she can face a new Democratic candidate in November, Harold has to defeat primary challenger Gary Grasso, a Chicago-area politician who currently serves on the DuPage County board.\n\n\n\n\nIn the final weeks of the primary campaign, the GOP contest has gotten particularly ugly. Grasso recently sent mailers accusing Harold of choosing to \u201cplace a child in the home of known child abusers,\u201d decontextualizing remarks Harold made during the Miss America pageant when she was explaining her opposition to same-sex adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI switched my vote because of that mailer and am going to support Erika,\u201d one member of the Palatine Township Republican Association told me at the parade. \u201cThat attack just wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nGrasso also sent mailers suggesting that Harold is anti-family and pro-choice, as well as implying that he had received the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune editorial board, when in fact the paper had endorsed Harold.\n\nWhen supporters at the parade asked her about Grasso\u2019s negative ads, Harold shrugged them off with a pleasant smile. \u201cWhen you get late in a race and your opponent doesn\u2019t like the way things are looking, sometimes they turn to tactics like this. The best thing to do is ignore it and stay focused on the positives,\u201d Harold told one man.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not falling for it,\u201d he replied, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my vote. I think you\u2019ve got the best chance in the fall. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for you.\u201d\n\nAccording to an SIU poll from late February, Harold leads Grasso 18 percent to 14 percent, with a full 65 percent of voters undecided. Among residents of Chicago proper, Harold was up 21 to 14 percent, and in downstate Illinois, where she was born and raised, she leads Grasso 19 to 13 percent. In the suburbs, however, the two are tied at 14 percent support.\n\nWhich makes Harold\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day excursion to the suburbs even more appropriate. Though she appears to be the slight favorite to win today\u2019s primary, she isn\u2019t the type to slack off. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come up to me and say, \u2018I remember shaking your hand\u2019 or \u2018I remember you coming up onto my porch to meet me,\u2019\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou have to actually enjoy people and be curious about their stories.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cVery few people fully understand all the political issues,\u201d one of Harold\u2019s supporters told me just before the parade began. \u201cBut we remember when you show up.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s right, Harold\u2019s knack for showing up in style like she did in Palatine might be exactly what she needs to put her over the edge in today\u2019s primary \u2014 and it might even help her win in November, too.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David French", "body": "Alec Murrary holds an AR-15 assault rifle at the Ringmasters of Utah gun range, in Springville, Utah (George  them would gut the concept of an armed citizenry as a final, emergency bulwark against  about guns tend to suffer from two distinct problems. The first \u2014 and most obvious \u2014 is they quickly get screechy. The arguments devolve into shouting matches and temper tantrums. The goal isn\u2019t to persuade but to mock and bully, as if stigma alone can decisively shift the public debate. The second problem occurs when the debate gets too wonky. Charts and graphs fly across Twitter, as if fundamental questions about liberty and American society can be answered by the right kind of cross-country comparison with Australia, Great Britain, or Switzerland.\n\nWhen facing the big questions about guns \u2014 such as whether America should \u201cban\u201d an entire category of weapons (such as \u2018assault weapons\u2019) \u2014 it\u2019s better, I think, to go back to the first principles embodied in the Second Amendment. At its core, the Amendment protects a person\u2019s individual inherent right of self-defense and empowers the collective obligation to defend liberty against state tyranny. As Justice Scalia noted in District of Columbia v. Heller, this concept was fully embedded in the founding generation:\n\nAnd, of course, what the Stuarts had tried to do to their political enemies, George III had tried to do to the colonists. In the tumultuous decades of the 1760\u2019s and 1770\u2019s, the Crown began to disarm the inhabitants of the most rebellious areas. That provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.\n\nAny given gun-control measure must be evaluated against the background of those twin purposes. That\u2019s one reason why statements such as \u201cThe Second Amendment was only designed to protect muskets\u201d are so ridiculous. Imagine trying to defend your family with a flintlock pistol. The right of self-defense is best understood as a right of effective self-defense, and the tools for effective self-defense will evolve right along with weapon design and development. Any other conclusion leads to absurd results. Consequently, as the Supreme Court held, the amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time.\u201d\n\n\nThis means that if gun-control measures \u201cfreeze\u201d the nature and types of guns that are lawful for civilian use, even as broader gun development proceeds apace, there will be an ever-widening gap between the capacity of a criminal to do harm and law-abiding citizens\u2019 ability to protect themselves from that harm. It will also lead to such a yawning gap between citizen and state that private gun ownership no longer provides any meaningful deterrent to tyranny.\n\nAnd this brings us to the two favorite targets of those who argue for so-called common sense gun control \u2014 assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. While the term \u201cassault weapon\u201d is vague, we\u2019ll define it as a semi-automatic rifle with cosmetic features similar to military weapons. They\u2019re typically paired with high-capacity magazines. In fact, an \u201cassault weapon\u201d without a high-capacity magazine is little more than a menacing-looking hunting rifle.\n\n\n\n\nThere are millions of assault weapons in America. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the nation. There are tens of millions of high-capacity magazines, and they\u2019re extraordinarily easy to make. Both are unquestionably in \u201ccommon use.\u201d\n\nThis means that the foreseeable criminal threat to you or your family comes from a person wielding \u2014 at the very least \u2014 a semiautomatic pistol with a high-capacity magazine. This is one reason that police typically don\u2019t carry revolvers. Their own weapons of choice have evolved to deal with the threat, and \u2014 as my colleague Charlie Cooke is fond of noting \u2014 if a person doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a high-capacity magazine to defend himself, then why do the police use them?\n\nIf I use an AR-15 for home defense, then I possess firepower that matches or likely exceeds (given how rarely rifles are used in gun crimes) that of any likely home intruder. Limit the size of the magazine to, say, ten rounds, and you\u2019ve placed the law-abiding homeowner at a disadvantage. Prohibit them from obtaining a compact, easy-to-use, highly accurate carbine, and you\u2019ve ensured that homeowners will be defending themselves with less accurate weapons. The best weapons \u201cin common use\u201d would be reserved for criminals.\n\nMoreover, an assault-weapon ban (along with a ban on high-capacity magazines) would gut the concept of an armed citizenry as a final, emergency bulwark against tyranny. No credible person doubts that the combination of a reliable semiautomatic rifle and a large-capacity magazine is far more potent than a revolver, bolt-action rifle, or pump-action shotgun. A free citizen armed with an assault rifle is more formidable than a free citizen armed only with a pistol. A population armed with assault rifles is more formidable than a population armed with less lethal weapons.\n\nCitizens must be able to possess the kinds of weapons that can at least deter state overreach.\n\nThe argument is not that a collection of random citizens should be able to go head-to-head with the Third Cavalry Regiment. That\u2019s absurd. Nor is the argument that citizens should possess weapons \u201cin common use\u201d in the military. Rather, for the Second Amendment to remain a meaningful check on state power, citizens must be able to possess the kinds and categories of weapons that can at least deter state overreach, that would make true authoritarianism too costly to attempt.\n\n\nI fully recognize that there are many millions of Americans who flatly disagree with the notion that armed citizens either can or should try to deter tyranny. Either their trust in the government is so complete (or their sense of futility in the face of its armed might so great) that they don\u2019t believe private ownership of weapons is a meaningful check on lawless government action, or they believe that the cost of widespread civilian gun ownership is simply too high to pay in exchange for a theoretical check on state power. That\u2019s a debate worth having \u2014 in the context of a long-term progressive effort to repeal the Second Amendment. But for now, the Founders have settled question.\n\nAs Justice Scalia ably articulated in Heller, the Second Amendment was designed to protect what Blackstone called \u201cthe natural right of resistance and self-preservation.\u201d Without access to the weapons in common use in our time, the law-abiding citizen will grow increasingly \u2014 and intolerably \u2014 vulnerable to the lawless. Thus, to properly defend life and liberty, access to assault weapons and high-capacity magazines isn\u2019t a luxury; it\u2019s a   French is a senior writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, and a veteran of Operation Iraqi", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Robert Bryce", "body": "Micheal Shellenberger discusses climate and nuclear power at a TED Talks event in Banff, Canada, June 2016\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Bret  Shellenberger, a pro-nuclear Democrat, makes a longshot bid for California governor.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf California\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial race gets decided solely by money, Michael Shellenberger doesn\u2019t have a chance.\n\nThe latest campaign filings show that Shellenberger, an environmentalist from Berkeley, has about $37,000 in cash on hand. The frontrunner in the June 5 California primary, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, has more than $16.6 million in the bank. Former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is running second in the polls, has about $5.9 million.\n\nPolls show Shellenberger running fifth. When I talked to him on Monday, he said his fundraising efforts were picking up. \u201cI\u2019m up to $50,000 now,\u201d he bragged. Shellenberger, a lifelong Democrat, may be cash-poor, but his campaign represents a stark break with Democratic-party orthodoxy on energy policy, and that alone makes his candidacy important. Shellenberger is among the world\u2019s foremost advocates for nuclear energy, and one of the fiercest critics of renewables. While his pro-nuclear stance separates him from nearly every other Democratic politician, his willingness to call out fellow Democrats on energy policy has made him one of the most important voices on the left \u2014 particularly in California, where, by 2030, the state\u2019s utilities must obtain half of the electricity they sell from renewable sources.\n\nIn addition to advocating for nuclear energy in California and elsewhere, Shellenberger is calling for reforms to housing policy and pensions. He wants to triple the rate of new housing construction in the state. He also wants to address California\u2019s pension obligations, which now stand at some $366 billion. Name one other politician who dares utter the words \u201cpension reform.\u201d\n\nIn addition to advocating for nuclear energy in California and elsewhere, Shellenberger is calling for reforms to housing policy and pensions. \n\nAuthor and demographer Joel Kotkin has been writing about California politics for many years. He told me that Shellenberger is \u201cfocused on the biggest issue in California, which is the erosion of the middle class and lack of social mobility.\u201d Kotkin said that California has become a one-party state where policy decisions are dominated by \u201cthe urban land speculators who benefit from housing policy, greens, unions, and the oligarchs. Everyone else is a bit player.\u201d Shellenberger, says Kotkin, \u201cunderstands that this has become a rigged game. Make housing and energy more expensive, you hurt the middle and lower classes.\u201d\n\nBefore going further, I should disclose that I\u2019ve known, and admired, Shellenberger for about a decade. He has long been willing to tweak conventional wisdom, particularly when it comes to energy and climate issues. In 2004, along with Ted Nordhaus, he wrote an essay called \u201cThe Death of Environmentalism,\u201d which called out groups such as the Sierra Club for their focus on fundraising rather than policy results. The two went on to found the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based research think tank that consistently turns out top-notch analysis on issues ranging from agriculture to climate change. About two years ago, Shellenberger split with Nordhaus and launched a new organization, Environmental Progress, a Berkeley-based think tank that advocates for nuclear energy.\n\n\n\n\nLast month Environmental Progress released a report, co-authored by Shellenberger and energy analyst Mark Nelson, showing that between 2011 and 2017, California\u2019s electricity prices rose five times faster than rates in the rest of the country. Californians now pay about 60 percent more for their electricity than residents of other states. Shellenberger lays the blame for the state\u2019s soaring energy costs on the its governor during those years, Jerry Brown. High electricity prices are a form of regressive taxation on the poor, Shellenberger told me. In addition, he said, \u201cIt gives lie to the reality of renewables. It shows that high penetration of renewables result in high electricity costs not just in California, but all over the world.\u201d\n\nElectricity prices matter in California, which has the highest poverty rate in the country. In 2015 my colleague Jonathan Lesser, the president of Continental Economics, authored a study for the Manhattan Institute (where I\u2019m a senior fellow) that found that in 2012, nearly 1 million California households faced \u201cenergy expenditures exceeding 10 percent of household income. In certain California counties, the rate of energy poverty was as high as 15 percent of all households.\u201d\n\nDespite those facts, California politicians continue pushing for more renewables. On his campaign website, Newsom says that \u201con his first day in office,\u201d he will \u201cissue a directive putting California on a path to 100 percent renewable energy. It\u2019s achievable and it\u2019s  candidacy has received some favorable press. The San Francisco Chronicle recently called him \u201cthe kind of wonky, engaged person people should want in government, especially because he isn\u2019t afraid to take on his fellow progressives.\u201d Despite some positive squibs in the Bay Area press, Shellenberger may be excluded from the upcoming gubernatorial debates. Earlier this month, more than a dozen energy and environmental experts \u2014 including climate scientist James Hansen, Harvard professor Steven Pinker, Nobel Prize\u2013winning scientist Burton Richter, and University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. \u2014 sent a letter to the state\u2019s biggest newspapers asking that Shellenberger be included in those debates. \u201cWithout endorsing all of his policy positions, we believe his participation in the debates would be salutary for California\u2019s democracy.\u201d They continued: \u201cRelying on money raised as a deciding variable allows wealthy candidates, and those who have taken significant quantities of funding from special interests, to effectively buy their way into debates.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, Shellenberger admitted that he faces long odds in the gubernatorial race. But he said his decision to run was motivated by a desire to change the discussion and create a \u201cnew politics that is not about identity, or scarcity, it\u2019s about abundance, a unifying economic vision along with a moderate view on immigration.\u201d He went on: \u201cIdentity politics is the opiate of the California masses.\u201d Working-class people in the state \u201ccan\u2019t afford housing. We have the highest rates of poverty and homelessness and yet all people want to talk about is identity politics and immigration raids.\u201d\n\n\u2018Identity politics is the opiate of the California masses.\u2019 \u2014 Michael Shellenberger\n\n\n\nTo nearly any observer, it\u2019s apparent that Shellenberger has little chance of moving into the governor\u2019s mansion in Sacramento. The movie-star-handsome Newsom has both name recognition and virtually limitless money. Villaraigosa also has name recognition and will be popular among California\u2019s Hispanics, who account for 28 percent of the state\u2019s voting population.\n\nIn spite of the odds against him, Shellenberger\u2019s decision to run for office is a brave one. More than perhaps any other person on the left, Shellenberger has been adamant \u2014 some would even call him a zealot \u2014 in his advocacy for nuclear energy. His zeal has fueled significant victories, including in South Korea, where he nearly singlehandedly forced the government to have a citizen jury decide the future of the country\u2019s fleet of reactors. Last year, the jury decided in favor, which allowed continued construction of new reactors. South Korea is also a major exporter of nuclear technology. Later this year, the first of four reactors being built by Korea Electric Power Company will begin generating electricity in Abu Dhabi. When completed, the new Barakah nuclear plant will be the world\u2019s largest single nuclear project, with 5,600 megawatts of capacity.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, here in the U.S., the nuclear sector is reeling. Reactors in California, New York, Vermont, and other states are being prematurely shuttered. And as those reactors are shuttered, the juice they were producing is being replaced with electricity from natural-gas-fired generators, thereby increasing carbon dioxide emissions. Shellenberger has repeatedly underscored the hypocrisy of the Left and big environmental groups \u2014 the Sierra Club, 350.org, the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 for their efforts to shutter nuclear reactors while at the same time demanding drastic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nShellenberger has won plenty of detractors during his stint among the greens, and now in politics. To judge from the amount of money he\u2019s raised in his race for governor, it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t have many donors. But in his passion and willingness to speak the truth about electricity prices and the fashionable but expensive renewable-energy mandates that are driving those prices yet higher, he has become a consumer advocate as well.\n\nIf I lived in California, I\u2019d vote for him.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions (John  General Jeff Sessions issued a memo Wednesday instructing prosecutors to seek the death penalty for drug-related offenses whenever \u201cappropriate\u201d in order to bolster the federal government\u2019s efforts to combat the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cIn the face of all of this death, we cannot continue with business as usual,\u201d Sessions said in a memo sent to the country\u2019s U.S. Attorneys. \u201cDrug traffickers, transnational criminal organizations, and violent street gangs all contribute substantially to this scourge.

Rauner said he would cut the state income tax; after a long budget impasse, Republican and Democratic legislators overrode him to pass an income-tax hike. He said he would reform the pension system; he bailed it out under pressure, only to see the state\u2019s credit rating downgraded anyway. He signed a bill into law that weakens immigration enforcement. Rauner inherited a bad situation, but since taking office he has mostly made it worse.\n\nRauner\u2019s duplicity on the issue of abortion should be disqualifying to conservatives. \n\nFailing to pass the fiscal reforms he promised wouldn\u2019t alone justify his ouster in the primary. But Rauner\u2019s duplicity on the issue of abortion should be disqualifying to conservatives. During the election, Rauner \u2014 who is pro-choice, had once donated to Planned Parenthood, and whose wife is an abortion-rights activist \u2014 insisted that he was merely running to fix the state\u2019s coffers. He had, he said, \u201cno social agenda.\u201d When a bill to guarantee abortion as a right if the Supreme Court ever overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and provide public money for abortions through all nine months of a woman\u2019s pregnancy began circulating in the state legislature, Rauner said he would veto it. In September, he signed it into law. Pro-lifers who voted for Rauner put their trust in a man who is now forcing them to underwrite third-trimester abortions. His record is not just dreadful, but features a glaring lie.\n\nWhich is why Jeanne Ives, a state legislator, is a better alternative. Ives is an underdog and lacks Rauner\u2019s resources, but she is both a superior candidate to the governor and a solid politician in her own right. One recent poll has her just 7 points behind Rauner. For his part, the governor is running far behind the likely Democratic nominee \u2014 J. B. Pritzker, a cat\u2019s paw of Madigan \u2014 and has been unwilling to engage Ives in debate after an embarrassing showing in a joint appearance with her at the Chicago Tribune editorial office. Illinois Republicans should vote for Ives, the only conservative on the ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless, that is, they live in the state\u2019s third congressional district. There,\u00a0Democrat\u00a0Marie Newman is contesting the\u00a0House seat currently held by Dan Lipinski. The congressman is one of the last remaining pro-life Democrats to hold national office; for this, many Democrats think he has to go. Newman has earned the support of NARAL, Planned Parenthood, progressive luminaries such as Bernie Sanders, and two of Lipinski\u2019s fellow representatives. Enough is at stake for pro-life conservatives that those living in Illinois\u2019s third district should consider voting in the Democratic primaries instead, and cast a vote for Lipinski.\n\nThis primary might well be a symbolic Waterloo for pro-life Democrats. As the party has radicalized on abortion, Democrats who aren\u2019t comfortable with expansive abortion rights have either been cajoled into becoming so or outright replaced.

W. Cooke", "body": "David Hogg (CNN via  Parkland survivor has chosen to insert himself into an important national policy debate. We who disagree with his views on guns have a duty to speak up against them.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDavid Hogg, the telegenic 17-year-old who survived the shooting in Parkland, is not a crisis actor, an FBI plant, or the secret brainchild of a Soros-backed CNN plot. He\u2019s a political advocate engaged in a political debate, and he should be treated as such.\n\nSince the multiple murders at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Hogg has emerged as a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Pundit, whose status within the debate sits contingent upon his critics\u2019 willingness to push back.\u00a0The game being played with his testimony \u2014 by adults, not by Hogg \u2014 is as transparent as it is cynical. For ten days now, Hogg has been as permanent a fixture on the nation\u2019s TV screens as anyone bar the president. In each appearance, he has been invited without reply to share his ideas on our public policy. This he has done, emphatically. Among the proposals that Hogg has advanced are that the most popular rifle in America be federally prohibited; that the NRA be regarded as a haven for \u201cchild murderers\u201d; that Americans boycott Amazon, FedEx, and the state of Florida; and that Governor Rick Scott take responsibility for the failures of another elected official. In addition, Hogg has held a gun-control rally in New Jersey, slammed the president as a coward, criticized the federal response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico, made comments in support of funding for wind and solar power, taken a pre-emptive stand on Florida\u2019s imminent senatorial election, and suggested that, as a matter of general policy, cops cannot be expected to protect the citizenry if they believe they might be outgunned.\n\n\nFor this advocacy \u2014 and that\u2019s what it is \u2014 Hogg has been feted as a key leader within a \u201cmass movement\u201d that is determined to reform America; he has been praised for his attempt to \u201cforce change\u201d; he has been cast, including by himself, as a lion who refuses to back down; and, in some of the more cunning quarters of the left, he has been turned into a walking demonstration of the need to lower the voting age. At no point has anyone hosting him suggested that his relevance is limited to his capacity to describe his experience; rather, he\u00a0has in every instance been asked to join a public political fight \u2014 a fight, remember, that relates to nothing less foundational than the American Bill of Rights.\n\nAnd yet, when other Americans have seen fit to respond, Hogg\u2019s defenders have cast him upon the instant in diametrically opposite terms: As an irrelevance; as a mere \u201ckid\u201d; as a grieving ornament who sits well outside of our national conversation. This is extraordinary. How obvious, one wonders, do his champions intend to make it that they are using him to launder their views? And how clearly must they reveal that, despite their protestations to the contrary, they in fact have no respect whatsoever for his agency?\n\nFar from being \u201cmean,\u201d those contending with Hogg\u2019s pronouncements are accepting that he has an opinion, and that it is worth countering.\n\nIn the last few days, a handful of people have begun to push back against the substance of Hogg\u2019s views, and, in each case, have been met with the insistence that they should simply \u201cignore him\u201d as they would ignore a tenth-grade book report. Yesterday, I criticized Hogg for his routine incoherence, and immediately encountered a host of apologists who submitted that to engage with his remonstrations was \u201cmean\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d or an example of \u201cpunching down.\u201d The political incentives behind this tactic are obvious, but, substantively, the line has it utterly backward. It is condescending to ignore somebody arguing about politics, not to take them on. Far from being \u201cmean,\u201d those contending with Hogg\u2019s pronouncements are accepting that he has an opinion, and that it is worth countering \u2014 that is, they are doing exactly what Hogg\u2019s boosters have asked: treating him as the leader of a movement. Could it be, perhaps, that those boosters don\u2019t really mean what they are saying?\n\nOr could it be, perhaps, that Hogg has become a liability and that his champions now regret having thrust him into the limelight? One certainly couldn\u2019t blame them if they did, for Hogg is in fact a pretty poor advocate.\u00a0And why, pray, would he be otherwise? Suffering through a terrible crime gives a person no special insight into its causes, and Hogg has no special insight into its causes \u2014 or, frankly, into anything else. He\u2019s ignorant about basic civics; he\u2019s liable to backward reasoning; and, unable as he is to synthesize the evolving talking points upon which he relies, he has increasingly come across as slippery. In perhaps his most embarrassing moment thus far,\u00a0he shifted from arguing that the cop on duty who stood outside and did nothing while his classmates were slaughtered was correct to demur (not a great message, all told) to making the opposite case when he sensed an opportunity to lay the blame at the feet of Governor Scott \u2014 who, of course, had nothing to do with running the sheriff\u2019s department responsible for failing to save his classmates.\u00a0Demosthenes he is not.\n\n\n\n\nEven worse has been Hogg\u2019s attitude toward those who have had the temerity to disagree with him. Here, one suspects, he has been let down by those around him, the loudest of whom have evidently led him to believe that our complex political discourse can be circumvented by the blunt issuing of demands. The gun debate in America remains intractable, consisting not only of difficult legislative questions, but of elaborate constitutional, sociopolitical, historical, and criminal inquiries, too. For some reason, David Hogg has come to suppose that he can slice through this reality by issuing threats: Give me what I want, or I\u2019ll stop using FedEx; give me what I want, or I won\u2019t go back to school; give me what I want, or Florida\u2019s economy gets it. And, by the way, I\u2019m going to outlive you\u2026\n\n\nThis, suffice it to say, is not how republics work, and whether he likes it or not, Hogg lives in a republic. There is no Angry Victim clause in our constitutional text.\n\nDavid Hogg is an American, and he should speak as often and as loudly as he wishes. Moreover, if CNN believes that its present monomania will serve it well in the long run, it should continue to give him a platform. But there must be no inoculation for either party, nor must those who agree with the gun-control agenda attempt to shield its purveyors from rebuttal. Hogg did not choose to be involved in a school shooting; that, sadly, was beyond his control. But he has now chosen to play pundit on a topic of import to millions.

Or, as Lisa Page warned her paramour as early as February 2016, at the beginning of the campaign and well before the respective party nominees were even selected:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne more thing: she [Hillary Clinton] might be our next president. The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear. You think she\u2019s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?\n\n\n\n\tThe traditional way of looking at the developing scandals at the FBI and among holdover Obama appointees in the DOJ is that the bizarre atmospherics from candidate and President Trump have simply polarized everyone in Washington, and no one quite knows what is going on.\n\n\n\tAnother, more helpful, exegesis, however, is to understand that if we\u2019d seen a Hillary Clinton victory in November 2016, which was supposed to be a sure thing, there would now be no scandals at all.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat is, the current players probably broke laws and committed ethical violations not just because they were assured there would be no consequences but also because they thought they\u2019d be rewarded for their laxity.\n\n\n\tOn the eve of the election, the New York Times tracked various pollsters\u2019 models that had assured readers that Trump\u2019s odds of winning were respectively 15 percent, 8 percent, 2 percent, and less than 1 percent. Liberals howled heresy at fellow progressive poll guru Nate Silver shortly before the vote for daring to suggest that Trump had a 29 percent chance of winning the Electoral College.\n\n\n\tHillary Clinton herself was not worried about even the appearance of scandal caused by transmitting classified documents over a private home-brewed server, or enabling her husband to shake down foreign donations to their shared foundation, or destroying some 30,000 emails. Evidently, she instead reasoned that she was within months of becoming President Hillary Clinton and therefore, in her Clintonesque view of the presidency, exempt from all further criminal exposure. Would a President Clinton have allowed the FBI to reopen their strangely aborted Uranium One investigation; would the FBI have asked her whether she communicated over an unsecure server with the former president of the United States?\n\n\n\tFormer attorney general Loretta Lynch, in unethical fashion, met on an out-of-the-way Phoenix tarmac with Bill Clinton, in a likely effort to find the most efficacious ways to communicate that the ongoing email scandal and investigation would not harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. When caught, thanks to local-news reporters who happened to be at the airport, Lynch sort of, kind of recused herself. But, in fact, at some point she had ordered James Comey not to use the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d in his periodic press announcements about the FBI investigation.\n\n\n\tHow could Lynch in the middle of an election have been so silly as to allow even the appearance of impropriety? Answer: There would have been no impropriety had Hillary won \u2014 an assumption reflected in the Page-Strzok text trove when Page texted, about Lynch, \u201cShe knows no charges will be brought.\u201d In fact, after a Clinton victory, Lynch\u2019s obsequiousness in devising such a clandestine meeting with Bill Clinton may well have been rewarded: Clinton allies leaked to the New York Times that Clinton was considering keeping Lynch on as the attorney general.\n\n\n\tHow could former deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe assume an oversight role in the FBI probe of the Clinton email scandal when just months earlier his spouse had run for state office in Virginia and had received a huge $450,000 cash donation from Common Good VA, the political-action committee of long-time Clinton-intimate Terry McAuliffe?\n\n\n\tMost elite bureaucrats understood the Clinton way of doing business, in which loyalty, not legality, is what earned career advancement.\n\n\n\tAgain, the answer was clear. McCabe assumed that Clinton would easily win the election. Far from being a scandal, McCabe\u2019s not \u201cloaded for bear\u201d oversight of the investigation, in the world of beltway maneuvering, would have been a good argument for a promotion in the new Clinton administration. Most elite bureaucrats understood the Clinton way of doing business, in which loyalty, not legality, is what earned career advancement.\n\n\n\tSome have wondered why the recently demoted deputy DOJ official Bruce Ohr (who met with the architects of the Fusion GPS file after the election) would have been so stupid as to allow his spouse to work for Fusion \u2014 a de facto Clinton-funded purveyor of what turned out to be Russian fantasies, fibs, and obscenities?\n\n\n\tAgain, those are absolutely the wrong questions. Rather, why wouldn\u2019t a successful member of the Obama administrative aparat make the necessary ethical adjustments to further his career in another two-term progressive regnum? In other words, Ohr rightly assumed that empowering the Clinton-funded dossier would pay career dividends for such a power couple once Hillary was elected. Or, in desperation, the dossier would at least derail Trump after her defeat. Like other members of his byzantine caste, Ohr did everything right except bet on the wrong horse.\n\n\n\tWhat about the recently reassigned FBI lawyer Lisa Page and FBI top investigator Peter Strzok? Their reported 50,000-plus text messages (do the math per hour at work, and it is hard to believe that either had to time to do much of anything else) are providing a Procopian court history of the entire Fusion-Mueller investigation miasma.\n\n\n\tSo why did Strzok and Page believe that they could conduct without disclosure a romantic affair on FBI-government-owned cellphones? Why would they have been emboldened enough to cite a meeting with Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, in which they apparently discussed the dire consequences of an improbable Trump victory?\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s [probably Andrew McCabe, then deputy director of the FBI] office that there\u2019s no way Trump gets elected \u2014 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40.\n\n\n\n\tAnd why would the two believe that they could so candidly express their contempt for a presidential candidate supposedly then under a secret FBI investigation?\n\n\n\tOnce more, those are the wrong interrogatories. If we consider the mentality of government elite careerists, we see that the election-cycle machinations and later indiscretions of Strzok and Page were not liabilities at all. They were good investments. They signaled their loyalty to the incoming administration and that they were worthy of commendation and reward.\n\n\n\tHillary Clinton\u2019s sure victory certainly also explains the likely warping of the FISA courts by FBI careerists seeking to use a suspect dossier to surveille Trump associates \u2014 and the apparent requests by Samantha Power, Susan Rice, and others to read surveilled transcripts of Trump associates, unmask names, and leak them to pet reporters. Again, all these insiders were playing the careerist odds. What we view as reprehensible behavior, they at the time considered wise investments that would earn rewards with an ascendant President Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\tDid Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, or Debbie Wasserman Shultz worry about their fabrications, unethical behavior, and various conspiratorial efforts to ensure that Hillary Clinton would be exempt from criminal liability in her email shenanigans, and that she would win the Democratic nomination and general election? Not when their equally unethical and conspiratorial boss would appreciate her subordinate soul mates. For a deep-state careerist without ethical bearings, one of the advantages of a Clinton sure-thing presidency would be that the Clintons are known to reward loyalty more highly than morality.\n\n\n\tThen we arrive at the tragic farce of former FBI director James Comey. It is now easy to deplore Comey\u2019s unethical and unprofessional behavior: In all likelihood, he wrote an exoneration of Hillary Clinton before he even interviewed her and her top aides; then he lied about just that sequence while he was under oath and virtue-signaling before Congress; he feigned concern about Clinton\u2019s felonious behavior but used linguistic gymnastics in his report to ensure his condemnation would be merely rhetorical and without legal consequences.\n\n\n\tHad Hillary won, as she was supposed to, Comey would probably have been mildly chastised for his herky-jerky press conferences, but ultimately praised for making sure the email scandal didn\u2019t derail her. Comey\u2019s later implosion, recall, occurred only after the improbable election of Donald Trump, as he desperately reversed course a fourth time and tried to ingratiate himself with Trump while hedging his bets by winking and nodding at the ongoing, unraveling fantasy of the Steele dossier.\n\n\n\tAnd Barack Obama? We now know that he himself used an alias to communicate at least 20 times with Hillary on her private, non-secure gmail account. But Obama lied on national TV, saying he learned of Hillary\u2019s illegal server only when the rest of the nation did, by reading the news. Would he have dared to lie so publicly if he\u2019d assumed that Trump\u2019s presidency was imminent? Would he ever have allowed his subordinates to use the dossier to obtain FISA warrants and pass around and unmask the resulting surveillance transcripts if he\u2019d seen Trump as the likely winner and a potentially angered president with powers to reinvestigate all these illegal acts?\n\n\n\tWe sometimes forget that Barack Obama, not candidate Hillary Clinton, was president when the FBI conducted the lax investigation of the email scandal, when Loretta Lynch outsourced her prosecutorial prerogatives to James Comey, when the FBI trafficked with the Clinton-funded Fusion GPS dossier, when various DOJ and FBI lawyers requested FISA-approved surveillance largely on the basis of a fraudulent document, and when administration officials unmasked and leaked the names of American citizens.\n\n\n\tHad Hillary Clinton polled ten points behind Donald Trump in early 2016, we\u2019d have none of these scandals \u2014 not because those involved were moral actors (none were), but because Hillary would have been considered yesterday\u2019s damaged goods and not worth any extra-legal exposure taken on her behalf.\n\n\n\tSimilarly, if the clear front-runner Hillary Clinton had won the election, we\u2019d now have no scandals. Again, the reason is not that she and her careerist enablers did not engage in scandalous behavior, but that such foul play would have been recalibrated as rewardable fealty and absorbed into the folds of the progressive deep state.\n\n\n\tThe only mystery in these sordid scandals is how a president Hillary Clinton would have rewarded her various appendages. In short, how would a President Clinton have calibrated the many rewards for any-means-necessary help? Would Lynch\u2019s tarmac idea have trumped Comey\u2019s phony investigation? Would Glen Simpson now be White House press secretary, James Comey Clinton\u2019s CIA director; would Andrew McCabe be Comey\u2019s replacement at the FBI?\n\n\n\tWhat now appears clearly unethical and probably illegal would have passed as normal in a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton progressive continuum.\n\n\n\tIn reductionist terms, every single scandal that has so far surfaced at the FBI and DOJ share a common catalyst. What now appears clearly unethical and probably illegal would have passed as normal in a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton progressive continuum.\n\n\n\tA final paradox: Why did so many federal officials and officeholders act so unethically and likely illegally when they were convinced of a Clinton landslide? Why the overkill?\n\n\n\tThe answer to that paradox lies in human nature and can be explored through the hubris and nemesis of Greek tragedy \u2014 or the 1972 petty burgling of a Watergate complex apartment when Richard Nixon really was on his way to a landslide victory.\n\n\n\tNeedlessly weaponizing the Obama FBI and the DOJ was akin to Hillary Clinton\u2019s insanely campaigning in the last days of the 2016 campaign in red-state Arizona, the supposed \u201ccherry atop a pleasing electoral map.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn short, such hubris was not just what Peter Strzok in August 2016 termed an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against an unlikely Trump victory. Instead, the Clinton and Obama officials believed that it was within the administrative state\u2019s grasp and their perceived political interest not just to beat but to destroy and humiliate Donald Trump \u2014 and by extension all the distasteful deplorables and irredeemables he supposedly had galvanized.\n\n\n\t\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won, released in October from Basic Books.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew C.

The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat begins his long awaited memo \u2014 the minority response to the Nunes memo that was penned by staffers of the committee\u2019s Republican majority \u2014 by slamming Chairman Devin Nunes\u2019s unconscionable \u201crisk of public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose.\u201d The Schiff memo, which has been delayed for weeks because the FBI objected to its gratuitous effort to publicize highly classified intelligence, including methods and sources, then proceeds to tell its tale through what appear to be scores of blacked-out redactions of information Schiff pushed to expose.\n\nHeavy Reliance on Steele Dossier Confirmed\n\nThe FBI and the Justice Department heavily relied on the Steele dossier\u2019s uncorroborated allegations. You know this is true because, notwithstanding the claim that \u201conly narrow use\u201d was made \u201cof information from Steele\u2019s sources,\u201d the Democrats end up acknowledging that \u201conly narrow use\u201d actually means significant use \u2014 as in, the dossier was the sine qua non of the warrant application. The memo concedes that the FISA warrant application relied on allegations by Steele\u2019s anonymous Russian hearsay sources that:\n\nPage met separately while in Russia with Igor Sechin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin and executive chairman of Roseneft, Russia\u2019s state-owned oil company, and Igor Divyekin, a senior Kremlin official. Sechin allegedly discussed the prospect of future U.S.-Russia energy cooperation and \u201can associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia.\u201d Divyekin allegedly disclosed to Page that the Kremlin possessed compromising information on Clinton (\u201ckompromat\u201d) and noted the possibility of its being released to Candidate #1\u2019s [i.e., Donald Trump\u2019s] campaign. . . . This closely tracks what other Russian contacts were informing another Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos.\n\nThis passage puts the lie to two of the main Democratic talking points:\n\n1) This was obviously the most critical allegation against Page. The Democrats attempt to make much of Page\u2019s trip to Moscow in July 2016, but the uncorroborated Sechin and Divyekin meetings, which Page credibly denies, are the aspect of the Moscow trip that suggested a nefarious Trump-Russia conspiracy. That\u2019s what the investigation was about. Far from clandestine, the rest of Page\u2019s trip was well publicized and apparently anodyne. And saliently \u2014 for reasons we\u2019ll get to in due course \u2014 Page was clearly prepared to talk to the FBI about the trip if the Bureau wanted to know what he was up to.\n\nIt is the Steele dossier that alleges Page was engaged in arguably criminal activity. The Democrats point to nothing else that does.\n\nMoreover, because Page was an American citizen, FISA law required that the FBI and the DOJ show not only that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power (Russia), but also that his \u201cclandestine\u201d activities on behalf of Russia were a likely violation of federal criminal law. (See FISA, Section 1801(b)(2)(A) through (E), Title 50, U.S. Code.) It is the Steele dossier that alleges Page was engaged in arguably criminal activity. The Democrats point to nothing else that does.\n\n2) Democrats implausibly insist that what \u201claunched\u201d the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation was not Steele\u2019s allegations but intelligence from Australia about George Papadopoulos\u2019s contact with what Democrats elusively describe as \u201cindividuals linked to Russia.\u201d As we learned when Papadopoulos pled guilty, though, it is anything but clear that these \u201cindividuals linked to Russia\u201d had much in the way of links to Putin\u2019s regime: London-based academic Joseph Misfud, who is from Malta and apparently does not speak Russian; an unidentified woman who falsely pretended to be Putin\u2019s niece; and Ivan Timofeev, a program director at a Russian government-funded think-tank.\n\nEven if we assume for argument\u2019s sake that these characters had solid regime connections \u2014 rather than that they were boasting to impress the credulous young Papadopoulos \u2014 they were patently not in the same league as Sechin, a Putin crony, and Divyekin, a highly placed regime official. And that, manifestly, is how the FBI and the DOJ saw the matter: They sought a FISA warrant on Page, not Papadopoulos. And, as the above-excerpted passage shows, they highlighted the Steele dossier\u2019s sensational allegations about Page and then feebly tried to corroborate those allegations with some Papadopoulos information, not the other way around. (More on that when we get to Schiff\u2019s notion of \u201ccorroboration.\u201d)\n\nConcealing the Dossier\u2019s Clinton-Campaign Origins\n\nAnother major takeaway from the Schiff memo is that the FBI and the DOJ withheld from the FISA court the fact that Steele\u2019s work was a project of the Clinton campaign. Naturally, the reader must ferret this admission out of a couple of dense paragraphs, in which Democrats risibly claim that the \u201cDOJ was transparent with the Court about Steele\u2019s sourcing.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019s this for transparency? The FISA warrant application says that Steele, referred to as \u201cSource #1,\u201d was \u201capproached by\u201d Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, referred to as \u201can identified U.S. person,\u201d who\n\nindicated to Source #1 that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. Person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s [i.e., Trump\u2019s] ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. Person and Source #1 have a longstanding business relationship.) The identified U.S. Person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign. [Emphasis in Schiff memo, p. 5]\n\nThe first thing to notice here is the epistemological contortions by which the DOJ rationalized concealing that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid for Steele\u2019s reporting. They ooze consciousness of guilt. If you have to go through these kinds of mental gymnastics to avoid disclosing something, it\u2019s because you know that being \u201ctransparent\u201d demands disclosing it.\n\nNext, Schiff \u2014 again, hilariously enough to make you wonder if it\u2019s done tongue-in-cheek \u2014 accuses Nunes of hypocrisy for condemning the omission of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name after having rebuked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cunmasking\u201d of American names. Of course, the two things have nothing to do with each other.\n\n\u201cUnmasking\u201d refers to the revelation of American identities in intelligence reports. These are Americans who, though not targeted as foreign agents, are incidentally intercepted in surveillance. In marked contrast, we are talking here about a FISA warrant application, not an intelligence report. In a warrant application, it is the DOJ\u2019s honorable practice, and the judiciary\u2019s expectation, that the court must be informed about the material biases of the sources of the factual allegations that the DOJ claims amount to probable cause.\n\nAs the Democrats\u2019 own excerpt from the FISA application illustrates, unmasking has nothing to do with it, because there is no need to use names at all: Note that Simpson is referred to as \u201can identified U.S. person\u201d; Perkins-Coie is referred to as \u201ca U.S.-based law firm.\u201d The dispute here is not about the failure to use the words \u201cHillary Clinton.\u201d They could have referred to \u201cCandidate #2.\u201d To state that \u201cCandidate #2\u201d had commissioned Steele\u2019s research would have been just as easy and every bit as appropriate as the DOJ\u2019s reference to a \u201cCandidate #1,\u201d who might have \u201cties to Russia.\u201d Had DOJ done the former, it would not have \u201cunmasked\u201d Hillary Clinton any more than Donald Trump was unmasked by DOJ\u2019s description of him as \u201cCandidate #1\u201d; but it would have been being \u201ctransparent\u201d with the FISA court. By omitting any reference to Clinton, the DOJ was being the opposite of transparent.\n\nTwo other things to notice here.\n\n1) The DOJ\u2019s application asserted: \u201cThe identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d There is only one reason to include such a statement: The DOJ well understood that the implied biases in the process of compiling the dossier\u2019s allegations, including Steele\u2019s implied biases, were material to the FISA court\u2019s evaluation. A prosecutor does not get to tell a judge reasons that a source\u2019s reports should be thought free of bias while leaving out why they should not be thought free of bias. If you know it\u2019s necessary to disclose that \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d Simpson was being paid by \u201ca U.S.-based law firm\u201d (Perkins-Coie), then it is at least equally necessary to disclose that, in turn, the law firm was being paid by its clients: the Clinton campaign and the DNC. To tell half the story is patently misleading.\n\n2) Schiff comically highlights this DOJ assertion as if it were his home run, when it is in fact damning: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d This is the vague reference that Democrats and Trump critics laughably say was adequate disclosure of the dossier\u2019s political motivation. But why would the FBI \u201cspeculate\u201d that a political motive was \u201clikely\u201d involved when, in reality, the FBI well knew that a very specific political motive was precisely involved?\n\nThere was no reason for supposition here. If the FBI had transparently disclosed that the dossier was a product of the Clinton campaign \u2014 oh, sorry, didn\u2019t mean to unmask; if the FBI had transparently disclosed that the dossier was a product of \u201cCandidate #2\u2019s\u201d campaign \u2014 then the court would have been informed about the apodictic certainty that the people behind the dossier were trying to discredit the campaign of Candidate #2\u2019s opponent. It is disingenuous to tell a judge that something is \u201clikely\u201d when, in fact, it is beyond any doubt.\n\nThe Issue Is the Credibility of Steele\u2019s Informants, Not of Steele Himself\n\nWhen the Justice Department seeks a warrant from a court, the credibility that matters is not that of the agent who has assembled the information from the informants; it is that of the informants who observe the fact matters that are claimed to be a basis for finding probable cause. That is, what mattered was the credibility of Steele\u2019s anonymous Russian sources, not the credibility of Steele himself. By dwelling on the countless reasons why Schiff is wrong about the adequacy of the disclosure of Steele\u2019s biases, I am falling into the trap I have warned against (here, and in section C here).\n\nThe FBI and the DOJ relied vicariously on Steele\u2019s credibility, as a substitute for their failure to corroborate his informants\u2019 information. It was improper to do this.\n\nTo be clear, the only reason Steele\u2019s own biases have any pertinence is that the FBI and the DOJ relied vicariously on Steele\u2019s credibility, as a substitute for their failure to corroborate his informants\u2019 information. It was improper to do this. Yet even if a prosecutor goes down a certain road wrongly, the duty to be candid with the tribunal still applies. The prosecutor is obliged to tell the whole story about potential bias, not a skewed version.\n\nSchiff\u2019s memo struggles mightily, and futilely, to demonstrate that Steele\u2019s credibility issues were sufficiently disclosed. But that is a side issue. The question is whether Steele\u2019s informants were credible. To the limited extent that committee Democrats grapple with this problem, they tell us that, after the first FISA application, the FBI and the DOJ provided additional information that corroborated Steele\u2019s informants. There are four problems with this:\n\n1) It would not justify using uncorroborated allegations in the first warrant.\n\n2) The supposedly corroborative information is blacked out; while that may be an appropriate protection of sensitive intelligence, we are still left having to take Schiff\u2019s word for it.\n\n3) Taking Schiff\u2019s word for it would be unwise given his memo\u2019s warped conception of \u201ccorroboration.\u201d Recall the Schiff memo passage excerpted in the first section above. In the last part, the Democrats argue that the dossier claim that Page met with Kremlin official Divyekin was somehow corroborated because it \u201cclosely tracked\u201d what Papadopoulos was hearing from his dubious \u201cRussian contacts.\u201d But the supposed \u201cRussian contacts\u201d were telling Papadopoulos that the Kremlin had thousands of Clinton-related emails. That did nothing to confirm Steele\u2019s claim that Page had met with Divyekin, a top regime official; nor did it corroborate that the \u201ckompromat\u201d Divyekin referred to was the same thing as the emails that Papadopoulos\u2019s \u201cRussian contacts\u201d were talking about. (Of course, it may well be that Page never actually met with Divyekin and that Papadopoulos\u2019s sources were wrong about emails; if so, committee Democrats are in the strange position of contending that the non-existent can corroborate the non-existent.)\n\n4) Most significantly, Democrats seem not to grasp that the flaw here lies not merely in the failure to corroborate the information from Steele\u2019s sources. There appears not even to be corroboration that these sources existed \u2014 i.e., that they are real people whose claims are accurately reported. Indeed, it is worse than that. Even if we stipulate for argument\u2019s sake that Steele\u2019s anonymous Russian informants are authentic, they are generally hearsay witnesses, one or more steps removed from the events they relate. The real question, then, is whether the informants\u2019 sources are real, identifiable, reliable informants. Based on what has been disclosed, we must assume that the FBI did not know. That is why the DOJ inappropriately tried to rely on Steele\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe FBI Interviews of Carter Page\n\nIn the course of providing a skewed portrait of Carter Page\u2019s background, the Schiff memo unintentionally highlights another deep flaw in the warrant application.\n\nThe memo limns Page as a master spy with disturbing \u201cconnections to Russian Government and Intelligence Officials\u201d \u2014 which will be amusing to anyone who has seen an interview of Page, now a ubiquitous oddball media presence. What Democrats conveniently omit is that (a) Page cooperated with the FBI and Justice Department in a prior investigation in which his information was used to prosecute Russian spies; (b) the Russian spies explicitly regarded him as an \u201cidiot\u201d (and they had not even seen him on cable TV); and (c) since Russian operatives can be as diabolical and sophisticated as the Democrats suggest, they would have known that Page did not have the kind of relationship with Trump that would have made Page a suitable conduit for proposing traitorous deals \u2014 and as we\u2019ve seen, the Russians had far better ways to approach Trump (e.g., the Kremlin-connected oligarch Aras Agalarov, who had a personal relationship with Trump and orchestrated the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting).\n\nThe memo does note that \u201cthe FBI also interviewed Page multiple times about his Russian intelligence contacts.\u201d Apparently, these interviews stretch back to 2013. The memo also lets slip that there was at least one more interview with Page in March 2016, before the counterintelligence investigation began. We must assume that Page was a truthful informant since his information was used in a prosecution against Russian spies and Page himself has never been accused of lying to the FBI.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance? It is a requirement of FISA law.\n\nSo . . . here\u2019s the question: When Steele brought the FBI his unverified allegations that Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin, why didn\u2019t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance? Lest you wonder, this is not an instance of me second-guessing the Bureau with an investigative plan I think would have been better. It is a requirement of FISA law.\n\nWhen the FBI and DOJ apply for a FISA warrant, they must convince the court that surveillance \u2014 a highly intrusive tactic by which the government monitors all of an American citizen\u2019s electronic communications \u2014 is necessary because the foreign-intelligence information the government seeks \u201ccannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques.\u201d (See FISA, Section 1804(a)(6)(C) of Title 50, U.S. Code.) Normal investigative techniques include interviewing the subject. There are, of course, situations in which such alternative investigative techniques will inevitably fail \u2014 a mafia don or a jihadist is not likely to sit down with FBI agents and tell them everything he knows. But Carter Page was not only likely to do so, he had a documented history of providing information to the FBI.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see what the DOJ told the FISA court about why normal investigative techniques would not suffice to pry information from Page. They certainly seem to work fine for Fox News.\n\nThe Page Surveillance Enabled Interception of Past Communications\n\nThe Schiff memo repeats the canard that the Obama administration was not really spying on the Trump campaign because the DOJ waited until the Trump campaign cut ties with Page before seeking a surveillance warrant. What Democrats fail to mention is that the surveillance enabled the FBI to intercept not only his forward-going communications but also any stored emails and texts he might have had. Clearly, they were hoping to find a motherlode of campaign communications. Remember, Page was merely the vehicle for surveillance; the objective was to probe Trump ties to Russia.\n\nThe \u201cClosely Held Investigative Team\u201d\n\nSchiff is determined to run with the implausible story that George Papadopoulos is the face that launched a thousand ships \u2014 that Papadopoulos\u2019s boozy conversation with an Australian diplomat, not the Steele dossier\u2019s allegations of a traitorous Trump-Russia conspiracy, was the true impetus for the counterintelligence investigation. Schiff maintains that the FBI was therefore not even paying attention to Steele until long after the Papadopoulos information came in. That is, even though the Bureau started receiving Steele\u2019s reports in July 2016, they did not make their way to the FBI\u2019s \u201cclosely held investigative team\u201d for some seven weeks \u2014 i.e., until mid September. This team is described elsewhere (p. 3) in the Schiff memo as \u201cthe counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters.\u201d Of course, by mid September, Steele and Fusion GPS were leaking Steele\u2019s allegations to many favored reporters, so perhaps Schiff is saying that the \u201cclosely held investigative team\u201d read about them in the news.\n\nIt is, in any event, a frivolous point. The fact that the Bureau administratively opened a case on Papadopoulos does not mean that much of anything was done on it. As we know, investigators did not even interview Papadopoulos until late January 2017, after Trump had already taken office and about six months after they received the info about Papadopoulos. By contrast, once the \u201cclosely held investigative team\u201d got the Steele dossier, the FBI and the DOJ were at the FISA court\u2019s doorstep tout de suite. And to repeat, they got a surveillance warrant for Page, not Papadopoulos.\n\nMeantime, Schiff needs to make up his mind about the significance of the \u201cclosely held investigative team.\u201d Near the end of the memo, he raps Nunes for pointing to the anti-Trump animus evident in the texts of FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. These Bureau officials are not important, Schiff says, because neither of them was the \u201caffiant\u201d on any of the FISA warrant applications.\n\nBut wait: Stzok and Page were part of the \u201cclosely held investigative team,\u201d which Schiff has only just told us are the only FBI personnel who matter. Anyway, though he is wont to remind us every few minutes that he is a former prosecutor, Schiff seems unfamiliar with how investigations work. The affiant on a warrant application aggregates the information of many agents and informants. A warrant is a team effort, which I had thought was why Schiff stressed the \u201cclosely held investigative team.\u201d And Page was a lawyer, not an agent, so though she would presumably not be the affiant on a warrant application, she may well have participated in the FBI\u2019s legal review of the applications, which occurs both in-house and in consultation with Justice Department lawyers.\n\nFour Different FISA-Court Judges\n\nSchiff makes much of the fact that the four FISA warrants (the original authorization and three renewals, at 90-day intervals) were signed by four different FISA-court judges \u2014 all apparently appointed to the federal district courts by Republican presidents. This hardly commends the validity of the warrants.\n\nIn criminal surveillance orders, for example, it is common for prosecutors to bring renewal applications back to the same judge who authorized the original surveillance. That judge presumably knows the case better and is thus in a superior position to detect any irregularities. If FISA surveillance works differently, that would be another reason for critics to fear that the court is merely a rubber stamp. (For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t share the view that the FISA court merely rubber-stamps applications. The process is a give-and-take one, and though the FISA court rarely rejects warrants, the DOJ does modify many warrants in response to the court\u2019s concerns. Moreover, since surveillance of foreign threats to the U.S. is an executive responsibility, the court should approve them unless it appears that the FBI and the DOJ are abusing the process).\n\nIn any event, the issue here is failure to disclose information to the court. If a judge was not made aware of material facts, the judge\u2019s authorization of a warrant does not validate the derelict application. (That said, it is difficult to understand why judges would not be troubled by the lack of corroboration of Steele\u2019s unidentified Russian hearsay informants.)\n\nThe Basis for Steele\u2019s Termination as an FBI Informant\n\nThe FISA judges were not told that Steele had lied to the FBI about contacts with the press.\n\nThe Schiff memo is disingenuous in claiming that the warrant applications were forthright with the FISA court about the reasons for Steele\u2019s termination as an FBI source. The Grassley-Graham memo explains (as I\u2019ve previously detailed) that the court was apparently told that Steele was dismissed over contacts with the press. The FISA judges were not told that Steele had lied to the FBI about contacts with the press.\n\nPapadopoulos and the Clinton Emails\n\nCommittee Democrats misrepresent a significant fact derived from Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s statement of Papadopoulos\u2019s offense (filed when the latter pled guilty). The Schiff memo states\n\nWe would later learn in Papadopoulos\u2019s plea that the information the Russians could assist by anonymously releasing were thousands of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nWhat we actually learned in Papadopoulos\u2019s plea was that his dubious Russian sources had heard that the Kremlin had the emails. There is no indication that the Kremlin in fact had the emails; the Kremlin apparently provided no emails to Papadopoulos (or anyone else in Trump\u2019s orbit); and there is no evidence that the \u201cRussia-linked\u201d people to whom Papadopoulos spoke knew what they were talking about \u2014 it is at least as plausible that they were playing Papadopoulos.\n\nThe Use of a Media Report to \u2018Corroborate\u2019 Steele\n\nCommittee Democrats make a highly unlikely claim about the DOJ\u2019s controversial use in the FISA warrant applications of a Yahoo News report by journalist Michael Isikoff. The claim appears to be contradicted by both the aforementioned Grassley-Graham memo and by the Isikoff article itself.\n\nSpecifically, the Schiff memo denies the Republican claim that the DOJ tried to corroborate Steele\u2019s allegations by relying on Isikoff\u2019s media story, dated September 23, 2016. Rather, Schiff says the Isikoff report was mentioned for a righteous purpose: \u201cto inform the Court of Page\u2019s public denial of his suspected meetings in Russia\u201d (with Sechin and Divyekin). The memo further claims that the FISA application cited another news story along these lines, but that the Nunes memo withheld this detail.\n\nSchiff\u2019s version has two problems.\n\n1) While it is true (as noted above) that Page denies meeting Sechin and Divyekin, it is not true that this denial is reported in Isikoff\u2019s article. Instead, Isikoff reported that Page \u201cdeclined repeated requests to comment for this story.\u201d He added that, while in Moscow in July 2016, \u201cPage declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip\u201d \u2014 not that he denied doing so. Isikoff, who is a superb reporter, also took pains to explain that it was merely \u201calleged\u201d that Page had met with high-ranking Russians \u2014 that is, the meetings had not been confirmed. But there is nothing in Isikoff\u2019s article about Page himself denying that they occurred. It is therefore hard to understand why the DOJ would, as Schiff suggests, include the article as a way of informing the court that Page denied the meetings.\n\n2) Schiff\u2019s version is contradicted by the Grassley-Graham memo, which quotes the FISA warrant application. Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham recount (memo, p. 3) that \u201cthe FISA applications note the existence of\u201d Isikoff\u2019s article, \u201cwhich in particular contained some of the same dossier information about Mr. Page compiled by Mr. Steele and on which the FBI relied in its application.\u201d The senators then quote from the FISA application, which said:\n\nGiven that the information contained in the September 23rd news article generally matches the information about Page that [Steele] discovered during his/her research, [two lines redacted.] The FBI does not believe that [Steele] directly provided this information to the press.\u201d [Emphasis added, brackets in original.]\n\nThe senators\u2019 memo strongly suggests that Nunes is right and Schiff is wrong: The Isikoff article was used precisely because, to quote the DOJ again, it \u201cgenerally matched\u201d Steele\u2019s allegations about Page. In effect, the DOJ was using Steele to corroborate Steele.\n\nSchiff\u2019s Defense of Bruce Ohr\n\nSchiff\u2019s attack on the Nunes memo for referring to top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr\u2019s connections with Steele is utterly unpersuasive \u2014 a \u201cHow dare you\u201d argument that rests on Schiff\u2019s description of Ohr as \u201ca well-respected career professional.\u201d\n\nRepublicans did not attack Ohr personally or belittle his law-enforcement credentials. To the contrary, the Nunes memo argued that because Ohr was a high-ranking official \u2014 the right-hand of Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was effectively running DOJ \u2014 it should have been disclosed to the court that (a) Ohr was meeting with Steele about the anti-Trump project; (b) Steele had told Ohr in September (i.e., before the first FISA application) that he \u201cwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president\u201d; and (c) Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie Ohr, was a Russia expert at Fusion who was collaborating with Steele on the dossier. If Schiff thinks that is unreasonable, I expect most people will disagree.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the Schiff memo does more to harm than advance the Democrats\u2019 defense of the Obama administration and the use of the FISA process by the FBI and the DOJ.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rich Lowry", "body": "Gina Haspel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CIA/Handout via  Haspel\u2019s record should be an asset, not a roadblock, to her appointment \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPresident Donald Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director is about to experience a good Borking.\n\nNo one doubts her professionalism, and she\u2019s been endorsed by Obama intelligence officials. Yet Gina Haspel\u2019s long career at the agency, including extensive work undercover in the field, is getting blotted out by her reported involvement in the CIA\u2019s black-site interrogation program, which has become a warrant to say anything about her.\n\nHer critics assert she should be in jail, and the New York Times editorial page wrote about her nomination under the headline \u201cHaving a Torturer Lead the C.I.A.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in demagogic attacks on anyone associated with our national-security apparatus, Senator Rand Paul calls Haspel \u201cthe head cheerleader for waterboarding,\u201d and claims she mocked a detainee for his drooling. The only problem is that this anecdote comes from a book by a contractor who worked with the CIA, James Mitchell, and it describes a man, not a woman, making the comment.\n\nTheir factual accuracy aside, the attacks on Haspel are ahistorical in that they ignore the context of the CIA program, and unfair insofar as they portray her as a remorselessly cruel prime mover behind it.\n\nThe interrogation program began when al-Qaida operative Abu Zubaydah was captured in March 2002. At the time, we believed another attack was imminent, and preventing it had an urgency fueled by raw memories of an event that was literally yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nIn light of this pervasive feeling, it\u2019s unsurprising that a broad political consensus supported doing what was necessary to get information from captured al-Qaida leaders. The CIA repeatedly briefed select congressional leaders, especially the top Republicans and Democrats on the intelligence committees. By all accounts, the program met with assent.\n\nThe interrogation program wasn\u2019t a rogue operation. It was approved at the highest level of the U.S. government, and the CIA sought, and got, explicit legal approval from the Department of Justice.\n\nThe interrogation program wasn\u2019t a rogue operation. It was approved at the highest level of the U.S. government, and the CIA sought, and got, explicit legal approval from the Department of Justice.\n\nHaspel is connected in the press to the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, although the CIA hasn\u2019t confirmed her participation in the oversight of any particular detainee and insists much of the reporting about her work in this period is erroneous.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider Zubaydah\u2019s case. He was not a detainee who had nothing to tell us, as he is often portrayed by critics of the CIA. Shortly after his capture, he identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of 9/11. CIA documents say that \u201cAbu Zubaydah provided information on al-Qa\u2019ida activities, plans, capabilities, and relationships,\u201d as well as information on \u201cits leadership structure, including personalities, decision-making processes, training and tactics.\u201d\n\nThe enhanced interrogations were brutal. Zubaydah was struck, placed in stress positions, confined in small boxes and repeatedly waterboarded. During one session, he became unresponsive. By any standard, this was extreme and right up to the legal line.\n\nThe CIA didn\u2019t learn of any planned attack in the U.S.; it did become confident that Zubaydah wasn\u2019t holding back anything about one. From his capture to his transfer to the Department of Defense on September 5, 2006, information from him produced 766 intelligence reports.\n\nIn the cold light of day, we would have handled all of this differently. The Bush administration shouldn\u2019t have been as aggressive in its legal interpretations. We should have realized that we had more time to play with, and that the program itself would become a black mark on our reputation overseas and such a domestic flashpoint that we would basically lose all ability to interrogate detainees (droning became the preferred alternative).\n\nBut this was a national failing, and at a time when we understandably believed we were in a race to prevent another atrocity on our shores. To punish Gina Haspel more than\u00a015 years later\u00a0for doing what her country asked her to do, and in response to what she was told were lawful orders, would be a travesty and a disgrace.\n\nBut so were the confirmation hearings of Robert Bork.\n\n\u00a9 2018 by King Features   Lowry is the editor of National Review.

Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon devoted considerable resources to promoting Trumpist candidates who supposedly shared President Trump\u2019s worldview and parroted his rhetoric, including anti-globalism, economic nationalism, and crude insults of \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians. Those schemes largely came to naught.\n\n\nThe intellectual effort to craft or divine a coherent Trumpist ideology didn\u2019t fare much better. Just over a year ago, Julius Krein launched a new journal called American Affairs to \u201cgive the Trump movement some intellectual heft,\u201d as Politico put it. As I wrote at the time, American Affairs\u2019 dilemma was that by associating itself with Trump, it would be forced to either defend the incoherence of his behavior or break with him to defend its own consistency.\n\nSix months later, after the debacle of Trump\u2019s response to the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., Krein recanted his support for the president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left, there\u2019s an enormous investment in the idea that Trump isn\u2019t a break with conservatism but the apotheosis of it. This is a defensible, or at least understandable, claim if you believe conservatism has always been an intellectually vacuous bundle of racial and cultural resentments. But if that were the case, Commentary magazine\u2019s Noah Rothman recently noted, you would not see so many mainstream and consistent conservatives objecting to Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nIntellectuals and ideologically committed journalists on the left and right have a natural tendency to see events through the prism of ideas. Trump presents an insurmountable challenge to such approaches because, by his own admission, he doesn\u2019t consult any serious and coherent body of ideas for his decisions. He trusts his instincts.\n\nTrump has said countless times that he thinks his gut is a better guide than the brains of his advisers. He routinely argues that the presidents and policymakers who came before him were all fools and weaklings. That\u2019s narcissism, not ideology, talking.\n\nEven the \u201cideas\u201d that he has championed consistently \u2014 despite countervailing evidence and expertise \u2014 are grounded not in arguments but in instincts. He dislikes regulations because, as a businessman, they got in his way. He dislikes trade because he has a childish, narrow understanding of what \u201cwinning\u201d means. Foreigners are ripping us off. Other countries are laughing at us. He doesn\u2019t actually care about, let alone understand, the arguments suggesting that protectionism can work. Indeed, he reportedly issued his recent diktat on steel tariffs in a fit of pique over negative media coverage and the investigation into Russian election interference. His administration was wholly unprepared for the announcement.\n\nNews emanating from the White House is always more understandable once you accept that Trumpist policy is downstream of Trump\u2019s personality.\n\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s attack on his attorney general\u2019s conduct as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d makes no political, legal, or ideological sense, but it is utterly predictable as an expression of Trump\u2019s view that loyalty to Trump should trump everything else.\n\nLikewise, his blather about skipping due process to \u201ctake the guns\u201d was politically bizarre but perfectly consistent with his poor impulse control and well-established tendency to tell people in the room with him what they want to hear.\n\nAnd, of course, his decision to promote and protect his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is purely psychological. Giving Kushner the responsibility to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for all time seems like the premise of a sitcom \u2014 yet is wholly congruent with Trump\u2019s management style.\n\nStill, many of Trump\u2019s biggest fans stick by him, mirroring Trump\u2019s mode of thinking and discovering ever more extravagant ways to explain or rationalize the president\u2019s behavior. (Krein\u2019s abandonment of Trump was an exception to the rule.) When Trump attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University tweeted his support, floating the idea that Sessions was an anti-Trump deep cover operative who endorsed Trump to undermine his presidency from within.\n\n\nIt seems Trumpism is infectious. If this infection becomes a pandemic \u2014 a cult of personality \u2014 one could fairly call Trumpism a movement. But psychology would still be the best way to understand it.\n\n(C) 2018 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY,   Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David French", "body": "Barack Obama delivers a statement after the Supreme Court blocked his illegal immigrant work permit plan, June 23, 2016.

When the opposing party occupies the White House, the Founders\u2019 vision of sovereign states and a limited federal government suddenly has an alluring appeal. Retake the White House, and it becomes time for the states to fall into line.\n\nCalifornia progressives have been loving federalism lately. While they\u2019ve pushed through a number of policies specifically designed to fight the Trump administration, few have garnered more headlines than the state\u2019s comprehensive statutory scheme to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The statutes don\u2019t block the federal government from enforcing federal law. They do, however, limit the extent to which federal authorities can depend on California citizens and state officials to affirmatively assist in executing the federal mission.\n\n\nSo that\u2019s federalism, right? While it\u2019s clear that states can\u2019t nullify federal laws, in the absence of conflicting federal statutes, can\u2019t California enact immigration policies that advance its own, unique state interests?\n\nIt appears not. Ironically enough, thanks to a determined litigation effort by Obama\u2019s Department of Justice, progressives handed the Trump administration a legal club that will likely beat down California\u2019s attempt to go its own way: A Supreme Court precedent. And yesterday, the Trump DOJ picked up that club, suing California to block its new statutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, way back in 2012 the two parties had very different views of federalism. The GOP wanted to dissent from Obama\u2019s immigration policies, and the Obama administration very much wanted to impose its own version of uniform, national rule. The state of Arizona, facing multiple challenges from a swelling illegal-immigrant population, enacted a statute that essentially created enhanced penalties for illegal immigration and granted state officials new powers to enforce existing federal law.\n\nIn other words, it was the mirror image of the California effort. Arizona\u2019s statute didn\u2019t conflict with federal law; it was just different from federal law, reflecting the state\u2019s sovereign priorities. The Obama administration sued, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court. On June 25, 2012, the Court struck down the key provisions of the Arizona law. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion, and it was sweeping in its language and scope.\n\nEssentially, Kennedy ruled that Congress \u2014 through its comprehensive statutory scheme \u2014 had \u201coccupied the field\u201d of alien registration and thus \u201ceven complementary state regulation is impermissible.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This so-called \u201cfield preemption\u201d reflects \u201ca congressional decision to foreclose any state regulation in the area [preempted], even if it is parallel to federal standards.\u201d After waxing eloquent about the importance of immigration in the American national story, Kennedy\u2019s opinion goes on to conclude that \u201cArizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration . . . but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, and it was classic Scalia. It surveyed relevant American constitutional history, discussed the nature of state sovereignty, and reached a conclusion that California would almost certainly like to cling to today:\n\nIn light of the predominance of federal immigration restrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the States\u2019 traditional role in regulating immigration \u2014 and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so. I accept as a given that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution when (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or (2) it conflicts with federal regulation \u2014 when, for example, it admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or excludes those whom federal regulation would admit.\n\nUnder the Kennedy framework, California law likely goes down in flames. If Arizona\u2019s efforts at creating complementary policy were impermissible, then California faces an immense challenge justifying a policy that is quite explicitly designed to undermine federal enforcement. According to Kennedy\u2019s reasoning (adopted by Roberts, Breyer, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor), federal statutes are precisely designed to accomplish national goals \u2014 goals that no state can undermine.\n\nTrue federalism could temper polarization by empowering self-governance. Cynical, fake federalism divides us with its dishonesty.\n\nScalia\u2019s reasoning, firmly rooted in American constitutional tradition, represents federalism as the Founders intended. The Founders recognized that America wasn\u2019t a single sovereign entity but rather a unified nation comprising multiple distinct and different states with their own sovereign interests. The federal government is supreme, but in the absence of conflict with federal law, the states have considerable discretion to fashion their own policies. They are, after all, different in history, politics, geography, and culture.\n\n\nBut the Founders\u2019 vision is largely lost. Federalism has become just another constitutional means to an ideological end, a way of accomplishing locally what you can\u2019t accomplish nationally. It\u2019s a defense mechanism when you\u2019re out of power and an annoyance when you\u2019re in power. That\u2019s why the Obama administration sued Arizona, and the Trump administration is suing California. That\u2019s why the same progressives who cheered the Obama administration\u2019s SCOTUS victory in 2012 will complain bitterly if the Trump administration wins its suit in 2018. And that\u2019s why all too many conservatives who supported Arizona now want to bring down the hammer on California.\n\nIt will take more time and more pain before Americans on both sides (hopefully) remember the wisdom of the Founders and understand that centralized control of an ideologically diverse and polarized nation is not only elusive but destructive. True federalism could temper polarization by empowering self-governance. Cynical, fake federalism divides us with its dishonesty. I\u2019m with Scalia. California should be able go its own way. But will Californians support Arizona\u2019s right to go its own way when and if the roles are once again reversed?

Peterson is fond of reminding us, the oldest theme of storytelling is a conflict between something cruel and masculine, and something kind and feminine. In the literature of North American political journalism, this has certainly been the long-favored prism for portraying Canadian\u2013American relations, particularly these days, when the leaders of both countries seem such on-the-nose stereotypes.\n\nIn the age of Trump vs. Trudeau, a plot point that journalists of both nations have gripped especially tight is the supposed stampede of Third World refugees from the United States into Canada. Reuters was but the latest to produce a feature story on the phenomenon, reporting on Monday that \u201cmore than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how abundant they are in color and anecdote, these stories rarely divert from a few predetermined conclusions: that Trump is a frightening racist, that American-based refugees are right to flee, and that if Canada is guilty of anything, it\u2019s caring too much.\n\nIf one exerts minimal effort to get off this tendentious narrative track, however, the tale becomes far less morally tidy.\n\nTo begin, the fact that some people illegally cross the border from the United States into Canada does not suggest that the continent is descending into a Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2013esque dystopia. Illegal crossings are a persistent logistical problem that has dogged the two countries for decades. Every year, somewhere between hundreds and thousands of American-based persons sneak across the Canadian border, and certain persistent trends, such as Somalis crossing the Minnesota-Manitoba line, experience peaks and valleys that do not tend to correlate with developments. During the 2015\u201316 election cycle, for instance, 294 Somalis crossed the border before Donald Trump even won the Republican nomination.\n\nAttempts to chronicle larger trends are hampered by unclear data (as is often the case with Canadian statistics). The \u201cmore than 20,000\u201d figure cited by Reuters is based on Royal Canadian Mounted Police \u201capprehensions\u201d of border-crossers in 2017, for which no previous data exist, but other, vaguer data do support the thesis that there\u2019s been a significant \u201cTrump Bump\u201d of American-originated refugees applying for amnesty at Canadian immigration offices at both \u201cland\u201d (i.e., border) and \u201cinland\u201d (inside the country) locations. Under the terms of a 2004 treaty, American-based persons are not supposed to apply for refugee status in Canada at all, though the agreement has exemptions and can be dodged altogether by entering Canada illegally. The combined land and inland total was 5,005 in 2015, followed by 8,990 in 2016 and 18,190 in 2017, though that 2015 figure shows that Canada would still be struggling with a substantial inflow of American asylum seekers even with a Democrat in the White House.\n\n\n\n\nFor many American-based refugees, Canada has always been the ultimate destination, with the United States understood as a temporary stop along the way. Now we have the so-called New Underground Railroad, in which migrants from Asia, Africa, or the Middle East enter this hemisphere through Latin America and then make an arduous trek upward until they arrive in the Great White North.\n\nCanada is an attractive endpoint for refugees for a number of reasons. The main one can sound insensitive when stated bluntly, because it inevitably involves passing moral judgement on such frequently desperate people: Basically, Canada is just fundamentally more lawless than the United States when it comes to immigration.\n\nOne should therefore be wary of the narrative, popular in some circles on both right and left, that Prime Minister Trudeau has exacerbated the refugee situation by posturing disingenuously, on social media and elsewhere, about Canadian generosity, when, supposedly, Canadian refugee law is actually quite tough \u2014 little different from America\u2019s.\n\nWhatever Canadian law says on paper, terrible follow-through ensures that Canada is, in fact, a very logical place for any refugee, including those of dubious claim or character, seeking comparatively easy treatment.\n\nIn reality, whatever Canadian law says on paper, terrible follow-through ensures that Canada is, in fact, a very logical place for any refugee, including those of dubious claim or character, seeking comparatively easy treatment. Global News has been reporting this week on just how spectacularly incompetent Canada\u2019s immigration bureaucracy is at deporting even the most brazenly unacceptable aliens, including a Sudanese man with 37 criminal convictions and a Palestinian terrorist deemed a \u201cdanger to the security of Canada\u201d \u2014 both of whom remain in the country more than a decade after ordered out.\n\nIllegal border-crossers aside, Canada welcomes thousands of ordinary refugee applicants to the country every year, yet the Canadian refugee-verification system has proven unable to process this steady intake, CBC News has reported. By Ottawa\u2019s own estimate, it may soon take eleven years for a refugee applicant to even get an initial hearing, and obviously longer should he choose to appeal an unfavorable ruling.\n\nIn a cynical concession to this fact, multiple levels of government have made staying in unprocessed refugee limbo a kind of de facto long-term visa of its own, with members of the class eligible to obtain work permits, use the Canadian public health-care system, and even collect welfare.\n\nCanada has made staying in unprocessed refugee limbo a kind of de facto long-term visa, with members of the class eligible to obtain work permits, use the Canadian public health-care system, and even collect welfare.\n\nAll of this creates a particularly powerful border-crossing incentive for refugees in the United States who have exhausted the limits of the American immigration system. This is very much the case with the large number of Haitians who have crossed into Quebec recently, migrants who are not fleeing \u201cTrump\u201d so much as his administration\u2019s decision to rescind a temporary deportation amnesty imposed by President Obama in the wake of that country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nWhen the executive branch offers a temporary amnesty for humanitarian purposes, as it has done repeatedly since Congress granted such powers in 1990, there is an implied obligation that those benefitting from this conditional right will be aware of its specific terms \u2014 in the case of the Haitians, the reality that their country would eventually rebuild to the point where their return could be morally justified. (The conclusion that Haiti is now safe enough to be deported to, incidentally, is one the Trudeau administration shares.) Over the decades, countless temporarily protected refugees in America have found ways to upgrade their immigration status to something more permanent, while others have failed and returned home. It is the rule of law, more than any uniquely sinister or sadistic president, that many of the border-crossers seek to flee.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose inclined to view North American politics as a simple morality fable may find none of this nuance compelling. If we rob refugees of all agency, individualism, and responsibility, and simply treat them as bit players in the grand drama of Donald Trump, Destroyer of Worlds, then it\u2019s easy to frame their plight as a crisis America has caused, and that generous, passive Canada is trying to cure.\n\n\nThose who believe there is some worth in a civilization whose compassion is managed through enforced standards of justice, procedure, and precedent will find the morality tale troubling for different reasons.

When the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program asked why President Trump had congratulated Russian president Vladimir Putin on being reelected, former CIA director John Brennan pulled no punches. In answering the leading question that implied Trump may be afraid of Putin, Brennan said, \u201cThe Russians may have something on him personally.\u201d The Russians, he said, \u201chave had long experience of Mr. Trump, and may have things they could expose.\u201d\n\nComing from just another foe of Trump \u2014 which Brennan, an Obama loyalist, certainly is \u2014\u00a0the assertion could be dismissed as just a partisan cheap shot. But coming as it did from a career intelligence officer who served for four years as the head of the American intelligence establishment, this had to be more than a baseless conjecture.\n\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t.\n\nBy the end of the day, Brennan admitted his wild charge was not based on any actual information or intelligence revealed to him during the course of his duties but just a willingness to assume the worst about Trump. In a written response to questions from the New York Times, he said, \u201cI do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn a world in which journalists treated unfounded assumptions as just that, rather than headline news, Brennan\u2019s charges would have been dismissed. But though the Times knew the accusation was baseless by the time it published its article on the subject, the paper buried the lead. The headline on the story was \u201cEx-Chief of the C.I.A. Suggests Putin May Have Compromising Information on Trump.\u201d Brennan\u2019s walking back of his charge didn\u2019t appear until the eleventh paragraph of the story.\n\nThe point here is not just the decision of the editors of the Times to downplay information that undermined the entire story. Nor is it only that the rest of the mainstream media played it the same way. In particular, the coverage on MSNBC and CNN consisted of highlighting the accusation, treating it as a proven fact, and then following up with panels in which others speculated as to what evidence might substantiate Brennan\u2019s charge, even though he had already admitted he had no such information. This episode encapsulates most of the media\u2019s coverage of the entire Russian-collusion investigation over the last year, in which speculation about Trump\u2019s guilt is always assumed to be true even if proof is never forthcoming.\n\nThis episode encapsulates most of the media\u2019s coverage of the entire Russian-collusion investigation over the last year, in which speculation about Trump\u2019s guilt is always assumed to be true even if proof is never forthcoming.\n\nThe case of the Brennan smear is, however, instructive in that it shows how coverage of Trump and Russia works. When Brennan spoke of the Russians\u2019 having something on Trump, not one member of the panel asked the former Obama staffer whether his opinion was rooted in actual knowledge rather than pure speculation. Nor did many others ask that question over the course of a day in which Brennan\u2019s comment was among the most discussed stories.\n\nThat fits a pattern that applies to every stage of the Russian-collusion investigation.\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year into the Trump presidency and the appointment of Robert Mueller to lead a special investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, information about the subject is still scarce. Speculation about the dearth of knowledge regarding what happened or what exactly Mueller has discovered is understandable. But in most of the media, that lack of information hasn\u2019t stopped both reporters and commentators from jumping to conclusions about Trump\u2019s being in big trouble every time even the smallest tidbit about the probe is aired.\n\nUntil Mueller finishes his work and issues a report, we won\u2019t know what he has found. Like virtually every other special counsel, armed with an unlimited budget and near plenary powers to chase down any potential crime no matter how tenuous its link to his original brief, Mueller is taking his time. But after his indictments of Russians for their activities, the only crimes committed by Americans that he appears to have found get us nowhere near a finding of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. While there were scattered contacts, there is still no evidence they cooperated on anything. At this point, and since the charges against the Russians were not tied to those against Americans with whom they might have colluded, it is not unreasonable to think that there may be none.\n\nWhat we do know is that President Trump does appear to have a soft spot for the Putin regime and seems unwilling to listen to the counsel of those who urge him to be more guarded in his statements about the subject.\n\nIs that enough, as Brennan seems to think, to fuel a charge that he might be under some sort of pressure from Russia?\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious answer is no. Trump has been consistent throughout his campaign about believing in better relations with Russia and for his lack of outrage about its foreign mischief making. This is a terrible idea, as Moscow has proved time and again over the last year, since thwarting U.S. interests is, along with reassembling the old Soviet empire, one of the keynotes of Putin\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nYet you don\u2019t have to be a Russian agent of influence to back policies or gestures that are favorable to Putin. After all, President Obama made the same foolish gesture for which Trump has been lambasted this week: calling to congratulate the authoritarian leader after winning a rigged election in which his victory was foreordained. Obama began his first term with a comical effort to \u201creset\u201d relations and continued to defend Russia. He mocked Mitt Romney for declaring Russia to be America\u2019s prime geostrategic foe in their 2012 foreign-policy debate, a stance that is Democratic-party orthodoxy now that d\u00e9tente with Putin is identified with Trump. Just as bad, in an infamous hot-mic moment, he told Putin\u2019s puppet Dmitry Medvedev to tell \u201cVladimir\u201d that he could be more \u201cflexible\u201d in bowing to Russian demands after he was reelected.\n\n\n\n\nNone of that constituted proof that Obama was in thrall to Putin. His belief in showing weakness to Russia was sincere. But Trump\u2019s sporadic continuation of this imprudent policy \u2014 for which Brennan was at least partially responsible \u2014 is assumed without proof as being prima facie evidence of treason, even though Trump has also done some things, such as his arming of Ukraine, to offend Putin.\n\n\nTheoretically, Brennan could be right. But to assume without proof that the only possible motive for a policy choice is a criminal connection isn\u2019t journalism. At best, it\u2019s a highly partisan talking point. At worst, it\u2019s a smear.\n\nIt used to be that partisan assumptions fueled by pure speculation and unaccompanied by proof didn\u2019t pass the smell test at any major network or newspaper. The fact that political smears of this sort have now become not only possible but also normal says a lot about the way animus for the Trump administration has distorted much of the media\u2019s judgment and coverage.

You know middle America, with its toxic envy of people from . . . uh, India.\n\nAlthough she is not running anymore, Clinton\u2019s comments are in some ways worse than Obama\u2019s. He attributed the bitterness in \u201csmall towns in the Midwest\u201d to the policy failures and false promises of the Clinton and Bush years. He prefaced the remark by saying, \u201cEach successive administration has said somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s remarks manage to combine self-pity with contempt. They are unhelpful to Democrats trying to get elected. And they articulate what is becoming the central myth of the liberal elite: We are beautiful and successful because we\u2019re morally superior. Clinton\u2019s remarks connect the expanding GDP of her constituents to their commitment to diversity, and the economic trouble of the red states to their supposed opposition to \u201cwomen having jobs\u201d and civil rights. She seems to confirm the observation made by Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen at First Things:\n\nOur ruling class is more blinkered than that of the ancien r\u00e9gime. Unlike the aristocrats of old, they insist that there are only egalitarians at their exclusive institutions. They loudly proclaim their virtue and redouble their commitment to diversity and inclusion. They cast bigoted rednecks as the great impediment to perfect equality \u2014 not the elite institutions from which they benefit.\n\nEffectively, Clinton admitted she disclaims any responsibility to the states she lost, arguing that they deserve their lower economic status on account of their wickedness. Whereas she and her constituents deserve their riches, on account of their notional commitment to egalitarianism.\n\nEffectively, Clinton admitted she disclaims any responsibility to the states she lost.\n\n\nWhile Clinton is perhaps the worst exemplar of the attitude, it is almost omnipresent in mainstream and online media. And this, I predict, will remain a major problem for Democrats seeking office and the larger center-left going forward. Their desire to publicly announce and witness to their moral separation from the \u201crest\u201d of the country frequently outweighs their better judgment on how to acquire power. The Democrats have lost the ability to denounce the \u201cmalefactors of great wealth\u201d because they are led by an aristocratic klatch, one that can\u2019t help adverting their contempt for the common man.\n\nEach successive political guru has said that demographic trends would reelect them, and they have not.

Yet, the press barely notices.\n\n\n\tRest assured: If a Republican administration had used unverifiable hearsay from a patently suspect agent of the Republican presidential candidate to gull the FISA court into granting a warrant to spy on an associate of the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign, it would be covered as the greatest political scandal in a half-century.\n\n\n\tInstead, it was the other way around. The Grassley-Graham memo corroborates the claims in the Nunes memo: The Obama Justice Department and FBI used anonymously sourced, Clinton-campaign generated innuendo to convince the FISA court to issue surveillance warrants against Carter Page, and in doing so, they concealed the Clinton campaign\u2019s role. Though the Trump campaign had cut ties with Page shortly before the first warrant was issued in October 2016, the warrant application was based on wild allegations of a corrupt conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Moreover, the warrant meant the FBI could seize not only Page\u2019s forward-going communications but any past emails and texts he may have stored \u2014 i.e., his Trump campaign communications.\n\n\n\tWith its verification by the Grassley-Graham memo, the Nunes memo now has about a thousand times more corroboration than the Steele dossier, the basis of the heinous allegations used by the Justice Department and FBI to get the FISA warrants.\n\n\n\tWhat the Grassley-Graham memo tells us is that the Nunes memo, for all the hysteria about it, was tame. The Grassley-Graham memo tells us that we need not only a full-blown investigation of what possessed the Obama administration to submit such shoddy applications to the FISA court, but of how a judge \u2014 or perhaps as many as four judges \u2014 rationalized signing the warrants.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWe need full disclosure \u2014 the warrants, the applications, the court proceedings. No more games.\n\n\n\tSenators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are senior Republicans on the Judiciary Committee (which Grassley chairs, while Graham chairs a relevant subcommittee). As we\u2019ve previously detailed (in a two-part series, here and here), they composed their memo in support of a criminal referral recommending that dossier author Christopher Steele be investigated for making false statements to the FBI (which is a felony). Initially, the senators\u2019 memo was withheld, then it was released with extensive redactions because its contents were largely classified \u2014 covering submissions to the FISA court, the secret tribunal established by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But following the release of the Nunes memo \u2014 the memo prepared by Republican majority staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence led by Representative Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) \u2014 Senators Grassley and Graham stepped up their admirable efforts to get more information unsealed . . . so that the public can see it, even if the press prefers not to cover it.\n\n\n\tLast Friday, the Nunes memo asserted that the FBI and Justice Department had significantly relied on the unverified Steele dossier to obtain FISA warrants on Page. In the week that followed, House Intelligence Committee Democrats and their media echo chamber bleated about how things had been taken out of context, with some suggesting that there was plenty of other evidence to establish probable cause that Page was acting as a Russian agent. (See my column last Sunday responding to claims by Representative Jerrold Nadler, here.) It was even implied that Nunes  Co. had deceptively reported committee testimony by the FBI\u2019s then deputy director Andrew McCabe that the Steele dossier was essential to this probable-cause showing.\n\n\n\tWe\u2019re not hearing much of that now. No wonder. Here\u2019s the Grassley-Graham memo on the critical first FISA application, the basis for the warrant granted on October 21, 2016:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe bulk of the application consists of allegations against Page that were disclosed to the FBI by Mr. Steele and are also outlined in the Steele dossier. The application appears to contain no additional information corroborating the dossier allegations against Mr. Page, although it does cite to a news article that appears to be sourced to Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier.\n\n\n\n\tWe\u2019ll come to the news article \u2014 the stupefying circular attempt to corroborate Steele with Steele. For the moment, suffice it to say that the senators have confirmed the Nunes memo\u2019s account, except with much more information than House Republicans were able to include. Information such as this:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen asked at the March 2017 briefing [of Judiciary Committee leaders] why the FBI relied on the dossier in the FISA applications absent meaningful corroboration \u2014 and in light of the highly political motives surrounding its creation \u2014 then-Director [James] Comey stated that the FBI included the dossier allegations about Carter Page in the FISA applications because Mr. Steele himself was considered reliable due to his past work with the Bureau. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\tOn this score, Grassley and Graham quote directly from the warrant applications: \u201cBased on [Steele\u2019s] previous reporting history with the FBI whereby [Steele] provided reliable information to the FBI, the FBI believes [Steele\u2019s] reporting to be credible.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\tI cannot stress enough how irregular this is. It is why there is abundant reason to demand that the judge explain his or her rationale for granting the warrant.\n\n\n\tAs I outlined at greater length last week (here, in section C), in applying for a warrant, the government must establish the reliability of the informants who witnessed the alleged facts claimed to support a probable-cause finding. Steele was not one of those witnesses. He is not the source of the facts. He is the purveyor of the sources \u2014 anonymous Russians, much of whose alleged information is based on hearsay, sometimes multiple steps removed from direct knowledge. Steele has not been in Russia since his cover as a British spy was blown nearly 20 years ago. He has sources, who have sources, who have sources . . . \u00a0and so on. None of his information is better than third-hand; most of it is more attenuated than that.\n\n\n\tFor purposes of justifying a warrant, it does not matter that, in a totally unrelated investigation (involving corruption at FIFA, the international soccer organization), the FBI judged that the hearsay information provided by Steele, then a British agent, checked out. In his anti-Trump research, Steele could not verify his sources. Furthermore, he was now a former foreign intelligence officer who was then working for private clients \u2014 which is the advocacy business, not the search-for-truth business.\n\n\n\tA judge would need to know whether Steele\u2019s sources were reliable, not whether Steele himself was reliable.\n\n\n\tLet that sink in, then think about this contrast: No actual FBI agent, no matter how renowned, would be able to get a judicial warrant based solely on his own reliability as an investigator. Jim Comey, despite having a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 geometrically more impressive than Steele\u2019s, including Senate confirmations to some of federal law-enforcement\u2019s loftiest positions, would not be given a warrant based on representations to the court that the FBI, the Justice Department, the president, and the Senate all attested to his impeccable reliability.\n\n\n\tThe only reliability that counts is the reliability of the factual informants, not of the investigator who purports to channel the informants. The judge wants to know why the court should believe the specific factual claims: Was the informant truly in a position to witness what is alleged, and if so, does the informant have a track record of providing verified information? The track record of the investigator who locates the sources is beside the point. A judge would need to know whether Steele\u2019s sources were reliable, not whether Steele himself was reliable.\n\n\n\tThis is not esoterica. In the investigations biz, this is so basic that to call it \u201cWarrants 101\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice. If you don\u2019t have witnesses with verifiable, first-hand knowledge, you don\u2019t have anything. Without them, to borrow Director Comey\u2019s notorious dictum, no reasonable prosecutor would bring a warrant application to a federal judge, and no reasonable judge would issue a warrant.\n\n\n\tIf there is no credible sourcing for the factual allegations in the warrant application, that is a probable-cause deficiency that could not have been cured by the reputation of the purveyor of the sources, no matter how sterling. That said, it is obvious that the less identifiable and reliable the informants are, the greater is the government\u2019s obligation to be transparent in conveying the investigator\u2019s potential biases. The Obama administration\u2019s malfeasance on this point is breathtaking.\n\n\n\tGraham and Grassley recount:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe FBI noted to a vaguely limited extent the political origins of the dossier. In footnote 8 [of the first warrant application, apparently repeated in the subsequent applications] the FBI stated that the dossier information was compiled pursuant to the direction of a law firm who had hired an \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d \u2014 now known as Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS.\n\n\n\n\tThe fact that Fusion GPS\u2019s ultimate client was the Clinton campaign was never disclosed in any of the warrant applications, which ran well beyond June 2017, when the last 90-day extension was granted. Patently, so much struggle and circumlocution went into crafting this \u201cvaguely limited\u201d footnote that we can only conclude the decision not to disclose the Clinton connection was the subject of much deliberation.\n\n\n\tThe Clinton campaign\u2019s sponsorship was not publicly disclosed until October 2017. Before then, it is virtually certain that, to the extent the FISA court and Congress were told of the \u201cpolitical origins\u201d of the dossier, these were benignly presented as bipartisan concerns about Donald Trump. That is, the Steele dossier phase of Fusion\u2019s anti-Trump project was conflated with the earlier phase, when \u2014 as Simpson has testified \u2014 Fusion did documentary research on Trump during the Republican primaries for a conservative media outlet. It was not disclosed that, by the time Steele was hired to do the dossier, the project was backed exclusively by the Democratic party and the Clinton campaign.\n\n\n\tManifestly, that was a material fact. If a prosecutor withheld an arguably exculpatory fact of this degree of significance, it could get a conviction reversed. As some have observed, a public company would likely face a stock fraud prosecution for concealing a fact so patently material from its required SEC reports.\n\n\n\tThe Clinton-campaign tie should have been disclosed from the beginning. Now, consider what happened as the surveillance continued for the better part of a year.\n\n\n\tIn late October 2016, shortly after the first warrant was issued, the FBI terminated its relationship with Steele because he lied to the Bureau about his contacts with the media. But the Justice Department did not report this to the FISA court. Instead, when the first warrant expired in January 2017, the FBI and Justice Department sought its renewal by, again, relying on the credibility of the guy they\u2019d booted for lying. In another lawyerly footnote, they told the FISA court that Steele had been terminated not because he lied but because he was guilty of \u201cunauthorized disclosure of information to the press.\u201d\n\n\n\tBut that was not the half of it. Steele\u2019s agreement with the FBI was that he would not communicate with the press. He made that agreement and then communicated with the press anyway \u2014 which showed he was unreliable, notwithstanding the FBI\u2019s continued insistence to the contrary. He hadn\u2019t just flouted the agreement by speaking to the press, though; he had clearly lied about doing so.\n\n\n\tBy mid-September 2016, at Fusion\u2019s direction and even before the first FISA warrant was issued, Steele had spoken with a plethora of Clinton-friendly press outlets. As a result, Yahoo News published a news story by Michael Isikoff on September 23, which reported precisely the information that Steele had given to the FBI about Page: that he\u2019d supposedly met in Moscow with two top Russian operatives and discussed the lifting of sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\tHow could the FBI and Justice Department not have known that Steele was the source for this story? Isikoff explicitly stated that his account of Page\u2019s activities was set forth in \u201cintelligence reports\u201d that were in the possession of \u201cU.S. officials.\u201d Plainly, the FBI was privy to intelligence reports in the government\u2019s possession \u2014 the purported \u201cintelligence\u201d reports Steele had provided as well as any others. Had there been another intel report from a different source who happened to provide the same exact information Steele had provided, not only would the FBI have known about it; the Bureau would have touted it to the FISA court as critical corroboration of Steele\u2019s anonymous sources.\n\n\n\tTo the contrary, the FISA court was told: \u201cThe FBI does not believe that [Steele] directly provided this information to the press.\u201d I\u2019ve emphasized \u201cdirectly\u201d to highlight how curious this assertion is. Ostensibly, the Bureau seems to have been saying that Steele was not the source \u2014 meaning that there must have been another source, yet one the Bureau had not managed to identify even though this mystery source was described in intelligence reports accessible to the Bureau.\n\n\n\tOn the other hand, what does \u201cdirectly\u201d mean? By using that qualifier, was the Bureau conceding that Steele might have provided information to the press indirectly \u2013 i.e., through an intermediary? But that would make no sense: What would be the point of citing the Isikoff article as corroboration for Steele if Steele had been Isikoff\u2019s source, even if indirectly?\n\n\n\tIt is not good, one way or the other. Either Steele lied to the FBI about speaking to the press, or the FBI consciously avoided learning that Steele had spoken to Isikoff and then speculated to the court that Steele was probably not Isikoff\u2019s source. Either way, Steele\u2019s credibility was a huge issue. That put in doubt the FBI\u2019s vouching for his reliability, which in turn made disclosure of the Clinton campaign\u2019s sponsorship of his dossier even more imperative.\n\n\n\tOr how about this: Steele gave a published interview to Mother Jones in late October 2016, after promising not to speak to the media. In trying to soft-peddle the palpable unreliability Steele had thus exhibited, the FBI rationalized that he was acting not out of dishonesty but in a fit of pique over Director Comey\u2019s pre-election announcement that the FBI had reopened the Clinton emails investigation.\n\n\n\tThis, of course, is the announcement that Clinton partisans blame for their candidate\u2019s loss. So, according to the Bureau, Steele\u2019s pro-Clinton partisanship induced him to such outrage over Comey\u2019s announcement that he was moved to violate his agreement with the FBI. Wouldn\u2019t you think it might then occur to the Bureau and the Justice Department that maybe, just maybe, they ought to let the court in on that teeny detail about the Clinton campaign\u2019s being the sponsor of Steele\u2019s dossier?\n\n\n\tNope. Instead they kept mum and they kept telling the court Steele was perfectly reliable.\n\n\n\tIn fact, they kept telling the FISA court he was reliable even after Steele himself admitted to a British court that his dossier wasn\u2019t at all reliable.\n\n\n\tWhat\u2019s that? Am I kidding? No.\n\n\n\tTruth is a defense to libel. Suffice it to say, it was not Steele\u2019s defense.\n\n\n\tEven though there was still no meaningful corroboration of Steele\u2019s sources after months of investigation, even though Steele had lied to them, the FBI and Justice Department represented again and again, in April and June 2017, that the FISA court could confidently bank on Steele\u2019s reliability. By early 2017, however, Steele was being sued for libel in Britain, among other places, by people accused of misconduct in the dossier.\n\n\n\tTruth is a defense to libel. Suffice it to say, it was not Steele\u2019s defense.\n\n\n\tIn May 2017, as I have detailed (here), Steele was required to respond to interrogatories. He emphasized that his dossier allegations were \u201craw intelligence\u201d that was \u201cunverified\u201d and \u201cwarranted investigation.\u201d He further described his reports as \u201climited intelligence\u201d that described mere \u201cindications\u201d of \u201cpossible\u201d coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. He was not in a position to vouch for the accuracy of what he\u2019d been told, he explained; he passed it along because it needed further investigation.\n\n\n\tYet, far from reporting Steele\u2019s retreat to the FISA court, Grassley and Graham report that the FBI and Justice Department continued vouching for the reliability of his allegations.\n\n\n\tBeyond all that, we now learn through the senators\u2019 memo, and some follow-up reporting, that two longtime Clinton cronies, Cody Shearer and Sidney Blumenthal, fed their own anti-Trump dossier to Steele, through a State Department official, Jonathan Winer. In the fall of 2016, Steele, while working on his Clinton-funded project, reported this Clinton-crony information to the FBI.\n\n\n\tStill, the FBI and Justice Department elected not to tell the FISA court that the Clinton campaign was paying for Steele\u2019s unverified, unverifiable anti-Trump research.\n\n\n\tI spent many months assuring people that nothing like this could ever happen \u2014 that the FBI and Justice Department would not countenance the provision to the FISA court of uncorroborated allegations of heinous misconduct. When Trump enthusiasts accused them of rigging the process, I countered that they probably had not even used the Steele dossier. If the Justice Department had used it in writing a FISA warrant application, I insisted that the FBI would independently verify any important facts presented to the court, make any disclosures that ought in fairness be made so the judge could evaluate the credibility of the sources, and compellingly demonstrate probable cause before alleging that an American was a foreign agent.\n\n\n\tI was wrong.\n\n\n\t\u2014 Andrew C.

Comey incoherently mocked the memo\u2019s purported unimportance even while listing all its deleterious effects and the crises that would  DOJ, and FBI resistance to the release of most documents connected to FISA-gate apparently originates with fears that information will either reveal Obama-administration efforts to surveille Trump officials during a campaign or will suggest that the impetus for the Mueller investigation came as a result of illegal activities and a concocted dossier \u2014 or both.\n\n\n\t2) Critics scream, \u201cCarter Page is no big deal.\u201d Aside from the easy retort that neither, initially, was a petty break-in at the Watergate complex, or rumors of supplying arms to distant guerillas in Central America, Page is a big deal for a variety of reasons.\n\n\n\tDemocrats allege that, given Carter Page\u2019s familiarity with Russians, it was logical for the Obama administration to use the dossier\u2019s references to him to substantiate FISA warrants.\n\n\n\tBut is not the opposite more likely true?\n\n\n\tHe was apparently known to intelligence agencies for years (supposedly under investigation variously by the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network), and he may have been the object of a 2014 FISA warrant. But such intelligence agents were never able to bring charges against him, and it appears he even cooperated with American intelligence in gathering info against the Russians. So why would the FBI and DOJ, suddenly in 2016, believe that mention of Page\u2019s name in an unverified opposition-research dossier warranted four FISA warrants to find wrongdoing?\n\n\n\tAfter all, if he was so well known to the FBI for so many years, during which they never charged him with being a Russian agent, and if the FBI nonetheless still regarded him as suspicious in 2016, why not simply go to a regular court to obtain a warrant to wiretap him? Such a\u00a0court, of course, would be less secretive, not known for a 99 percent approval rate, subject to far more deliberation, and less useful for surveilling Trump associates.\n\n\n\tA more likely supposition is that it\u00a0was not Page\u2019s past flirtations with the Russians (who supposedly dubbed him an \u201cidiot\u201d) that abruptly brought him back into the sights of the DOJ and FBI in 2016. Instead, it was his brief and minor relationship with Trump, and his appearance in a bogus dossier, that offered useful pretexts for court-ordered surveillance sweeps and indirect targeting of possible Trump associates.\n\n\n\tPage was simply a tool, to be surveilled in hopes of also sweeping up other names and information that might corroborate some shred of the dubious Steele dossier.\n\n\n\tPage was simply a tool, to be surveilled in hopes of also sweeping up other names and information that might corroborate some shred of the dubious Steele dossier. In that narrow sense, his name might as well have been Jones or Smith.\n\n\n\tSo far, all Carter Page has been found guilty of is momentarily working for the Trump campaign. His likely future lawsuits against Steele, Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign, the FBI, and the DOJ will probably follow a number of avenues.\n\n\n\t3) The New York Times and others strangely have claimed that the dossier-based FISA warrants were not the real basis of the Russian-collusion allegations, given, as the memo implies, that the FISA warrants were issued after FBI agent Peter Strzok had investigated George Papadopoulos, another minor Trump-campaign official of brief tenure.\n\n\n\tBut there has never been much connection between Page and Papadopoulos, as the Nunes memo also made clear. It is far more likely that Papadopoulos was written off as a dead-end functionary by Strzok, who also claimed to his paramour that there was likely nothing to be found at all in the Russian-collusion investigation. (And indeed Papadopoulos eventually pled guilty to making false statements, not collusion).\n\n\n\tMore likely, the collusion narrative gained ground only when the Steele dossier energized subsequent FISA requests in October and after the election, resulting in surveillance sweeps.\n\n\n\tMoreover, given the admissions by Strzok that he detested Trump and pondered ways of stopping him, and given that he and the FBI were never able to find Papadopoulos indictable on intended collusion charges, it is entirely unlikely that Papadopoulos prompted much of anything.\n\n\n\tIf he was not a dead end, then the argument could just as well be that an admittedly biased FBI agent hounded a minor, former Trump aide to find collusion, failed to find it, tried to turn him by the usual \u201cfalse statements\u201d perjury traps, and then Strzok or others around him leaked information about collusion investigations to damage the Trump campaign.\n\n\n\t4) Other than Andrew McCarthy of National Review, few have written about the FISA-court application(s) for surveillance of Trump-campaign officials that the FISA court rejected in June 2016, shortly before Trump was nominated as the Republican candidate.\n\n\n\tGiven that 99.97 percent of FISA requests are eventually granted, why exactly did a federal judge quite extraordinarily reject an Obama-administration FBI-DOJ request? Was it too \u201cbroad\u201d or insufficiently sourced in June? And what (or who) had changed by October, when a subsequent request was apparently granted? Was Strzok\u2019s July investigation of Papadopoulos better grounds to surveille Trump associates? Was the dossier (which apparently became known to the FBI as early as June or July 2016) initially used to obtain a warrant, to no avail? Or was the dossier instead used first in October, on a subsequent attempt, and in this case the FISA court granted the warrant?\n\n\n\t5) The talented, Trump-hating Peter Strzok was a sort of ubiquitous Zelig of FISA-gate and the most interesting of all the players named so far in the case. He probably convinced Comey to change the wording of his report on Hillary Clinton to prevent criminal liability. He may have started the whole shebang off by investigating George Papadopoulos. He texted away to his mistress and fellow FBI investigator Lisa Page the court secrets of the FBI and Mueller investigations, saying his gut sense was that there was \u201cno big there there\u201d to the entire effort. He interviewed Mike Flynn without Flynn\u2019s lawyer being present, and he probably compared Flynn\u2019s responses in that interview to FISA intercepts. He also met with Andrew McCabe to ponder ways to nullify the Trump ascendency. And unlike his far less talented superiors, he may have been careful to avoid strictly breaking the law.\n\n\n\t6) Even less has been written about the Obama administration\u2019s public attitude to the ongoing efforts of its own DOJ and FBI to seek FISA warrants to surveille Trump associates.\n\n\n\tTrump (apparently tipped off to prior FISA surveillance of his campaign associates) presciently tweeted on March 4:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\n\t\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\n\n\tMost of the establishment media insisted that Trump\u2019s tweet proved he was unhinged and paranoid. Former Obama White House officials issued haughty denials. Yet it is increasingly likely that Trump received good counter-intelligence on Obama-administration efforts that were either improper or illegal, and likely both.\n\n\n\tAn Obama communiqu\u00e9 that replied to Trump\u2019s accusation had the inadvertent effect of leaving even more doubt:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.\n\n\n\n\tSome have noted that the disavowal was carefully worded. First, it claims that no \u201cWhite House official\u201d interfered with any independent investigation. Fine, but does that mean other administration officials may have, or that a White House official may have interfered with investigations not deemed \u201cindependent\u201d? And does \u201cinterfered with\u201d include unmasked? Second, if neither President Obama nor a White House official ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen, does that mean that Obama-appointed DOJ and FBI officials might well have?\n\n\n\tThe problem may not be that the Obama White House itself had ordered surveillance of Trump associates, but rather than it sat back and enjoyed the wide berth granted to its DOJ and FBI investigators.\n\n\n\tIn support of the Obama denial, the Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler, to take one example, at the time issued an embarrassing second denial in a \u201cfact check\u201d that was soon made inoperative by leaks about ongoing FISA-warranted surveillance of Trump officials:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Washington Post for months has sought to confirm this report of a FISA warrant related to the Trump campaign but has been unable to do so. Presumably other U.S. news organizations have tried to do so as well. So one has to take this claim with a huge dose of skepticism.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe Wrongdoer in Chief: Obama?\n\n\n\tIn this context, one of the final executive orders of the Obama administration takes on new significance. Shortly before leaving office, Obama abruptly issued yet another expansion of the Reagan-era Executive Order 12333, dramatically enlarging some 17 government agencies\u2019 legal authority to surveille U.S. citizens \u2014 an order that had followed even earlier expansions of the number of officials privy to surveilled information. Why such a radical move in the last days in office?\n\n\n\tThe practical intent of that order might have been inadvertently contextualized by Evelyn Farkas, a former assistant deputy secretary of defense. On MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show, she blurted out:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI was urging my former colleagues and \u2014 and frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed \u2014 aimed at telling the Hill people, \u201cGet as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration.\u201d Because, I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left. So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff\u2019s dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried, because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues, and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.\n\n\n\n\tWhat exactly did she mean by \u201chow we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff\u2019s dealing with Russians\u201d? Was the DOD also privy to FISA-ordered surveillances, or did DOD staffers simply read the passed-around Steele dossier and other memos?\n\n\n\tWhat Farkas was probably outlining was an eleventh-hour attempt to leak, perhaps improperly and illegally, surveillance and classified gossip to as many government agencies as possible as well as sympathetic congressional leaders, in hopes that the information would flood out (as it did) before the incoming Trump administration could stop such illicit dissemination of improper government surveillance.\n\n\n\tObama allowed his DOJ and the FBI to manipulate the FISA courts to surveille an American citizen and indirectly target others.\n\n\n\tAt some distant point, investigators and the media will conclude that the nexus of wrongdoing was likely Barack Obama himself. Aside from the massaged investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s wrongdoing, during the election of 2016 and the Trump transition of November 2016 to January 2017, Obama allowed his DOJ and the FBI to manipulate the FISA courts to surveille an American citizen and indirectly target others. He then made sure such data were\u00a0disseminated among as many administration hands as possible. And he further allowed his subordinates to unmask surveilled citizens, whose identities and (in some cases conversations) were ultimately leaked to news organizations.\n\n\n\tThat was a process of leaking and sensationalism that sought first to damage the Trump campaign. Ultimately, it succeeded in creating overwhelming public and official Washington pressure to justify James Comey\u2019s later efforts to angle for the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\n\tThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s \u201cphase one\u201d memo, as Nunes has described it, limits itself to the likely wrongdoing of DOJ and FBI officials.\n\n\n\tOne would expect that phase two and beyond would examine the nature of the surveillance itself, the number of Obama intelligence and political officials who had access to such information, the exact requests of named officials to unmask Trump associates, and the correlations of such unmasking with the roughly simultaneous appearance of such names in the media.\n\n\n\tBoth Watergate and Iran-Contra were multiyear affairs. FISA-gate may last longer, given that the media this time around are not a watchdog, but an enabler, of government misconduct. We are at the very beginning of the exposure of wronging by Obama-era DOJ and FBI officials \u2014 and their superiors \u2014 and have not begun to learn exactly why and how American citizens were improperly monitored, and by whom. In one of the strangest moments in the history of American journalism, Washington reporters and agencies, known for their loud interests in protecting civil liberties, are either silent or working to suppress news of these scandals, and they may well soon rue their own complacency.\n\n\n\tWashington reporters and agencies are either silent or working to suppress news of these scandals.\n\n\n\tNor have we learned the full nature of why and how Obama-era investigative agencies departed from normal protocol in exonerating Hillary Clinton from criminal liability during a number of 2015\u201316 controversies. Presumably there are records, official and otherwise, of these matters; they should come to light as soon as possible.\n\n\n\tWhat seems clear is that the present hysteria about the Trump administration was already deeply seeded in the federal government throughout the 2016 campaign and the 2016\u201317 transition. A number of powerful Obama officials thought they had both moral right and the administrative means to nullify Trump. And they were not shy in breaking the law to exercise them.\n\n\n\t\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won, released in October from Basic Books.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "Conor Lamb is greeted by supporters during his election night rally in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, March 13, 2018.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Brendan  Cook Political Report, a renowned nonpartisan election forecaster, shifted its projections of nine House races in favor of Democrats Friday, days after political novice Conor Lamb bested his Republican challenger in the special election to represent a Pennsylvania district President Trump carried by 20 points against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nAmong the notable ratings changes were three races affected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s recent move to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts, ostensibly as a counterweight to the effects of partisan gerrymandering.

If you believe what you watch, read, and hear, America is hopelessly fractured among red and blue partisan team lines, poised for an endless and nightmarish cable-news-style shouting match. Support for Donald Trump, we are informed, is particularly \u201ctribal in nature,\u201d as Senator Bob Corker recently told the Washington Examiner. If you spend a lot of time on social media \u2014 and many journalists do \u2014 you\u2019re probably convinced that this is correct. America is broken, we are told. People simply can\u2019t see beyond party lines. Reason has failed. Tribalism reigns.\n\nBut what if this simply isn\u2019t true?\n\nWhat if a significant segment of the American population is completely left out of the larger media discussion about social media and tribalism?\n\nReally, bear with me: What if a significant segment of the American population is completely left out of the larger media discussion about social media and tribalism? Think about your real-life experiences, not those that occur in front of a screen. You probably know these people. Perhaps you are even one of them. Let\u2019s call them the \u201cMehs.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeh,\u201d according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is a neologism \u201cused to express indifference or mild disappointment.\u201d \u201cMeh\u201d is \u201can interjection used as an expression of indifference or boredom,\u201d Wikipedia notes. \u201cIt is often regarded as a verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders,\u201d and people utter it when addressing a topic they have \u201cno opinion or emotions about.\u201d (That last line is kind of hilarious, given that our current cultural milieu urges people of all ages and levels of engagement to have passionate opinions on every topic in the universe, including subjects they know nothing about. But let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMeh\u201d was first widely popularized on The Simpsons, a TV show credited with predicting this year\u2019s U.S. Olympic curling win against Sweden eight years before it happened, as well as forecasting Donald Trump\u2019s presidency way back in the year 2000. Since its Simpsons debut, \u201cmeh\u201d has appeared in various dictionaries as well as headlines for BBC News, ABC News, and the New York Times. \u201cMeh,\u201d apparently, has arrived.\n\nIn its political form, a \u201cmeh\u201d might signify displeasure with American politics at large, but with none of the gushers of faux outrage and over-the-top feigned surprise that regularly festoon social media. (Remember, say, the trauma of the proposed Washington, D.C., military parade that was going to potentially end America as we know it and that inspired a brief burst of hysteria until everyone forgot about it a few days later? No? Ah ha! You might be a \u201cmeh.\u201d)\n\nAs a \u201cmeh,\u201d you might align with one political party \u2014 ahem, I\u2019m sorry, political \u201ctribe\u201d \u2014 but in reality, that tribe frequently annoys and exasperates you and makes you wonder, at least once a week, why it even exists as an entity. You\u2019re not the sort of rah-rah knee-jerk blinkered team player we\u2019re so confidently told is on the rise. You just happen to think \u2014 based on actual policy preferences, not base caveman instinct \u2014 that the other side is worse. (This also explains the predicament of Evangelicals, by the way, who are often painted in the media as tribal robots. Many were reluctant Trump voters at best.)\n\nMost significantly, the \u201cmehs\u201d have a crucial skill in this day and age: They understand the grand unifying theory of politics, which is that a frighteningly large percentage of the people involved in politics can be insufferable and wildly out of touch. At moments of trivial political absurdity, the \u201cmehs\u201d can say, \u201cUgh, well, that\u2019s politics,\u201d as opposed to completely freaking out and acting as if trivial political absurdities have never occurred before \u2014 not with people surviving to tell the tale, anyway \u2014 and ratcheting matters up to eleven on a one-to-ten scale, as social media tends to inspire people to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo say \u201cmeh\u201d isn\u2019t to say \u201cwho cares?\u201d when it comes to important issues. But it does involve a certain detached understanding that much of our federal government is a gigantic, sprawling, often self-serving mess. On one side, a \u201cmeh\u201d understands why we\u2019re somehow voting on a gargantuan $1.3 trillion funding bill when the supposedly fiscally conservative political party is power. On the other, a \u201cmeh\u201d understands that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is not unfolding in real life.\n\nI hope that the rise of the \u201cmehs\u201d will correlate with increased calls for limited, accountable government, and the votes to back them up. This rarely happens, but hey, we all can dream. In the meantime, you, too, can adopt the \u201cmeh\u201d lifestyle. Does this column infuriate you? If this one doesn\u2019t, is there another on the docket that makes you want to pull a proverbial Incredible Hulk? Close your eyes, lean back, and say \u201cmeh.\u201d Trust me.

The government will in effect place those with unpaid taxes under arrest, effectively denying them their right to travel.\n\n\n\tTo be clear: We are not talking about Americans who have been convicted of tax evasion or tax fraud, or who are awaiting a criminal trial on charges related to tax matters. These Americans have not been charged with a crime, must less convicted of one. They simply have unpaid taxes amounting to $50,000 or more.\n\n\n\tMore precisely: They have an unpaid IRS liability amounting to $50,000 or more. The IRS\u2019s aggressive schedule of interest and penalties for unpaid taxes ensures that a relatively small amount of unpaid taxes can turn into a $50,000-plus liability with remarkable speed.\n\n\n\tThe IRS has remarkable investigative tools and collections procedures at its disposal. Say what you will about the Patriot Act, it does not oblige Americans to file detailed paperwork annually with the Department of Homeland Security detailing their personal affairs, business arrangements, housing situation, health-insurance coverage, etc. The IRS has that power, and then some: It can seize assets, garnish wages, put liens on property, and more. Still, there are occasions when it finds itself unable to collect a debt. Sometimes, that is because it is dealing with a crafty person who manages to hide his income and property from the government. More often, that is because it is dealing with a person who simply cannot pay.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat\u2019s worse is that there is no appeal, no procedural remedy in the law, no redress for those who have been wrongly targeted \u2014 and we know the IRS has a history of wrongly targeting Americans its agents perceive as political enemies. The sole remedy available to Americans who wrongfully lose their passports to the IRS \u2014 or who fail to have them reinstated after making good on their taxes \u2014 is to file a civil action against the agency under 26 USC 7345. Suing the IRS is an expensive and difficult proposition, especially for people who are likely already to be in a difficult financial situation.\n\n\n\tWhen it comes to relations between citizen and state, it\u2019s always a matter of \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Here is a data point for you: Under federal sentencing guidelines, the recommended sentence for involuntary manslaughter is 10 months to 16 months. The average sentence for tax evasion? Seventeen months. The average sentence in a tax case is longer than the average sentence for a car thief (twelve months), a forger (twelve months), or a felon convicted in a drug case (14 months).\n\n\n\tBut that\u2019s tax fraud. We aren\u2019t even talking about that. We\u2019re just talking about Americans with unpaid back taxes.\n\n\n\tThe right to travel is \u2014 like the right to free speech, the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievance \u2014 a basic civil right. Americans as free people have a God-given right to come and go as they please, irrespective of the preferences of any pissant bureaucrat in Washington. Yes, we curtail people\u2019s rights in certain circumstances \u2014 when they have been charged with a crime and convicted after due process. Tax fraud is a crime; having unpaid taxes is not.\n\n\n\tThe U.S. government needs a periodic reminder that it was created by the states and by the people, not the other way around, and that it exists at the sufferance of the people \u2014 not the other way around.

Most people do. But there are limits to what the government may permissibly do to citizens in any situation, and much narrower limits to what the government may permissibly to do citizens who have neither been charged with nor convicted of any crime in the matter \u2014 which is not, after all, a criminal matter in the first place.\n\n\n\tPeople should pay their taxes, and the people at the IRS should do their jobs honestly and ethically. Most of them do. But not all of them. Lois Lerner, the IRS boss who illegally targeted conservative groups for harassment in the runup to the 2012 presidential election, is happily enjoying retired life in some Washington suburb while collecting a fat federal pension. She didn\u2019t lose her passport. Former IRS commissioner John Koskinen lied to Congress about the situation and oversaw the destruction of evidence. He still has a passport. The crimes \u2014 actual crimes \u2014 of the powerful and the connected go unpunished, while those who for whatever reason have an unmet obligation to the IRS are treated like East Germans locked behind the Checkpoint Charlie of the federal bureaucracy. If you want to know why faith in our institutions is at such a low point, meditate on that.\n\n\n\tIn the meantime, Congress should repeal the statute enabling the IRS to effectively place Americans under house arrest over unpaid bills.

The debate on the right is mainly between Trump partisans who believe, or at least claim they believe, that President Trump is in the habit of saying astoundingly stupid things in public as part of a grand political scheme (twelve-dimensional chess!) and those who believe that President Trump is in the habit of saying astoundingly stupid things in public because . . . of the more straightforward reason.\n\nJamie Kirchick of the Brookings Institution wryly observes: \u201cEverything Trump says makes sense when you just preface it with, \u2018Donald from Queens, you\u2019re on the air.\u2019\u201d I do not know if Kirchick intended his remark this way, but his joke actually splits the difference between the grand-design explanation of Trump\u2019s ridiculousness and the he\u2019s-just-an-ordinary-fool explanation. There\u2019s a reason Trump sounds like your chemtrail-obsessed uncle or that guy at work who\u2019s always going on about Q-Anon, trafficking in a poisonous mix of conspiracy theories, scapegoating, and resentment-driven politics.\n\n\n\n\nThe formal term for what\u2019s at the root of all this is \u201crational ignorance.\u201d Many of you will have experienced the phenomenon of the very smart person who has very dumb ideas about politics \u2014 and who, if challenged, will immediately retreat into the vaguest of generalities, and often ends up displaying surprising ignorance about the most basic public-policy questions. These are the people who believe that you can walk into Walmart and buy a machine gun, that foreign aid represents half of federal spending, that the CIA introduced crack into inner-city neighborhoods, etc., and who tend not to know things like who their representative in Congress is or how our tax system works. Why are these smart and often very successful people so ignorant about politics? Because they\u2019ve spent their lives getting really smart about a different subject and achieving their success in a field in which political knowledge isn\u2019t very important. This is why Albert Einstein had such batty ideas about politics.\n\nWe have only so much time and only so much available in the way of neural resources to throw back at all the problems life throws at us. Earning a living eats up a bunch of the ordinary person\u2019s time-and-brainpower budget, while seeing to children and family, managing a household, maintaining friendships and social obligations, etc., demands most of what\u2019s left \u2014 or, for many busy people, more. I\u2019d like to learn French and, if I dedicated a couple of hours a day to it, I could make some real progress in a year or two, I\u2019m sure. But if I take into consideration all the other things I might do with that one or two hours a day, learning French ends up not making the cut. (So far.) That doesn\u2019t mean that I lack the capacity to learn a Romance language or that I hold the works of Guy de Rabelais in low regard. My ongoing ignorance of the French language is rational \u2014 there are other uses of my time and resources that better serve my overall ends in life.\n\nWe have only so much time and only so much available in the way of neural resources to throw back at all the problems life throws at us.\n\nOn top of that, in a mass democracy there is little opportunity for the learned amateur to put what political knowledge he does have to efficacious use. It is extremely unlikely that your individual vote is going to be the deciding factor in any given election, or that the outcome of any given election is likely to be the deciding factor in any public-policy issue that is deeply important to you in your own life. Imagine you are 18 years old, and ask yourself which would have the bigger likely payoff: spending four years studying public policy or spending four years studying finance? Imagine you are a 35-year-old mother or father: If you had spent two hours a day for the past ten years reading up on the details of federal fiscal policy instead of investing that time in your children, would you or your family be happier or better off? Unlikely. You\u2019re probably in the same position vis-\u00e0-vis most of that kind of stuff that I am with French: If your options were unlimited, it would be on the agenda. But your options are not unlimited. That\u2019s the root of \u201crational ignorance.\u201d\n\nRevenons \u00e0 nos moutons.\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that most people who don\u2019t make their living thinking about politics tend not to think very much or very carefully about politics does not mean that they are not interested in politics or do not care about it. Far from it. But, as Robin Hanson reminds us, politics is not about policy. Politics is about tribe. How we align politically is based for most people almost entirely on how we wish to position ourselves socially and culturally. At the moment, our politics is marked by a kind of inverse partisanship: It isn\u2019t that Trump partisans think the Republican party is so great \u2014 they just think those other guys are so awful that any alternative is acceptable. That\u2019s the \u201cBut Hillary\u201d defense, a moral get-out-of-jail-free card for right-wing talk-radio hosts and their listeners. Democrats have their own version of that, which is why they don\u2019t argue that Republicans are wrong about tax policy or abortion but that they are racists, misogynists, homophobes, captive to corporate greed, etc. We end up with a political discourse in which both sides are, at their broadest points, heavily invested in their insistence that there is no good-faith disagreement about policy \u2014 there is only the eternal conflict between the guys in the white hats and the guys in the black hats.\n\nAcknowledging good-faith disagreement inevitably would highlight the basic political ignorance of the general electorate (including the cable-news-watching and talk-radio-listening sub-electorate), and people find it very disagreeable to confess their ignorance about these issues, even as they are entirely comfortable admitting that they do not know very much about diesel engines or blood disorders or the internal politics of Tuvalu.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is clearly a creature of ignorance. No other sort of man would be capable of writing these sentences: \u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. When we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don\u2019t trade anymore \u2014 we win big. It\u2019s easy!\u201d There isn\u2019t a serious economist or businessman in these United States who really believes that. But it may sound good on talk radio and social media, and Trump is at the very least clever enough to understand that his core partisans are ignorant enough about the underlying issues that their sense of tribal loyalty is almost certain to overwhelming whatever critical thinking they may bring to the question.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t know much, but he knows enough to know that that doesn\u2019t much matter, at least as a question of the crude calculation of his own self-interest \u2014 the only subject to which he gives serious thought.\n\nCall it rational ignorance with a vengeance, rational ignorance with malice aforethought.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Charles C.

And not just a little bit moronic. This is so moronic, so dim, so utterly and incandescently stupid that I frankly worry for the future of the republic. I have been reading through these reactions for a few hours now, and I can still scarcely imagine the rank historical and legal illiteracy that it takes to hear \u201cAnglo-American\u201d in such a context and to assume it\u2019s a racial reference. Sessions could not have been more clear if he had tried. His talk was to sheriffs \u2014 about sheriffs. His point \u2014 \u201cliterally\u201d! \u2014 was that sheriffs play a \u201ccritical\u201d role within the law enforcement system that developed first in England, and then in America. (\u201cSheriff\u201d derives from a combination of the word \u201cshire\u201d and the word \u201creeve.\u201d) In order to make that point at that talk, he said, \u201cThe office of sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\n\tIt is hard to overstate just how commonly used this phrase is in this context. Within the law, \u201cAnglo-American\u201d does not mean \u201cwhite.\u201d It does not mean \u201cthe KKK.\u201d It is not a \u201cdog whistle.\u201d It is fundamental. It is used \u2014 shock! \u2014 to refer to those institutions, ideals, structures, and customs that are common to England and the United States \u2014 that is, to the common legal heritage the two countries share. Most basically, it means \u201ccommon law,\u201d but it can also apply more broadly. There is, for example, an identifiable \u201cAnglo-American\u201d conception of due process, which is distinct from, say, the Napoleonic system. That some people also use the word \u201cAnglo\u201d to mean \u201cwhite\u201d has no bearing on this. Has Senator Schatz never read a history book?\n\n\n\tKnow who had read a history book?

I hope we remember this as we go forward. I sincerely hope we can protect what has been called the \u201cgreat writ\u201d\u2014a writ that has been in place in the Anglo-American legal system for over 700 years.\n\n\n\n\tAnd here\u2019s Obama during the 2008 campaign, making broadly the same point:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBut Obama, who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago for more than a decade, said captured suspects deserve to file writs of habeus corpus.\n\n\t\n\t\tCalling it \u201cthe foundation of Anglo-American law,\u201d he said the principle \u201csays very simply: If the government grabs you, then you have the right to at least ask, \u2018Why was I grabbed?\u2019 And say, \u2018Maybe you\u2019ve got the wrong person.\u2019\u201d\n\n\t\n\t\tThe safeguard is essential, Obama continued, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t always have the right person.\u201d\n\n\n\n\tAnd here\u2019s Obama as president, at it again:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tObama would not say whether it could be achieved within the first 100 days of his term, citing the challenge of creating a balanced process \u201cthat adheres to rule of law, habeas corpus, basic principles of Anglo-American legal system, but doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t result in releasing people who are intent on blowing us up.\n\n\n\n\tThis usage \u2014 which is precisely the same as Sessions\u2019s \u2014 is common, it is quotidian, it is downright normal.

Their strategy has been to position China as the aggrieved party by claiming the mantle of rationality, global integration, and fairness. Chinese officials evidently believe that in appearing to take the high road they have an opportunity not only to undercut worldwide support for the U.S. actions, but also to sow seeds of dissension and doubt in the U.S. body politic. But it is important to understand China\u2019s PR blitz for what it really is: an audacious spin campaign that elides the truth about China\u2019s long record of subverting global trade rules and fleecing competitors to gain economic advantage. And the reality is that China is not justified in taking any retaliatory actions in response to the Trump administration\u2019s 301 investigation; China has long been failing to live up to its trade commitments. The only justifiable response from Chinese policymakers is to desist from their rampant innovation-mercantilist practices.\n\nNevertheless, for those following developments as they continue to unfold in the press, here is a guide for interpreting the true meaning of official statements from the Chinese government.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cChina will never seek its development at the cost of sacrificing other nations\u2019 interests, and its development will pose no threat to any other country.\u201d (President Xi Jinping, March 21, 2018)\n\nTranslation: China will seek global leadership in all advanced technology industries, and to the extent we can do that by reducing foreign competitive advantage that is icing on the cake.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStatement: \u201cNo one will emerge a winner from a trade war.\u201d (Premier Li Keqiang, March 20, 2018)\n\nTranslation: We have been engaging in a cold trade war with America for more than 15 years, and we are winning.

But Nunes didn\u2019t come from nowhere. He\u2019s a farmer turned politician whose career began with a near-accidental run for the board of trustees at a community college. He delved deeply into foreign policy as part of his work for the intelligence committee, and he was respected by Democrats with whom he worked \u2014 until the divisive post\u20132016 election debate changed everything.\n\n\n\nImmigrants in the Fields\n\nThe backstory of Devin Nunes begins not really in Washington or California but in the Azores, a tiny group of islands more than 800 miles off the coast of Portugal. These distant, isolated volcanic islands, settled in the 1400s, offered a harsh and difficult life. Inhabitants faced starvation, harsh weather, and earthquakes. Ships crossing the Atlantic stopped regularly in the Azores, and the locals often felt tempted by the thought of new life on a distant shore; some joined the gold rush to California in 1849.\n\nNunes\u2019s grandparents came from the Azores and, like many other Portuguese, settled in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, which holds some of the best land for farming in the country, or perhaps on earth. Previous generations of Portuguese Azorean immigrants and their children had turned to farming after the sheepherding industry declined in the 1870s. This is the region that John Steinbeck wrote about so frequently, a fertile, sunny Eden that offered many opportunities for work \u2014 and at least a slim chance at a fortune and the American dream. As Nunes described it in his 2010 book Restoring the Republic, the valley was \u201ca place where someone with few belongings, little education, and even no ability to speak English could prosper by picking grapes, milking cows, or hoeing cotton fields.\u201d Nunes\u2019s family ultimately worked and saved enough money to buy a 640-acre farm outside Tulare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the agricultural center of the planet,\u201d Nunes boasts. \u201cOver 300 crops grow here, year-round for the most part.\u201d The congressman grew up surrounded by extended family, all working on the farm and finding work on other farms nearby. Family and the land were closely intertwined in this immigrant subculture. Tony Jerome, a Portuguese Azorean immigrant who moved to Turlock, Calif., in 1912, wrote:\n\nSometimes when I am working in the fields, I reach down and get a handful of good clean dirt. It feels warm in the palm of my hand. I let it dribble through my fingers and I feel as if I had just shaken hands with all my ancestors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s little bit of a dying breed now, not a lot of people my age or younger grew up like that,\u201d Nunes tells me. He describes the family milieu:\n\nYou get together for every single birthday, Sunday afternoons are family dinners or lunches, and it\u2019s not just your immediate family, it\u2019s all your aunts and uncles and cousins and great-aunts and uncles and all of that. . . . Until I was a freshman in high school, I grew up with a dozen cousins who were all [aged] within three or four years of me.\n\nWhen the extended Nunes family wasn\u2019t farming, its members were serving in the armed forces. Since his election to Congress in 2002, Nunes has always had cousins and relatives serving in uniform and often in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the moment, Nunes and his wife together have five cousins serving in the military; among them, one is an officer, one just returned from Afghanistan, and one is about to deploy to Afghanistan. The congressman says his many relatives in the military are one of the factors that made him want to join the intelligence committee.\n\nWhen the extended Nunes family wasn\u2019t farming, its members were serving in the armed forces.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the congressman\u2019s father, Anthony Nunes, urged his son to not merely go out and find work but to start his own business. The teenage Devin Nunes and his younger brother, also named Anthony, started their own business, leasing a swather \u2014 a farm instrument that cuts hay or small grain crops such as alfalfa or wheat and forms them into a windrow.\n\n\u201cI went around to neighbors, and my brother and I would do this custom work,\u201d Nunes recalls. He figured his whole life would be in agriculture. \u201cI never pictured myself running for office. I always wanted to be a winemaker and make cheese, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, agricultural life in California\u2019s Central Valley was changing dramatically. Besides the rain, water for the valley\u2019s farms largely came from California\u2019s Central Valley Project, a complex network of dams, reservoirs, canals, hydroelectric power plants, and other facilities, built over five decades. In 1992, Congress passed the Central Valley Improvement Act, sponsored by George Miller, then a Democratic representative from California\u2019s eleventh district, and Bill Bradley, a Democratic senator from New Jersey. The new law diverted at least 800,000 acre-feet of water from agricultural use to preserving wetlands. The Audubon Society called it \u201can ambitious effort to move federal water policy in a more balanced and sustainable direction.\u201d Farmers saw it as diverting water \u2014 water they had enjoyed access to for decades \u2014 out farther west, so far that it ended up in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAmong those farmers convinced that the federal government was taking usable fresh water and diverting it out to the sea in the name of environmentalism was young Devin Nunes. In his teen years and later when he owned his own farm, he found federal policies hitting home.\n\n\u201cThe only land that I could afford [to buy] was the land with the worst water,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cIt\u2019s been 15 years since I sold my land, and a lot of that land out there where I farmed just isn\u2019t being farmed anymore. It\u2019s basically turned back to desert \u2014 not sand, but dry scrub and tumbleweeds. It\u2019s sad to see. There\u2019s beautiful land out there, with very fertile soil\u201d \u2014 presuming, of course, that the soil gets enough water.\n\nIn addition to the fights over water use, Nunes\u2019s future path was shaped in part by an obscure critter, the Tipton kangaroo rat.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the early 1990s, enforcement of the Endangered Species Act grew increasingly controversial, as landowners and the government fought over protections for the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest. During this period, Taiwanese immigrant Taung-Ming Lin bought 700 acres of farmland west of Bakersfield, Calif., on the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service contended that it sent Lin a certified letter explaining that endangered species, including the Tipton kangaroo rat, lived on his land; they urged him to work with the service on a habitat-conservation plan. Lin insisted he never saw the letter.\n\nOn February 20, 1994, armed federal agents arrested Lin, charging that he had tilled land he allegedly knew to be the home of three endangered species: the San Joaquin Valley kit fox, the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and the Tipton kangaroo rat. Lin faced up to three years in jail and $300,000 in fines.\n\nThe soft-spoken immigrant, who spoke little English, turned into an unlikely symbol of government overreach and trampled property rights. The late Tony Snow wrote about Lin\u2019s case in his syndicated column, noting that \u201ca squadron of more than two dozen state and federal agents, accompanied by helicopters, descended on the farm.\u201d (Agents disputed that they used helicopters.) Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio program.\n\nThe controversy even caught the eye of Donald Trump. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, the future president told the story of Lin. \u201cThese regulations begin with the assumption that hardworking, thrifty people deserve to be treated like common criminals,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAnd they are all but designed to kill jobs and opportunity.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors ultimately decided to drop criminal charges after Lin agreed to pay $5,000 to a fund to preserve endangered species.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in politics because of what the government did to my family, to my region, to where I live and the people I represent.\u2019 \u2014 Devin Nunes\n\n\u201cWhen all this is happening, I\u2019m trying to make payments by the month,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cWe were the guinea pig. And that\u2019s what drove me into politics. I\u2019m in politics because of what the government did to my family, to my region, to where I live and the people I represent.\u201d\n\nBack in the early Nineties, Cathy Abernathy was chief of staff to Representative Bill Thomas, who would go on to become chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. She remembers Nunes as an enthusiastic teenager showing up at town halls, asking detailed questions about federal water policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a shock to see a young person so astute on federal policies!\u201d she says.\n\nAfter high school, Nunes attended the College of the Sequoias, a two-year community college in Visalia, and then he spent three years completing a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree at California Polytechnic State University, at San Luis Obispo. About a month after getting his master\u2019s degree, Nunes\u2019s grandfather passed away, and he started working with his uncle managing his grandmother\u2019s dairy farm \u2014 as well as working on his own farmland.\n\nIn 1996, Nunes\u2019s community college announced a controversial decision to sell the farmland used for the school\u2019s vocational training. Farmers had donated the land, and the college planned to use the profits from the land sale to build new buildings: \u201cbuilding more bureaucracy on campus,\u201d as Nunes saw it.\n\nOne of his former community-college professors heard that Nunes had worked at political campaign fundraisers during his time at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and he reached out, urging Nunes to help two students who planned to run against the sitting president on the college\u2019s board of trustees. But Nunes\u2019s experience had been vastly overstated by the rumor mill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a damn thing about running a campaign, I had parked cars and poured wine,\u201d Nunes recalls with a laugh.\n\nNunes speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill, March 24, 2017.\n\n\n\u2018Why Don\u2019t You Run?\u2019\n\nNunes agreed to help, but fate had a consequential twist ahead of him: \u201cLiterally the day of the deadline, the two guys who had been talking about running both backed out and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you run?\u2019\u201d\n\nNunes drove out to the farm of Ron Quinn. The father of a college friend and housemate, Quinn grew to become a mentor to Nunes and, as Nunes puts it, \u201ckind of like my godfather.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Oh yeah, you\u2019re going to win, and I\u2019m going to help you.\u2019 I thought he was going to tell me, \u2018No, don\u2019t run!\u2019\u201d Nunes says. \u201cIt\u2019s the little things that happen in life. If he had said \u2018You\u2019re out of your mind,\u2019 I would have never done it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was nervous because he was young,\u201d Quinn says. (At 22 going on 23, Nunes was younger than the average student at the College of the Sequoias.)\n\nI said, \u201cYour personality, and your stature, you\u2019re going to win. . . . We need younger generations, your generation, to start getting involved with what\u2019s going on in our community. We\u2019re an ag-based community. You grew up in agriculture. You know what kind of problems we\u2019re having. You\u2019re really schooled in this, you\u2019ll be really good at this.\u201d\n\nQuinn remembered a prophetic observation: \u201cI said, \u2018You never know what can happen after that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe defeated a guy who was in his sixties, a well-established real savvy guy,\u201d says John Zumwalt, vice president of the College of the Sequoias, who served as college-board president when Nunes was on the board. \u201cHe was a 22-year-old kid, and we were in our fifties and sixties, so we were . . .\u201d He paused to chuckle. \u201cReal skeptical of him when he first came on. It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize that this was a kid with potential. He ended up being a leader.\u201d\n\nOnce on the college board, Nunes played a key role in moving the agricultural vocational program from Visalia, where the property had been increasingly surrounded by housing, to a new, expansive college farm in Tulare.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe and another board member had the vision to see that if you put a farm down there and made it big enough, that someday it might be a college,\u201d Zumwalt says, meaning a new branch campus about 16 miles away. \u201cSure enough. He was driven to make sure the ag program was sound. It had been a hodge-podge when he first came in. Now it\u2019s a first-class program.\u201d\n\nThe college\u2019s Tulare center now consists of a 500-acre site that includes 220 acres of farmland.\n\nAs a young, up-and-coming Republican in one of the few remaining heavily GOP parts of the state, Nunes got to know, and built useful relationships with, lots of local Republicans. None would prove to be more consequential than former congressman Bill Thomas, the Republican who chaired the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee from 2001 to 2006 and represented a large portion of the valley. Another key player was Thomas\u2019s staffer Kevin McCarthy, who went on to run for Congress himself and is today the House majority leader.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Nunes\u2019s ambitions turned to Washington, perhaps a bit too early. He announced a bid in California\u2019s 20th congressional district against Democrat Cal Dooley, who had represented the region since 1990. Nunes, then only 25 years old, fell short of the Republican nomination by about 1,100 votes.\n\n\u201cHe just wasn\u2019t well known enough,\u201d Quinn says, pointing out that the district lines at that time covered some of Fresno\u2019s more urban, less agriculture-focused suburbs.\n\nIn 2000, Nunes volunteered on the presidential campaign of George W. Bush. He was torn between the desire to work for the administration and the desire to stay close to his family and farm. After Bush won, Nunes was appointed to his ideal job, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s state director of rural development.\n\n\u201cThat was the coolest job you could ever have,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cI was all over the state and still able to farm, and still able to serve on the community-college board.\u201d\n\nThe 2000 census added a U.S. House seat to California, and the state\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature set out to redraw the lines for maximum partisan advantage. But the process of creating safe Democratic-leaning seats left a large Republican-leaning chunk of the San Joaquin Valley that included less of Fresno. The 2002 election was the first under the new district lines. Nunes ran again, facing the top two primary rivals, state assemblyman Mike Briggs and former Fresno mayor Jim Patterson. Briggs and Patterson represented the Fresno area, while Nunes, who had now served in an influential USDA position, had the votes of Tulare County more or less to himself.\n\nNunes\u2019s campaign strategist for that 2002 race was Mark Abernathy. Cathy Abernathy, his wife, recalls:\n\n[Mark] advised Devin that water didn\u2019t poll highly with the average voter, so it was important to explain it. Devin insisted upon making it the issue in his campaign. He stuck to the issues of water and agriculture, and slowly climbed ahead over four months.\n\nNunes won the three-way primary with 37 percent, and the general election that November with 70 percent. Since then, Nunes has never won less than 62 percent of the vote; he ran unopposed in 2010.\n\nNunes with Senator Ted Cruz and other lawmakers at the State of the Union speech, January 30, 2018.\n\n\nWelcome to D.C.\n\nWhen Nunes took the oath of office, he was 29, the second-youngest member in the House of Representatives. Nunes recounts an early conversation with Thomas about being the fresh-faced kid in the hallways of the Capitol Building:\n\nI asked him, \u201cBeing this age, is anybody going to think lesser, or greater, one way or the other about me?\u201d And he said, \u201cYou see that card you\u2019ve got there?\u201d He pointed to my voting card. He said, \u201cEverybody got here some way just like you, and your vote counts as much as anybody else\u2019s. You\u2019re not going to have any problems.\u201d\n\nOf course, a preexisting relationship with the House Ways and Means Committee chairman doesn\u2019t hurt. And he also struck up a friendship with another particularly young member of the House Republican Caucus, a wonky numbers-focused Wisconsinite named Paul Ryan.\n\n\u201cDevin\u2019s been working on fiscal issues with me since he got to Congress,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHe was an early supporter of the Road Map,\u201d Ryan\u2019s far-reaching budget proposal. \u201cAnd he played a big role in advancing tax reform for years, long before we actually achieved it.\u201d\n\nFor most of his early terms in Congress, Nunes had little profile outside of his district and his colleagues \u2014 which was how his constituents liked it, seeing him as a tenacious fighter in their crusade for more water.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a person who can really focus,\u201d says Connie Conway, the former Republican minority leader of the California Assembly from Tulare. \u201cHe can be a bulldog. He\u2019s not backing down, the way some people have. In California, it\u2019s easy to get worn down by the [Democratic] majority and their constant criticism.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the San Joaquin Valley faced increasingly serious drought conditions. Year after year, Nunes kept pushing Congress and, in particular, his state\u2019s Democratic senators to provide relief to the region. He wanted to see more water flowing through the Central Valley Project canals to the valley farmers, and less steered west to the oceans. The House kept passing legislation, but it often died in the Senate, and the Obama administration signaled its opposition.\n\n\n\n\nNunes\u2019s persistence finally bore fruit in late 2016, when Congress passed and President Obama signed legislation that included $335 million for water-storage projects; the law also eased limits on moving water south of the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta to help San Joaquin Valley farmers. The bill\u2019s language was hashed out by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative McCarthy; it was one of the rare splits between Feinstein and fellow California Democratic senator Barbara Boxer, who called the bill \u201cugly,\u201d \u201cwrong,\u201d and \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\nJohn Boehner became House Majority Leader in 2005 and started arranging for GOP members to take trips to places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Nunes joined Boehner on those trips, which usually would occur twice a year. Nunes had declared his 2002 bid shortly after 9/11, and members of the extended Nunes clan, wearing the country\u2019s uniform, kept heading off to war.\n\nWhen Boehner became Speaker after the 2010 GOP wave, he put Nunes on the intelligence committee; by all accounts, he fit in fine. Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is now the ranking member on the intelligence committee and who has become one of Nunes\u2019s toughest critics, once had high praise for him, telling the Fresno Bee in April 2014, \u201cI have always been impressed by him. He works in a very bipartisan way.\u201d\n\nHe has found himself on a creaky, nearly century-old barge, loaded up with trucks and livestock, crossing the Danube River at a remote spot in Eastern Europe, and driving through the Balkans, following the paths of Syrian civil-war refugees.\n\nMembership on the intelligence committee meant that Nunes was soon traveling to far-flung corners of the earth, and he quickly made clear he wanted more than the usual embassy meetings and tours of capital cities. In 2011, he and Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas drove eight hours along the Indian side of the India\u2013Pakistan border, starting in Kashmir. He has found himself on a creaky, nearly century-old barge, loaded up with trucks and livestock, crossing the Danube River at a remote spot in Eastern Europe, and driving through the Balkans, following the paths of Syrian civil-war refugees.\n\nLast year, while visiting a North African country (he can\u2019t disclose certain details about his trips), Nunes\u2019s convoy, protected by about 25 members of a security force loyal to the head of state, encountered ten members of rival local police forces. A tense showdown ensued. Through the window of his bulletproof vehicle, Nunes saw \u201ctwo guys with 9 millimeters [pistols] pointed at each other\u2019s heads.\u201d Thankfully, after a few minutes, cooler heads prevailed, and Nunes\u2019s convoy was allowed to pass.\n\nIn 2014, Nunes wanted to meet with a representative of a Libyan faction that opposed the Muslim Brotherhood and that was not favored by the Obama administration. In a Middle Eastern country that wasn\u2019t Libya, Nunes returned to his hotel late at night from his scheduled meetings, waited for his security and embassy escort to leave, and then snuck out, grabbed a taxi, and headed to a secret meeting \u2014 with the entire leadership team of the faction.\n\n\u201cWe go off the beaten path, taking cars and trains,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cYou can only truly learn what\u2019s going on in a country if you talk to people outside the bubble. In my mind, if I meet with someone and they\u2019re just repeating the conventional wisdom or reading talking points, it\u2019s a red flag\u201d that there\u2019s something more to uncover.\n\nIn March 2014, Mike Rogers, then chairman of the intelligence committee, announced his intention to retire. The House Steering Committee decides most committee chairmanships, but the chairman of the intelligence committee is picked by the House speaker alone. Several members of the intel panel had more experience than Nunes did, but they had either already served as chairman or they were set to chair other important panels: Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas was expected to become the next chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Jeff Miller of Florida was already chairman of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, and Peter King of New York already chaired a key subcommittee of the Homeland Security\u00a0Committee.\n\nBoehner selected his longtime ally, and Nunes, at 41, became the youngest committee chairman in Congress.\n\n\n\n\nHis first day on the job as chairman was the day of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris, and he quickly earned goodwill from the panel\u2019s Democrats. Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the committee\u2019s former top Democrat, called Nunes a \u201cgood man\u201d in the Fresno Bee back in 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, he\u2019s hardworking, and he\u2019s taking his job very seriously.\u201d By December of that year, Nunes and ranking member Schiff had worked out a previously thorny disagreement on the Intelligence Authorization Act.\n\nNunes is an unlikely candidate to be, in Pelosi\u2019s term, a \u201cTrump stooge.\u201d He didn\u2019t endorse any of the Republican candidates for president in the 2016 primary, and he never had a conversation with Trump until the summer of 2016. Nor does Nunes share in Trump\u2019s skepticism that Russia would attempt to hack sensitive information at the DNC or try to influence the election. A month before the election, Nunes told reporters it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that Russia would target U.S. political organizations.\n\nNor is there much evidence that Nunes is a fan of Russia, or outside of the Republican foreign-policy mainstream. He supported trade-promotion authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, doesn\u2019t believe the country can sufficiently screen Syrian refugees, and opposed the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn 2014, he denounced the \u201cshameless propaganda\u201d of RT, the Kremlin\u2019s flagship international media outlet. And, in an op-ed in the Washington Times, he warned: \u201cWhile [Vladimir Putin] may be willing to sacrifice Russia\u2019s own economy for his geo-political ambitions, we cannot afford to be a mere bystander as his destabilizing actions begin to threaten the economies of the Baltics and other NATO allies, possibly including our own.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, he joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers urging the Obama administration to authorize the transfer of \u201clethal, defensive weapons systems to the Ukrainian military.\u201d In an appearance on CNN in April 2016, he criticized the Obama administration for being too soft with Putin:\n\nAfter the Georgian invasion, maybe we thought some diplomacy might work. Clearly, after the invasion of Crimea, that should have been a red line, and we immediately should have moved quickly in to bolster our NATO allies. But instead we continued to negotiate with the Russians, we continued to talk to the Russians, and then they invaded Eastern Ukraine. We missed that. Then we completely missed entirely when they put a new base with aircraft into Syria. We missed it, we were blind. . . . We misjudged Putin for many, many years.\n\nNunes joined Trump\u2019s transition team three days after the election and recommended James Mattis to be secretary of defense, and his congressional colleague Mike Pompeo to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nBut Nunes\u2019s past stances were forgotten as Democrats touted Russian meddling as the most satisfying explanation for the president\u2019s surprise victory and as President Trump publicly fumed about the FBI\u2019s investigation of his campaign. Nunes\u2019s relatively good relationship with the president, and his belief that the FBI and Department of Justice had abused their powers in the run-up to the 2016 election, spurred an avalanche of criticism \u2014 some fair, and much downright unhinged.\n\nIn November, Andrew Janz, a Democratic congressional candidate, unveiled a billboard that depicts Trump and Nunes on Putin\u2019s leash. In January, MSNBC contributor John Heilemann asked Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy on air, \u201cIs it possible that we actually have a Russian agent running the House Intel Committee on the Republican side?\u201d\n\nNunes is no Russian agent, but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t willing to lock horns with top officials in the intelligence community and federal law enforcement.\n\nNunes questions FBI director James Comey during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee in March 2017.\n\n\nThe FBI and the FISA Court\n\nThe FBI and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are going to need to make \u201cmajor changes,\u201d Nunes says.\n\nThey don\u2019t even know what hit them yet. I\u2019ve been trying to tell DOJ and FBI, \u201cLook, your best [move] is to get in front of this.\u201d In fact, I begged them. I said, \u201cLook, you guys, I didn\u2019t even want to come out with the memo. But if you guys aren\u2019t going to investigate this, if you\u2019re not going to appoint either a second special counsel or give us some confidence that something\u2019s going to happen . . . \u201d All they would do is say, \u201cWell, there\u2019s an IG investigation.\u201d That is not what I was talking about. There was a big disagreement between myself and my committee members [on one side] and the top people at DOJ and FBI [on the other]. They\u2019re a little bit in denial. And I think that the longer they stay in that position, crouched down, thinking they can weather this . . . They haven\u2019t seen anything yet. You can only imagine the amendments that are going to come on the floor come appropriations-bill time in a couple of months. It\u2019s going to be ugly. And by them not getting in front of it, it\u2019s going to make it worse.\n\nIn its initial application for a wiretap on Carter Page, the FBI told the FISA court, in a footnote: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d The description is technically accurate but painfully generic; we now know that opposition researcher Christopher Steele was being paid indirectly by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cThe footnote that they\u2019re so hot to talk about, from our perspective, that was evidence that they actually went out of their way to not tell the court,\u201d Nunes says, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s a cute lawyer trick to somewhere down the line be able to say, \u201cOh yeah, we did tell you.\u201d It was kind of like an escape hatch. Just come right out and say, \u201cHey judge, the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for this dossier, they hired this Christopher Steele guy to go talk to Russians.\u201d That\u2019s the right way to handle it, and that\u2019s what the American people expect, and if we\u2019re going to have secret courts, they damn sure should expect total and full transparency when something of this nature happens.\n\nThere\u2019s another detail indicating that an even less reliable source was involved in getting the information to the FBI. On February 8, former State Department special envoy to Libya Jonathan Winer wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that in late September 2016 he met with Sidney Blumenthal. Speaking of Blumenthal, Winer wrote: \u201cHe showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.\u201d Winer said he let Steele keep a copy of the Shearer notes, and \u201cI learned later that Steele did share them \u2014 with the FBI, after the FBI asked him to provide everything he had on allegations relating to Trump, his campaign and Russian interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nIn other words, at least some information was passed through notorious Clinton attack dog Blumenthal to Winer, who then passed it to Steele, who then passed it to the FBI. This is the same Sidney Blumenthal whom his colleagues\u00a0nicknamed \u201cGrassy Knoll\u201d for his paranoia\u00a0when he worked in the White House, who was rebuked in the courtroom for his false characterization of grand-jury proceedings during the Ken Starr investigation, who was obsessed with a mythical \u201cwhitey tape\u201d in the 2008 Democratic primary, and whom the Obama team deemed too dishonest and unethical to work in the State Department under Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn 2003, in a Slate essay titled \u201cInsidious Sid,\u201d Michael Isikoff wrote of Blumenthal: \u201cHe rearranges facts, spins conspiracy theories, impugns motives, and besmirches the character of his political and journalistic foes \u2014 all for the greater cause of defending the Clintons (and himself). . . . Distortion is standard fare for Blumenthal.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t prove that the entire Trump dossier is entirely false \u2014 only that one of the most dishonest figures ever to haunt Washington had a hand in assembling its material. It is very difficult to imagine a scenario in which the FBI would carefully consider statements from comparably controversial figures (say, Roger Stone or Alex Jones) alleging\u00a0crimes committed by Hillary Clinton.\n\nA key question before Nunes and his committee overlaps with an investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz. The IG\u2019s office is trying to determine why Andrew McCabe, deputy director at the FBI in autumn of 2016, appeared to take no action for about three weeks on a request to examine a batch of Hillary Clinton emails that contained classified information. The emails were discovered during an investigation of Anthony Weiner, the ex-husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. McCabe left the FBI in January; the IG report is expected sometime this spring. A Washington Post report on March 1 said that the IG\u2019s office has already concluded that McCabe leaked information inappropriately and then misled investigators.\n\nNunes sees a pattern: FBI senior leaders were moving cautiously and glacially on a matter related to Clinton, but they were determined to dig into Carter Page\u2019s electronic communications as quickly as possible.\n\nPut the FISA request alongside 1) McCabe\u2019s decisions, 2) the FBI chief of counterespionage Peter Strzok\u2019s softening of the language in James Comey\u2019s July 5 statement that he would not recommend prosecution of Hillary Clinton, and 3) the anti-Trump comments in texts between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page . . . and Nunes sees a pattern: FBI senior leaders were moving cautiously and glacially on a matter related to Clinton, but they were determined to dig into Carter Page\u2019s electronic communications as quickly as possible.\n\nHe lays out the core issue:\n\nThe obvious challenge here is, \u201cIs it ever okay to use the FISA court to open up a counterintelligence investigation into another campaign?\u201d That, in my book, is a big no-no, and when you go one step further and you use the FISA court to get a warrant on somebody within one campaign, using dirt from the other campaign, that is totally unacceptable. If the media would actually cover that, 80 percent of Americans would be on one side. Maybe 90.\n\nOn March 1, Nunes wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, citing the FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide. The guide states: \u201cAccuracy of information contained within FISA applications is of utmost importance. . . . Only documented and verified information may be used to support FBI applications to the court.\u201d Nunes asked Sessions whether those protocols were changed, and if not, what steps the DOJ or FBI had taken to hold accountable the officials who used the dodgy Steele dossier, with its unverified information, as part of the FISA application.\n\nAll of this would naturally be a formula for tension with the new FBI director, Christopher Wray, but Nunes characterizes his relationship with Wray as productive:\n\nI like Wray, and I told him, \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you to clean this up. We want to support you.\u201d But so far, we haven\u2019t seen it yet. That doesn\u2019t mean It\u2019s not going to happen. I think we need to give him a lot more time and space to see if he can perform. It\u2019s not like the guy walked into easy shoes to fill here, with all the problems that were left.\n\nNow Nunes seems to run into new controversies like clockwork, disputes and accusations that he dismisses as partisan nonsense. In April 2017, the House Ethics Committee opened up an investigation into claims that he had illegally disclosed classified information when he said he\u2019d found evidence to support the president\u2019s claim he\u2019d been illegally wiretapped at Trump Tower. (There seems to have been no wiretapping of Trump Tower, but the FISA surveillance did include wiretapping Page.) In December, the House Ethics Committee announced that it had consulted with classification experts in the intelligence community and concluded that the information that Nunes disclosed was not classified.\n\nIn February, Fox News reported that Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, had extensive contact last year with Adam Waldman, a Washington lawyer and a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch who was offering Warner access to former British spy and dossier author Christopher Steele. The report quoted text messages between Warner and Waldman. The Fox News report said the messages \u201cwere obtained from a Republican source.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported March 1 that Warner and the Senate panel chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, had met with House speaker Paul Ryan in February to complain about Nunes, blaming Nunes for the leak. But after the Times report came out, Burr told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that much of the paper\u2019s account was flat wrong. He denied that the Senate Intelligence Committee had concluded that Nunes or House Republicans were behind the leak of the Warner texts. He also denied that they he and Warner had raised their concerns with Ryan. \u201cWe met with Speaker Ryan to update him on our investigation,\u201d Burr told Raju. \u201cThat was it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not investigating Warner, we don\u2019t give a sh** about him,\u201d Nunes tells me. The copies of the texts had been sent by a law firm to the staff of the House Intelligence Committee, he says, and the staffers quickly realized they didn\u2019t want to start snooping in the communications of their Senate counterparts. \u201cNo member [of the committee] looked at them. The staff looked at them and said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to have anything to do with this.\u2019\u201d He said the documents were sent back to the law firm.\n\nNunes dismisses the accusation that the House Intelligence Committee has grown more divided and contentious on his watch: \u201cThere was a toxic environment on the Intelligence Committee for many, many years, because of the Iraq War and the intelligence leading up to the war. It started under [former chairman] Porter Goss and got worse, to the point where the committee didn\u2019t operate.\u201d\n\nThree of Nunes\u2019s predecessors as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee had a previous career tie to one of the agencies the committee oversees. By comparison, Nunes is a true outsider.\n\nThe tensions on the committee did alleviate somewhat during Obama\u2019s presidency, but it\u2019s worth remembering that for several years the chairman was Mike Rogers, who had spent five years as an FBI special agent, and the ranking member was Ruppersberger, whose home district includes the headquarters of the National Security Agency. The two men were, at least in the broadest sense, sympathetic to their former employers and key constituents.\n\nIn fact, three of Nunes\u2019s predecessors as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee had a previous career tie to one of the agencies the committee oversees: Rogers with the FBI; Texas Democrat Silvestre Reyes worked for the U.S. Border Patrol for 26 years; and Florida Republican Porter Goss spent a decade working in the clandestine services of the Central Intelligence Agency. By comparison, Nunes is a true outsider.\n\n\u201cThe more time that I\u2019ve been involved in this, [I\u2019ve learned that] the fewer people you have who come from the agencies or the area that\u2019s represented, the better off you are to oversee them,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that you can\u2019t learn if you spend time studying it.\u201d\n\n\nNunes doesn\u2019t expect the denunciations from Democrats or the on-background criticism from members of the agencies he oversees to cease any time soon. While amiable, he\u2019s not here to make friends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really judge this by, \u2018Is the committee bipartisan? Do people cooperate?\u2019 I don\u2019t really give a damn about that,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cWhat I care about is: Do you have members doing their work? Are they doing their work in an honest, hard-working fashion to get to the truth, whatever the truth is? Our job is to oversee these agencies, and when they go awry, to rein them in. That\u2019s our job. We\u2019re the legislative branch of government. We created these guys, and they\u2019re not above the law. And they\u2019re going to be reined in for as long as I\u2019m chairman.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "J.

Newman once shared an anecdote of watching a man stubbornly attempt to force a vending machine to accept a particularly tattered dollar bill. After one failed attempt too many, he finally exploded, \u201cGODDAMN Trudeau!\u201d The day PET died, September 28, 2000, my favorite radio chat show featured caller after caller spitting out some form of \u201cGood riddance,\u201d as the host sarcastically mourned the \u201cdearly departed.\u201d Books could (and have been) written about the precise reasons why the old man Trudeau was as loathed as he was; suffice it to say his unique style of imperious leftism saddled the nation with a heavy legacy whose burden was widely borne.\n\nPierre\u2019s adult son, Justin, was introduced to Canada at his father\u2019s funeral, giving a hammy eulogy (he literally began it \u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d) that grated like sandpaper on the radio-caller types, but the press spun it as Churchillian brilliance. It immediately became evident that a Justinian succession was going to be foisted on Canadians at some point or another, though it took Justin himself a while to clue in. After his father\u2019s death, the dauphin spent eight years wandering the landscape as a celebrity dilettante, doing nothing in particular and exerting scant effort to brand himself as politically curious in any way. After an underwhelming entry to parliament in 2008, he was abruptly made head of the Canadian Liberals in 2013, at a time when the party was in such desperate straits it had no choice but to break glass and embrace the foretold. His first years on the job were marked by near-constant gaffes of Dan Quayleian proportion.\n\nThe best American analogy I can offer is that Justin Trudeau\u2019s rise was like the 2016 presidential election encapsulated in a single person \u2014 the grim, monarchical \u201cinevitability\u201d of Hillary Clinton coupled with the \u201cIs this seriously happening?\u201d bizarreness of Donald Trump. To a great many Canadians, the notion that Justin Trudeau, Justin Trudeau, Pierre\u2019s dopey, silver-spoon kid, somehow wound up as prime minister evokes an incredulity akin to those who can\u2019t believe the host of The Apprentice now sits in the Oval Office.\n\nRuler of Canada since 2015, Trudeau has emerged a poster boy for what\u2019s now called the social-justice Left, and conservatives the world over have learned to hate him as a sort of human manifestation of \u201csafe spaces and checked privileges,\u201d as Stephen Daisley recently summarized. I must confess I have a hard time giving him even that much credit. Like everything else in his fortunate life, Trudeau\u2019s current identity as social-justice warrior par excellence seems like just one more thing he\u2019s blindly stumbled into, egged on by handlers and journalists much smarter than him.\n\nHis ghostwritten memoir, Common Ground (2014), and an equally outsourced 2015 speech at McGill University \u2014 both billed as revealing windows into his worldview \u2014 offered little hint of any ambitious progressive philosophy, and instead simply rationalized standard Liberal Party boilerplate. If his pre\u2013prime ministerial mind had any truly passionate preoccupation, it was appeasing French-Canadian nationalism \u2014 a dated, parochial concern his father nevertheless regarded as the existential purpose of Canadian politics.\n\nIn short, the most accurate read of Trudeau would posit him less a committed ideologue than a mediocre actor who hasn\u2019t fully learned his lines (which, incidentally, also describes one of his many short-lived pre-political careers). To put it another way, despite some predictions to the contrary, the future of progressive rule probably won\u2019t resemble Trudeau\u2019s all that much \u2014 it\u2019ll be far worse.\n\nIn more competent, determined hands, the postmodernist new-new-left ideology Trudeau is said to embody would present a far more aggressive threat to rights of free expression, conscience, and association than Trudeau\u2019s often muddled and confused administration has so far pursued. (One reason we hear so much about his virtue-signaling and PR stunts is that he doesn\u2019t seem to have much interest in actually governing.) This isn\u2019t to say the actions his government has taken to date, such as passing laws denying right of dissent on the transgender issue, making summer-job subsidies for students conditional on their employers\u2019 supporting \u201cthe right to access safe and legal abortions,\u201d and to shove identity politics into places where they manifestly do not belong, such as NAFTA negotiations and assessments of natural-resource projects, have not been awful in their own way. It\u2019s merely that the instincts inspiring such initiatives will manifest in far more sweeping, tyrannical fashion once held by a more ideologically committed and competent government.\n\nIn more competent, determined hands, the postmodernist new-new-left ideology Trudeau is said to embody would present a far more aggressive threat to rights of free expression, conscience, and association.\n\nSuch foreshadowing, incidentally, should serve as reminder of the inescapable importance of a robust system of checks and balances, particularly the oft-overlooked importance of anticipatory checks as a means of balancing the excesses of a future regime.\n\n\nOne of the most substantial critiques that deserves to be leveled at Trudeau\u2019s Tory predecessor, Stephen Harper, is that he gave the matter of safeguarding the future such little evident thought. Compared with the United States, the Canadian executive enjoys sweeping, unilateral power, yet Harper failed to entrench, in any branch of government, conservatives destined to outlast his personal control of the prime minister\u2019s office. He did not appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court, nor did he expend the political capital necessary to reform Canada\u2019s sclerotic, appointed Senate into an elected chamber where conservatives could exercise meaningful legislative influence, even under Liberal prime ministers. As a result, Trudeau\u2019s government today enjoys a free rein moderated only by its own amateurism.\n\nIt\u2019s a concern to keep in mind as Americans battle for control of their own Senate later this year. Republican control of that chamber is often spoken of exclusively in the context of President Trump \u2014 will it be submissive or assertive, and so forth. Yet because senators serve six-year terms and Trump\u2019s tenure beyond 2021 is hardly guaranteed, a strong conservative presence in the legislature provides not merely supervision for the present moment but insurance against the inevitable emergence of an American Trudeau, who, like most American things, will almost certainly prove more sophisticated and substantial than the Canadian version.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "A combination photo shows U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, March 8, 2018, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Mike Pompeo on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., February 13, 2018 respectively.

Barney Frank (right) after signing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in Washington, July 21, 2010. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Jim  Senate has passed a bill with bipartisan support.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would roll back parts of Dodd-Frank. The vote was 67\u201331, with 17 members of the Democratic caucus breaking party lines. If the legislation passes the House and is signed, it will be the largest change to the controversial financial-reform package since it became law in 2010.\n\nA major focus of the reform, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, is correcting the unintended harm Dodd-Frank has caused to smaller banks around the country. Dodd-Frank imposed 28,000 new restrictions on banking activities, and larger banks proved more capable of complying with them.\n\n\nCredit unions and local banks have been disappearing under the pressure, at a rate, according to government figures, of one per day since Dodd-Frank. This has led to a consolidation of the industry, eliminating competition and ultimately boosting the big banks all the more. Consumers may have been victims as well: Three-quarters of banks offered customers free checking with no minimum balance in 2009, a number that had been rising for decades; by 2012 it was below 40 percent, where it remained last year.\n\nSupporting Dodd-Frank has become something of a Democratic responsibility: The legislation was a victory of the Obama administration, it\u2019s a major boot on the throat of Wall Street, and it created Elizabeth Warren\u2019s lapdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. So the victory in the Senate is a sign that moderate Democrats are beginning to side with conservatives who see Dodd-Frank as anti\u2013Main Street as much as it\u2019s anti\u2013Wall Street.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Senate floor to radio interviews, Democrats from Jon Tester (D., Mon.) to Gary Peters (D., Mich.) pointed to banks in their states hurt by the law and pledged to relieve the pressure. Even blue-state senator and former Clinton vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine (D., Va.) voted for the reform. While critics of the bill are claiming the moderate Democrats\u2019 votes came from reelection fears, rather than genuine concern about economic harm, the numbers don\u2019t back them up: Just seven of the Democratic \u201cyes\u201d votes were from senators running for reelection in Trump-won states, and three red-state senators facing reelection voted \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe reform focuses on community banks, which Dodd-Frank defines as those with less than $10 billion in assets. (\u201cBig\u201d banks have more than $250 billion in assets; mid-size banks fall in between.)\n\nLenders making 500 or fewer mortgages a year will now be exempt from mortgage-data reporting requirements. Critics of the bill claim it will allow such banks to discriminate against black or Hispanic borrowers; supporters retort that the rules are too costly to comply with, and that the reporting requirements are unlikely to cause a significant decrease in lending discrimination. The bill also exempts community banks from the Volcker rule, which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in certain types of proprietary trading \u2014 swapping their funds for profit \u2014 and restricts hedge-fund and private-equity investment.\n\nThe most controversial part of the reform, though, is its redefinition of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d (or \u201csystemically important\u201d) banks, which at present include institutions above $50 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank requires these institutions to have higher capital cushions and undergo \u201cstress tests,\u201d both ways of verifying that a bank can survive a sudden shock or absorb a certain amount of defaulted debt, and a \u201cliving will,\u201d a plan explaining how to \u201cwind down\u201d the bank in the event it fails.\n\nThe reform raises the threshold to $250 billion, freeing regional banks such as Fifth-Third and SunTrust. Critics say this ignores the fact that banks collapse together \u2014 so the smaller banks should have some verification of survivability too \u2014 while advocates have pointed out that Dodd-Frank was conceived with the mega-banks in mind, not the smaller ones caught up in the shockwaves.\n\nOverall, the reform is not a dramatic walk-back.\n\nOverall, the reform is not a dramatic walk-back. In an interview with Vice News, Barney Frank \u2014 a former congressman from Massachusetts and a co-author of the bill \u2014 pointed out that 95 percent of the original law is unaffected. While the typical anti\u2013Wall Street progressives such as Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Ver.) have criticized the reform effort as giving too much to Wall Street, Dodd-Frank was designed to protect the American economy from a very specific thing: bank failure. Resisting these changes from the platform of \u201cdown with Wall Street\u201d is to forget why Dodd-Frank exists and impose on it a new purpose.\n\n\nThe bill now faces the House, where it\u2019s likely to receive numerous changes. The House passed its own bill in June, the Financial CHOICE Act, but the legislation failed to leave committee in the Senate. The House\u2019s bill is much more severe than the Senate\u2019s and includes provisions that moderate Democrats are unlikely to support.\n\nHopefully the House can settle for a milder, but still effective, reform that Senate Democrats can endorse.

If we could reduce all the arguments to a single question, it might be: How much immigration is good for America? I think most people agree that some amount of immigration is good for our country, and many would argue that some other amount is too much and is therefore bad for America. Where the political parties differ is in their estimate of how much immigration is the optimal amount, whom to allow in, and how to manage the system. They differ on quantity, quality, and control. However, across both sides of the aisle, there is one underlying agreement and unstated assumption: that immigration is good for the immigrant.\n\nIt is valid for Americans, acting in their own interest, to have a discussion about the quantity, quality, and control of our immigration system. And yet as an immigrant, I know that we also need to grapple with other questions that don\u2019t normally take center stage in our public debates on immigration. I want to bring to the forefront a thought that may seem peculiar to many Americans: that immigration is not always an unqualified good. Through discussions with immigrants, I have found that in many cases, the answer is not yes; often it is a qualified yes, and it would help us all to understand why this might be the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration can be a good. But it is good, healthy, and fruitful \u2014 for the immigrant and the adoptive country \u2014 only insofar as the \u00e9migr\u00e9 makes the choice freely. Some will argue that, by default, everyone who comes here (legally or illegally) chooses to do so, since the very act of coming here is an act of free will. I say no: It\u2019s not necessarily a free choice.\n\nIn the Summa Theologiae (I-II.6), St. Thomas Aquinas writes that \u201cviolence is directly opposed to the voluntary.\u201d The word \u201cvoluntary\u201d denotes something arising out of one\u2019s own inclination, that which proceeds from the will. He goes on to say that what we do through fear is \u201cof a mixed character,\u201d voluntary and involuntary. Acting out of fear, \u201cinasmuch it is repugnant to the will,\u201d is involuntary. However, an act that \u201chinders a greater evil that was feared\u201d is voluntary, and therefore willed freely. This understanding of how the will works shows us that the decisions people make to leave their homelands are fraught with complexity, and that some people are here not out of their own free will. And even when they do leave voluntarily to prevent greater harm, leaving can still feel forced because the option to stay in the country of origin was unviable.\n\nWhen a person is trapped between political oppression, religious persecution, war, slavery, poverty, economic upheaval, etc. and the opportunity to flee elsewhere in order to survive, he will choose survival via emigration (legal or illegal). Therefore, an individual in this situation is not quite choosing freely. He makes his choice under duress \u2014 and that is not a truly free choice. As a result, it is not an unqualified good for either the immigrant or the adoptive country.\n\n\n\n\nIn some sense, we know this is happening. We see refugees in the Middle East by the millions fleeing their homelands. Some years back, we saw children coming in waves from Central America to escape violence and brutal gangs that target children for use in the sex and drug trades. There\u2019s no question that for many of these people, coming to America is the best thing that can happen to them.\n\nThe benefits are tangible. They go from chaotic lands to one where they can lead a tranquil life. They leave behind societies where deceit is necessary for survival, and they make their new homes in an orderly country governed by the rule of law. They escape crushing oppression under strongmen and societies built for the powerful and connected. They find respect and dignity in this new land. Hungry and downtrodden and with no economic or education prospects, they arrive in an America where there is plentiful food, material help, and opportunities available to those willing to work hard. Those persecuted for their religion find solace in religious freedom. For those of us fortunate to live in America, the physical and spiritual blessings are many. This happy outcome, however, lulls us into complacency and distracts us from the tougher moral and philosophical questions of immigration.\n\nWhen immigrants are primarily coming to the U.S. to flee violence and fearful conditions in their countries of origin, they are not weighing risks and benefits to make a well-reasoned choice. As new immigrants, they face unknown perils and are exposed to cultural forces that often contradict their own customs and beliefs, leading to family instability, fragmentation, and often dispersion, especially intergenerationally. When they forsake the land of their heritage, they lose their livelihood. Sometimes they lose the value of their education because they cannot practice the profession for which they trained. Some lose all their earthly possessions. They lose their communities and huddle in subcultures to survive cultural disorientation. They lose a sense of who they are and to whom they belong. In short, they are affected economically, morally, physically, psychologically, and socially in unpredictable and sometimes negative ways.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to immigration cannot only be that of the Good Samaritan: have mercy on the immigrant and the refugee and give him a home. That\u2019s the answer sometimes, but it\u2019s not sustainable.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to immigration cannot only be that of the Good Samaritan: have mercy on the immigrant and the refugee and give him a home. That\u2019s the answer sometimes, but it\u2019s not sustainable. The more merciful answer \u2014 the truly good answer \u2014 is to do everything we can to give immigrants and refugees a future and a hope in their own lands.\n\nThe answer to our immigration problems will never be resolved simply through domestic-policy decisions: expanding or restricting the number of immigrants; favoring some countries over others; choosing high-skill workers using a points system, or choosing low-skill workers to \u201cdo the jobs Americans won\u2019t\u201d; preventing an immigrant from sponsoring members outside of his immediate family; dithering over what \u201cimmediate family\u201d means; building walls or opening our border; passing laws to deter migrants either legal or illegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot even a combination of these policy ideas will resolve our immigration problem. Nor can we resolve them by a crass and facile plan that objectifies immigrants, like the one recently posed by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl in Politico Magazine, which recommended that individual citizens \u2014 rather than corporations \u2014 sponsor their own immigrants, put them to work, and reap the economic benefits of an immigrant of their own. (The original title of the essay was \u201cWhat If You Could Get Your Own Immigrant?\u201d After readers expressed outrage, Politico changed it to \u201cSponsor an Immigrant Yourself.\u201d)\n\nThe only lasting and just resolution is to help create a world where people of all nations can stay in the land of their heritage if they choose, where immigration is by choice, rather than by necessity. The goal is not to eliminate immigration altogether but to create a more just world for all peoples. A by-product of such a world might be reduced immigration, but it need not be the goal.\n\nWe have a responsibility to create a better world for everyone, not just ourselves. St. John Paul II said to his audience on World Day of Migrants and Refugees 2000:\n\nThe Church hears the suffering cry of all who are uprooted from their own land, of families forcefully separated, of those who, in the rapid changes of our day, are unable to find a stable home anywhere. She senses the anguish of those without rights, without any security, at the mercy of every kind of exploitation, and she supports them in their unhappiness.\n\nOur unity under God, the call to solidarity, our duty to respect the dignity of fellow human beings, our ethical obligation to love the stranger go beyond welcoming him in our midst. They also require a radical rethinking of our resignation to upheaval in far-distant lands. Rather, as St. John Paul II said, and I am pressing for here: \u201cIt includes the advancement of everyone\u2019s right to be able to live peacefully in his own country.\u201d\n\n\nWe should not accept a world where people are forced \u2014 through violence and fear \u2014 to leave their homeland. The peoples of the world deserve to live in their own lands.

Even now, left-wing action groups coalesce around students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as they lobby for increased gun control, and there has been nary a peep in opposition.\n\nAmong those groups is an ever-present progressive specter, a professional lobbying group in its own right: Planned Parenthood. Along with Everytown for Gun Safety, MoveOn.org, and the Women\u2019s March LA, Planned Parenthood has chipped in to help the students strategize for next month\u2019s March for our Lives rally.\n\nAccording to a recent\u00a0Buzzfeed report, Planned Parenthood is \u201cteaching and hosting trainings\u201d for young activists across the U.S., working with gun-control advocate and former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, and \u201chelping the students with logistics, strategy, and planning for next month\u2019s March for Our Lives rally and beyond.\u201d\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to National Review\u2019s request for clarification regarding the exact nature of its support for the Parkland students.\n\nBut, of course, there have been no charges that these activist groups are exercising improper influence over the political process. Not only are the NRA\u2019s attackers wrong to suggest that the NRA is somehow responsible for the Parkland shooting, but their outrage over its spending is so obviously selective.\n\nNewsweek, for example, pushed back against NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch by pointing out that the NRA spent $5 million on lobbying last year. And several outlets \u2014 not to mention progressive politicians \u2014 have noted the money that GOP politicians accept from the NRA.\n\nBut when Senate Democrats shot down a largely popular 20-week abortion ban last month, there was no Newsweek article noting Planned Parenthood\u2019s lobbying statistics. Nor do mainstream outlets ever point to the campaign contributions that Democratic politicians accept from Planned Parenthood and its close cousin NARAL.\n\nDuring the 2016 election cycle alone, Planned Parenthood\u2019s political-action arms shelled out over $38 million to elect Democratic politicians. In its 2016\u201317 annual report, the group reported spending $40 million on \u201cpublic policy,\u201d as well as upwards of $175 million in such nebulous categories as \u201cmovement building,\u201d \u201cstrengthening and securing Planned Parenthood,\u201d and \u201cengaging communities.\u201d Undoubtedly, much of this money is flooding into the pockets of those who will push for policies that benefit Planned Parenthood\u2019s bottom line by protecting abortion on demand.\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood also \u2014 and unlike the NRA \u2014 rakes in over half a billion dollars in government funding each year. The group then turns around and spends much of that money not only to fund abortion procedures for low-income women (albeit indirectly), but also to lobby the federal government for additional funding and elect Democratic politicians who will vote to eliminate restrictions on that funding, and on abortion itself.\n\nIf the Left and its friends in the media truly cared about the influence of \u201cdark money,\u201d they would bother to report this information about Planned Parenthood instead of enabling the group\u2019s efforts to masquerade as a non-partisan, run-of-the-mill health-care provider.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Arthur Herman", "body": "Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson addresses a joint news conference in Brussels, Belgium on December 5, 2017.  (Francois  the Trump administration, unconventional, assertive thinking about foreign policy is in; ineffectual, process-driven diplomacy is out.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOf all the abrupt comings and goings in this administration, the dismissal of Rex Tillerson is undoubtedly the most important \u2014 maybe one of the most important firings since Harry Truman fired Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War.\n\nBy dismissing MacArthur, Truman drew a firm line between military and civilian authority that no soldier since has dared to cross. By dumping Tillerson, Trump has sent a similarly unambiguous message to the entrenched bureaucracy \u2014 Foggy Bottom\u2019s version of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 and to America\u2019s political elites about the future direction of U.S. foreign policy, hopefully one that will outlast his administration.\n\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s stipulate a couple of things.\n\nFirst, Rex Tillerson is a man of deeply conventional mindset during a deeply unconventional time, a man with no understanding of the rapidly changing face of world trends, especially but not limited to the rise of China as an aggressively revisionist power; Iran\u2019s determined bid for regional hegemony, including getting nuclear weapons; and the fateful dynamic of Russia\u2019s reassertion of its imperial ambitions in Eastern Europe and against the West under Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, Trump almost certainly did not realize this when he appointed Tillerson secretary of state. He probably assumed Tillerson would bring a businessman\u2019s mindset to the job, as a hard-headed negotiator with a shrewd nose for good deals sharpened by years as a CEO of a global energy corporation, ExxonMobil. Above all, he assumed Tillerson would be someone like himself, who would immediately recognize the place of American interests in the world, and fight for those interests with energy and boldness.\n\nTrump thought he was getting a lion in Tillerson. Instead, he was getting a Saint Bernard. Like the breed, Tillerson may be large and imposing at first glance; but he is no fighter, least of all against the bureaucratic mentality that permeates the U.S. State Department.\n\nHere we can stipulate a third point. Virtually every secretary of state since Cordell Hull has suffered one of two fates. Either he or she becomes the president\u2019s representative to the bureaucracy \u2014 and when necessary the ruthless enforcer of the chief executive\u2019s will in Foggy Bottom \u2014 or he or she becomes the bureaucracy\u2019s representative to the president, and assumes the role of bringing the State Department\u2019s views to the chief executive\u2019s attention \u2014 even at times serving as an advocate of those views.\n\nThe latter is what happened to Tillerson. It\u2019s also what happened to Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice when they became secretaries of state \u2014 and Condi, interestingly, was one of the people who most strenuously worked to get Tillerson on the Trump team. She clearly recognized in Tillerson the man who could become the State Department\u2019s watchdog in the Trump cabinet, someone who would uphold its world view revolving around incrementalism and process, and who, when U.S. interests conflict with a globalist agenda favored by elites, e.g. on global warming or the Arab\u2013Israeli \u201cpeace process,\u201d would automatically side with the elites.\n\nThat view includes North Korea and Iran, countries that foreign-policy elites conventionally look at through the lens of nuclear non-proliferation instead of seeing both as dangerous rogue nations who need to be stopped in their tracks. According to reports in the Washington Free Beacon, it was precisely on the issue of Iran that Tillerson ultimately came a cropper. \u201cWhite House allies warned Tillerson\u2019s senior staff for weeks that [his] efforts to save the [Iran] nuclear deal and balk on Trump\u2019s key demands regarding the deal could cost Tillerson his job,\u201d says the Beacon, a prediction that came true on Tuesday.\n\nMike Pompeo promises to be the kind of enforcer Trump will need in order to guide U.S. foreign policy and Foggy Bottom in a more aggressively pro-American direction.\n\nWhat happens next? Tillerson\u2019s successor, Mike Pompeo, promises to be the kind of enforcer Trump will need in order to guide U.S. foreign policy and Foggy Bottom in a more aggressively pro-American direction, especially with regard to Iran, whereas Pompeo as a congressman was deeply skeptical of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal (the congressman\u2019s staff and I worked together on exposing the cash-for-hostage deal in a couple of NRO articles), and on China. He is also the perfect secretary of state to have on hand before the planned meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un.\n\n\nThe other place to keep a sharp eye out for changes in foreign-policy leadership is in the National Security Adviser\u2019s office.\n\nUnconventional, assertive thinking about foreign policy is in; ineffectual, process-driven diplomacy is out, at least under Trump. The result of this year\u2019s midterms may determine how long this new trend lasts, before the deep state and political elites try to recapture their   Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, is the author of 1917: Lenin, Wilson, and the Birth of the New World", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Victor Davis Hanson", "body": "President Trump sits at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office in January. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Kevin  creates hysteria, both rabid antipathies and fervent support.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral chaos surrounds President Trump. Few dispute that. All argue over the origins, causes, and nature of these wild reactions to our president.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Left\u2019s Hatred\nTake the Left\u2019s loathing of Trump that arises from three sources.\n\nFirst, Trump supposedly has no shame. The traditional leftist use of invectives such as \u201cracist,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201chomophobe,\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d appears to have had little effect on Trump \u2014 as it seems to have done on McCain (who in 2008 ruled out attacks on Obama\u2019s personal pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright) and Romney (who passed on standing down debate moderator and rank partisan Candy Crowley).\n\nMore likely, smearing Trump only energizes him to become even more combative and uncouth. In the past, when a progressive tagged a Republican politician as some sort of irredeemable or deplorable bigot, he often inched left in search of penance or to preempt further attacks.\n\nIn the past, when a progressive tagged a Republican politician as some sort of irredeemable or deplorable bigot, he often inched left.\n\nTrump seems to enjoy the tumult, on the strange principle that only fire can tamp down the bias and unprofessionalism of a mostly pampered and overrated media. Does he do so by diminishing the aura and grandeur of the presidency, at least as the office is traditionally defined? Maybe, but half the country is likely to think \u201cHow dare the media smear the president?\u201d rather than \u201cHow dare the president of these United States stoop to reply in kind to petty CNN reporters?\u201d\n\nSecond, of course, Trump is politically dangerous to progressivism. In military terms, he is a strategic B-52 on a deep mission. Trump targets the enemy\u2019s homeland, even as his opponents\u2019 far-flung and attenuated expeditionary armies bog down abroad.\n\n\n\n\nThe Obama era gave us the conventional banality that \u201cdemography is destiny.\u201d A supposedly 67 percent so-called white population would inevitably shrink into electoral insignificance, gnashing its teeth in its \u201cwhite privilege\u201d irrelevance.\n\nAll who declared themselves nonwhite (to the extent that is still possible in a racially mixed, intermarried, often assimilated and integrated America) would grow in number. And they would purportedly vote in accordance with their perceived appearances and tribal affiliations. That calculus would inevitably mean that states such as Georgia and Arizona would soon follow the paradigm of California, Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico: They\u2019d flip blue.\n\nDemocrats accordingly pushed open borders and identity politics to ensure such an electoral utopia. But Trump overflew them and start bombing Democratic strongholds to the rear in more important swing states: Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nBy emphasizing class more than race, Trumpism itself was a potentially more dynamic idea than proportional representation on the basis of superficial appearance. When a Latino landscaper, poor white machinist, or inner-city African-American clerk considers voting for Trump (if as much for cultural or protest reasons as from empathy for his person or approval of his message), he subverts some of the basis of the present progressive party \u2014 a pyramid of enlightened elites at the top adjudicating what is necessary for a broad foundation at the bottom, made up of nonwhites and the supposedly dependent poor. It does not take much of a defection of minority and poor voters to weaken the progressive project, when the percentages of white and working-class voters alienated from it are so large.\n\nEqually explosive is the syndrome in which middle-class moderates and independents are tired of being damned as privileged and biased, on the basis of their appearance \u2014 often by those who enjoy far more privilege and exhibit far more bias. For all the hype that the stereotypical Trump voter was uneducated and without a degree, Trump appealed as much to the college educated and professionals for what he at least was not, rather than for what he was.\n\n\n\n\nThird, Trump earns leftist disdain for being the anti-Obama, much as conservatives feared Obama for being the anti-Reagan. In other words, just as a charismatic Obama sought to overturn the entire Reagan revolution of low taxes, deregulation, smaller government, and strong defense by the sheer force of his person, so too Trump really does threaten to undo Obama\u2019s foreign policy, and energy, tax, regulatory, and education agendas.\n\nBut whereas Obama rammed down an unpopular Obamacare and lost the House in the 2010 midterms, it may be that Trump rammed down a popular tax cut that will not result in a 2010-like backlash. Under Obama, the Democratic party has become the progressive resistance. While heading hard left, it has left the center free to be reclaimed by opportunistic Republicans, as evidenced by substantial gains at the local, state, and congressional levels. Trump could make Obamism irrelevant \u2014 a historical footnote by the end of his first term. That would be especially ironic, given that Obama\u2019s \u201cpen and phone\u201d executive-order mode of governance proved so toxic for progressives in the tit-for-tat hands of Trump.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTrump Voters\nNever Trumpers often feel that Trump\u2019s latest escapes are embarrassingly excused as sophisticated \u201cthree-dimensional chess\u201d by Trump supporters. I have rarely found many Trump voters who believed that. More often, they shrug, saying they wish Trump would curb his tweets, rallies, and ad hominem outbursts.\n\nTo the extent that they do not object enough to Trump\u2019s behavior, it is not because they believe he is a chess master of political strategy. Rather, they assume that, for strange reasons, no one can quite predict the effects of Trump\u2019s weirdness, in a stifling politically correct society. More than half the nation has lost confidence in progressivism, the administrative state, and the Republican hierarchy and establishment. In the past, experts erred in thinking that Trump had so debased the candidacy, or the office, of the presidency that he was sure to implode. In that climate, his supporters are not about to believe that anyone can accurately fathom the ultimate effect of his so-called unpresidential behavior.\n\nWhere critics see chaos, some voters are likely to see clarity and comeuppance.\n\nOther Trump voters no doubt enjoy the ensuing blood sport. They feel that most of his targets have it coming and that the resulting chaos, within limits, is much-needed purging. Out of the daily conundrum, Trump nevertheless has managed so far to achieve greater prosperity at home and stability abroad than did Obama, while the reputation of a habitually prejudiced media is plummeting fast. Where critics see chaos, some voters are likely to see clarity and comeuppance.\n\nWhat would lose Trump his strategically located, and thereby winning, 46 percent of the voting public?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, Trump cannot abandon signature issues that separated him from his 16 primary rivals and helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in key swing states that Democrats had mostly taken for granted since 2008 and in many cases since 1992. For example, Trump cannot embrace amnesty and open borders masquerading as \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d or optional overseas interventions, or major new restrictions on the Second Amendment, or new expansions of pro-abortion laws. If he became a so-called globalist open-borders centrist, Trump could still win 46 percent of the 2020 vote but lose the purple belt from Ohio to North Carolina and with it the Electoral College.\n\nSecond, if Trump keeps boomeranging his own side, at some point his invective could become suicidal. His supporters don\u2019t mind if he descends to spar even with Alec Baldwin or the NFL. They will eventually tire of him if he cruelly continues to dog Jeff Sessions or H. R. McMaster. If his own messengers are the enemy, then at some point he\u2019ll lose the resonance of his message as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNever Trump\nForget for a moment the ethical and moral dimensions of the Never Trump conservative argument, and concentrate on its practical effect. Why did the conservative establishment that loathed Trump \u2014 much of it influential as measured by print and television exposure and by state and federal political offices \u2014 have so few consequences in 2016?\n\nAbout the same percentages of Republican voters chose Trump when the Republican elite was fragmented as went for McCain and Romney, when it was united. That raises unpleasant scenarios.\n\nWere Never Trumpers simply fewer in number and far less influential than they had supposed? Or was the small number of voters swayed by their antipathy more than offset by the greater number of voters energized to oppose Never Trumpism? Did those Tea Party or Reagan Democrat conservatives who did not turn out for a much-praised Romney cost Romney the election, while their enthusiasm in 2016 ensured victory for the much-attacked Trump?\n\n\n\n\nDid Trump\u2019s ascendance snap Never Trumpers into self-realization that they were not of the same ilk as even his reluctant supporters? Or did their frenzied loathing spark Trump\u2019s voters into seeing that his Republican haters were more interested in the style and class of conservativism than in its message and pragmatic ramifications for the American public?\n\nThere are other questions not fully addressed.\n\nOne: Is Trump\u2019s crudity really without precedent in the past? We know that prior presidents on occasion were as gross or grosser than Trump: JFK\u2019s callous seduction of teenage staffers in officio, LBJ\u2019s genitalia exposure, Clinton\u2019s Oval Office bathroom-sex antics, Obama\u2019s crude jokes about \u201ctea-baggers\u201d and the Special Olympics. Then there are the many scandals, from lying about Vietnam, to Watergate, to the recent weaponizing of the IRS, DOJ, and FBI.\n\nSo is the writ that even if Trump\u2019s buffooneries are no more crude than those of past presidents, they are uniquely daily events, rather than infrequent episodes? And is that frequency, rather than the degree of controversy, the reason that conservatives who once pushed Trump\u2019s agendas now condemn those policies as tainted \u2014 because of Trump\u2019s fingerprints on them? Were Clinton\u2019s agendas less of a danger than Trump\u2019s person, as if a hard progressive\u2019s Ivy League background and administrative-state comportment mattered more than the populist conservatism of a combed-over rabble-rouser?\n\nThe media from 2008 to the end of 2016 simply would have thought it racist to report that Obama as a senator did a smiling photo-op in 2005 with anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.\n\nSecond is the matter of media emphases. We\u2019ve never had a president whose media coverage was 90 percent negative. In the past, it would have been unthinkable for a Walter Cronkite to report that LBJ had used the n-word in a private White House conversation or dictated to aides while defecating. The media from 2008 to the end of 2016 simply would have thought it racist to report in detail that Obama as a senator did a smiling photo-op in 2005 with anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan in the basement of the Capitol or that he had damned Israel in a long-suppressed speech in praise of pro-Palestinian advocate Rashid Khalidi.\n\nIt may be the case that Trump is deemed unpresidential and unfit because his bad behavior is more frequent and extreme than that of past presidents, and that this assessment is not a result of virulently anti-Trump media bias. (If an Obama scandalous tree fell loudly in a forest devoid of media, did it really make a sound \u2014 or fall at all?) But so far, the Never Trump movement has not made such an argument convincingly. Trump voters now still believe that the mostly positive message matters more than the flawed messenger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, there are understandably legitimate differences in conservative attitudes toward Trump, the first U.S president without prior political or military experience and service. But should such acrimony extend to the Trump voter?\n\nIn attributing moral or ethical laxity to Trump voters, Never Trumpers sidestep the argument that in a Manichean world, not voting for Trump was a de facto vote for the alternative \u2014 a likely 16-year Obama-Clinton continuum. Is condoning Trump\u2019s antics by default the moral equivalent of its practical antithesis: ensuring a Supreme Court, economy, and foreign policy that would, in conservatives\u2019 views, radically injure millions of Americans for a generation?\n\nIf it were really unethical or foolhardy to vote for Trump, is it by extension far more unethical to serve Trump? In other words, are H. R. McMaster, Jim Mattis, John Kelly, Betsy DeVos, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pompeo far more morally suspect for empowering such a president, in a fashion that outweighs their principled notions of serving the country?\n\nIs it still sustainable to suggest that Trump is not a conservative but a dangerous liberal or demagogic wolf in conservative sheep\u2019s clothing? The doctrinaire conservative Heritage Foundation now claims that two-thirds of its proverbial 334 conservative agenda items have been already met by Trump \u2014 and at a pace far faster than that achieved even by former president Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth, are there Never Trump formulas for presidential candidates and issues that can translate formidable conservative local, state, and congressional successes to the White House, in a way that dozens of past Republican primary and general presidential candidates seemed unable to?\n\nFinally, is there any serious introspection as to why so many misjudged Trump\u2019s trajectory? After Trump\u2019s supposedly impossible election, many doubled down and suggested that he would soon be impeached, or quit, or prove non-conservative or impotently conservative. And the critics continue in this vein today. What was continually missed, and why, and how is such acknowledgment critical in offering believable assessments to come? Finally, if 10 percent of the party might threaten to sit out or leave due to either Trump\u2019s message or his person, would that matter to the 90 percent, given that the party has both won and lost presidential elections with a 90 percent Republican majority but not without voters in Midwest swing  Davis  contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "George Will", "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.,  January 20, 2018\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Reuters/Joshua  Supreme Court must strike down a California law that compels pro-life crisis-pregnancy centers\u2019 speech in violation of the First  routinely behave badly, but sometimes their mean-spiritedness comes to the Supreme Court\u2019s attention.\u00a0On Tuesday, it\u00a0will\u00a0hear oral arguments concerning the constitutionality of measures that California\u2019s government has taken to compel pro-life entities to speak against their own mission.\n\nCrisis-pregnancy centers are nonprofit facilities usually owned and operated by people with religious objections to abortion. Some centers are licensed medical facilities providing pregnancy testing, ultrasound examinations, medical referrals, prenatal vitamins, etc. Other centers are unlicensed because they provide only nonmedical services (self-administered pregnancy-testing kits, parenting-preparation training, baby clothes, diapers, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nA 2015 California law requires licensed crisis-pregnancy centers to tell clients (in pamphlets, in waiting-room signs) this: \u201cCalifornia has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care and abortion for eligible women.\u201d Unlicensed centers are required to notify clients that the center \u201cis not licensed as a medical facility by the state of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.\u201d\n\nSo, government compels licensed centers to provide free advertisements for government-provided abortions. And government compels unlicensed centers to say \u2014 in large fonts, in as many as 13 languages, even on their own websites \u2014 that they do not have medical providers that the government itself says, by not requiring them to be licensed, are not necessary for the services they provide. The government\u2019s obvious nasty purpose is to make the unlicensed centers\u2019 clients unnecessarily uneasy.\n\nCalifornia tailored the law to target only crisis centers: It exempts from the compelled-speech requirements all women\u2019s-health-services providers that dispense abortifacients. The crisis centers are incorporated as religious organizations and their mission is dictated by the content of their beliefs. The pro-choice government is targeting the centers to exercise one-sided influence on some women\u2019s choices. The Cato Institute\u2019s Ilya Shapiro, author of an amicus brief supporting the crisis centers, says it is telling that California has no comparable law requiring abortion providers to post advertisements for adoption agencies or other alternatives to abortion.\n\nCalifornia tailored the law to target only crisis centers: It exempts from the compelled-speech requirements all women\u2019s-health-services providers that dispense abortifacients.\n\nNeither the 2015 law\u2019s legislative history nor the state\u2019s brief in defense of the law provides any evidence for the state\u2019s charge that the centers \u201cconfuse,\u201d \u201cmisinform,\u201d or otherwise harm women. And the law clearly has nothing to do with ensuring informed consent by clients of the crisis-pregnancy centers.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose reasoning is frequently novel and whose rulings are frequently reversed, upheld California\u2019s law on the ground that government often can regulate the practice-related speech of professionals it licenses. The Supreme Court has never embraced this carve-out from the First Amendment, which would give government an open-ended power to require whomever the government deems a \u201cprofessional\u201d to communicate whatever message the government favors.\n\nPro-choice defenders of California\u2019s patently content-based and discriminatory law should consider the following. Suppose a pro-life state government were to require all publicly and privately funded abortion providers to advertise on their premises the locations and services of crisis-pregnancy centers. Or even to post the following accurate information on their premises, websites, and advertisements:\n\nEighteen days after conception, the unborn baby\u2019s brain begins to form. At about three weeks, the heart begins to beat, circulating the baby\u2019s blood. At six weeks, brain waves are detectable and at seven weeks, the baby is kicking. By week nine, the baby can suck his or her thumb and move his or her head. From weeks ten through 13, bones harden and teeth, fingerprints, and fingernails begin to form. At 26 weeks, the spinal cord and pain receptors are in place for pain transmission to the brain.\n\nA pro-life government\u2019s point in compelling the placement of this factual notice would be not just to inform women contemplating having an abortion but to incline them against doing so. The abortion providers would be compelled to disseminate a message contrary to their beliefs about the morality of abortion. This would be (as Shapiro says of California\u2019s compelled-speech law targeting the crisis centers) government putting \u201cits thumb on the scale in a social debate, by conscripting individuals to help spread a particular message.\u201d\n\n\nAs the Supreme Court has held, freedom of speech means freedom to choose what to say \u2014 and what not to say. The crisis-pregnancy centers have a right that California\u2019s bullying government also has and that it would do well to exercise more often: the right to remain silent.\n\n\u00a9 2018, Washington Post Writers   Will is a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning syndicated columnist.

The chance of extraditing any of the accused from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is zero.\n\nSome of the Russians\u2019 Keystone Cops efforts to disrupt the election favored Donald Trump (as well as Bernie Sanders). Yet Mueller\u2019s team made it clear that the Russians neither colluded with any U.S. citizens nor had any material effect on the election\u2019s outcome.\n\n\n\n\nBut from here on out, there will be ironies, paradoxes, and unintended consequences with just about everything Mueller does.\n\nIs it now time to prosecute foreigners for attempting to interfere with a U.S. election? If so, then surely Christopher Steele, the author of the Fusion GPS dossier, is far more culpable and vulnerable than the 13 bumbling Russians.\n\nSteele is not a U.S. citizen. Steele colluded with Russian interests in compiling his lurid dossier about Donald Trump. Steele did not register as a foreign agent. And Steele was paid by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to find dirt on political rival Trump and his campaign.\n\nIn other words, Steele\u2019s position is far worse than that of the Russians for a variety of reasons. One, he is easily extraditable while the Russians are not. Two, his efforts really did affect the race, given that the dossier was systematically leaked to major media and served as a basis for the U.S. government to spy on American citizens. Three, unlike with the Russians, no one disputes that American citizens \u2014 Hillary Clinton, members of the Democratic National Committee, and anti-Trump partisan Glenn Simpson and his Fusion GPS team \u2014 colluded by paying for Steele\u2019s work.\n\nMueller\u2019s team has also leveraged a guilty plea from former Trump national-security adviser Michael Flynn for making false statements to FBI investigators. If the Flynn case is now the Mueller standard, then we know that a number of high-ranking officials are vulnerable to such legal exposure.\n\nDepartment of Justice official Bruce Ohr deliberately omitted on federal disclosure forms the fact that his wife, an expert on Russia, worked on the Fusion GPS dossier.\n\nSteele himself probably lied to the FBI went he claimed he had not leaked the dossier\u2019s contents to the media.\n\nHillary Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills likely lied to FBI investigator Peter Strzok (who had also interviewed Flynn) when they claimed they had no idea that Clinton was using a private and illegal email server until the story went public. In fact, Abedin and Mills had communicated with Clinton over the same server \u2014 as did then-president Barack Obama, who likewise denied that he knew about the improper server.\n\nMueller\u2019s existential problem has been with him from the start. Due to the shenanigans of his discredited friend Comey and a rabid media, he was appointed to investigate crimes that did not exist.\n\nFormer FBI director James Comey likely lied to Congress when he claimed that his exoneration of Clinton came after he had interviewed her. We now know from documents that he drafted a statement about the conclusion of the investigation even before he met with her.\n\nAs far as obstruction charges go, Mueller has other possible targets. Former attorney general Loretta Lynch met secretly with Bill Clinton on a jet parked on a tarmac in Phoenix shortly before the Justice Department closed the probe of Hillary Clinton and chose not to pursue charges against her. Comey said Lynch asked him not to use the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d when discussing the Clinton email probe. Text messages between Strzok and fellow FBI official Lisa Page suggest that Lynch knew in advance about the conclusions Comey would reach in the investigation.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nMueller is under enormous pressure to find collusion between the Trump team and Russia, or to find that the Trump team obstructed justice by trying to hide such collusion. But neither likely happened. Mueller was appointed at a time of national hysteria, brought on by partisan journalism based on a leaked dossier \u2014 itself a product of a discredited British agent working with Russian sources while being paid by the Clinton campaign.\n\nWorse still, the effort to hide the origins and the use of that dossier to obtain court permission to spy on American citizens may be a classic case of obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller\u2019s existential problem has been with him from the start. Due to the shenanigans of his discredited friend Comey and a rabid media, he was appointed to investigate crimes that did not exist. But if they did exist, collusion and obstruction were committed by those associated with the Clinton campaign and even by members of the Obama administration.\n\nInvestigating any possible crimes committed by members of the Clinton campaign or the Obama administration apparently is taboo, given the exalted status of both. But every time Mueller seeks to find incidental wrongdoing by those around Trump, he only makes the case stronger that behavior by those involved in the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration should be investigated.\n\n\n\n\nIf such matters are not treated in an unbiased manner, we are not a nation of equality under the law, but a banana republic masquerading as a democracy.\n\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tribune Content Agency,  Davis  contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "(Joshua  House aide Kellyanne Conway violated federal law by engaging in political advocacy during a pair of cable-news appearances last year, according to the U.S. Office of the Special Counsel (OSC).\n\nIn a report released Tuesday, OSC special counsel Henry Kerner indicated that Conway\u2019s\u00a0advocacy \u201cfor and against candidates\u201d in the Alabama special election constituted a violation of the Hatch Act, which prevents executive-branch employees \u2014 save for the president, vice president, and a few other high-ranking officials \u2014 from participating in certain political activities.\n\n\nThe violations stem from a pair of appearances, one on CNN\u2019s\u00a0New Day and another on Fox News\u2019 Fox  Friends,\u00a0in which Conway disparaged Democratic Alabama senate candidate Doug Jones.\n\n\u201cFolks, don\u2019t be fooled.

But far more important than what he has said is what Trump has done. That same caveat applies to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nStart with two givens: Vladimir Putin is neither stupid nor content to watch an aging, shrinking, corrupt, and dysfunctional \u2014 but still large and nuclear \u2014 Russia recede to second- or third-power status. From 2009 to 2015, in one of the most remarkable and Machiavellian efforts in recent strategic history, Putin almost single-handedly parlayed a deserved losing hand into a winning one. He pulled this off by flattering, manipulating, threatening, and outsmarting an inept and politically obsessed Obama administration.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Obama presidency and the tenures of Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Russia made astounding strategic gains \u2014 given its intrinsic economic, social, and military weaknesses. The Obama reaction was usually incoherent (Putin was caricatured as a \u201cbored kid in the back of the classroom\u201d or as captive of a macho shtick). After each aggressive Russian act, the administration lectured that \u201cit is not in Russia\u2019s interest to . . . \u201d \u2014 as if Obama knew better than a thuggish Putin what was best for autocratic Russia.\n\nA review of Russian inroads, presented in no particular order, is one of the more depressing chapters in post-war U.S. diplomatic history.\n\nJust watching the film clip of Hillary Clinton presenting the red, plastic Jacuzzi button to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva remains painful, more so than even George W. Bush\u2019s simplistic, reassuring commentary after he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes. Under the Obama-Clinton reset protocols, Russia was freed from even the mild sanctions installed by the Bush administration, imposed for its 2008 Ossetian aggressions. As thanks, in early 2014, Russia outright annexed Crimea. It used its newfound American partnership as an excuse to bully Europe on matters of energy and policy, confident that under American reset, it would face little NATO pushback.\n\nRussia assumed de facto control over large sections of eastern Ukraine. Its aggression sent nations of Eastern Europe and the Baltic States into a panic and raised fears of another Ukrainian-like intervention \u2014 thereby wresting pro-Russians concessions on the premise that it was nearby and unpredictably dangerous while the U.S. was distant and predictably inert. Russia succeeded in helping to dismantle previously negotiated U.S. missile-defense arrangements with the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nRussia since 2013 had sought to interfere in U.S. elections with impunity, so much so that as late as October 18, 2016, on the eve of the anticipated Clinton landslide, Obama mocked any suggestion that an entity could ever successfully warp the outcome of a U.S. election. (\u201cThere is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America\u2019s elections. There\u2019s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I\u2019d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.\u201d)\n\nAfter a near 40-year hiatus, Russia was invited into the Middle East by the Obama administration. It soon became the power broker in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.\n\nAfter a near 40-year hiatus, Russia was invited into the Middle East by the Obama administration. It soon became the power broker in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq and to some extent offered passive-aggressive support for Israel and Turkey \u2014 a position of influence that it retains to this day and that would now be hard to undo. It posed as a \u201chelper\u201d to the Obama administration with Iran and helped broker the disastrous Iran deal \u2014 and then used U.S. acquiescence to Iran to fuel the ascendance of the Iran-Hezbollah-Assad crescent.\n\nUnlike the United States, Russia had no need to maintain the nuclear umbrella, which protected the clients of the U.S. post-war alliance. Despite America\u2019s nuclear responsibilities, Russia convinced the Obama administration to cut back radically on our stockpile of deployable nuclear weapons. Such promised reductions in deliverable weapons came at a time of massive U.S. defense cuts and cancellations, and delays in missile defense.\n\nRussia was relieved by Obama\u2019s efforts to stall fracking and make huge swathes of American territory off-limits for U.S. oil and gas exploration \u2014 as this would tighten global oil markets and enhance Russian petroleum export profits. The Obama administration inexplicably approved sale of a sizable portion of scarce U.S. uranium holdings to a Russian company, despite the fact that it was known that investors connected with the Kremlin and uranium interests had paid Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech in Moscow. In additions, the chairman of the so-called Uranium One consortium gave $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation, a fact that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not disclose, even though she had promised (during her confirmation process) to reveal all such possible conflicts of interest.\n\nMost significantly, the Obama administration had created a false orthodoxy of d\u00e9tente, a politically correct Lala Land, in which to question any of these lopsided Russian advantages was to be considered idiotic or unpatriotic.\n\n\n\n\nMitt Romney learned that in the third 2012 presidential debate when he was tagged as a Cold War hack by a snarky Barack Obama for even suggesting that an opportunistic and conniving Russia was our chief geostrategic rival. Even when Putin became arrogant and greedy in his winnings, and finally, mostly through hacking, helped to collapse the disastrous Russian-reset misadventure, Hillary Clinton looked back on her role in Russian reset and made the astonishing claim that it had been a success: \u201cI think it was a brilliant stroke, which in retrospect it appears even more so, because look at what we accomplished.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama revealed himself with an open-mic promise to outgoing Russian puppet president Dmitri Medvedev, which, by any reasonable logic, could only be explained as a promise by Obama to retard U.S. missile-defense efforts in Europe in exchange for good Russian behavior during Obama\u2019s reelection bid. (\u201cOn all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it\u2019s important for him to give me space. . . . This is my last election. . . . After my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d) Had Donald Trump been caught in such a private conversation offering a Russian president a quid pro quo \u2014 massaging future U.S. national defense policy in a pro-Russia direction in exchange for Russian behavior that would help Trump\u2019s electoral chances \u2014 he would probably be facing impeachment on grounds of real Russian collusion.\n\nBy the 2016 campaign, however, amid allegations of Russian hacking of Democratic and Clinton campaign communications, the Obama administration could no longer see its failed reset as \u201ca brilliant stoke.\u201d As a result, the architects of one of these embarrassing concessionary policies became not just embarrassed; she pointed to Trump\u2019s loud bombast as proof that he\u2019d colluded with and appeased the Russians. And so began the real collusion between the Clinton campaign and elements in the U.S. government to smear Trump as a Russian patsy.\n\nThe odd result of such failed reset policies and bought opposition research was a yarn that the neophyte and recklessly talking Donald Trump was a clever Russian lackey. Yet Trump\u2019s strategic, defense, and energy policies, and his later appointments of realist Russian skeptics \u2014 such as General James Mattis, General H. R. McMaster, Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo, and, yes, Rex Tillerson \u2014 were anathema to Moscow.\n\nThe Trump administration has armed Ukrainians, reentered the Middle East to bomb ISIS, squared off against Russia, and decimated Russian mercenaries in Syria. Trump also has ensured that the U.S. is well placed to usurp Russia as the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u00a0within about twelve months.\n\nIn just its first year, the Trump administration has armed Ukrainians, reentered the Middle East to bomb ISIS, squared off against Russia, and decimated Russian mercenaries in Syria. Trump also has ensured that the U.S. is well placed to usurp Russia as the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u00a0within about twelve months. He upped the defense budget, ordered the updating of the nuclear arsenal, bantered NATO members to increase their defense contributions, and traveled to Eastern Europe to bolster Western solidarity,\n\nGiven the media dismissal of Donald Trump and its eagerness to canonize Barack Obama\u2019s eight years with another eight of Hillary Clinton, Russia by late 2016 went from a deity to a demon. It was reinvented as Mitt Romney\u2019s enemy of liberal democracy, and, after the election, served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s excuse for losing the election \u2014 and Putin became the new ally and collaborator of Donald Trump!\n\nThus spread the fertilizer that fed the national hysteria leading to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate a crime \u2014 active collusion with the Russians to warp an election \u2014 that likely did not exist. And if it did exist, it was probably committed by Hillary Clinton, her campaign, members of the Obama administration, and the miscreants of Fusion GPS. After months of politicized special-counsel investigations, together with House and Senate investigations, Americans are only now being apprised of what we always should have known from the beginning:\n\n1) Russia implants chaos as cheaply as it can inside the U.S. How bold it is depends on how much it worries about a U.S. response. During the Obama reset tenure, it felt there were no repercussions and thus few bounds to its disinformation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n2) Like the Obama administration and the Hillary Clinton campaign, Moscow was convinced that Hillary Clinton would win the nomination and would be a shoo-in during the general election. Predictably, Russia invested comparatively meager resources to encourage pro-Sanders and pro-Trump campaign efforts to stir up trouble. It may have hacked into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails, and perhaps it even found access to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private, illegal, and deleted emails to embarrass the likely future president and perhaps to find avenues for threats of future blackmail against her. Note well, that if the sure thing had happened \u2014 the election of Hillary Clinton \u2014 then no one but the Russians might have known, and possibly disclosed at a time and under conditions of their choosing, the shenanigans of Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, and his Russian sources.\n\n3) The result of the Russian-fed, Clinton-bought Steele dossier is as depressing as was the earlier Russian wins from the reset: The gullible and partisan FBI hierarchy is now discredited and compromised. The intelligence agencies, politicized under John Brennan and James Clapper, may soon share the embarrassments of the FBI. The critical FISA-court protocols have been undermined by deceit and untruth. The highest echelons of the Obama administration were probably complicit in surveillance of political opponents, spying that was predicated on Russian sources for a bogus dossier, and some Obama officials may well have committed felonies by unmasking the names of U.S. citizens and leaking them to the press.\n\nThe highest echelons of the Obama administration were probably complicit in surveillance of political opponents, and some Obama officials may well have committed felonies by unmasking the names of U.S. citizens and leaking them to the press.\n\n\nThe verdict on Russia, the Obama administration, and the Clinton campaign is now becoming clearer. Russian reset resurrected Putin\u2019s profile and hurt U.S. interests. It grew out of a partisan rebuke of the Bush administration\u2019s perceived harshness to Russia and was later massaged to help Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign by granting Russia concessions in hopes of a foreign-policy success that would lead to perceived calm. Russia deliberately inserted itself into the 2016 election, as it had in previous elections, because 1) it had suffered few if any prior consequences, 2) it wanted to sow chaos in the American political system, and 3) it saw a way to warp Clinton\u2019s efforts to smear Donald Trump, first, no doubt to compromise a likely President Clinton, and, in unexpected fashion, later to undermine an actual President Trump.\n\nAt very little cost, Russia has embarrassed American democracy, played the media for the partisans they are, completely discredited the Clinton campaign and name, and created a year of nonstop hysteria to undermine the Trump administration.\n\n\nAnd it is not over  Davis  contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin D.

There are two ways to understand that sentence, and both apply: Among major news publications, the Times regularly exhibits an unparalleled level of illiteracy on the subject of firearms, and it exhibits comparable illiteracy on practically no other subject. Even on such self-acknowledged weak spots as American religion, the Times rarely sinks to the level of outright stupidity that characterizes its coverage of firearms and related crimes.\n\nE.g., this from Michael D. Shear:\n\nPresident Trump \u2014 under pressure from angry, grieving students from a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last week \u2014 ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas.\n\nA bump stock does not convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon, and there were no automatic weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting. Bump-firing is a (nifty but largely useless) rapid-firing technique, not a technology. Bump stocks do make it easier to bump fire, but they are neither necessary nor sufficient. Bump-firing is something that must be learned, and it can be achieved without a bump stock: Some shooters use rubber bands, some use their belt loops, and some use no accessory at all. Beginning shooters, who often have poor grips, bump-fire accidentally from time to time, and bump-firing does not even require a semiautomatic weapon \u2014 you can bump-fire a revolver, if you work at it.\n\nOr you could just learn to shoot really fast.\n\nIf it is the case that bump stocks \u201cconvert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons,\u201d then some inexperienced shooter \u2014 I\u2019m assuming Shear is not a gun nut \u2014 ought to be able to simply install one on an ordinary semiautomatic rifle and achieve a fully automatic rate of fire. I\u2019ll make Shear and his editors at the Times a public wager: that no New York Times writer or editor without prior training in bump-shooting can achieve a fully automatic rate of fire (about 700 rounds per minute on the M4 carbine, the AR-15\u2019s military cousin) from an ordinary AR-15 equipped with a bump stock. I\u2019ll provide the rifle, the ammunition, and the range time. All Michael D. Shear of the Times has to do is show up and then write up what happens.\n\n\nShear and his Times colleagues write routinely about \u201cassault weapons,\u201d a meaningless term inasmuch as there is no generally agreed-upon definition of \u201cassault weapon.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t stop such Times stalwarts as Thomas Friedman from writing, with mystifying confidence: \u201cThey know full well that a common-sense banning of all military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, or mandating universal background checks for gun buyers or to prevent terrorists and the mentally ill from buying guns, would not curb the constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d Friedman doesn\u2019t know what he thinks he knows full well, much less what gun-rights activists \u201cknow full well.\u201d This illiteracy, too, is worth unpacking.\n\nIf by \u201cassault weapon\u201d he means rifles of the sort included in the 1994 ban \u2014 which, it is worth remembering, had no measurable effect on crime \u2014 then what he is talking about is semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines. (One of the major defects of the 1994 ban was its poorly conceived definitions, but, most broadly, that\u2019s what it was designed to limit.) Prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines would mean prohibiting the sale of the majority of rifles sold in the United States\u00a0 \u2014 the vast majority, in all likelihood. AR-style rifles alone account for about one in five rifle sales.\n\nIf we include semiautomatic handguns with detachable magazines \u2014 and why wouldn\u2019t we, given their much greater prominence in crime? \u2014 then what Friedman proposes is a prohibition on something like 80 percent or more of the firearms sold in the United States. Friedman may not see how that conflicts with the Second Amendment, but the courts do.\n\nWhich other constitutional rights (free speech? freedom of the press?) would Friedman be comfortable to see revoked based on an American citizen\u2019s appearance on a secret government list without charges, legal process, or recourse?\n\nHe could also use a refresher in due process: We already forbid terrorists to buy firearms; what Friedman is talking about is people who are suspected of wrongdoing or who, in the case of the no-fly list, simply share a name with someone suspected of wrongdoing. I wonder which other constitutional rights (free speech? freedom of the press?) Friedman would be comfortable to see revoked based on an American citizen\u2019s appearance on a secret government list without charges, legal process, or recourse.\n\nFriedman, warming to his self-indulgent, self-righteous mode, writes: \u201cThey know full well that most voters are not asking to scrap the Second Amendment, but for common-sense gun laws that could prevent or reduce more school shootings and would not interfere with any decent Americans\u2019 right to own guns for hunting, sports or self-protection.\u201d Setting aside that bit of constitutional illiteracy \u2014 the Second Amendment isn\u2019t about hunting or sport shooting; does anybody really think that the No. 2 item on the Bill of Rights is about a hobby? \u2014 Friedman does not seem to know that semiautomatic rifles, including AR-style rifles, are in fact among the most common hunting and sport-shooting firearms.\n\n\n\n\nFor hunters of everything from coyotes and other small predators to feral hogs, AR-style rifles are extraordinarily common. And a fair number of big-game hunters use similar rifles in more powerful calibers, for example Wilson\u2019s popular semiautomatic hunting rifles. Functionally, the only difference between a semiautomatic hunting rifle and the more common .223 AR-15 rifles is that the hunting rifles are much, much more powerful. Until recently, the .223 round was prohibited for hunting deer and other sizable game, not because the AR-15 is a \u201cweapon of war\u201d but because the caliber was considered insufficiently powerful to use humanely on deer.\n\nA thinking man with a working knowledge of the actual U.S. firearms market might have considered the fact that there is no way to ban nefarious black AR-15 rifles without also prohibiting common hunting rifles (never mind that the AR-15 is a common hunting rifle) or \u2014 sillier still \u2014 prohibiting the modestly powered \u201cmilitary\u201d guns while leaving the much more powerful hunting rifles on the market. But that thinking man would probably have a hard time writing for the Times, which apparently is opposed to thinking at all on this subject.\n\nSo-called assault rifles are so rarely used in crimes that the federal government doesn\u2019t keep separate data on them. Actual military weapons \u2014 fully automatic rifles and other ballistic exotica \u2014 are statistical unicorns when it comes to violent crime.\n\nAll long guns (which is to say, all rifles and shotguns) combined account for a tiny fraction of the firearms used in violent crimes in the United States; so-called assault rifles are so rarely used in crimes that the federal government doesn\u2019t keep separate data on them. Actual military weapons \u2014 fully automatic rifles and other ballistic exotica \u2014 are statistical unicorns when it comes to violent crime.

The most common ones.\n\n\nOur progressive friends enjoy boasting of their purportedly evidence-based approach to social problems, but when it comes to firearms, it is pure Kulturkampf. Firearms, in their view, are an atavistic enthusiasm for rural primitives and right-wing militia nuts, a hobby that must be tolerated \u2014 if only barely \u2014 because of some vestigial 18th-century political compromise.

In the aftermath of the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, House Democrats are making another attempt at banning so-called assault weapons. A \u201csupermajority\u201d (156 of 193) of House Democrats have signed on, leaving no doubt as to the party\u2019s move left on gun control. The bill, called the \u201cAssault Weapons ban of 2018,\u201d is a non-starter \u2014 at least so long as Republicans control the House \u2014 but it\u2019s a mistake to simply write off any proposal backed so overwhelmingly by one side of the aisle. This debate isn\u2019t going away.\n\nSo let\u2019s deal with he bill on the merits, beginning with taking on its inherently deceptive name. The bill calls for a \u201cban\u201d on both \u201csemi-automatic assault weapons\u201d and \u201clarge capacity magazine feeding devices\u201d (magazines holding more than ten rounds). But then \u2014 in the very next paragraphs \u2014 it exempts every single weapon and magazine lawfully possessed before the enactment of the law.\n\nIn other words, the assault-weapons ban isn\u2019t a ban at all. It would leave tens of millions of guns and magazines on the streets. In fact, nobody actually knows the number. Rifle sales have skyrocketed. Counting rifles made and distributed in the U.S. only (in other words, not counting imports), the number has increased from 1.6 million in 2007 to 4.2 million in 2016. During that time, the AR-15 has been among the most popular rifles sold in the U.S.\n\nIn other words, even if the proposed \u201cban\u201d were enacted, a person who wanted an AR-15 could find an AR-15. A person who wanted a large-capacity magazine could find a large-capacity magazine.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \u201cassault weapons\u201d is also inherently deceptive. The drafters include within the definition not just the scary-looking, military-style rifles such as the AR-15 but also semi-automatic pistols that can \u201caccept a detachable magazine\u201d and have at least one common additional feature such as a threaded barrel. The proposed ban also includes semi-automatic shotguns with, among other things, a pistol grip, a fixed magazine that accepts more than five rounds, or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of any size.\n\nThis is the worst kind of gun control. Any measure that preserves the ability of criminals to access guns while restricting the access of law-abiding Americans is a measure that fundamentally impairs the very purpose of the Second Amendment. For the law-abiding, the existing stock of tens (hundreds?) of millions of weapons and magazines would instantly become more expensive. Yet with the slightest premeditation, a criminal could easily circumvent the ban. It\u2019s a simple matter, in fact, to make your own high-capacity magazine.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s sheer speculation that a ban on so-called assault weapons would reduce mass shootings, reduce gun suicides, or reduce overall gun violence. Rifles are rarely used in \u201cnormal\u201d gun crimes (blunt objects and fists kill more people), and you don\u2019t need an AR-15 to kill yourself (rifle suicides are rare). And as ample, grim experience shows, you don\u2019t need an AR-15 to commit a horrific mass killing. America\u2019s worst school shooting \u2014 the Virginia Tech massacre \u2014 was committed with handguns, and the list of deadly handgun shootings is long and sad.\n\nMass shooters are among the most committed criminals in the entire United States. They often fantasize about their attacks for years and plan them for months. They can find an AR-15. Yet an AR-15 isn\u2019t an indispensable weapon for a spree killer. They have options.\n\nAt best, then, the argument is that making an AR-15 slightly more difficult to obtain won\u2019t make spree killings less common, but it might make spree killings less lethal. Again, that\u2019s more speculation, assuming that the most committed killers 1) can\u2019t get their hands one of the tens of millions of legal weapons still on the streets; and 2) that a man with a semi-automatic pistol isn\u2019t just as deadly as a man with a rifle. Neither assumption is warranted.\n\nIn fact, experience with the previous federal assault-weapons ban demonstrates that any benefit gained by decrease in crimes committed with one type of weapon is often offset by increases in crimes committed with other weapons, leaving no net benefit. Here\u2019s the key language from a comprehensive study of the impact of the federal assault-weapons ban:\n\nWe cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation\u2019s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury, as we might have expected had the ban reduced crimes with both AW [assault weapons] and LCMs [large-capacity magazines].\n\nAnd that study is based on a world where tens of millions fewer assault magazines and large-capacity magazines were in circulation. The facts on the ground have changed, substantially, since 2004.\n\nPolice officers need 15 rounds in a pistol to defend themselves, but I don\u2019t need 15 rounds to defend myself? How is that coherent?\n\n\nBut we have to offset the known and undeniable negatives against the entirely speculative positive effect. Millions of law-abiding Americans would find it more difficult to obtain guns and magazines that would match the foreseeable criminal threat. Indeed, the necessity of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines to confront the criminal threat is illustrated by the proposed ban itself, which exempts law-enforcement officers. Police officers need 15 rounds in a pistol to defend themselves, but I don\u2019t need 15 rounds to defend myself? How is that coherent?\u00a0\n\nAn assault-weapons non-ban does nothing to address the underlying causes of mass shootings. It does nothing to empower citizens or police to respond to troubled individuals before they pull the trigger, and it does nothing to enhance the ability of citizens to defend themselves once engaged. In fact, it may well put the armed citizen at a meaningful disadvantage. It\u2019s not the answer to mass killings. It\u2019s not even \u201can\u201d answer. It is, however, an infringement on individual liberty, and it\u2019s one that a majority of American voters will not   French is a senior writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, and a veteran of Operation Iraqi", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Crowe", "body": "(Mike  president\u2019s new school-safety plan wouldn\u2019t raise the age for legally buying a semi-automatic rifle from 18 to 21, a measure he has repeatedly called for in the wake of the Parkland shooting. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe White House released a school-safety plan Sunday that does not include the increased age restrictions on gun purchases that President Donald Trump repeatedly called for in the wake of the Parkland shooting.\n\nThe plan would allocate federal money to cover concealed-carry training for school personnel and create a federal commission to study the impact of increased age requirements and other potential legislative measures.

Becerra went quite poorly for those hoping the Court would endorse California\u2019s effort to impose speech restrictions on pro-life pregnancy centers. The Justices took turns pointing out obvious unconstitutional applications of the law, questioning whether California had gerrymandered its law to target pro-lifers, and wondering about the quantum leaps in First Amendment doctrine that would be required to sustain the law.\n\nBut the most important exchange \u2014 and the one that is indicative of a longer-term problem for the pro-abortion side in a range of speech and religion cases \u2014 related to whether the law was even needed in the first place. Supporters of pregnancy-center speech restrictions often claim that the laws are needed because pregnancy centers use deceptive advertising and other tricks to mislead women. California itself had argued that its law was necessary so that pro-life centers do not \u201cattract women into their facilities based on confusion or deception\u201d about their services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a rather glaring problem with this argument. If pregnancy centers engaged in the kind of behaviors used to justify these laws \u2014 such as fraud, false advertising, practicing medicine without a license, or impersonating a doctor \u2014 then that behavior could be prosecuted using general laws that make such behaviors illegal regardless of the topic of speech. And surely blue-state attorneys general who hope to have a political future in the Democratic party (such as Respondent Xavier Becerra, and his predecessor, now-Senator Kamala Harris) would be eager to bring such cases both to protect women and to please their base. Yet there is no record that they ever even tried, which severely undercuts the claimed need for a special restriction on speakers who talk about pregnancy options.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s lawyer probably expected to be questioned on this topic, but he may have been taken aback by the identity of the Justice who pressed him: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He should not have been surprised \u2014 Justice Ginsburg, after all, joined an opinion several years ago in McCullen v. Coakley (the Massachusetts abortion-clinic buffer-zone case) taking Massachusetts to task for failing to identify \u201ca single prosecution brought under [existing] laws within at least the last 17 years.\u201d That case was a 9-0 loss for the government that was trying to use a new, targeted law to regulate speech where it could have achieved its goals with existing, speech-neutral laws.\n\nAt the NIFLA argument, Justice Ginsburg appeared focused on a similar problem for California, asking whether California had \u201cever brought charges against any of these places for false and misleading advertising?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTo his credit, California\u2019s lawyer began his answer with the truth: that the state had not brought such charges under its law that already makes false advertising illegal for everyone. But, in an effort to suggest there was still a problem to be solved, he added, \u201cI believe that the city and county of San Francisco has, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat last part is likely false \u2014 at least in relation to the recent pregnancy-center controversies, San Francisco has not brought charges against pregnancy centers for false and misleading advertising. Instead, San Francisco actually behaved much like California did: It complained about alleged false advertising, never pursued any charges, and then used its own complaining as a basis to pass a special law targeting the speech of pro-life pregnancy counselors. That law is at issue in another pregnancy-center speech case that is right behind NIFLA v. Becerra at the Supreme Court, called First Resort, Inc. v. Herrera. The court in First Resort explained how San Francisco wrote a letter about alleged false advertising, but does not suggest that any charges were actually brought. With my colleagues at the Becket Fund and co-counsel from Locke Lord, I represent First Resort \u2014 and no such charges have been brought.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s error is easy enough to understand, and it reveals a problem that has plagued the pro-abortion side of speech and religion cases at the Supreme Court for the past several years. He presumably knew that San Francisco had made noise about alleged false statements, but had missed that they had never actually even tried to enforce the generally applicable law, instead proceeding to target pro-life speakers for special restrictions. In short, San Francisco cried wolf, and it looks like California\u2019s lawyer may have mistakenly fallen for it.\n\nBut as in McCullen, Justice Ginsburg seemed keenly aware of the difference between merely complaining about an ideological opponent and actually having proof of a real problem that needs to be solved by restricting speech. Other recent decisions in pregnancy-center cases confirm that Justice Ginsburg\u2019s instinct is correct. In a parallel case, the Fourth Circuit recently noted the absence of any proof of any actual harm: \u201cAfter seven years of litigation and a 1,295\u2013page record before us, the City does not identify a single example of a woman who entered the Greater\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0Center\u2019s waiting room under the misimpression that she could obtain an abortion there.\u201d And in striking down a similar Montgomery County, Maryland, statute, Chief Judge Deborah K. Chasanow found that, although she had given the county years to prove its case, the government\u2019s arguments failed because of \u201cthe lack of any evidence that the practices of [pregnancy centers] are causing pregnant women to be misinformed which is negatively affecting their health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNor are the pregnancy-center cases isolated instances of wolf-crying. For many years and over a series of cases involving Hobby Lobby, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other religious groups, advocates told the Supreme Court that the contraceptive mandate was necessary to protect a compelling interest in women\u2019s health. But when pressed by the Supreme Court, the Obama administration ended up admitting that there were actually many other ways for women to get contraceptives. And a new study by the Guttmacher Institute actually finds that the mandate was not compellingly important after all, as it brought \u201cno changes in contraceptive use patterns among sexually active women.\u201d So much for that argument.\n\n\n\n\nAnd despite overheated claims that the Hobby Lobby decision would open the floodgates to a raft of religious-liberty claims by businesses and others, recent studies show nothing of the kind actually occurred.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a pattern here: In order to pass a law or try to win a lawsuit, over-the-top claims are made about why the government needs to restrict the speech or free exercise of an ideological opponent or the sky will fall. But when the proof comes in, the claims turn out to be false or vastly overstated.\n\nCrying wolf may work well for political purposes, for raising money, or for convincing partisans on one side to enact a law. But our system of adversarial litigation \u2014 with its requirements of sworn evidence, candor to the court, and discovery \u2014 is actually well equipped to tell the real wolves from the imagined ones. Credibility is being burned with each episode in which the claimed problem turns out to have just been an excuse to target one\u2019s opponents. And Justice Ginsburg\u2019s questions show that, while she supports legalized abortion, she still understands that the First Amendment protects people on all sides and requires governments to only restrict speech when it actually has a compelling need to do so.

Why not, then, appoint another special counsel to squeeze the squeezers? Why not turn the tables?\n\n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nOriginal Sin: A Prosecutor but No Crime\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made a foundational error in appointing Robert Mueller to be special counsel to investigate . . . well . . . um . . . come to think of it, that was the error:\u00a0The investigation has no parameters, and thus no  conducted by prosecutors are supposed to be rooted in known crimes\u00a0\u2014 or, at the very least, articulable suspicion that known crimes have occurred. Under the governing regulations, to justify the appointment of a special counsel,\u00a0those crimes must form the basis for two salient findings: (1) that the Justice Department has a conflict of interest so severe that it cannot conduct the investigation in the normal manner, and (2) that it is necessary to appoint, from outside the Justice Department, a quasi-independent prosecutor. This special prosecutor is to be given a grant of investigative jurisdiction limited to the crimes that the Justice Department is too conflicted to investigate \u2014 and no other crimes, unless the special counsel explicitly requests, and the Justice Department grants, an expansion of jurisdiction. (See here, where I address Paul Manafort\u2019s claim that his indictment violates regulations limiting special-counsel jurisdiction.)\n\nAs we have repeatedly observed (see, e.g., here, here, and here), Rosenstein failed to adhere to the regulations, appointing Mueller to conduct a counterintelligence investigation. Because counterintelligence is not lawyer work, and because the objective of counterintelligence is to gather information about a foreign power, not to build a criminal case against a suspect, prosecutors are not ordinarily assigned to counterintelligence investigations. In the Mueller appointment, then, counterintelligence is camouflage for something that should never happen: a special counsel unleashed to hunt for crimes to prosecute despite the absence of known crimes warranting appointment of a special prosecutor.\n\nCollusion with Russia? That is so two tweets ago!\n\nSo now, predictably, we have this absurdity: A special counsel, whose purported mandate is to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible Trump-campaign \u201ccollusion\u201d in it (whatever that means), is looking into whether Jared Kushner\u2019s financial woes\u00a0influenced Trump-administration policy towards Qatar.\n\nCollusion with Russia? That is so two tweets ago!\n\n\n\n\nMind you, there may be good reasons to probe Kushner\u2019s possible self-dealing as an adviser to his father-in-law, the president \u2014 and, for that matter, Kushner\u2019s reported failures to disclose significant foreign contacts during his background check (which clearly complicated his ability to qualify for a security clearance). Similarly, it may well be that scheming by Paul Manafort and Richard Gates with a Kremlin-connected Ukrainian political party in the dozen years prior to the 2016 campaign should be scrutinized. The point, however, is that these matters have nothing to do with Russian interference in the election. There is no reason our $29 billion\u2013per\u2013annum\u00a0Department of Justice could not have investigated them without the administration-crippling appointment of a special counsel.\n\nNow it is Republicans on the verge of the same mistake, which would inevitably lead to similar abuses and the paralysis of critical government functions.\n\nThe Goodlatte-Gowdy Call for a Special Counsel\n\nTwo House Republican heavyweights, Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Oversight Committee chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, have penned a letter\u00a0to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein seeking the appointment of another special counsel. The quasi-independent prosecutor they envision would\n\nreview decisions made and not made by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, including but not limited to evidence of bias by any employee or agent of the DOJ, FBI, or other agencies involved in the investigation; the decisions to charge or not charge and whether those decisions were made consistent with the applicable facts, the applicable law, and traditional investigative and prosecutorial policies and procedures; and whether the FISA process employed in the fall of 2016 was appropriate and devoid of extraneous influence.\n\nI\u2019ve highlighted \u201cthe investigation\u201d because, among other problems with the letter, it is not clear whether the chairmen are referring only to the Trump-Russia investigation. Clearly, that elusive probe (taken over by Mueller in May 2017) is the main focus of the letter. But Goodlatte and Gowdy also mention the possibility that bias infected \u201cdecisions to charge or not charge\u201d; that suggests that they also have in mind the Clinton-emails investigation \u2014 a probe involving the other 2016 presidential candidate, in which no indictment was filed despite strong evidence of felony wrongdoing. Though I do not agree with the Goodlatte-Gowdy proposal of a second special counsel, the chairmen are wise (if I am reading them right) to combine consideration of the Clinton and Trump probes. The disparate treatment they were given \u2014 kid gloves for the former, unrestrained zeal for the latter \u2013 is among the most disturbing elements of the controversy.\n\nThe patent flaw in the Goodlatte-Gowdy proposal is the same one that plagued Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Mueller: There is no triggering crime.\n\nBefore explaining my disagreement with them, I must first observe that Chairmen Goodlatte and Gowdy, along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), continue to perform an invaluable service in exposing investigative irregularities and demanding accountability. Where I part company with them is not over whether we need an investigation; it is over whether that investigation should be done by a special counsel.\n\nThe patent flaw in the Goodlatte-Gowdy proposal is the same one that plagued Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Mueller: There is no triggering crime. As I\u2019ve repeatedly shown, that is the condition precedent for a special-counsel appointment under the governing regulations. I suspect that is why Goodlatte and Gowdy do not discuss the application of the regulations \u2014 \u00a0they breezily claim that \u201cthe relevant Federal regulations provide\u201d for the appointment of a purportedly \u201cindependent Special Counsel,\u201d but they do not try to demonstrate that this is so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not so.\n\nInvestigative Excesses Are Usually Not Crimes\n\nIt is very bad for investigators to exhibit bias, to allow bias to taint their exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion, to depart from Justice Department guidelines, and to provide unverified information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court). But none of these things is a crime \u2013 at least, not obviously so.\n\nThere is no criminal statute addressing bias on the part of agents and prosecutors. We all have biases. It would not be possible to have bias-free investigators. Even if investigators unprofessionally act on their biases, this does not necessarily mean the investigative decisions they make are indefensible on the merits \u2014 so proving prejudicial bias is difficult.\n\nAs for departing from Justice Department guidelines, such guidelines typically come with a disclaimer that deviations from the guidelines are not grounds for criminal or civil action. Indeed, such a disclaimer appears at the very beginning (introductory section 1-1.000) of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Manual:\n\nThe Manual provides only internal Department of Justice guidance. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter civil or criminal. Nor are any limitations hereby placed on otherwise lawful litigative prerogatives of the Department of Justice.\n\nWhy do we have guidelines and manuals? Because we want our law-enforcement officers to operate within clearly legitimate boundaries, not constantly to test the margins of their lawful authority. Having guidelines encourages this. It provides a standard for internal discipline when excessive or abusive conduct occurs. But if deviations from guidelines were to become a basis for legal action, including criminal prosecution, one of two things would happen: The guidelines would be repealed, or they would be rewritten in a broadly permissive manner, endorsing investigative behavior that might be justifiable in exigent circumstances but would be grossly inappropriate the rest of the time. If we want to have meaningful guidelines, the trade-off is that guidelines departures cannot lead to lawsuits \u2014 although they must lead to administrative discipline, including termination if the misconduct is serious enough.\n\nFinally, it is a serious dereliction for the FBI and Justice Department to provide the FISA court with unverified information, such as the allegations in the Steele dossier (which, based on what is publicly known at present, were essentially uncorroborated). As explained in a letter\u00a0Chairman Nunes sent to Attorney General Sessions last week, it is a violation of the FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide\u00a0to include anything other than \u201cdocumented and verified information\u201d in FBI applications for FISA-court surveillance warrants.\n\n\n\n\nAll that said, there is a big difference between (a) giving a court information that is unverified because it has not been adequately corroborated and (b) knowingly giving a court information that is false. The former is abusive; the latter is felony obstruction of justice.\n\nIt is highly unusual for FISA surveillance applications to be debated in public, as have the ones that targeted former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It is not at all unusual, however, for FBI agents and prosecutors to be accused of including inaccurate information in applications for criminal-law surveillance warrants \u2014 claims nearly indistinguishable in kind from the claim that the FBI and Justice Department included dubious Steele-dossier allegations in the FISA warrant applications. These criminal-law claims are such a commonplace that our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has established tests for evaluating them \u2014 asking such obvious questions as: whether the allegedly inaccurate information was, in fact, inaccurate; whether, if inaccurate, the information was necessary to the showing of probable cause; and whether the inaccurate information was provided to the court in good-faith error (e.g., an agent reasonably credits an informant who turns out to be wrong) or in a conscious effort to deceive.\n\nIn the vast majority of instances where wrong is done, the wrong involves an overzealous error made in good-faith belief that incriminating evidence would be found.\n\nIf a court has been given faulty information in a criminal case, the remedy is that evidence derived from the warrant is suppressed. Concededly, this \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine does not have a counterintelligence analogue \u2014 once our intelligence agencies know something they should not have learned, we can\u2019t tell them to \u201cun-know\u201d it. The point, nevertheless, is that the remedy of suppression is preferable to subjecting officials to punishment because, in the vast majority of instances where wrong is done, the wrong involves an overzealous error made in good-faith belief that incriminating evidence would be found. Thankfully, intentional frauds on the court are unusual \u2014 although, as my friend Kevin Williamson has chronicled (e.g., here) they do happen. (I\u2019ve noted the same on occasion.)\n\nSimilarly, criminal defendants seeking to have warrant evidence suppressed routinely claim that agents and prosecutors withheld material information that should have been disclosed to the judge \u2014 just as it has been claimed (quite correctly) that the Clinton campaign\u2019s connection to the Steele dossier should have been disclosed to the FISA judges. Again, such failures to disclose, even when wrong, are generally based on erroneous judgment calls about whether disclosure was required under criminal-law discovery rules, which can be a complex question. Frauds on the court are highly unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I am not arguing that law-enforcement officials never commit criminally actionable obstruction of justice; just that it is very rare. It is much more common that officials screw up than that they malevolently break the law. This is a distinction to which we must be sensitive: If police and prosecutors came to believe enforcement errors would lead to prosecutions or civil lawsuits against them, they would refrain from taking any but the most uncontroversial enforcement actions. In another context, Heather Mac Donald has written compellingly about this phenomenon as \u201cthe Ferguson effect.\u201d To discourage policing is to erode the rule of law, imperiling societal peace and prosperity.\n\nGood-Faith Grounds for the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nIt is not inconceivable that crimes have been committed by investigators in the Trump-Russia investigation. Currently, however, there are not concrete grounds to conclude that they were. (I am addressing only what is raised in the Goodlatte-Gowdy letter. I am not addressing potentially illegal leaks of investigative or classified information, which the letter does not specifically address, and which the Justice Department says it is already probing.) Without concrete grounds for a criminal investigation, a special-counsel appointment could not be justified.\n\nIf there was a good-faith basis for the FBI and Justice Department to investigate possible Trump\u2013Russia ties of a corrupt nature, it would be very difficult to prove that investigators broke the law in conducting their investigation \u2014 in contrast to proving that they engaged in abusive excesses that call for administrative discipline but not prosecution. One need not accept the politically inflated Trump\u2013Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative in order to acknowledge that there was a basis for an FBI investigation. One need not endorse abusive investigative tactics in order to acknowledge that it would be very challenging to establish that they amounted to prosecutable crimes.\n\n\n\n\nCandidate Trump made alarmingly ingratiating statements about Vladimir Putin, a murderous anti-American dictator (whose regime is suspected of still more assassination attempts on Western soil, carried out just this weekend in Britain). During the campaign, Trump praised Putin as a strong \u201cleader,\u201d and when asked about Putin\u2019s political assassinations, Trump countered that \u201cour country does plenty of killing also.\u201d Once, he even expressed hope that the Kremlin\u2019s agents would find former Secretary Clinton\u2019s deleted State Department emails. While this was a very dumb thing to joke about, it was not a call for hacking, as many Trump detractors insist \u2014 it was a political jab calling attention to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s security carelessness and destruction of thousands of government files.\n\nWith that as the mood music, Trump brought Manafort and Gates into his campaign at a very high level. They had notorious ties to Kremlin-backed Ukrainians. Those ties are not speculation;\u00a0they are established fact. Moreover, Trump publicly identified Carter Page, an obscure Kremlin apologist, as one of his campaign\u2019s handful of foreign-policy advisers. Simultaneously, the FBI was alerted\u00a0that the Russians might be in possession of thousands of hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton, and might have made a point of communicating this claim to George Papadopoulos, another of the few identified Trump foreign-policy advisers.\n\nThen the bureau was approached by Christopher Steele. Far from being unknown to the FBI, this former British spy was a proven asset, having provided information that helped the bureau crack the FIFA soccer case \u2014 the Obama Justice Department\u2019s most significant international corruption and racketeering prosecution. Steele alleged that Trump was involved in a corrupt conspiracy with Russia, in which Manafort, the point man, was using Page as an intermediary. Because of his prior work with the bureau, Steele would not have been ignored by the FBI, regardless of the Clinton campaign\u2019s sponsorship of his work \u2014 that would have been a reason to be skeptical, but not dismissive. The bureau also would have taken the claims themselves seriously \u2014 not necessarily believing them, but looking into them \u2014 given the preexisting reasons for concern: Trump\u2019s pro-Putin rhetoric; the backgrounds of Manafort, Gates, and Page; and the report about possible Russian involvement in hacked Democratic emails.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear: None of this would excuse the FBI\u2019s failure to verify Steele\u2019s information before presenting it to the FISA court. None of this would justify the failure to inform the FISA court that Steele\u2019s dossier was an opposition-research project commissioned by the Clinton campaign. None of this establishes Trump\u2013Russia \u201ccollusion,\u201d nor does it erase the fact that such collusion exists less as reality than as a political narrative to rationalize Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss. Moreover, to acknowledge the reasonableness of FBI and Justice Department concerns about the Trump-Russia information just outlined is only to raise more questions about the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s tanking of the Clinton-emails case, which featured solid evidence of crimes, not mere suspicion.\n\nThere were good-faith reasons for concern about ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian regime.\n\nMy point is simply this: It would not be credible to claim that the Trump-Russia investigation was fabricated out of whole cloth. Even stipulating that the top FBI/DOJ hierarchy was biased against Trump, and thus too quick to credit sensational allegations of Trump wrongdoing, there were good-faith reasons for concern about ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian regime. These reasons do not prove that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic emails; that Carter Page was a Russian agent; that Manafort and Gates were choreographing a Trump\u2013Russia conspiracy; or that Trump\u2019s Russia rhetoric was anything more than a political novice\u2019s effort to do what American administrations have been doing for decades \u2014 seek better relations with Moscow.\n\nAgain, if there were good-faith grounds for the FBI and Justice Department to look into Trump\u2013Russia ties, it becomes very difficult to imagine that investigative excesses transformed into criminal misconduct. And without crimes, there is no basis in the regulations to appoint a special counsel.\n\n\n\n\nAssign a Solid U.S. Attorney, Not a Special Counsel\n\nClearly, there needs to be an investigation. Goodlatte and Gowdy are entirely right about that. Regardless of whether there is a solid basis for a criminal investigation, the Justice Department is always responsible for ensuring the integrity and lawfulness of its own operations \u2014 it must investigate credible allegations of misconduct by its component agencies, including the FBI. Goodlatte and Gowdy are also right to suggest (as I believe they have) that the contemplated investigation should scrutinize the handling of the Clinton-emails probe \u2014 how it comported, or failed to, with Justice Department practices and policies. The chairmen are right yet again that the jurisdictional limitations on Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s very able inspector general, make it impossible for him to conduct the investigation that is needed.\n\nNeither, however, should that investigation be conducted by a special counsel.\n\nThe special counsel is a pernicious institution that operates outside the procedures and discipline of a normal U.S. attorney\u2019s office \u2014 where the merits of every case must be weighed against those of every other in the competition for limited investigative and prosecutorial resources. Special-counsel appointments should be resisted whenever possible. Indeed, with Robert Mueller already \u2014 and inevitably \u2014 straying far afield from his original \u201ccollusion\u201d inquiry, we should be discussing how that investigation can be limited and brought to a just conclusion; we should not be encouraging the launch of yet another special-counsel extravaganza. Never again should a special-counsel investigation be commenced in the absence of concrete evidence that a crime has been committed \u2014 a crime that serves to cabin the special counsel\u2019s investigation lest it become a fishing expedition without end.\n\nHere is what should be done. Attorney General Sessions should assign a U.S. attorney from outside Washington to conduct a probe of how the Clinton-emails and Trump-Russia investigations were handled by the Justice Department and FBI. A good model would be John Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut just confirmed by the Senate. In 2008, when he was that office\u2019s deputy U.S. attorney, he was assigned\u00a0by Bush Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the Bush administration\u2019s program for interrogating high-level terrorist detainees, specifically, the possible destruction of evidence\u00a0of the CIA\u2019s mistreatment of prisoners. Durham, a highly regarded career prosecutor, was permitted to continue in this capacity when the Obama Justice Department expanded his inquiry. The investigation was closed without charges in a credible, professional manner in 2011.\n\nUnder my proposal, the designated U.S. attorney would handle this investigation along with the rest of the work of his or her office \u2014 this would not be a prosecutor whose only assignment is to pursue a single target or set of targets, and who thus faces great pressure to file charges, no matter how far afield from the original focus of the investigation, in order to justify the appointment. Unlike the inspector general, the U.S. attorney would have full jurisdiction to convene a grand jury; investigate any crimes attendant to the Clinton-emails and Trump-Russia probes; issue subpoenas and seek other court process (such as search warrants) to secure evidence; and prosecute any violations of law by persons inside or outside of government.\n\nAs in any investigation, the U.S. attorney would also have the discretion not to file charges, and to refer any government officials found to have engaged in misconduct for administrative discipline. The attorney general could further require that the U.S. attorney file a report about the investigation\u2019s findings. This report could be shared with Congress; it could also be released to the public to the extent consistent with laws and guidelines that control the disclosure of investigative information regarding uncharged persons. (Obviously, information about charged persons, if any, would be disclosed in connection with their prosecutions.)\n\nSome will argue that my proposal fails to ensure the \u201cindependence\u201d enjoyed by special counsels brought in from outside the government, such as Robert Mueller. My first reaction is to ask: Was there ever a prosecutor more independent than Patrick Fitzgerald? Yet he was not brought in from the outside: When the Valerie Plame leak controversy broke, rather than ensure the appearance of independence by recruiting a former prosecutor from private practice, the Bush Justice Department decided to place an investigation of the Bush administration in the hands of the Bush-appointed U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois \u2014 Fitzgerald, who was given the assignment by then\u2013deputy attorney general James Comey. As Scooter Libby can attest \u2014 having been indicted for process crimes even though investigators had determined there was insufficient evidence to charge the actual leaker, Richard Armitage \u2014 the Bush administration was cut no slack by Fitzgerald, then a career prosecutor who is remembered for conducting a hyper-aggressive probe.\n\nMost of the ways special counsels exhibit independence are not salutary.\n\n\nThat example aside,\u00a0the\u00a0principal failure of \u201cwe need an independent prosecutor\u201d argument is that special counsels are not independent. Just like U.S. attorneys, they answer to the attorney general (or deputy AG if the AG is recused). Mueller is effectively independent only because Rosenstein has chosen to be passive; by the Constitution and regulation, Mueller reports to Rosenstein, who could assert more active supervision. Meanwhile, most of the ways special counsels exhibit independence are not salutary \u2014 particularly their propensity to expand the duration and scope of investigations that most prosecutors would drop if the original rationale for opening the investigation had proven fruitless.\n\nChairmen Goodlatte and Gowdy are right: The investigators need to be investigated. But we do not need a special counsel to do it. There is no reason that Attorney General Sessions cannot structure a probe that can be credibly conducted by the Justice Department\u2019s standard investigative arrangement: the FBI, in conjunction with a U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. While some recent errors by federal officials have deservedly drawn rebuke, these institutions typically do solid, professional work, uninhibited by partisanship.

Tobin", "body": "Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon speaks during a campaign rally for Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore in Midland City, Alabama, December 11, 2017. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Jonathan  himself creates a different set of problems.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOnly a few months ago, it seemed as if Steve Bannon\u2019s plan to take over the Republican party wasn\u2019t just a fantasy. After he left the White House last summer, the former presidential adviser was talking big about a new version of the Tea Party \u2014 the uprising that knocked off several mainstream Republicans earlier in the decade. This time it would be orchestrated by the populists at Breitbart.\n\nBut Bannon staked everything on Roy Moore\u2019s campaign to represent Alabama in the Senate. Moore beat the establishment pick in the primary, and in doing so forced many Republicans, including President Trump, to back Moore in the general election. The defeat of the deeply flawed former judge \u2014 who, between the primary and the general election, was credibly accused of sexual misconduct in years past \u2014 was the beginning of the end for Bannon\u2019s plans.\n\n\nThe loss of a safe Republican Senate seat woke up the conservative movement and the party to the potential cost of Bannon\u2019s plans. More to the point, it woke up Trump, who after a year in office has a better appreciation of the value of a GOP Senate majority than perhaps he did when Bannon was running his presidential campaign.\n\nThe fruits of that realization were on display last week, when a Bannon recruit bowed to pressure from Trump and pulled out of a Nevada primary against incumbent senator Dean Heller. Danny Tarkanian had Bannon\u2019s support and made it clear he wasn\u2019t happy about giving up the chance to upend a relative moderate. But after the president tweeted that Tarkanian should run for an open House seat rather than engage in a bitter primary that would probably weaken the Republicans\u2019 chances in the general, the challenger felt he had no choice but to do as he was told.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of the tweet made two things clear. The first is that Bannon\u2019s chances for leading a populist revolt are officially over. The second, if it wasn\u2019t already obvious, is that the Republican party now belongs to Donald Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to throw his weight around in a manner that reflects Mitch McConnell\u2019s vision for how to pick Senate candidate has to cheer the GOP establishment. It could also make it easier for Republicans to hold on to their Senate majority in 2018 or even add to it, thanks to the large number of red-state Democrats running for reelection.\n\nBut this is far from assured. To the contrary, the fact that the GOP is now Trump\u2019s party, rather than one that can defend its congressional majorities on ideological or traditional partisan lines, is exactly why it might lose ground in November.\n\nThat the Republicans are all working for Trump in one way or another has been painfully obvious since the 2016 GOP convention in Cleveland. While a few Never Trump dissidents continue to speak out on the right, almost all have ceased pretending to have any affection for the party. The few Republican officeholders who are actively opposing Trump, such as Ohio governor John Kasich, Senator John McCain, and especially Senator Jeff Flake, do not labor under any delusion that they are anything but lonesome dissidents whose views are out of touch with those of the GOP electorate. Flake might be flirting with a quixotic run against Trump, but he openly admits he\u2019s not running for reelection to the Senate because he knows he has no chance of winning a Republican primary.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a painful irony to being the party of Trump: The president\u2019s flaws overshadow the GOP\u2019s merits \u2014 but his popularity with his base does not transfer to other Republican candidates. Thus, in the end, perhaps 2018 will be no exception to the rule that midterm elections are brutal for the party in control of the White House and Congress.\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans can hope that a booming economy and success against ISIS will mean more to voters than do the endless speculation about collusion with Russia and the White House scandals that lead the news every night. But Trump dominates the political conversation in such a way as to ensure that every other topic is overwhelmed by the 24/7 news cycle, and social media that can talk of little else.\n\nThis is not to say that Trump is losing ground in the polls. He\u2019s actually gaining slightly or at least holding his own in surveys of presidential approval. But as the GOP saw last week in a Pennsylvania district that Trump carried easily in 2016, his popularity among the GOP base doesn\u2019t apply to others. Trump campaigned in the district, but his appearance was about him, not the doomed GOP candidate.\n\nThat\u2019s a sobering thought for Republicans who know that Trump\u2019s unpopularity in much of the country is a heavy burden for their candidates to carry. While Trump still retains the support of most of his 2016 voters, the dynamic of a midterm election means that all the passion is on the side of the opposition, not the GOP activists who administered a shellacking to President Obama in 2010 and 2014. Trump\u2019s fans may well turn out to cheer for him, and they may give him a chance to win the same 30 states he took in 2016 when he runs for reelection in 2020. But they don\u2019t look to be sufficiently motivated to give him a Republican House for his third and fourth years in office.\n\nThe close identification between party and president may be exactly the factor that dooms Republicans in 2018.\n\n\nMcConnell\u2019s formula for a Republican Senate has involved recruiting competitive and qualified candidates to run in states where victory is possible. Despite their temperamental differences and the fact that many of his supporters think the majority leader is as much the enemy as the Democrats, Trump seems to have bought into this insight.\n\nThat makes him a responsible GOP leader, but his brand might now be so toxic that the close identification between party and president could be exactly the factor that dooms Republicans in 2018. Trump solved one big problem for McConnell, and the Kentucky senator can take grim satisfaction in the humiliation of his tormentor Bannon, who can no longer even call Breitbart a home since his ouster there.

AFSCME and AFT are two of the AFL-CIO\u2019s largest member unions.\n\n\u201cThe corporate special interests behind this case are dead set on eliminating the rights and freedoms of working people to organize, to negotiate collectively and to have any voice in working to better their lives,\u201d National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said. \u201cThis is a blatant slap in the face of educators, nurses, firefighters, police officers and all public servants who make our communities strong and safe.\u201d\n\nTaking hundreds of dollars per year in mandatory fees from teachers in nearly two dozen states enabled NEA to pay Eskelsen Garcia $348,732 last year and $512,504 the year before that.\n\n\u201cThe anti-worker extremists behind this case want to divide working people, make it harder to pool our resources, and limit our collective power,\u201d Service Employees International Union president Mary Kay Henry said in September, when the Supreme Court announced it would hear the Janus case.\n\nSweeping condemnations of \u201ca rigged system,\u201d \u201crich CEOs,\u201d \u201canti-union oligarchs,\u201d \u201ccorporate special interests,\u201d and \u201canti-worker extremists\u201d undermine the hair-splitting distinctions union lawyers try to make between political and apolitical spending when defending mandatory fees in court; it\u2019s clear that union leaders believe their activism is inextricably linked to their ability to coerce fees from non-members.\n\nWhile Messenger argues that mandatory public-sector union fees are spent on political activism that dissenting workers shouldn\u2019t be forced to support as a condition of employment, Saunders, Trumka, Weingarten, Eskelsen Garcia, and Henry imply that dissenting workers should be forced to pay unions because of their activism.\n\nDemocrats and left-wing activist groups \u2014 beneficiaries of more than $1 billion in union spending from 2010 to 2016 \u2014 are similarly energetic in their defense of mandatory public-sector union fees, often repeating the same language the unions use to avoid discussing mandatory fees directly.\n\n\u201cIn Janus v. AFSCME, we are witnessing the culmination of the billionaires\u2019 anti-worker agenda,\u201d wrote far-left Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who was endorsed by AFSCME, AFT, NEA, and several other powerful labor unions in the 2017 race for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cThe case before the Supreme Court on Monday threatens the freedom of millions of Americans working in the public sector to bargain for decent pay, better benefits, and a voice in their workplace,\u201d Neera Tanden, president of the union-funded Center for American Progress, wrote at USA Today.\n\n\u201cThe Right intends to use Janus to gut public-employee unions, weakening what is the strongest constituency in organized labor. This in turn will greatly diminish labor\u2019s strength as a progressive force,\u201d wrote a contributor at AFSCME-sponsored online magazine Working in These Times.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) called the Janus case \u201cthe latest case in a years-long assault by powerful right-wing billionaires against workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is an attack on workers\u2019 rights backed by wealthy corporations,\u201d Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) wrote on Twitter.\n\nWith Messenger\u2019s oral arguments and all of the exhibits filed on his behalf, Janus may not have needed anything further to prevail when the Supreme Court issues its decision in his case this spring. But if a worker arguing that AFSCME is an inherently political organization that he shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay wanted to show why he felt that way, he couldn\u2019t ask for much better than the behavior of the union and its left-wing allies last week.\n\n\nShould Gorsuch vote with the four justices who sided against mandatory public-sector union fees in 2016, AFSCME, AFT, NEA, and SEIU will still be able to engage in outspoken progressive activism \u2014 but they\u2019ll have to do so without taking money from the teachers and other public employees who disagree with their agenda.\n\n\u2014\u00a0Jason Hart is\u00a0a health and labor policy analyst in central Ohio.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David French", "body": "Parents and students attend a demonstration calling for more gun control in Coral Springs, Florida, February 18, 2018.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Jonathan  should state this moral truth while remaining humble, aware that we don\u2019t know how we would have responded in a crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn the entire horrible history of modern mass shootings, have government failures ever been so comprehensive and so heartbreaking as those that led up to school massacre in Parkland, Fla.? The FBI received a precise tip and failed to act. Local law enforcement was called to the shooter\u2019s home dozens of times. Local law enforcement received a precise tip and failed to act. Many mass shooters wave red flags. The Parkland shooter did everything but call police and tell them the date and time of his attack. It would have been difficult for him to make his intentions more clear.\n\nThen, yesterday, the story got even more heartbreaking. When the news of the attack first broke, millions of Americans wondered if there was security on campus, and if so, what security did as the attack unfolded? Well, it turns out that there was a law-enforcement officer on campus. He \u201cresponded\u201d to the shooting, and did nothing. At the critical moment, he stayed outside. The Miami Herald has the details:\n\n[Scot] Peterson \u2014 named school resource officer of the year for Parkland in 2014 \u2014 was in another building, dealing with a student issue when the shots sounded. Armed with his sidearm, Peterson ran to the west side of Building 12 and set up in a defensive position, then did nothing for four minutes until the gunfire stopped, the sheriff said.\n\nBroward County sheriff Scott Israel said that he was \u201csick to his stomach\u201d about Peterson\u2019s failure. Asked what Peterson should have done, Israel replied: \u201cWent in. Addressed the killer. Killed the killer.\u201d\n\nAn armed and trained officer hovered outside. Waiting. While children died. There is no excuse.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell that to Twitter. For some folks there is one narrative \u2014 and one narrative alone \u2014 that should dominate public discourse: Ban assault weapons. So the unjustifiable had to be justified. It was a suicide mission, they said. How could a cop with a handgun take on a killer with an AR-15? This proves that a good guy with a gun can\u2019t stop a bad guy with an \u201cassault rifle.\u201d Besides, who are you to judge? If you\u2019ve never been in combat, you don\u2019t know what that fear is like.\n\nLet\u2019s be very clear. Every single person who puts on a uniform and pledges to protect their community \u2014 either in combat overseas or under fire at home \u2014 is indicating by their choice that they are willing (not wanting, willing) to lay down their lives. That is their job. When the crisis hits, that is their purpose. It\u2019s what we expect of soldiers in environments that are far more intense. It\u2019s what we expect of cops when the shots ring out. If you have doubts about your ability to do that job, don\u2019t put on the uniform.\n\nEven so, there are some people in uniform who will fail that test. Infantry soldiers wilt under fire, even when their brothers\u2019 lives hang in the balance. One cop will hang back when another charges forward. When every molecule in your body is screaming for you to live, to protect yourself, it takes immense strength to expose yourself to mortal danger. Simply put, until you\u2019ve felt true fear, you don\u2019t really know how you\u2019d react.\n\nCultivating courage is a complex and difficult task. Some armies are better at it than others. Some civilizations are better at it than others. And no sane army or civilization relies merely on the inherent goodness or virtue of their warriors to maintain resolve. Courage comes through inspiration \u2014 we aspire to do great things \u2014 but it can also come through fear. There are soldiers or cops who ultimately fear shame more than death. They fear condemnation. Some fear punishment.\n\nThat\u2019s why armies throughout history have celebrated valor and punished cowardice. There is a carrot and a stick. Great sacrifice brings great honor. Abject cowardice brings severe sanction. Failure carries with it a deep sense of shame. Adjust that balance \u2014 remove the shame of failure \u2014 and you risk draining courage from your culture.\n\nFailure carries with it a deep sense of shame. Adjust that balance \u2014 remove the shame of failure \u2014 and you risk draining courage from your culture.\n\nWe can and should state this moral truth while remaining deeply humble and self-aware. There is a world of difference between stating, \u201cThat cop should have intervened\u201d and puffing out your chest and declaring, \u201cI would have done better.\u201d You can imagine the kind of person you want to be, and you can dream of being a hero, but many imaginary warriors have turned tail at the sound of the guns. Simply put, you don\u2019t truly know how you\u2019ll respond to a crisis until you\u2019ve been in a crisis.\n\nIn other words, we can understand his failure even if we cannot justify that failure. To fail to understand is to fail to grapple with fallen humanity. To justify it is to surrender to that fallen nature and normalize cowardice.\n\nFailure is not inevitable. Courage is possible. Killers with assault rifles? Cops have taken them on before. Just ask the Capitol Police who engaged the man who tried to massacre congressional Republicans in Alexandria, Va. An AR-15 does not render a man bulletproof. There were unarmed students and teachers inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who exhibited greater courage than did the armed officer who had promised to protect them.\n\n\nThe gun-control debate is growing truly twisted if it becomes necessary to excuse cowardice to advance public policy. It is entirely acceptable for law-abiding gun-owning Americans to demand that the government do its job before considering sweeping new restrictions that will primarily impact people who\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Part of law enforcement\u2019s job is to follow up on specific tips and warnings. Part of its job is to ask specific men and women in uniform to lay down their lives to protect the public.\n\nYes, men may be cowards. No, none of us know how we would respond to a crisis until we face that ultimate test. But none of the events in Parkland have taught me to trust others to protect my family. And certainly none of the events in Parkland have built my trust in government.

On February 26, CBS News chimed in: \u201cRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke could mean blue wave hits deep red Texas in Senate race.\u201d Just this week, CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza siren-blared the following headline: \u201cSenate Key Race Alert: Texas Is No Longer Solid Republican.\u201d (The story, which focuses on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent impressive fundraising, somewhat begrudgingly notes that \u201cCruz still holds a clear advantage in the race.\u201d)\n\nThen there\u2019s the local coverage of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s events, which tend to infuse O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gatherings in middle-school gyms with \u201cfrantic energy\u201d and a surge of mysticism on the side.

As the Times piece notes, \u201cno Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994, the year before Amazon sold its first book.\u201d But turning Texas blue, for many on the Democratic side of the aisle, is the fever dream that never dies. Google the words \u201cTexas blue wave,\u201d in fact, and you will reap a digitized and passionate wave of hopes and dreams that might knock you out of your chair.\n\nAlso, as an aside, I should clarify that I have nothing against Beto O\u2019Rourke. I would never vote for him, given that he has a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and a \u201cvision\u201d for single-payer health care, and a host of other half-baked ideas \u2014 including one he recently abandoned that involved mandating a year of government service, despite the fact that people already de facto serve the government by forking over income taxes.

Texas needs to be more like Illinois or New York!\u2019\n\nMy problem, however, is this: Why is it that, time and time again, Democrats and media players look at the wild success of Texas \u2014 a state that is growing and thriving and drawing people who are fleeing Illinois, New York, and other blue states \u2014 study it a for bit, scratch their chins like a herd of drunk professors, and then say, \u201cAh, yes. Texas needs to be more like Illinois or New York!\u201d? I myself fled a blue state five years ago, and I can tell you that I didn\u2019t move to Texas so that it could be more like Illinois. (Illinois, much to its chagrin, recently joined New York and New Jersey to make up the top three in the latest United Van Lines survey of America\u2019s most-fled states.)\n\nScoff if you will, but Texas, as state residents are famous for reminding anyone who will listen, is a glorious place. I\u2019m always a bit shocked to hear someone new to the state \u2014 and there is always someone new, often from San Francisco or Silicon Valley or Brooklyn or what have you \u2014 confessing their shock and alarm that they\u2019ve actually moved to . . . gasp . . . Texas. They moved to Texas, of course, because it is more affordable and has low taxes and is home to three of the top-ten fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the United States; plus, it doesn\u2019t propose bills to put waiters in jail if they serve unwanted bendy straws. (That place, in case you\u2019re wondering, is California.)\n\n\nCould it be that these desirable traits are largely the result of conservative policies? Nah, couldn\u2019t be.\n\nRegardless, the enthusiastic beat to turn Texas blue goes on. This is nothing new: Wendy Davis\u2019s epic gubernatorial loss to Greg Abbott was prefaced with months of breathless, over-the-top coverage, largely driven by her terrifying level of abortion fandom. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign appears its worthy heir, at least when it comes to delirious media coverage. Perhaps his impressive round of fundraising will actually translate into success.

This is not a partisan point. It\u2019s as true of Republicans as it is of Democrats, as a general rule \u2014 though it wouldn\u2019t shock me if it\u2019s more acute in more Democrats than Republicans for the simple reason that Democrats tend to invest more in the power and nobility of government than Republicans do. Politicians are prone to thinking the country needs them where they are (or in some higher office).\n\nNo doubt the reasons for this belief are complicated and numerous. Sometimes it may even be true. Churchill believed he was the indispensable\u00a0man, and for a time he certainly was. But most of the time, I think it\u2019s fair to say that this mindset is derived from a bundle of rationalizations. They like being the center of attention. They like power. They like \u201cbeing in the room where it happens,\u201d to borrow a phrase from the song. And, often, they\u2019ve got no place else to go, to borrow another from An Officer and a Gentleman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, they stick around longer than they should.\n\nConsider Nancy Pelosi. The House minority leader will be 78 next week. She was first elected to the House in 1987. No doubt she has many legislative accomplishments under her belt. She was also the first female speaker of the House. But is there any doubt that it\u2019s time for Pelosi to pack it in?\n\nWhile I\u2019m no fan of hers for ideological reasons, this isn\u2019t an ideological or partisan point. She\u2019s simply an albatross for the Democratic party. Dave Weigel writes:\n\nThe GOP tried to tie [Conor] Lamb to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the San Francisco liberal and subject of countless Republican attack ads over the past 10 years. Lamb said he would not support her for speaker if Democrats won the House, undercutting the GOP criticism.\n\nYet Republican groups still plastered the Pennsylvania airwaves with her image, highlighting polls that had her favorability in the district at 25\u00a0percent.\n\nA day after the election, Republicans made clear they will be relentless in using Pelosi as a cudgel against Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to also talk about what would happen if Nancy Pelosi became speaker again,\u201d said Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the party\u2019s whip.\n\nPelosi took Lamb\u2019s apparent victory as proof that the attacks no longer connected, dismissing questions about her popularity.\n\n\u201cHe won. If he hadn\u2019t won, you might have a question. But he won,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is kind of sad. Yes, it\u2019s true that the GOP effort to effectively tie Lamb to Pelosi failed insofar as Lamb won. But the GOP\u2019s messaging didn\u2019t work because Lamb effectively severed himself from Pelosi by saying he wouldn\u2019t vote for her for speaker. Weigel offers powerful evidence that Pelosi is in denial. He reports:\n\nIn interviews over the past month with 16 Democrats running for Congress, none said affirmatively that they would support Pelosi for speaker.\n\nIf Pelosi retired from Congress (or from leadership), the Democrats would be more likely to take back the House. But she can\u2019t see it \u2014 or won\u2019t acknowledge it. Pelosi\u2019s rejoinder, and her overall attitude, will be the stuff of Downfall videos if the Democrats fail to take back the House.\n\n\nNow, in the grand tradition of National Review, you could make an argument that conservatives, as opposed to Republicans, should hope Pelosi comes to her senses and steps down for the good of her party. Why? Because virtually any plausible replacement of the San Francisco Democrat would be an improvement since, at least rhetorically, they would be marginally more conservative. The trade off, of course, would be that a Democrat-led Congress would deal a far more devastating blow to the conservative legislative agenda. I do think it\u2019s worth remembering, however, that the point of the conservative movement isn\u2019t simply to get Republicans elected but to move the political center of gravity of the country rightward.\n\nOf course, this is all academic because I am invincibly certain that Ms. Pelosi does not value my advice. I am also almost as certain that she thinks the country and the Democratic party need her vastly more than they actually   Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National  Posts", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jonah Goldberg", "body": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, July 27, 2016. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Carlo  may have been willing, but could he really pull it off?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDespite the indictment of 13 Russian professional social-media pranksters who worked to tip the 2016 election to Donald Trump, I remain somewhere between skeptical and agnostic on the question of whether or not Trump knowingly and secretly colluded with the Russians to win the election.\n\nWe\u2019ll come back to those important qualifiers \u2014 knowingly and secretly \u2014 in a moment.\n\nBut first, a word about conspiracy theories: As a rule, they will almost always let you down.\n\n\n\n\nThe conspiracy theories that capture our imagination usually depend on false assumptions about how the world works. They rely on the idea that government (or some other large organization) is both profoundly evil and profoundly competent, particularly at keeping secrets. Sometimes the former may be true, but the latter virtually never is. Conspiracy theories also rely on the belief that objectively bad outcomes are subjectively intended. It\u2019s like trying to read the world like a work of literature, where all actions foreshadow future events.\n\nThat\u2019s why I tend to avoid conspiracy theory in favor of what one might call character theory. Character is destiny, as Heraclitus observed, and it serves as a far more reliable guide than feverish dot-connecting of disparate events.\n\nIt is President Trump\u2019s character that leads me to think he didn\u2019t do it, at least not in a way the impeachment-hungry mob hopes he did.\n\nOh, I think he\u2019s morally capable of having done it. As a candidate he publicly called on the Russians to (further) hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s server and release the missing emails. He is the one member of his administration incapable of condemning Russian president Vladimir Putin or his regime. Indeed, his instincts are to hail Putin\u2019s \u201cleadership.\u201d\n\nIt is President Trump\u2019s character that leads me to think he didn\u2019t do it, at least not in a way the impeachment-hungry mob hopes he did.\n\nNor do I think Trump surrounded himself during the campaign with people who would have talked him out of collusion (save for then-senator Jeff Sessions). Saying that his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is not overly scrupulous would be a mind-bending understatement. And Trump\u2019s son Don Jr. has already admitted a) that he met with a Russian emissary and b) that he didn\u2019t care where anti-Clinton dirt came from.\n\nBut while they may have been willing to coordinate with the Kremlin, I\u2019m not at all certain they would have been able to pull it off \u2014 and keep it a secret. Everything we know about the Trump campaign is that it was a shambolic moveable feast of warring egos, relentless leaks, and summary firings. But we\u2019re supposed to believe that everyone maintained total secrecy about Russian collusion?\n\nMore implausible, we\u2019re supposed to believe that Trump has never let it slip, in private or public? The man admitted he fired FBI director James Comey to thwart the Russia investigation. Indeed, his blunders are what invited the investigation in the first place.\n\nSo why, you might ask, is Trump so obsessed with stopping Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia probe? I have three mutually reinforcing theories.\n\nFirst: Trump thinks the probe is unfair. He knows he didn\u2019t personally collude and feels unjustly accused. Second, it\u2019s a blow to his ego, because he thinks it robs him of credit for what he believes was a landslide victory. (It wasn\u2019t.) And third, he fears Mueller might find something else. Perhaps Trump\u2019s not nearly as rich as he claims. Maybe his business practices (or those of his family), particularly with regard to Russia, would not withstand close legal scrutiny. One explanation for why Trump always flattered Putin on the campaign trail is that he thought he would lose the election, so why foreclose future business opportunities?\n\nFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon matter-of-factly told author Michael Wolff: \u201cThis is all about money laundering.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s \u201cpath to .\u00a0.\u00a0. Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr. and Jared Kushner,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cIt\u2019s as plain as a hair on your face.\u201d Tellingly, the president has said he might fire Mueller if he looks into his family\u2019s finances.\n\n\nThese three factors add up to an explanation for why Trump insists the whole Russia investigation is a witch hunt and why he can\u2019t stop obsessing over it. It\u2019s not the only explanation, but it\u2019s more consistent with what we know of Trump\u2019s character than the current conspiracy theories, which depend on us believing he\u2019s a villainous mastermind.\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tribune Content Agency,   Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Clarke D.

Five Justices in Hellerstedt threw out health and safety regulations for Texas abortion clinics by adopting a new version of the \u201cundue burden\u201d test, by which the Court gave power to judges to decide whether state regulations impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s decision to choose abortion. Sooner or later, this persistently troublesome area of American constitutional law is bound to come back to the Court, and that may happen later this year.\n\n\n\n\nThis confusion goes back 45 years, to Roe v. Wade, by which the Court assumed authority to approve or disapprove \u2014 directly or through the lower federal courts \u2014 every abortion law in the country. In 1983, a decade after Roe, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor criticized the Court for its inconsistent application of Roe in cases over the preceding decade. Nine years later, the Court substantially changed Roe and created the \u201cundue burden\u201d test in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).\n\nThe late Justice Antonin Scalia predicted then that the new test would sow confusion, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. How a burden is determined to be \u201cundue\u201d in any case is entirely subjective. An \u201cundue burden\u201d seems to look at the justification for the burden, while a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d seems to look at only the extent of the burden.\n\nA year after Casey, the Court compounded the problem by adding a \u201clarge fraction\u201d factor to the \u201cundue burden\u201d test. For more than two decades, the federal courts struggled to determine what was a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of \u201crelevant\u201d cases showing a \u201csubstantial obstacle.\u201d\n\nIn January, abortion advocates asked the Supreme Court to review a case from Arkansas that tests whether any evidence is needed to claim that a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of women seeking abortion face a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d (Planned Parenthood v. Jegley). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed a lower-court injunction against a state regulation of chemical abortion because the court had \u201cdone no math\u201d to demonstrate that a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of women would likely be affected. That case has been prematurely appealed, and the justices should not hear it unless and until the factual record has been sufficiently developed.\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in Hellerstedt, the Court once again changed the \u201cundue burden\u201d test, by granting federal judges, for the first time, the power to personally review the \u201cbenefits and burdens\u201d of health and safety regulations, imposing a subjective standard that can be heavily influenced by the personal views of the judge. It is a highly speculative endeavor when federal judges review, as they often do, state abortion laws before they have gone into effect.\n\nUsing Hellerstedt as a sword, abortion clinics have now reopened attacks against abortion regulations across the country. In courts in Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas, more than a dozen cases are pending that challenge state abortion regulations \u2014 including laws that were upheld by the Supreme Court before Hellerstedt.\n\nThe confusion sowed by Hellerstedt isn\u2019t limited to health and safety standards for clinics or to hospital admitting policies after abortion complications, the specific issues involved in the case. Some pending cases seek to extend Hellerstedt to strike down basic medical-licensing and credentialing requirements. In Alabama and Indiana, parental-notice or consent statutes, an issue supposedly settled by prior Supreme Court decisions, have been challenged. Although the Court has twice upheld a physician-only law (that only physicians can do abortions), such laws in Maine and Montana are now facing court challenges. Waiting periods, which the Court previously upheld in Casey, are being challenged in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, and Tennessee.\n\nThe ambiguity in Hellerstedt seems intentional.\n\nHellerstedt has reopened 45 years of abortion law and interpretation. Before Hellerstedt the Court looked at the impact of specific abortion laws. Now Hellerstedt suggests that abortion advocates can, as they are now doing in Louisiana, challenge a number of state laws taken together, for their cumulative impact on abortion \u201caccess.\u201d\n\nFive justices in Hellerstedt said there wasn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d evidence of the need for Texas\u2019s health and safety regulations, though there was significant evidence in the record. Law professor Mary Ziegler, author of After Roe, notes that Hellerstedt \u201coffers little guidance about how much (or how good) the proof must be before lawmakers can regulate.\u201d That is a serious obstacle for legislators and public-health officials.\n\n\n\n\nThe ambiguity in Hellerstedt seems intentional. If the Court in June 2016 lacked enough votes to impose a broader injunction against state abortion regulations, the justices could effectively do the same thing by issuing a vague opinion that enabled abortion clinics to reopen challenges to parental laws, informed-consent laws, and waiting periods, knowing that sympathetic federal judges could shut down the laws for years, if not indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of Hellerstedt, Americans United for Life, where I serve as senior counsel, published Unsafe, a 200-page report (backed up by 250 pages of data) documenting that 227 abortion providers in 32 states were cited for more than 1,400 health and safety deficiencies between 2008 and 2016. By ruling as they did in Hellerstedt, the justices left unresolved the problem of substandard conditions and providers in dozens of abortion businesses across the country.\n\nWith Hellerstedt, the Court has neither clarified nor settled its abortion doctrine. Confusion prevents state and local officials from effectively doing what the justices have repeatedly said the states have the authority to do: protect the states\u2019 interest in fetal life and maternal health.

Mccarthy", "body": "It has become more urgent to ask: Why is there a special counsel in the Russia investigation? At this point, that question should be put to the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel \u2014 in the federal government, it\u2019s the lawyers\u2019 lawyer. To get down to brass tacks: May the president of the United States be charged with obstruction based on non-criminal discretionary acts that are unquestionably within his constitutional authority as chief executive?\n\n\n\tReaders of these columns may recall that I opposed the appointment of a special counsel and have argued that the appointment was illegitimate. This has nothing to do with Robert Mueller, who has had a distinguished law-enforcement career for which he is justly admired. It has to do with first principles and clear regulations. As a matter of principle, the law-enforcement arm of government must operate on a presumption of innocence. Therefore, in this country, a prosecutor should be assigned only if there is strong evidence that a crime has been committed; in the absence of such evidence, a prosecutor should never be assigned to investigate whether an American may have committed some unknown crime.\n\n\n\tThis, as we\u2019ve repeatedly observed, is reflected in the regulations that control when the Justice Department may appoint a special counsel. The question should never come up unless there is some \u201ccriminal investigation or prosecution\u201d that creates a conflict of interest for Justice Department leadership. A special counsel may be appointed only for purposes of this \u201ccriminal investigation or prosecution.\u201d In the absence of strong evidence of a crime, there is no basis for a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tThe Russia Investigation\u2019s Two Components\n\tThe Russia investigation, as it has been amorphously defined by the Justice Department (in March 20, 2017, testimony by former FBI director James Comey and in the May 17, 2017, order appointing Mueller by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) has two components.\n\n\n\tThere is, first, the overarching counterintelligence investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. As we have pointed out many times, a counterintelligence investigation is not a criminal investigation, and therefore cannot legitimately predicate the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe objective of a counterintelligence investigation is to collect intelligence about the actions and intentions of a foreign power to the extent they may affect American interests. The aim is not prosecution. Indeed, prosecution can undermine counterintelligence since the latter relies on secrecy (counterintelligence investigations are highly classified), while the former mandates public disclosure of allegations, evidence, and witnesses. Consequently, while Justice Department prosecutors are routinely assigned to criminal investigations, they are not assigned to counterintelligence investigations \u2014 government lawyers get involved when intelligence agents need the assistance of court process, such as warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\n\n\tThe second component of the Russia investigation is studiously vague. It was described by then-director Comey as an inquiry into \u201cthe nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\tThere are a couple of salient things to notice here. First, this was not a standalone investigation; Comey explicitly described it as included within the just-described counterintelligence probe of Russian election interference \u2014 i.e., it was not described as a criminal investigation. Second, what is outlined here is not a predicate for a criminal investigation: It is not a federal crime to have \u201clinks\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 to the Russian government; and whatever the equally slippery word \u201ccoordination\u201d may mean, there can be no federal crime unless (a) \u201cRussia\u2019s efforts\u201d transgressed some penal law (e.g., anti-hacking statutes) and (b) the \u201ccoordination\u201d rose to the level of knowing complicity in that transgression (e.g., conspiracy to commit hacking).\n\n\n\tEven if one believes that the Putin regime had a strong preference for Donald Trump, such support is not a concern of prosecutors unless criminal laws are broken.\n\n\n\tEven if one believes that the Putin regime had a strong preference for Donald Trump (personally, I believe the Kremlin hoped to sow discord and create havoc regardless of who won), such support is not a concern of prosecutors unless criminal laws are broken. And even that would not implicate \u201cindividuals associated with the Trump campaign\u201d in the absence of strong evidence that they aided, abetted, or conspired in the law-breaking.\n\n\n\tBottom line: What Comey described, and Rosenstein later adopted in defining Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction, was not a criminal investigation or prosecution, nor did it provide a factual basis for a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n\n\n\tWhat should have happened here is what should always happen. The FBI should have proceeded with its counterintelligence investigation of Russian interference in the election, and because such investigations are classified, not a word should have been said about it publicly. Then if, in the course of that non-criminal investigation, strong evidence of crimes was uncovered, that evidence should have been referred to the criminal-investigative arms of the FBI and the Justice Department. At that point, if the strong evidence of crime pointed at Trump-campaign associates or even the president himself, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should have recused himself (because of his involvement in the Trump campaign), and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should have appointed a special counsel to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute the crime that had been uncovered.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tWhy a Special Counsel?\n\tThis is not what happened. Mueller was appointed in the absence of strong evidence of a crime that would legitimately trigger a criminal investigation or prosecution. Since that should not have happened, one must ask: Why?\n\n\n\tIn a column on Thursday, I argued that the Obama administration saw the Russia probe as an opportunity to paralyze President Trump. As I noted in the column, the motivation for this could have been sinister or public-spirited \u2014 how you see it probably depends on what you think of Obama and Trump. President Trump\u2019s political opponents would have seen the Russia probe as a chance to strangle his capacity to govern and pursue his agenda; some investigators who suspected that the disturbing allegations in the Steele dossier were true, even if they had not and probably could not be proved, may have harbored good-faith concern that Trump could be blackmailed by Russia.\n\n\n\tRegardless of the motivation, the scheme to sustain the Russia investigation even after Obama left office and Trump was in a position to end it had three parts: (1) important information about the investigation needed to be withheld from the new president; (2) Trump had to be led to believe he was not under investigation (even though he was central to the investigation) so that he would not feel threatened by the investigation; and (3) Trump had to be admonished about respecting the independence of law-enforcement, to instill the fear that if he invoked his constitutional authority to shut down the investigation, he would be accused of obstruction.\n\n\n\tThis audacious strategy worked for four months, but it was done in by its core contradiction: It called for informing the president that he was not a suspect when he clearly was.\n\n\n\tSince the FBI, with the encouragement of Obama holdovers in the Justice Department, was being outrageously public about the existence of the counterintelligence probe and the fact that the Trump campaign was being investigated, the president naturally wanted it to be equally public that the FBI director had assured him he was not under investigation. The refusal of the FBI director to absolve the president was not tenable: Since he should not have said anything publicly about the investigation at all, it made no sense that he would publicly say things suggestive of Trump\u2019s guilt yet refuse to reveal that he had privately told Trump and Congress that Trump was not a suspect.\n\n\n\tComey\u2019s refusal to absolve Trump naturally led to greater focus on the alleged misconduct he appeared, by implication, to be a suspect in: \u2018collusion with Russia.\u2019\n\n\n\tThis refusal to absolve Trump naturally led to greater focus on the alleged misconduct he appeared, by implication, to be a suspect in: \u201ccollusion with Russia.\u201d But after many months, no evidence of actionable, criminal collusion had emerged. Trump understandably saw himself being whipsawed: There was no crime and he had been told he was not a suspect, yet the FBI was conducting itself as if there had been a shocking crime in which he was the main suspect.\n\n\n\tConsequently, Trump fired Comey, but he did not shut down the Russia investigation. The administration badly botched the explanation for Comey\u2019s firing (and amateurishly failed to anticipate the fervid Democratic opposition to it). The president\u2019s true rationale for the dismissal was the dichotomy between the director\u2019s public and private posturing; the point was not to halt a counterintelligence probe of Russian election-meddling, which continued apace.\n\n\n\tRemember: The Obama strategy was to straitjacket Trump by making him the focus of a continuing investigation, even if there was no apparent crime and even though Trump, as president, had the power to end the investigation. With Comey now sidelined, the only way to continue exploiting the Russia counterintelligence investigation for this purpose was to get a special counsel appointed.\n\n\n\tThis is no doubt why Comey went to such inappropriate lengths \u2014 the leaking to the media of a government memo involving his communications with the president about an investigation \u2014 to try to instigate the appointment, as he has testified. (\u201cI asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d) The administration\u2019s appalling mishandling of Comey\u2019s removal, which had Rosenstein reeling as the target of Democratic and media wrath, induced the deputy attorney general to submit. Mueller was appointed, and Trump is stuck with the investigation for as long as it lasts.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tWeakness of the Collusion Case\n\tThe ultra vires appointment of a special counsel provides a structure for keeping the president under investigation notwithstanding his ostensible authority over the Justice Department. Nevertheless, it cannot paper over the fatal weaknesses of the underlying case.\n\n\n\tIt has long been manifest that there is no criminal \u201ccollusion with Russia\u201d case. If there had been, there would have been no need for the legerdemain of conducting a criminal probe surreptitiously, under the label of \u201ccounterintelligence.\u201d\n\n\n\tIt is now clear that the collusion narrative was catalyzed by an unverifiable dossier of rank, anonymous hearsay, commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign and compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who lied to the FBI about his communications with the media \u2014 which the bureau should have anticipated since, as a mercenary retained by an opposition-research operation working for Democrats, Steele\u2019s job was to get Mrs. Clinton elected, not to investigate Russia. These facts were kept from the FISA court when the Justice Department and the FBI used the dossier to seek surveillance warrants. It increasingly appears that the officials who made these judgments may have more to answer for than the Americans on whom they were spying.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tWeakness of the Obstruction Case\n\tThis brings us to the other focus of the Mueller investigation, obstruction. From a prosecutor\u2019s standpoint, obstruction has two advantages over \u201ccollusion with Russia\u201d: (1) It is an actual statutory crime, and (2) it is unquestionably within the scope of a special counsel\u2019s jurisdiction. (See section 600.4(a) of the Code of Federal Regulations.)\n\n\n\tWe do not know everything the special counsel knows, but as publicly understood, the obstruction allegation against Trump seems to be based on two, or perhaps three, incidents: (a) the request that Comey drop the criminal investigation of former national-security adviser Michael Flynn, (b) the firing of Comey, and (c) an impulse to fire Mueller. The third is difficult to take seriously because, if it happened, it is at most an unconsummated directive: White House Counsel Donald McGahn reportedly declined to carry out an order to fire Mueller that he had not gotten directly from the president. So let\u2019s deal with the first two.\n\n\n\tThere is no legal doubt that a president may obstruct justice by the performance of illegal acts aimed at corruptly influencing legal proceedings. The plan to bribe Watergate witnesses in the Nixon impeachment proceedings and the subornation of perjury in the Clinton impeachment proceedings are illustrative. It is anything but clear, however, that a president may be found guilty of obstruction based on the performance of legal acts that are patently within his constitutional authority.\n\n\n\tIn connection with Flynn, we must note that prosecutorial discretion is an executive power. In our system, all executive power is vested in the president. Thus, federal prosecutors who exercise discretion hundreds of times a day in weighing the merits of continuing investigations or filing charges are exercising the president\u2019s power. They are delegates; they do not have power of their own. It would therefore be absurd to suggest that they are authorized to exercise the president\u2019s power but the president is not. The president had no less authority to weigh in on the merits of continuing the Flynn investigation than his Justice Department and FBI subordinates had.\n\n\n\tClearly, it would be better if a president did not get involved in criminal cases. That, however, is because of prudential policy aimed at protecting the public integrity of the legal system; there is no legal prohibition against it.\n\n\n\tClearly, it would be better if a president did not get involved in criminal cases. That, however, is because of prudential policy aimed at protecting the public integrity of the legal system; there is no legal prohibition against it. Moreover, the president is constitutionally empowered to end a criminal investigation or prosecution by issuing a pardon or ordering that it be shut down. Since our law thus allows the president to obstruct an investigation conclusively, it is specious to contend that criminally actionable obstruction occurs if he merely requests that the investigator exercise discretion in a suspect\u2019s favor. That is especially the case when, as here, (a) the president did not demand that the investigation be closed; (b) objectively, there was a very good argument on the merits that Flynn did nothing wrong but had suffered mightily; and (c) the investigation nevertheless continued \u2014 and Flynn was eventually prosecuted \u2014 without any presidential interference.\n\n\n\tAs for Director Comey, he was a subordinate executive officer. As such, he served at the pleasure of the president, who did not need a reason to remove him. Even if we assume, as I do, that Trump fired Comey over his handling of the Russia investigation, the president undeniably had the authority to do this.\n\n\n\tIt is worth repeating that the Russia investigation is a counterintelligence probe; it was not a judicial proceeding or a criminal investigation. Counterintelligence probes are not conducted to enforce the law through judicial proceedings; they are conducted to inform the president of threats posed by foreign powers. The president may shut them down at will, and doing so does not obstruct justice in any way.\n\n\n\tSignificantly, Trump did not terminate Comey because the Russia investigation was being conducted; he did it, again, because Comey publicly intimated that Trump was a suspect but refused to disclose his assurances that Trump was not a suspect. While I think it was unwise to fire Comey, this was hardly an irrational basis for doing so. In fact, it is a basis that would have been less controversial had the president been forthright about it, rather than disingenuously relying on Rosenstein\u2019s memo (which based the justification for removal on the director\u2019s public statements about the Clinton emails case).\n\n\n\tWhile Trump could have ordered the Russia investigation to be shut down, Comey\u2019s dismissal clearly was not intended to have that effect. Far from being obstructed, the investigation has continued despite the director\u2019s dismissal and replacement. That is to be expected, since the rubber-meets-the-road work of such an investigation is done by counterintelligence agents, not by the FBI director.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tHave the Office of Legal Counsel Resolve the Obstruction Question\n\tThat, in any event, is my view of it \u2014 which is worth what you\u2019ve paid for it. By contrast, an analysis that would really matter is that of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. By federal regulation, it is the task of OLC to prepare formal opinions on questions of law for the attorney general, which opinions are binding on the executive branch, including the Justice Department, subject to the approval of the attorney general and, ultimately, the president.\n\n\n\tI do not believe a president can commit an obstruction crime by lawful actions that are within his discretionary authority under the Constitution \u2014 although I do not doubt that a president could be impeached for abusing his discretionary authority. (Concrete example: A president would not commit obstruction by mass-pardoning a category of dangerous offenders, but Congress could well decide that doing so was an abuse of power worthy of impeachment and removal.) But my view is hardly unanimous. Other analysts contend that ostensibly lawful presidential acts shed their legitimacy if corruptly motivated and therefore qualify as obstruction \u2014 i.e., as corrupt endeavors to influence official proceedings.\n\n\n\tWho is right? That is a straight legal question of critical importance. Under federal law, the attorney general (or his deputy if, as here, the AG is recused) routinely delegates the OLC to prepare formal legal opinions for the purpose of guiding prosecutors and other government officials, and these opinions may be published for the benefit of the three branches of government, the bar, and the public. So why not let the OLC settle the matter?\n\n\n\tAn OLC opinion would be invaluable guidance for Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller. An OLC opinion would help clarify whether there truly is a basis for an obstruction allegation against President Trump. This would either lift a cloud of suspicion that makes it very difficult for a president to govern, or put Trump and future presidents on notice of what seemingly lawful presidential actions carry the hazard of potential legal jeopardy.\n\n\n\tLet\u2019s get to the bottom of this. If there are real grounds for accusing the president of criminal misconduct, he and the American people should know what they are. If there are no such grounds, the Justice Department should make it known that President Trump is not the subject of a criminal investigation.\n\n\n\t\u2014 Andrew C.

Just this week, President Donald Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0reviving\u00a0the idle Federal Interagency Reentry Council, bringing it into the White House and refocusing its work on rehabilitation and reintegration.\n\nWhile there are legislative remedies on the table in Congress, moving ahead with a reinvigorated Reentry Council could prove just as important and yield faster results.\n\nWhen created in 2011 by Attorney General Eric Holder, the\u00a0council included members from agencies that don\u2019t seem to have a direct stake in criminal-justice reform, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the new structure, membership will be open to more-relevant federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Prisons \u2014 a commonsense step to make the council more effective.\n\nBeyond personnel, emphasizing the importance of an inside-out approach to reentry that begins on Day 1 of a person\u2019s incarceration and includes approaches such as reentry planning and continuity of mentoring would go a long way toward enhancing the success of any program the administration devises.\n\nOther priorities should include more collaboration with the private sector and shining a spotlight on successful reforms already instituted by state, local, and tribal officials \u2014 and developing ways to emulate them at the federal level.\n\n\n\n\nWe know how to do these things, and we know they work.\n\nWe can get the formerly incarcerated into residential settings and similar programs earlier, subject to good behavior. We can expand access to quality education programs, drug treatment, therapy, and work programs that help prepare the 95 percent of inmates who will eventually be released to compete on the outside. And we can do more research to find out what works best and implement those best practices to ensure successful reintegration into society.\n\nWe can get the formerly incarcerated into residential settings and similar programs earlier, subject to good behavior. We can expand access to quality education programs, drug treatment, therapy, and work programs.\n\nSafe Streets and Second Chances is a new initiative that simultaneously addresses policy reforms and enhances reentry supports. The research is directed by Florida State University scholar Carrie Pettus-Davis\u00a0and the policy reforms are led by Koch Industries and the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\u00a0The first four pilot states are Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Florida, and Pettus-Davis will be using a randomized controlled trial of evidence-driven approaches to prepare people for release from prison and equip them with the appropriate skills for success after release to our communities.\u00a0The resulting data will enable improvement of a holistic, evidence-driven model of reentry services.\n\nSafe Streets and Second Chances hopes to be a resource and serve as a guidepost for the Reentry Council and for state officials seeking to improve their systems and, not incidentally, save their taxpayers a considerable sum of money.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to supporting a rejuvenated Reentry Council, President Donald Trump has lent rhetorical support to prison reform, both in his\u00a0State of the Union\u00a0address and in meeting with reform advocates. The administration is also putting its money where its mouth is, proposing $739 million for reentry programs in its 2019\u00a0budget\u00a0for the Bureau of Prisons, along with $48 million for the Second Chance Act Grant program. These programs fund education, job training, substance-abuse treatment, and other services.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties are invested in these reforms and are\u00a0co-sponsoring legislation\u00a0to push them forward. The White House is behind them. State officials have implemented some of them and found they work. Lives are at stake.

But his biggest asset hasn\u2019t been his iron grip on Russian politics, it\u2019s been the fecklessness and passivity of his Western counterparts in the face of his outrageous actions. Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion who has lived in exile in the West since 2013, wrote on Facebook that Putin, like most dictators, prefers playing poker to chess. \u201cYou can win at poker with a weak hand if your opponents play foolishly and keep folding their cards.\u201d\n\nIt was to plan a better series of future moves against Putin that Kasparov and Thor Halvorssen, the leaders of the Human Rights Foundation, assembled a collection of 30 anti-Putin experts in New York last Friday. Called PutinCon, the event featured everyone from former intelligence officials to a former Red Army veteran to former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara to Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption crusader who was blocked from the presidential ballot in Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Russia.\n\n\n\n\nAll of them agreed that the West should confront Putin and take serious measures to counter his increasingly brazen behavior. According to British foreign secretary Boris Johnson, this behavior now includes the stockpiling of the deadly nerve agent Novichok, recently used against Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy granted asylum in Britain, and his daughter Yulia.\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, an opponent of Putin\u2019s who is exiled and now lives in Switzerland, says that Russia has become a gangster-run state. Speaking of the attack on the Skripals, he told the BBC, \u201cEither Putin has given his consent to this operation, or he doesn\u2019t control the secret service to such an extent they can do it without his approval.\u201d The FSB, the successor to the Soviet Union\u2019s old KGB secret police, has seized complete control over Russia\u2019s security apparatus. The FSB is now more powerful than the KGB was at the time of Stalin \u2014 and much more independent from the Kremlin.\n\nAccording to Khodorkovsky a group of up to 100 people in Putin\u2019s orbit have \u201clearned to manipulate\u201d Putin \u201cquite effectively.\u201d He said the only way to hurt Putin and his gang is to \u201cundermine his reputation\u201d in the eyes of the Russian public and to focus efforts on attacking the overseas wealth of Putin cronies. In 2015, French economist Thomas Piketty and a group of his colleagues estimated total Russian wealth overseas at $800 billion.\n\nIan Birrell, writing for Britain\u2019s Mail on Sunday yesterday, noted the irony of Putin cronies trashing Western values but yet trusting the rule of law in their own country so little that they send billions of dollars abroad. \u201cThey stash their cash in our banks, buy our properties, fight legal battles in our courts and send their children to be educated in our schools.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nToomas Ilves, who served as president of Estonia from 2006 to 2016, told the PutinCon audience that he was personally sickened when he learned that the daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov graduated from his alma mater, Columbia University in New York City.\n\nIlves and Swedish economist Anders Aslund, who is now a scholar at Washington\u2019s Brookings Institution, says there are clear paths available to the West to attack Putin\u2019s cronies. They note that most Western nations don\u2019t permit anonymous investments that allow assets to be concealed. The two big exceptions are Britain and the United States.\n\nA month before he left office in June 2016, in the wake of the Brexit victory, British prime minister David Cameron organized an international conference to combat anonymous offshore ownership, including some 36,000 properties in London with a value of $156 billion. The rest of Britain has some 70,000 anonymously owned properties. \u201cThis is why you have all those properties in Belgravia standing empty,\u201d Aslund told the PutinCon audience. He estimates that Putin\u2019s inner circle exports some $40 billion to $50 billion in assets overseas every year.\n\nFollowing his 2016 conference, Cameron pushed eleven countries to increase their transparency, but he then suddenly resigned. His successor, Theresa May, hasn\u2019t followed through on the issue. In the wake of the nerve-agent attack on the Skripals, it\u2019s time for her to act: She should ban anonymous shell corporations from buying up property in Britain.\n\nThe United States could also do a lot more. In December 2016, the Wall Street Journal revealed that under the \u201cattorney-client privilege . . . tens of billions of dollars every year move through opaque law-firm bank accounts that create a gap in U.S. money-laundering defenses.\u201d\n\nFreezing the assets of Putin\u2019s oligarchs would send a message that the West is finally serious about confronting Russia\u2019s misbehavior.\n\n\nThis is where the Trump administration can prove its critics \u2014 who accuse it of being soft on the Russians \u2014 wrong. In August, Trump signed into law a bill calling for far-reaching investigations into \u201csenior foreign political figures and oligarchs in the Russian Federation\u201d \u2014 including \u201cspouses, children, parents, and siblings\u201d \u2014 and their assets in such popular real-estate markets as Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Palm Beach, New York, and Los Angeles. Stepping up those probes and actually freezing the assets of Putin\u2019s oligarchs would send a message that the West is finally serious about confronting Russia\u2019s misbehavior.\n\nThe incredible flow of assets out of Russia into Western safe havens is a clear vulnerability in Putin\u2019s authoritarian system. At a minimum, the West should prohibit law firms from acting as banks and also prohibit real-estate entities from effectively acting as banks for the oligarchs. Anonymous purchasers should no longer be able to hide their activities. It is only through moves like this that the West will get the attention of Putin and his cronies.

For starters, despite a near-unanimous tone of media coverage praising the old Assault Weapons Ban and pointing to it as the solution to mass shootings, a new\u00a0Washington Post/ABC News poll\u00a0finds Americans are about evenly split on the idea.\n\nSpecifically, the poll finds \u201c50\u00a0percent in support and 46\u00a0percent opposed, a stark contrast from the 80\u00a0percent support for the ban in 1994, the year it was enacted. The current level of support is little different from 51\u00a0percent in 2016.\u201d\nFor those who believe that there\u2019d be widespread rejoicing if the federal government tried to ban the most popular rifle in America, these numbers should serve as a timely dose of cold water. They come, remember,\u00a0in the immediate aftermath of a terrible attack. In 1994, 80 percent of Americans wanted to ban certain rifles absent any recent abominations. Today, after an unusual number of heinous events, only half do. Given that the right to bear arms is explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, these numbers simply won\u2019t cut it. Consider, by way of comparison, that seven out of ten Americans think abortion should be illegal in the second trimester, and yet it remains legal almost everywhere.\nThe outlook looks similarly grim for those who think they can just \u201cwait it out\u201d until those recalcitrant older voters die off. Per CNN, poll after poll reveals that younger voters are not in fact more pro-gun control than are older voters:\nWhile any one survey result for a subsample that is as small as those under the age of 35 could be an outlier, the average of nine surveys tells us a lot. In the average survey, 50% of Americans said they were for stricter gun control. The same nine polls found on average that 49% of Americans under the age of 35 were for stricter gun control. In other words, the difference was statistically insignificant.\nI also checked to see if more recent surveys during this five-year period suggested any sort of uptick in support for stricter gun control among younger adults. There wasn\u2019t. The last four surveys conducted by CNN discovered that 50% of those under 35 were for stricter gun control. That\u2019s identical to the 50% of all Americans who said they were for gun control in the same surveys.\nOver the last few decades, Americans have become far less interested in gun control. That, not \u201cthe NRA,\u201d is why we don\u2019t see the change that advocates covet.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "The White House immigration outline was released today and it\u2019s not good. It could change tomorrow, for all we know, but as it stands now, this is a preemptive surrender on several issues.\n\n\n\tThe enforcement component is fine, as far as it goes \u2013 there\u2019s no E-Verify, but the White House decided months ago not to push that, thinking it would be a bridge too far for Democrats, since it impacts illegals who are already here.\n\n\n\tBut the amnesty and chain migration components are fatally flawed. The fact that the amnesty would include a path to citizenship (i.e., the beneficiaries would eventually get green cards like regular immigrants) is fine with me \u2013 if you\u2019re going to amnesty illegal aliens, just rip off the band-aid and get it over with.\n\n\n\tInstead, the issue is the size of the amnesty, or rather the universe of people who would be amnestied. If \u2013 as the White House promised just days ago \u2013 the amnesty were confined to those who now actually have DACA work permits (or even those who had them but didn\u2019t renew), administering the amnesty would be relatively straightforward. All those people are already in the DHS database, and even if they were all re-examined as part of the amnesty process (to weed out the fraudsters that snuck past Obama\u2019s eagle-eyed DHS), it could still be done relatively quickly and with minimal disruption of the work of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the DHS component that deals with green cards, work permits, and the like.\n\n\n\tBut going beyond DACA beneficiaries to those who could have applied but didn\u2019t is a different thing. It\u2019s not just a difference in degree, but in kind. A whole new process will have to be set up for the 1 million additional people who would be expected to apply. The other work of USCIS would grind to a halt, delaying other legal immigration applications, as happened when DACA was originally implemented (and remember that Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty was smaller than what Trump is proposing). In addition, there would be an opportunity cost, with USCIS unable to pursue many urgently needed administrative reforms.\n\n\n\tWhat\u2019s more, expanding the amnesty beyond DACA beneficiaries is morally dubious. The reason they have a compelling case for amnesty before all enforcement measures and in place and legal immigration curbed is that not only did they arrive here as minors but they voluntarily came forward and provided their information to the government. Those who chose not to do so should not be granted the same extraordinary act of mercy.\n\n\n\tThen there\u2019s the legal immigration \u201ccuts.\u201d The outline says that no new applications for the visa lottery and the chain-migration categories would be accepted, limiting family immigration to spouses and minor children. Great! But it also provides for the continuation of those categories (and reallocation of the lottery visas) until the admission of all 4 million people on the current chain-migration waiting lists. This is the same gimmick that was in the Hagel-Martinez amnesty bill in 2007 \u2013 and the estimate at the time was that it would take 17 years before all those people got their green cards. In other words, legal immigration would not actually be reduced until after President Kamala Harris\u2019s successor took office.\n\n\n\tThe Cotton and Goodlatte bills both grandfather people on the waiting list who were within one year of getting their green card applications adjudicated, and refund the application fees for everyone else. This is a reasonable measure, since as the date gets closer, people might be selling property and whatnot as part of their relocation planning.\n\n\n\tBut to wait almost two decades before there\u2019s any reduction in legal admissions is absurd. First of all, if we\u2019re going to amnesty close to 2 million illegal aliens (and maybe more, since past estimates have proven so woefully wrong), that needs to be offset by immediate reductions elsewhere. What\u2019s more this would be yet another example of the other side getting what it wants up front, with promises of things we want in the future. As Popeye\u2019s friend J. Wellington Wimpy might have said, \u201cI will gladly reduce immigration on Tuesday for an amnesty today.\u201d\n\n\n\tThe White House has botched the DACA issue, cutting Bob Goodlatte\u2019s House bill off at the knees and making it more likely that either there will be no bill at all or that any final bill the president signs (which is guaranteed to be even weaker than this) will fatally demoralize Republican voters in November.

That was what Congressman K. Michael Conaway (R., Texas) announced yesterday evening, in the course of explaining that the committee has ended the investigative phase of its probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Republican-controlled committee also found, Conaway added, that \u201cthe Russians did commit active measures\u201d against the U.S. election and would continue attempting to do so in the future. But the committee majority rejects \u201cthe narrative that they were trying to help Trump.\u201d\n\n\nThe conclusion of the investigative phase means the committee has ceased interviewing witnesses and will now finalize its written report, currently said to be a 150-page draft. The final report, Conaway said, would address the four topics on which the committee\u2019s investigation focused: Russian meddling in the election, the U.S. government\u2019s response to that meddling, links between the Putin regime and both major-party campaigns, and leaks of classified information.\n\nRepresentative Conaway has taken the lead in this aspect of the committee\u2019s work since last April, when Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) stepped aside. Democrats had accused Nunes of leaking classified information. Nunes, who has since been cleared by the House Ethics Committee, had announced at a news conference that the Obama administration had collected intelligence on associates of Donald Trump (and perhaps Trump himself) during the transition following the 2016 election.\n\n\n\n\nThe Intelligence Committee is deeply divided along partisan lines. It took the ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, little time to rip the decision to end the investigation. By what he described as \u201cending its oversight role,\u201d Schiff said, the committee\u2019s Republicans had elevated \u201cthe interests of protecting the president over protecting the country.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the president pounced on the announcement. Monday night produced an all-caps tweet:\n\n\nTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018\n\n\nThis reaction, naturally, will amp up the Democrats\u2019 storyline that committee Republicans have been colluding with the White House from the start. Nevertheless, Schiff\u2019s clamor to continue the investigation is at least as driven by partisanship as the GOP decision to close it.\n\nThe House probe has run parallel to the investigation conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s mini-empire of 17 lawyers and scores of federal agents. The Mueller probe has ensued for ten months, after taking over a counterintelligence investigation that had already been ongoing for over a year. (It was in September 2015 that the FBI first advised the Democratic National Committee that its computer network may have been hacked.)\n\nNote that a congressional committee has at its disposal considerably less investigative authority and resources than do prosecutors. Yet, despite charging four men who were both associated with the Trump campaign and in contact with Kremlin-tied operatives, Mueller has not alleged any criminal conspiracy between the Trump associates and the Putin regime.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos have pled guilty to lying to investigators. Richard Gates has pled guilty to lying to investigators and to a minor conspiracy charge involving his lobbying work on behalf of a Kremlin-backed Ukrainian political party, mostly between 2004 and 2014. And Paul Manafort, who was indicted with his partner, Gates, on these charges unrelated to the 2016 campaign, is awaiting trial later this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Mueller has also filed an indictment against 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies for conducting influence operations, primarily through social media, directed at the 2016 election and its aftermath. Those operations, which appear remote from the original hacking allegations that spurred the counterintelligence investigation, were but a drop in the ocean of campaign messaging. Moreover, some of Russia\u2019s shenanigans predated Trump\u2019s entry into the race, and some were directed against Trump. To the extent there were supportive entreaties toward the Trump campaign, these are alleged to have been unsolicited, not conspiratorial.\n\nThese results of Mueller\u2019s probe have obviously informed the committee majority\u2019s conclusion that Putin\u2019s support for Trump is more the stuff of Democratic political narrative than reality. For what it\u2019s worth, I drew a similar inference when Mueller indicted the Russian nationals:\n\nThe Kremlin hoped to sow discord in our society and thus paralyze our government\u2019s capacity to pursue American interests. The Russian strategy was to stir up the resentments of sizable losing factions. It is not that Putin wanted Trump to win; it is that Putin figured Trump was going to lose. That is why the Kremlin tried to galvanize Trump supporters against Clinton, just as it tried to galvanize Sanders supporters against Clinton, and Trump supporters against Cruz and Rubio, during the primaries. It is why the Russians suddenly choreographed anti-Trump rallies after Trump won. The palpable goal was to promote dysfunction: Cripple a likely President Clinton before she could even get started, wound President Trump from the get-go when he unexpectedly won, and otherwise set American against American whenever possible.\n\nOf course, the Mueller investigation is continuing and we are privy to neither its inner workings nor the non-public information it has assembled. By all outward appearances, however, the special counsel lacks evidence of actionable collusion with Russia. As I have stressed, if he had such a case, he would have induced his cooperating defendants to plead guilty to a conspiracy, explain the criminal nature of any collusion, and implicate other conspirators. He would not have taken false-statements pleas, which indicate only some obstruction of the investigative process and serve only to brand accomplice witnesses as liars \u2014 which is not the way to build a prosecution.\n\nThere is no shame in not filing such conspiracy charges.\n\n\nThere is no shame in not filing such conspiracy charges. The prosecutor\u2019s task is to find out what happened and justly account for it, not to make a case where there isn\u2019t one. The salient point, though, is that if Mueller has not found actionable collusion, notwithstanding his formidable resources and zeal, there is no way the House Intelligence Committee is going to find it.\n\nRelatedly, while the committee composes its final report on the so-called Russia-gate aspect of the 2016 election, its probe of the investigative tactics employed by the FBI and the Justice Department \u2014 the \u201cFISA-gate\u201d aspect \u2014 will continue.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Douglas Murray", "body": "Jeremy Corbyn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Andrew  man who would be prime minister goes out of his way to avoid blaming Russia for the nerve-agent attack on the  is the perfect location for a very English type of murder. But what happened on the fourth of this month in the cathedral city was far from a bloodless Agatha Christie crime. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the center of the city has landed them in the hospital, where they remain critically ill. Also hospitalized was a police detective who was one of the first officials to enter the Skripal home after the attack. The discovery that the nerve agent Novichok was used in the assassination attempt has also led dozens of residents of Salisbury, including people who dined in the same restaurant as the Skripals, to face the possibility that they too have come into contact with the nerve agent.\n\nThe release of such a deadly nerve agent in a crowded city has done many things, not the least of which is to throw a clear line into the middle of Great Britain\u2019s political and public life. Prime Minister Theresa May and her government swiftly concluded (at the advice of the intelligence agencies) that the only possible culprits could be the Russians. But the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, was never going to give up a life of allegiances that easily. Both Corbyn and his closest adviser and spokesman, Seumas Milne, are the sort of leftists who do not so much hate modern Russia as feel let down by it \u2014 failing, as it did, to hold together in its glorious USSR form.\n\n\n\n\nSince becoming leader of his party, Corbyn has done a great deal to try to recast himself as ready for his potential incarnation as prime minister. Corbyn and his camp present his years of chumming up to IRA terrorists as \u201cpeace-making.\u201d He is pals with every available anti-Semite at home and in the Middle East \u2014 but this is only evidence of yet more \u201cpeace-making.\u201d As for his unyielding fealty to every Marxist despot from Castro to Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 it\u2019s just part of his endless search for equality and fairness for all.\n\nOf course the hard beliefs that actually lurk beneath such bromides occasionally become apparent. In recent days they have risen to the surface.\n\nThe first instinct of Corbyn when Her Majesty\u2019s Government fingered Russia as the culprit was to call for evidence. No bad thing in itself, but one gets the sense that, for Corbyn, the evidence might never be quite enough to justify his reaching a conclusion he would gladly put off until at least such a date as people stop asking. And then there was the politicking. Americans are no strangers to the use of the Russians as a means to pursue domestic political goals. But even American politicians would probably not stoop so low as to make use of a nerve-agent attack in an American city to score partisan points.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s second instinct \u2014 after providing smoke for Russia \u2014 was to attack the Conservative party for allegedly having taken money from dodgy Russians. Party funding is almost as much of a mess in the U.K. as it is in the U.S. (the one advantage being that the sums in Britain are infinitely smaller). But political parties are not allowed to take money from people who are not British citizens. Corbyn issued blanket attacks on the Conservatives for taking money from U.K. citizens who were born in Russia: We should deem this a slimy generalization, just as we would if \u2014 whenever problems erupted from the Indian subcontinent \u2014 the Conservatives attacked Corbyn for taking donations from British citizens who happened to be from Pakistan.\n\nBut the most fascinating aspect of the hill that Corbyn showed himself willing to die on (and polls suggested that if not dying, he is certainly suffering for his stance) is one that came from a lobby briefing. Last week, as Corbyn was taking flak for his stance, Seumas Milne was quoted telling journalists:\n\nI think obviously the government has access to information and intelligence on this matter which others don\u2019t; however, also there\u2019s a history in relation to WMD and intelligence, which is problematic to put it mildly.\n\nPast intelligence failures will obviously keep coming back to haunt intelligence services and governments in Britain and America for years to come. But it was the norm, until recently, for people in public life \u2014 especially those aspiring to public office \u2014 to at least view the intelligence services as being on their side. Principally because they were seen to be on the side of the national interest.\n\n\nIt was the norm, until recently, for people in public life \u2014 especially those aspiring to public office \u2014 to at least view the intelligence services as being on their side.\n\nIn Jeremy Corbyn and his spokesman, we have a different type of figure: people who view their country\u2019s intelligence services as though they are enemies. The fact that the same people have a tendency to view any and all of the nation\u2019s enemies as friends may be entirely coincidental. Or it may not. Either way it is a reminder of how dangerous it is that people who should be sitting in their family basement wearing tin hats are only a few government slip-ups away from controlling the state they have always   Murray is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kyle Smith", "body": "Marjory Stoneman Douglas student Cameron Kasky (left) asks Senator Marco Rubio if he will continue to accept money from the NRA during a CNN town hall meeting in Sunrise, Florida, February 21, 2018.  (Michael   journalists are using the student activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a mouthpiece for their gun-control message.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn the aftermath of the Parkland massacre, student activists achieved remarkable levels of fame almost instantaneously: Emma Gonz\u00e1lez already has nearly 1 million Twitter followers, for instance, and her fellow student David Hogg has more than 300,000. Both have become familiar faces on television.\n\nLike all Americans, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School kids have every right to express their ideas. But they aren\u2019t being given so much airtime by the media because they\u2019re policy experts. Hogg revealed in an appearance on MSNBC Monday morning that he didn\u2019t even know how the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, got his job. He described Israel as an appointee of Florida governor Rick Scott: \u201cThese elected officials,\u201d he said, \u201care the boss of these sheriff personnel and just like the president is the boss of the FBI, Governor Rick Scott is essentially the boss of Scott Israel, the sheriff, and as such he should be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFactually, Hogg\u2019s argument was just plain wrong: Israel is not an appointee of the governor; he was directly elected by the voters of Broward County. As a matter of logic, it failed too: Shouldn\u2019t accountability fall first on those closest to the scene \u2014 such as the cops who were actually present during the shooting \u2014 only to attenuate rather than grow stronger as it gets farther up the chain of command? Absolving those in an immediate position to stop the attack while attacking those farthest from the shooting looks like rank partisanship. (Israel is a Democrat who speaks out against the NRA, while Scott is a Republican who has largely agreed with it.)\n\nMSNBC, CNN, and other media outlets didn\u2019t see the pitfall that comes with making public spokesmen out of random citizens who happen to be present at a newsworthy event: Non-professionals may make elementary errors that undermine their authority. There\u2019s a reason ordinary folks, especially children, are not normally invited on TV to discuss complicated legal and political matters. Moreover, as the media learned to their chagrin with their elevation of Cindy Sheehan to national-celebrity status, once given a megaphone, citizens might start to stray off message and embarrass their boosters. Hogg on Saturday called for a spring-break boycott of Florida, which doesn\u2019t sound like an idea he thought through.\n\nThe reason television has made stars out of Hogg and Gonz\u00e1lez is obvious: They are telegenic, sympathetic vehicles for a message media personalities wish they could get away with openly espousing themselves. (\u201cI get so angry talking to these gun nuts,\u201d Piers Morgan said in a revealing moment on British morning television today.) Just as an op-ed editor at a newspaper can showcase his opinions without his name ever appearing in print by his selection of which articles to publish, the TV media keep giving airtime to students like Hogg because they\u2019re saying all of the things the media\u2019s nominally neutral hosts believe but don\u2019t otherwise feel comfortable saying. Katy Tur, George Stephanopoulos, and Wolf Blitzer can\u2019t passionately lecture the audience about why they think gun policy is crazy in this country, so they put the students on camera to say it. They\u2019re simply laundering their opinions through these kids.\n\nAs they deploy these students to advance their own interests, the media are overestimating their own importance \u2014 and their own attention span.\n\nYou may find something dismaying about grieving students being exploited for the purpose of advancing a media crusade. Or you might call the Parkland students inheritors of a grand tradition of Americans who use their personal experience to push for social change. But as they deploy these students to advance their own interests, the media are overestimating their own importance \u2014 and their own attention span. They are convincing themselves that their relentless effort to push American opinion to the left on guns is succeeding, but all that the polls are really measuring right now is the amount of media interest in the gun issue. Previous polling suggests that any surge in support for more gun control will be short-lived. Enthusiasm for more gun laws spiked in the days after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, but within two years support for gun rights reached an all-time high: \u201cAs the media has lost interest in gun issues, public opinion has reverted to its previous trend,\u201d which was gradually increasing support for gun rights, reported FiveThirtyEight.com.\n\nI should clarify my position on the gun debate: I don\u2019t care. Ban assault weapons? I don\u2019t care. Ban large-capacity magazines? I don\u2019t care. Raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms to 21, or even 25? I don\u2019t care. Would any of these policy changes make a difference, though? I doubt it. Even if all semi-automatic long guns were to be banned, I think mass shooters would simply switch to pistols. You can kill a lot of people with one pistol and a satchel full of ten-round magazines. And pistols are much easier to conceal than long guns.\n\nMy guess is that gun-control advocates such as the ones who run virtually every mainstream news organization would grudgingly agree that policy-tinkering such as the kind proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein (no more sales of rifles with pistol grips, folding stocks, etc., but also no effort to take out of circulation the millions of such weapons already on the streets) wouldn\u2019t make America a safer place. So why do they work themselves into such a febrile state about the minutiae of what will constitute a legal rifle going forward? Why are they suddenly so eager to punish Amazon and Roku for hosting the streaming channel NRATV, which nobody had heard of until the New York Times discovered it in a whip-up-some-hysteria piece on February 21? The Times offered no evidence that the NRA\u2019s channel, one of some 1,800 available on Roku, has much of a viewership.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy proposals aren\u2019t the real aim of the anti-gun crowd. What they\u2019re thinking is: We must strike a blow against gun culture. We must punish gun owners in general by doing something that annoys them. This is the Democratic obverse of Trumpian bully culture: It\u2019s public policy reduced to public shaming. It\u2019s insult theater. The politics of id. Is America really going to be made safer by shaming the First National Bank of Omaha into no longer issuing an NRA-branded Visa card? How is forcing through an increase of from 2 to 10 percent on the price NRA members pay for a United or Delta flight to the group\u2019s annual convention supposed to decrease gun deaths?\n\nThese petty slights are all meant to redefine the NRA as outside the mainstream, activists say on Twitter. It seems more likely that NRA members, and gun owners in general, are going to perceive a concerted attack on gun culture and vote accordingly. Progressives don\u2019t have a plan for stopping mass shootings. So they\u2019re falling back on venting at gun owners, and they\u2019re using the children of Parkland to do it.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Theodore Kupfer", "body": "House Speaker Paul Ryan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Aaron P.  should, but lawmakers are more likely to wring their hands and whine.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf Donald Trump\u2019s public statements can be trusted, then the world is quickly approaching a trade war. Last Thursday, the president announced his intention to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, later adding that he\u2019d make no exceptions for the exports of even our closest allies. This means that Canada will be hit with the same penalty as, say, China (though the White House has since floated using the tariffs as a bargaining chip in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement). In response, some of those allies threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods: of course metal, but also, said Jean-Claude Juncker of the EU, Levi\u2019s jeans, bourbon, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Fine, Trump said on Twitter, you can tax our bikes; we\u2019ll simply tax your cars.\n\nAdd to the mix Trump\u2019s insight that trade wars can be \u201cgood and easy to win,\u201d and the tit-for-tat, beggar-thy-neighbor model is riding high. So far, it is just a rhetorical war. Most observers agree that there is some distance between what Trump believes, what he says, and what he ultimately does. But the dueling announcements are a plausible dry run for the real thing. What starts with steel moves to motorcycles; Kentucky bourbon finds itself priced out of Europe while in America, steel producers raise their prices, companies that use steel lay off their employees, and consumers pay double for a can of beer.\n\n\nWhile many of Trump\u2019s policy statements wander in search of a consistent position, his position on protectionism is one of the few he has held steadily over the years. With free-trader Gary Cohn resigning from the White House, Trump seems likely to seek counsel from protectionists such as Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, which makes protectionist action all the more likely. If Trump does what he says, retaliations from around the world will beget more retaliation until an outside force stops the self-destructive cycle.\n\nCould that force be Congress? More properly put, shouldn\u2019t it be? Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\u201d As Jay Cost chronicles on the homepage, the legislative branch first used that power as little more than a tool to dispense favors to favored regions of the country before ceding it to the executive over the years. That abdication persists, he notes, \u201ceven in instances (such as this aluminum-and-steel case) where there is no compelling or immediate foreign-policy mandate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed tariff is dubiously justified on national-security grounds for the purposes of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act and the stipulations of the World Trade Organization. But it is a naked protectionist grab, a cynical ploy for support from steel magnates and their union employees. It\u2019s a move that Congress could stop him from making.\n\nPlenty of high-ranking congressional Republicans oppose the measure. Protectionism is one of Trump\u2019s issues that haven\u2019t exerted much pull on the rest of the party (though it has prompted a rethink of trade policy in certain intellectual circles). Statements from concerned representatives and senators abound: Paul Ryan, whose home state builds Harleys, issued a stern one Monday, while various committee chairmen have insisted on the need for \u201ctargeted\u201d action against offenders \u2014 a clear shot at Trump\u2019s \u201cMake Metal More Expensive\u201d policy, which targets Mexico, Canada, Germany, and China alike. Kevin Brady and Orrin Hatch, who lead the committees with jurisdiction over trade in the House and Senate, are avid free-traders. Behind the scenes, reports Politico, congressional Republicans are both \u201cfrantically lobbying Trump to reconsider\u201d his move and \u201ceven considering legislative action to try to stop him if he refuses.\u201d\n\nCongress could reassert its constitutional authority to impose tariffs, say Colin Grabow, a trade-policy scholar at the Cato Institute, and Clark Packard, a trade-policy scholar at the R Street Institute, by passing a bill introduced by senator Mike Lee (R., Utah). Lee\u2019s bill, the Global Trade Accountability Act, would require congressional approval in the form of an up-or-down vote on all significant tariffs. That bill is \u201cthe intellectual North Star of a lot of trade wonks,\u201d Packard tells National Review.\n\nWill congressional cowardice determine our course? Or will the GOP stick to the free-trade position that it has supported for decades?\n\nThe question, however, is whether Congress will follow Polaris\u2019s direction if the president has charted another path. Will congressional cowardice determine our course? Or will the GOP stick to the free-trade position that it has supported for decades?\n\nThis Congress has an instinct to run for the tall grass when the voting gets tough \u2014 witness the lack of action on health care in 2017, or the party\u2019s nonexistent agenda for 2018. Such inaction has political consequences: In a country where the president is legislator in chief, and with that president not afraid to sic his voters on uncooperative congressmen of his own party, opposing a policy the president supports seems politically suicidal (or at least inconvenient). Against that backdrop it is difficult to imagine Republicans standing openly against Trump, let alone working with Democrats to secure a veto-proof majority for a bill that limits presidential power.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other options besides an open legislative revolt. Packard suggests a more limited version of the Lee bill that, rather than rewriting all trade-remedies laws, would require congressional approval only for tariffs that are justified on national-security grounds under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Even if Trump imposes the tariff, Congress could pass a continuing resolution that declined to fund the collection of such duties.\n\nThat would require a Congress committed to its principles, ready to play its constitutional role, and willing to take meaningful steps to curtail presidential power. Which is to say it\u2019s a fanciful idea. As Yuval Levin has written, the current \u201cweakness of Congress is a result of dereliction and of a growing confusion about the role of the institution.\u201d Congress may yet pursue legislative solutions to rein in Trump, but it seems likelier that they\u2019ll fulminate, wring their hands, and try to convince the president to recant his earlier statements.

Instead, think of them as dye markers of how our cultural politics and the nature of the two parties have changed over time.\n\nIn the 1990s, it was common for Democrats to fret over both illegal and legal immigration. \u201cAll Americans,\u201d President Clinton said in his 1995 State of the Union address, \u201care rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Jordan, the civil rights icon and onetime Democratic congresswoman, headed a commission which concluded that legal immigration rates should be modestly cut.\n\nMeanwhile, countless Republicans championed immigration. \u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a single problem that would be solved by shutting off the supply of willing and eager new Americans,\u201d then-House majority leader Dick Armey said in 1995. \u201cIf anything . . . we should be thinking about increasing legal immigration.\u201d\n\nAfter a 1995 meeting with the National Restaurant Association, newly elected House speaker Newt Gingrich said, \u201cI think we would be a very, very self-destructive country if we sent negative signals on legal immigration.\u201d\n\nBack then, boosting legal immigration was seen by many on the left as a sop to big business. The ruling industrial class allegedly wanted a reserve army of cheap labor. As recently as 2015, avowed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders sounded downright Bannonesque in telling Vox that \u201copen borders\u201d was a \u201cKoch brothers proposal . . . a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States.\u201d\n\nSanders is an intriguing example of how political and cultural currents swirl around us. He won his first bid for Congress in 1990 in part because he received the full-throated endorsement of the National Rifle Association. Sanders, the former mayor of Burlington, Vt., was noncommittal on an assault-weapons ban while his GOP opponent, Peter Smith, flip-flopped and came out in favor of a ban.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Peter Smith vs. Bernie Sanders,\u201d the NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre explained. \u201cIt is about integrity in politics.\u201d\n\nThis history was just one reason why it was amusing to listen to LaPierre at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week railing against the \u201csocialists\u201d determined to grab everyone\u2019s guns. The man who helped launch the most prominent American socialist since Norman Thomas suddenly thinks socialism is an existential threat to liberty.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nOn the immigration front: Democrats are increasingly invested in permissive policies in large part because they\u2019ve bought into the theory that diverse populations are their key to electoral victories going forward. In dialectic fashion, Republicans are increasingly invested in restrictive policies in large part because they\u2019re chasing after ever-larger segments of the white vote.\n\nAs for firearms: Democrats passed an assault-weapons ban in September 1994. Even Bill Clinton credited that decision as one of the chief reasons the GOP took back the House two months later.\n\nTrue or not, the more important consequence was that gun rights increasingly became a partisan issue, and the NRA had little choice but to become an adjunct of the GOP. The dynamic became centrifugal, with Democrats and Republicans becoming ever more defined by the issue.\n\nAll of these changes were driven by facts on the ground. To listen to Democrats, Republicans support gun rights because the NRA tells them to. In reality, Republicans support gun rights because their voters tell them to, just as Democratic voters tell their representatives the opposite.\n\nBut guns and immigration are not simply drivers of polarization, they are examples of its power. Politics has become a lifestyle, part of the \u201cBig Sort\u201d driving so much in our culture. That\u2019s why the NRA\u2019s marketing these days has so little to do with gun policy and so much to do with smash-mouth cultural resentments.\n\n\nThese days, if you\u2019re a Democrat, you\u2019re likely to be a down-the-line Democrat on a host of unrelated issues. Same if you\u2019re a Republican. Like our representatives, many of us won\u2019t buck party orthodoxy on any matter of importance.\n\nLiberals such as Sanders have talked about \u201ctwo Americas\u201d for generations, but they worked on the assumption that this divide was class-based.

Most states have laws prohibiting voters from\u00a0campaigning\u00a0in or around the polls, and the Court recognized\u00a0in\u00a0a 1992 case,\u00a0Burson\u00a0v.

United States (1997) and New York v. United States (1992), the Supreme Court has ruled that the Tenth Amendment forbids federal \u2018commandeering\u2019 of state governments to help enforce federal law. Most of the support for this anti-commandeering principle came from conservative justices such as the late Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in Printz.\u201d\n\nPrintz correctly bars federal conscription of state and local officials and Washington\u2019s commandeering of their resources. Nobody wants ICE agents to dragoon local cops into joining immigration raids, against their wishes and those of their commanders and civilian overseers. Nor should ICE abandon its own vehicles and seize, say, NYPD squad cars in order to corral MS-13 killers.\n\nInstead, ICE officers want city and state governments to alert them before releasing alien criminals, so they can be taken into federal custody, for adjudication, punishment, or deportation. But California law SB 54 prohibits such communications with ICE, even among local or county authorities (and even private employers) who want to help federal officials remove criminal aliens from their communities and workplaces.\n\n\u201cRather than allow ICE officers to do their jobs at the jailhouse, they [\u2018lawless open-borders radicals\u2019] force these officers to conduct far more dangerous arrests elsewhere \u2014 where violent criminals may reside and where children can be caught in the crossfire,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Wednesday morning in Sacramento as he unveiled an anti-fugitive-state lawsuit against California.\n\nAlso, while Washington, D.C., should tolerate mayors and governors who prefer not to assist ICE, it correctly should expect that they will not scream, \u201cICE is coming. Head for the hills!\u201d in advance of federal crime-fighting  Printz, \u201cThe real issue is that these mayors and governors are violating federal law themselves by obstructing justice and aiding and abetting people to remain in this country illegally,\u201d says Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor and author of Licensed to Lie: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice. \u201cThe feds are not asking these local and state officials to do the feds\u2019 jobs, just to do their own and not violate federal law.\u201d\n\nAs Heritage Foundation legal analyst Hans von Spakovsky observes, \u201c8 U.S. Code \u00a71373 prohibits states and local jurisdictions from preventing their law enforcement officials from exchanging information with federal officials on the citizenship status of individuals they have arrested or detained.\u201d\n\n\nVon Spakovsky adds:\n\nSanctuary cities are trying to prevent federal officials from finding out about criminal alien murderers, rapists, and other violent criminals that these cities would apparently rather release than have picked up and deported so they cannot further victimize Americans. Section 1373 doesn\u2019t force local law enforcement officials to notify federal officials when they detain an illegal alien; it simply says that local governments can\u2019t ban law enforcement officials from doing so.\n\n\u201cCongress can require state, local, or university police to tell federal agents when they arrest an immigrant present in the country illegally,\u201d Washington-based constitutional lawyers David Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley argued in the Los Angeles Times. \u201cSanctuary policies create Balkanization on an issue with important foreign policy implications and corresponding potential for diplomatic embarrassment,\u201d they added. \u201cAs the Supreme Court affirmed in Arizona v. United States (2012), \u2018the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government\u2019 because it \u2018touch[es] on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump, his administration, and his supporters should explain and popularize the expression \u201cfugitive cities.\u201d They carefully should measure the human toll of this outrageous phenomenon. And, once armed with these data, they should give the local, county, and state officials who facilitate this mayhem the option to stand down.

I tend to be more sympathetic to the populist and nationalist impulses than some other conservatives. But I also recognize that, over the long term, every political movement is destined to end in failure and disillusionment. The open question is whether populism has any success and does any good before that inevitable reckoning. And then, if it has success, whether it gets to indulge its worst impulses and do damage on the way down.\n\nIn the meantime, however, there are a few ways liberals and technocrats can handle the populist challenge. It\u2019s worth exploring them in broad terms.\n\n\nPassive resistance: Wait for populism to fall on its face.\n\nYou may not wait long. Because technocratic liberalism did such a thorough job progressively stigmatizing populist ideas as low-status, marginal, and cretinous, the ranks of populist political movements are overstuffed with marginal, low-status cretins. Even if the voters empower them in protest of, say, a Hillary Clinton, surely the charlatans and jerks in the populist movement will immediately reveal their rank incompetence and be swiftly removed from office.\n\n\n\n\nTo change the metaphors, it\u2019s altogether possible that a little bit of populism will have the effect of inoculating the whole system. Perhaps the Trump years will be so obviously a disaster that no one will want to try anything like it again.\n\nTriangulation: Take the criticism to heart and take some of populists\u2019 issues on board.\n\nThis is the strategy of adjusting liberalism in order to save it. You can compromise with populism to a degree, in the name of preserving democracy. Perhaps you find trade barriers economically inefficient, but you can at least accept them as being the result of the democratic process. Perhaps you can enthusiastically accept the populist demand for Britain to regain its political sovereignty, and by doing so guide it to maintain the closest possible trading relations with Europe. Perhaps you can protect your broadly tolerant society, and maintain the racial and religious diversity your policies have created, by slowing down the rate of future immigration and strengthening a core national culture until it has assimilative power.\n\nBrinksmanship: Assimilate the worst features of populism in order to defeat it.\n\nFinally, you could determine that the stakes are existential and dig in for a ferocious battle. If you believe that populism and nationalism will, if unimpeded, vitiate your democracy, destroy your freedom to express your views, fill your society with an irrational fear of foreigners, and make your country an authoritarian nightmare, you could . . . opt to do all those nasty things on behalf of liberalism. Don\u2019t like the democratic verdict? Ignore it. Or delegitimize it as the product of nefarious Russian interference. Think the populists are leveraging digital platforms to advance their agenda? Make legal-sounding threats until Silicon Valley transforms itself into the de facto speech police and ministry of propaganda for the liberal order. Encourage your most unstable people in utter hysteria and accept that a few of them may try to shoot congressman or assault people in the streets on behalf of the liberal world order. Make memes celebrating them.\n\n\n\n\nThere are risks to each of these strategies and each is not always applicable. Some say Brexit is falling on its face. But that cause is now led by Theresa May, a prime minister who campaigned for remaining in the European Union, and the difficulties she has run into can be attributed to her half-heartedness or her willingness to compromise with figures such as Philip Hammond, her chancellor of the Exchequer. May certainly isn\u2019t the leader the Brexiteers would have chosen. You could put your faith in the boorish incompetence of populists and yet still see them preside over periods of economic growth and increased popularity. That\u2019s been the result in Poland so far.\n\nI always like to bet on human fallibility, so I think the strategy I take to be the wisest in this instance \u2014 democratic triangulation \u2014 will be left mostly untried. Emmanuel Macron seems to be the only leader even sniffing in this direction.\n\nYou could put your faith in the boorish incompetence of populists and yet still see them preside over periods of economic growth and increased popularity.\n\n\nAmerican society has lately taken to believing that you can only prove you are authentic to yourself and the world by indulging your worst impulses. And so it\u2019s hard not to conclude that we\u2019re headed for the worst of all worlds. Populist incompetence will exacerbate technocratic brinksmanship: The entitled and lawless liberals versus the ungovernable and unqualified democrats.\n\nIf you read a long, colorful, and accurate description of Western societies as you\u2019ve known them over the last three decades, would you conclude that we deserved a better fate?", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew C.

I offer a variety of reasons why the response principally proffered by the committee\u2019s ranking member, Representative Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), fails to defend the issuance of FISA court surveillance warrants against an American citizen tied to the Trump campaign, Carter Page, in a counterintelligence investigation seeking to probe suspected ties between Donald Trump and Russia. The warrant was issued based on uncorroborated hearsay allegations from unknown sources, compiled in the so-called Steele dossier. The FBI and Justice Department failed to disclose that these allegations were generated by an opposition-research project commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs I argue in the column, the Schiff memo leaves no doubt that the key allegation supporting issuance of the warrant is the Steele dossier\u2019s claim that, while on a well-publicized trip to Moscow in July 2016, Page met with two top Putin regime operatives, Igor Sechin and Igor Divyekin. Page credibly denies the meetings; former British spy Christoper Steele\u2019s claim that they happened is based on unidentified hearsay sources that he concedes he never confirmed; and all indications are that the FBI never corroborated them. In congressional testimony, Former FBI director James Comey described the dossier\u2019s allegations about Donald Trump as \u201csalacious and unverified.\u201d Furthermore, according to a memo published by two senior Senate Judiciary Committee members \u2014 Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) \u2014 then-director Comey conceded that the Bureau did not corroborate Steele\u2019s sources and relied on the fact that Steele had given the FBI reliable information in the past. (See Grassley-Graham memo, p.2.)\n\nAt the Washington Examiner, Byron York picks up on something I wish I had highlighted: The Schiff memo\u2019s focus on past Russian intelligence efforts (in 2013) to recruit Page to become an agent for Russia. As Byron notes, the Schiff memo claims that \u201cSteele\u2019s information about Page was consistent with the FBI\u2019s assessment of Russian intelligence efforts to recruit him and his connections to Russian persons of interest.\u201d\n\nThe fact that a foreign power is trying to recruit an American to become an agent for that foreign power is not a sufficient basis to issue a surveillance warrant against the American under FISA. It would, of course, be sufficient to issue a warrant against the foreign spies who are making the recruitment efforts, but it is not enough for a warrant against the American citizen who is the target of the recruitment effort.\n\nTo get a surveillance warrant under FISA (i.e., the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as codified at Title 50, U.S. Code, Sections 1801 et seq.), the FBI and the Justice Department must establish probable cause that the person to be monitored under the warrant is acting as an active, purposeful agent of a foreign power \u2014 not that the foreign power hopes to turn him into such an agent.\n\nFISA defines \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d \u2014 as that term is applicable to \u201cU.S. persons\u201d (i.e., American citizens and permanent-resident aliens) \u2014 as a person who:\u00a0\n\n(A) knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;\n\n(B) pursuant to the direction of an intelligence service or network of a foreign power, knowingly engages in any other clandestine intelligence activities for or on behalf of such foreign power, which activities involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;\n\n(C) knowingly engages in sabotage or international terrorism, or activities that are in preparation therefor, for or on behalf of a foreign power;\u00a0\n\n(D) knowingly enters the United States under a false or fraudulent identity for or on behalf of a foreign power or, while in the United States, knowingly assumes a false or fraudulent identity for or on behalf of a foreign power; or\u00a0\n\n(E) knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) or knowingly conspires with any person to engage in activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).\n\n(See Section 1801(b)(2)(A)-(E), emphasis added.)\n\nEven assuming the FBI and Justice Department could prove that efforts were being made to recruit a U.S. person to become an agent of a foreign power, that would not come close to the probable cause showing required under FISA. If the government wants to establish that an American is a foreign agent, it must demonstrate that the American is knowingly engaged in clandestine activity on behalf of the foreign power that is so egregious it very likely constitutes a serious federal felony \u2014 e.g., terrorism, sabotage, or using false identities while spying on behalf of the foreign power.\n\nTo date, after dueling memos from Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, plus the Grassley-Graham memo from the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have only one allegation regarding Page that approaches the statutorily required showing that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power: the Steele dossier\u2019s claim that Page met separately with Sechin and Divyekin, and discussed with them, respectively, a corrupt quid pro quo to end sanctions against Russia, and the possibility that the Kremlin would provide the Trump campaign with damaging information (\u201ckompromat\u201d) against Hillary Clinton (along with a warning that Trump should be careful dealing with Russia because the Kremlin had kompromat on him, too).\n\nIn light of the legal standard that applies, it is inconceivable that the FISA warrant would have issued in the absence of this uncorroborated hearsay allegation \u2014 which is exactly what FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe stated in December 2017 House Intelligence Committee testimony (a Nunes memo assertion (at p.3, para.4) that the Schiff memo does not attempt to rebut), and exactly what is reported in the Grassley-Graham memo (at p.2: \u201cThe bulk of the application consists of allegations against Page that were disclosed to the FBI by Mr. Steele and are also outlined in the Steele dossier\u201d). Schiff may be right that there were several layers of information in the warrant application about what Russia was doing regarding the election and Russia\u2019s efforts to recruit foreign agents \u2014 including Page. But specifically with respect to Page, who was targeted for surveillance and as to whom the government was legally required to show probable cause that he was a knowing, active agent of a foreign power, without the Sechin/Divyekin allegation, there could have been no basis for the warrant.\n\nOne last point of law that is covered in more detail in my column. FISA also requires the FBI and Justice Department to satisfy the court that surveillance \u2014 highly intrusive eavesdropping on the phone, email, text, and other communications of the alleged agent of a foreign power \u2014 is necessary because the information sought \u201ccannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques.\u201d (See FISA, Section 1804(a)(6)(C).) Such techniques include interviewing the alleged foreign agent.\n\nThe Schiff memo acknowledges that the FBI has interviewed Page numerous times over the years, including as late as March 2016 \u2014 six months before the FISA warrant. Yet, the Schiff memo fails to explain that Page was a government cooperator in a 2013 investigation of Russian spies, and that his information was used to prosecute the spies. In fact, this is the very matter in which the Russians were trying to recruit Page. I pointed out this out in responding to the Schiff memo\u2019s precursor, a letter from the Intelligence Committee\u2019s senior Democrat, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York:\n\nOn the question of criminality, I note that many commentators point to Page\u2019s involvement in a prior FBI investigation involving Russia, and darkly observe that he \u201cwas on the Bureau\u2019s radar screen for years\u201d before the October 2016 FISA warrant application \u2014 as if this supposition were a substitute for FISA\u2019s legal requirement of proving criminal activity. But the 2013 investigation into which Page stumbled was a case of Russian agents trying to recruit him as a source. Far from doing anything criminal, Page appears to have cooperated with the FBI and Justice Department to nail the Russian spies. (See the Justice Department\u2019s complaint in United States v. Buryakov, at pp. 12\u201313 \u2014 Page is \u201cMale-1,\u201d whom the Russian spy Victor Podobnyy refers to as an \u201cidiot,\u201d and whose 2013 interview by the FBI is described in paragraph 34.) Again, we don\u2019t know everything the FBI knows, but based on what we have been told, it appears that in the prior case, Page worked with the United States against Russia; that does not jibe with the allegation in the FISA warrant application that he worked with Russia against the United States.\n\nConsider these two facts. First, there is no public indication that Page has ever been unwilling to speak to federal investigators or has ever lied to them in the many times he has been interviewed \u2014 unlike, say, Christopher Steele, who was terminated as an informant for violating his agreement about press contacts and for apparently lying to the FBI about speaking to the media. Second, the FBI and Justice Department quite understandably wanted to know whether Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin but were unable to verify Steele\u2019s hearsay claim that he had.\n\nThere is no public indication that Page has ever been unwilling to speak to federal investigators or has ever lied to them in the many times he has been interviewed.\n\nWith those things in mind, I will close here with the same questions I asked in the column posted last night:\n\n\nWhen Steele brought the FBI his unverified allegations that Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin, why didn\u2019t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance?\n\nGiven that it is a requirement of federal FISA law that the FBI and Justice Department demonstrate that surveillance is necessary because alternative investigative techniques have been tried and have failed, or would fail if tried, what did the government agents and lawyers tell the FISA court about why interviewing Page would not yield the information they were seeking?", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mairead Mcardle", "body": "ProLife Democrat Dan Lipinski Wins Illinois Primary\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPro-life Democrat Dan Lipinski snatched a narrow victory on Tuesday over newcomer progressive\u00a0Marie Newman in the Chicago-area district he has held for seven years.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for the incumbent candidate, who leads by less than two percentage points with 97\u00a0percent of precincts reporting.\n\nNewman, who argued Lipinski\u2019s views are out of date, garnered powerful professional allies, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Verm.), who is popular in the district.\u00a0 Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Human Rights Campaign, EMILY\u2019s List, MoveOn.org, and former Obama advisor David Axelrod also lent their support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance we wake up in recount mode,\u201d Newman told her supporters Tuesday evening.\n\nThe race was seen as a litmus test for Democrats for whether pro-life candidates are still welcome in the party.\n\nLipinski is against abortion and voted against same-sex marriage and Obamacare, moves that his opponent said make him not a \u201ctrue Democrat.\u201d He refused to endorse Barack Obama for re-election in 2012.\n\nMany in his own party have blasted his views, calling him \u201cone of the worst.\u201d Even the\u00a0Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not endorse him this time around.\n\n\u201cDan Lipinski may have a D next to his name \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t have true Democratic values,\u201d said NARAL president Ilyse Hogue. \u201cHe\u2019s consistently undermined the rights of women, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lipinski is known around the neighborhood and supported by many labor groups, including\u00a0Illinois AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cCompromise is essential to getting things done,\u201d he said last week.\u00a0\u201cAnd the party and the country cannot afford a Tea Party of the left.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cif it means that you have to support abortion to be a Democrat, a lot of people will walk away,\u201d said Kristen Day, the Democrats For Life executive director.\n\nLipinski does not face much competition in the general election, as the candidate running on the Republican side of the ballot is\u00a0the former head of the American Nazi Party and\u00a0has been disowned by his own party.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jibran Khan", "body": "(Yves  If foreign investment in the U.S. is arbitrarily blocked through executive order, half the purpose of corporate-tax reform is defeated.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn Monday, President Trump issued an executive order to block Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s takeover of Qualcomm before the two companies had even made a deal. In the order, the president says that \u201cthere is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited .\u00a0.\u00a0. might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201d The move seems to have worked, given that Broadcom withdrew and terminated its $117 billion bid on Wednesday morning. What this evidence entails is highly unclear.\n\nBroadcom and Qualcomm are major players in the mobile-technology space. The two companies produce much of the silicon that powers laptops, phones, and tablets. Despite Broadcom\u2019s Singapore corporate headquarters, it is largely an American company and started as a division of Hewlett-Packard in the 1960s. The company plans to move its headquarters to the U.S. next month, quite possibly as a result of corporate-tax reform. In fact, Broadcom\u2019s CEO announced the move at the White House this past autumn, standing beside President Trump as he did so.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the latest in a long line of trade restrictions that the administration has taken in the name of national security. Each has been fast-tracked unilaterally by means of Cold War\u2013era statutes, including the recent steel and aluminum taxes. The Trump administration has been quietly blocking international business deals via a Treasury Department panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), that is chaired by Steven Mnuchin. In the case of Broadcom, the president chose the much more visible route of issuing an executive order as well. Why did this call for such visibility? Trump will be in San Diego next week; it is entirely possible that he wants to claim \u201cvictory\u201d at Qualcomm\u2019s offices.\n\nMany have argued that the block allows Qualcomm to remain ahead of China\u2019s Huawei as the market leader in 5G technology; indeed, even the Wall Street Journal endorses the Trump executive order on those grounds, despite its stance against the steel and aluminum tariffs. The Journal editors argue that a Broadcom merger would have meant that Qualcomm\u2019s 5G technology effectively ceased, because Broadcom is in the habit of deprioritizing spending on research and development. That claim does not hold up to scrutiny. Qualcomm is currently the market leader in 5G technology, which \u201cis a core piece of the franchise Broadcom is trying to purchase,\u201d according to an analyst with Bernstein Research before the deal was blocked, and 5G expansion was the stated reason for Broadcom\u2019s interest in the merger. Furthermore, Qualcomm has incurred costly fines and lawsuits that are likely to take a toll on the company and that Broadcom\u2019s cash influx would help pay for.\n\nTrump\u2019s most prominent Senate ally on trade, Senator Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), while praising the executive order on the Senate floor, laid out the other argument, \u201cthat China has been rapacious about trade and very smart. They look for places where they can steal our best technology.\u201d That argument is based on the fact that Broadcom works with Chinese companies .\u00a0.\u00a0. but so does Qualcomm. In fact, so do just about all tech companies. Perhaps Schumer and Trump believe Singapore to be part of China, but it is no more so than Geneva is part of France. (Even if the company were not mostly American, which it is, Singapore is a staunch ally anyway.)\n\n\n\n\nThere are fears that the continual denials issued by CFIUS will lead to a chilling effect on international investment. With the expectation that approval for mergers and acquisitions will be denied by Washington, foreign companies may simply decide against the uncertainty of making investments in the U.S., and other countries could retaliate by erecting regulatory barriers against American firms.\n\nThe Broadcom-Qualcomm merger would have been the largest in tech history. It was likely to run into antitrust issues, especially given that the two companies between them produce most smartphone components. The deal might have been stopped in its tracks by antitrust regulators, but in that case at least the reasons would have been transparent.\n\nSuch abuse of executive authority cheapens appeals to national security and advances Congress\u2019s abdication of its own authority.\n\n\nIt is dangerous that national-security authority is invoked to justify any measure to stop something that the president does not like. Abuse of that authority cheapens appeals to national security and advances Congress\u2019s abdication of authority by encouraging unilateral decision-making from the executive branch. It seems likely to me that the order is driven by Trump\u2019s \u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d instincts, dressed up in the rhetoric of national security for easy implementation and buy-in from the ideologically unmoored. What\u2019s more, Trump is not alone. Senators John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif) want to expand CFIUS\u2019s authority to block investments, in the name of \u201cmodernization.\u201d\n\nTrump and the GOP talked up the ways in which corporate tax reform would open up the U.S. to greater investment, and they had a point.

But it\u2019s a surprise that the president should endeavor to repeat throughout the midterm elections if he hopes to bolster his first term with any legislative achievements beyond tax reform.\n\n\n\n\nThe presidential tweet\u2019s conciliatory tone is an unfamiliar one, especially in light of Romney\u2019s sustained public opposition to Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016. In March of that year, Romney delivered a major speech urging Republicans to vote strategically in order to deny Trump an outright majority of delegates heading into the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which would have opened the possibility of a non-Trump compromise candidate winning the Republican nomination. Unlike many leaders on the right, who slowly came to embrace the unconventional candidate, Romney persisted in vocally opposing Trump even after he had secured the nomination.\n\nIn May of 2016 \u2014 after Trump had won the Indiana primary and all but locked up the nomination \u2014 Romney explained his rationale in steadfastly opposing the GOP nominee to the Wall Street Journal:\n\nI wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn\u2019t ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world. . . . I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak, but that\u2019s how I can sleep at night.\n\nRomney went on to skip July\u2019s Republican National Convention. Later, he denounced Trump\u2019s comments on the infamous Access Hollywood tape that emerged just a month before the November election.\n\nAll of this makes Trump\u2019s immediate support for Romney\u2019s Senate campaign fairly puzzling. Trump has never been known for receiving public criticism with grace \u2014 whether those volleys come from perceived enemies on the left or would-be allies on the right. Despite being the standard bearer of the GOP in 2016, Trump often refused to support the Senate campaigns of Republicans who didn\u2019t embrace his own candidacy as enthusiastically as he wished. Indeed, in the weeks before his inauguration, some speculated that Trump had entertained the possibility of Romney\u2019s nomination as secretary of state \u2014 only to spurn him and choose Rex Tillerson \u2014 as a way to exact revenge for Romney\u2019s failure to endorse his candidacy.\n\nIn fact, both during and after the 2016 elections, Trump appeared to revel in attacking Republicans who expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership of the GOP. The laundry list of Trump\u2019s rhetorical onslaughts against members of his own party has grown too lengthy to explore in great detail, but no Republican daring enough to criticize him has been left unscathed \u2014 and that includes Romney, whom Trump personally attacked on over a dozen occasions during the course of 2016 alone.\n\nRepublican Senate candidates\u2019 lack of gusto for Trump\u2019s campaign, however, didn\u2019t end up being terribly detrimental to them in the 2016 elections \u2014 at least, not as detrimental as hardcore Trump supporters insisted it would be. Many Republican incumbents even ran ahead of Trump in their home states: from Ron Johnson in Wisconsin to Marco Rubio in Florida to Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman, among others.\n\nAnd Romney will surely be no exception in Utah, with or without the president\u2019s endorsement. In 2016, the state did go to Trump, but over 20 percent of Utah voters supported third-party candidate Evan McMullin, the largest share of the vote he received in any state, by far. Utah is a conservative state, but it\u2019s not a Trump state, and from the looks of Romney\u2019s opening salvo in the campaign, he knows it.\n\nHis young candidacy has already been fascinating, if only for what it has revealed about both Trump and Democrats. Some on the left insist that Romney\u2019s willingness to accept Trump\u2019s endorsement proves he\u2019ll never dare to oppose the president on anything. Those expecting Romney to arrive on the Senate floor as the newly minted Republican anti-Trump will likely be disappointed, yes, but to large swathes of the left, any failure to loudly condemn Trump\u2019s every word is equivalent to abetting his supposed attempts to overthrow our Republic.\n\nBy every indication, Romney will tread a middle course, and there\u2019s no evidence that he has bowed obsequiously to Trump since 2016 in order to win the president\u2019s support. For example, Romney didn\u2019t hesitate last August to roundly condemn the president\u2019s failure to single out white nationalists and neo-Nazis for criticism after the alt-right\u2019s Charlottesville rally.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Romney\u2019s campaign-announcement video contained a few lines that could very easily be taken as a critique of the president. For instance: \u201cUtah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington. . . . Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the word. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion. And on Utah\u2019s Capitol Hill, people treat one another with respect.\u201d And several outlets have reported this week that sources close to Romney say that, as senator, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to publicly critique the president as he sees fit.\n\nEven so, the president\u2019s quick embrace of Romney \u2014 appearing to set aside the vitriol of 2016 \u2014 seems to suggest that he\u2019s willing to overlook past transgressions for the sake of building a Republican coalition capable of winning the midterms. If that\u2019s the case, that calculation would be a huge shift for Trump, and a welcome one for GOP lawmakers handcuffed by the slim Senate majority and concerned about losing the House to Democrats in November.\n\nAs senator, Romney wouldn\u2019t hesitate to publicly critique the president as he sees fit.\n\nPerhaps Trump has realized that, if he wishes to sign major legislation into law beyond last December\u2019s tax reform, he\u2019ll need more than 51 GOP senators to get the job done. Alternatively, perhaps the president suspected that Romney might be able to win in Utah even without his support and wanted to preempt that possibility by getting on board early so that he can claim credit come November.\n\n\nRegardless, urged on by his ever-present desire for victory, Trump should take the same good will he\u2019s managed to muster toward Romney and apply it to the campaign of every viable Republican candidate, regardless of past feuds. After all, he knows better than most how to wield the undeniable power of his persona and the loyalty of his base to drum up broader support on the campaign trail, and he\u2019ll be especially successful in doing so if he focuses on last year\u2019s popular tax-reform legislation \u2014 and Republicans\u2019 undeniable success in confirming conservative judges \u2014 rather than his own petty grudges.\n\nIf he follows such a course, Donald Trump would be doing the Republican party a huge favor.

But ignoring the consequences of government profligacy won\u2019t make them go away.\n\nBut as ridiculous as the process may be, the omnibus bill is far worse. We likely won\u2019t know everything that is in the bill until after it\u2019s passed. Some items, such as funding for President Trump\u2019s border wall, anti-abortion riders, and $900 million for a rail-and-tunnel project connecting New York and New Jersey that is opposed by President Trump, are still being negotiated, even as the House prepares to vote as early as today. It is unlikely that more than a handful of members will have actually read the bill before the vote.\n\nThat won\u2019t stop the bill from passing on a bipartisan basis, of course, because it will be stuffed with plenty of goodies for both parties. Overall, it will increase federal spending by the largest amount since 2009. Democrats are reportedly set to get a $63 billion increase in domestic discretionary spending, including a $15 billion bailout for insurance companies under Obamacare. Meanwhile, Republicans will receive $80 billion in additional spending on the Pentagon. And the bill for all this will fall to our children and grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the omnibus passes, we can expect a parade of members of both parties appearing on television to congratulate themselves for finally having done their job. The omnibus will be hailed as a model of bipartisan cooperation and example of what Washington can accomplish if Democrats and Republicans simply put aside inconvenient things like principles and work together. Then they can all hurry home to campaign. Let the good times roll.\n\nConcerns over the debt, spending, and the size of government are distinctly out of fashion in Trump\u2019s Washington.

Now Trump has few good  are dead and thousands wounded after an intensive bombing campaign in Eastern Ghouta by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Images of bloodied children, carnage, and destroyed homes have made the rounds across major media outlets. Opinion pieces have slowly started to roll out questioning President Trump\u2019s decision to remain removed from the conflict, with criticism coming most notably from two former Obama State Department appointees, Evelyn Farkas and Frederic Hof, writing in The Atlantic.\n\nThis is nothing more than an attempt to confuse the fact that Obama, not Trump, is responsible for the worsening bloodshed in Syria.\n\n\n\n\nSyria has been in a state of civil war since March 2011. More than 500,000 have been killed and millions remain displaced in one of the worst humanitarian crises in the modern era. European governments have been destabilized from the millions of refugees who have fled, seeking safety. How did the United States let it get this bad? Because President Obama offered no leadership as Syria descended into chaos and the world is now forced to face the aftermath of that mistake.\n\nObama\u2019s decision to remain clear of Syria was calculated. Looking for a major foreign-policy achievement, the president wanted to cement his legacy by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. Negotiators from Tehran issued a warning to Washington that no deal would happen if the United States became embroiled in the Syrian civil war. Presented with the opportunity to secure the nuclear deal, Obama and his team decided to \u201clead from behind\u201d in Syria, leaving other nations to deal with the issue.\n\nUnfortunately, the Iran Deal had the consequence of significantly accelerating strife in Syria. By freeing up hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctioned money, Tehran was able to prop up Assad and his murderous regime, to the generous tune of $6 to $35 billion a year, according to the U.N. special envoy to Iran, Staffan de Mistura. Oil, foot soldiers, and munitions followed. Worse, Iran was able to provide substantial funding to its proxy group, Hezbollah, whose radical Islamist fighters poured into Syria to support Assad.\n\nObama\u2019s lack of leadership in Syria also left other actors to fill the gap. Seeing an opportunity to advance his goal of returning Russia to global-power status, Vladimir Putin sent soldiers and military support to the Syrian regime in 2015. Moscow continues to help train Assad\u2019s forces and has partaken in airstrikes. Russia-Syrian joint forces have conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Eastern Ghouta alone.\n\nEven as Russia stepped up its influence alongside Iran and Hezbollah, and the situation continued to deteriorate, President Obama kept America on the sidelines. Syrians faced the meat grinder of the Assad regime, and Washington apparently didn\u2019t feel obligated to highlight the atrocities. The Obama administration remained silent on Iran and Hezbollah\u2019s frequent attacks on civilian populations.\n\nWhile images of ISIS beheading American captives splashed across television screens worldwide, the Obama administration remained mired in passivity.\n\nSurprisingly, Washington even curtailed the use of military force against radical Islamist groups such as ISIS. While images of ISIS beheading American captives splashed across television screens worldwide, the Obama administration remained mired in passivity. Former CIA director Mike Morrell disclosed that fear of environmental harm, from the destruction of ISIS\u2019s oil wells, kept the U.S. from waging a full-fledged campaign to destroy the terror group and its financing mechanisms. So we launched strikes on individual trucks rather than oil wells or  Obama\u2019s inaction on this front wasn\u2019t the worst of his blunders. Previously, the president had set a \u201cred line\u201d warning the Syrian government that the United States would not accept the use of chemical weapons in the conflict. \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,\u201d Obama noted in August 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBut the red line vanished. The world watched in shock as Assad slaughtered his own people using chemical weapons, testing the former president\u2019s response. Obama condemned the attack and expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d over the situation, but no tangible concessions from Assad or military response followed. He proved his own \u201cred line\u201d to be an empty threat, shattering American credibility.\n\nWith Obama\u2019s missteps, one is right to ask what Trump has done since he\u2019s taken office. To start, he has loosed the rules of engagement to allow our troops to be less constrained when combating radical Islamist terrorist groups. ISIS remains on the run in both Syria and Iraq and has lost more than 98 percent of its territory, mostly since Trump took office.\n\nThe authoritarian regimes in Iran and Russia have also been put on watch. In a recent major escalation, United States forces killed or wounded more than 300 Kremlin-backed guns for hire near the city of Deir al-Zor, in Syria. Assailants attempted to launch an assault on an American base and were obliterated in a clash more deadly than any single occasion during the cold war. Trump offered no apologies or condolences to Putin after it was revealed that dozens of fighters were Russian citizens, fighting under the guise of mercenaries.\n\n\n\n\nMost significantly, the Trump administration has stood firm on its stance that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable. Emboldened by Obama\u2019s feeble response, Assad launched a chemical attack on the Syrian city of Khan Shaykhun in April 2017. More than 80 were killed, with hundreds injured including women and children.\n\n\n\n\nThe United States responded immediately, launching 59 Tomahawk missiles at Shayrat Airbase and wiping out approximately 20 percent of the Assad regime\u2019s airpower. Thankfully, these actions made clear that the current administration will take decisive measures to ensure that chemical weapons are not normalized.\n\n\nDespite these firm actions from the current administration, Trump can do only so much. President Obama ceded too much control to Iran and Russia, and further American involvement would probably initiate a major military confrontation. So when you see the humanitarian catastrophe blare across your television, remember that President Obama is the reason we cannot do more. America\u2019s hands remain tied from past failures.\n\nBlaming the current Syria situation on President Trump is both dishonest and unscrupulous. Obama\u2019s handling of Syria was disastrous. Expecting Trump to fix the mess overnight is ridiculous. He and his team are now attempting to uphold international law and halt the worsening humanitarian crisis.

Judging by what he wore when he went out to vote in Minneapolis on Nov. 2, 2010, his preferences in shirts run less to button-down Oxford cloth than to chatty T-shirts. The question the U.S. Supreme Court will consider\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0is whether Cilek\u2019s expressive shirt impermissibly interfered with Minnesota\u2019s interest in maintaining \u201cpeace, order and decorum\u201d at polling places.\n\nMinnesota forbids voters from wearing in a polling place political badges, buttons, or other insignia designed to \u201cinfluence and impact\u201d voting, or \u201cpromoting a group with recognizable political views,\u201d even if the things worn do not refer to any candidate or issue on that day\u2019s ballot. Nine other states have similar laws, and all 50 states have \u201cspeech-free zones\u201d around polling places. Cilek\u2019s T-shirt featured the Gadsden Flag (\u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d) and a small tea-party logo. He also sported a button, from a group worried about voter fraud, that read \u201cPlease I.D.

Minnesota has admitted that its law also would forbid apparel bearing the logos of, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, which do indeed have \u201crecognizable political views.\u201d These might (to use the language of campus speech police) \u201ctrigger\u201d in people who see them. . . what?

It is, however, a bit much for Minnesota to forbid passive expression of political \u2014 very broadly defined \u2014 allegiances not associated with any person or issue being voted on. What about a shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity\u201d? Those words, which a guide for University of California employees says can constitute a \u201cmicroaggression,\u201d could trigger fainting spells among voters at polling places sniffing for the reek of unchecked white privilege.\n\nAnd what about a T-shirt with a pristinely unpolitical message (e.g., \u201cI despise cocker spaniels\u201d) that might disturb some sensitive souls in a polling place? The Supreme Court can try to enunciate what is unimaginable \u2014 clear standards concerning every conceivable language use in a hypersensitive America. Or the court can give its squint of strict scrutiny to all such polling-place laws, many of which will not pass muster. Otherwise, polling-place officials will have broad discretion to lay down the law, if it can be dignified as law, on an ad hoc basis concerning what is and is not a \u201crecognizable\u201d political view or \u201cundue\u201d influence.\n\n\nThe First Amendment was ratified in 1791. One hundred and twenty-eight years passed before the court confronted a case \u2014 three cases, actually \u2014 squarely concerning freedom of speech. Dealing disgracefully with residues of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s wartime semi-totalitarianism, the court held: During wartime, the government can restrict speech that could \u201ccreate a clear and present danger\u201d of evils that Congress has the power to prevent. And the guarantee of free speech does not protect printing leaflets urging disruption of the war effort. And Wilson\u2019s administration did not violate the amendment when it imprisoned Eugene Victor Debs \u2014 he had received 6 percent of the presidential vote as the Socialist Party\u2019s candidate in 1912 \u2014 because he made an anti-war speech.\n\nNowadays, the court frequently adjudicates speech controversies because governments eagerly embrace sinister rationalizations for \u201cbalancing\u201d free speech against competing values, to the detriment of free speech. Hence the court should affirm Cilek\u2019s admirably prickly resistance to Minnesota\u2019s officiousness.

To be sure, they both draw on some of the same political trends, notably a distrust of elites and an upsurge of popular anger over evident failures of public policy such as illegal immigration. But opposition to Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union has been the firm belief of a large and passionate number of voters, sometimes a plurality, in U.K. politics ever since Britain joined in 1973. Trumpism, on the other hand, is a very recent phenomenon (even if long germinating). Also, though Brexit may be proving hard to achieve, it\u2019s a clear and well-defined idea: that Britain should leave the EU to regain its former status as a self-governing democracy. Trumpism, however, is a work in progress, which, as in the paintings of some modern artists, may not even exist as a distinct concept in the mind of the artist.\n\nDespite these differences, however, both Trump and Brexit have inspired the same sort of derangement syndrome. And, as it happens, both such syndromes have been triggered by the same event in the past few days \u2014 namely, the crisis arising from the poisoning of the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the picturesque English cathedral town of Salisbury. As soon as the broad facts were known and the suspicion formed \u2014 in part because Russian television gloated unbecomingly over it \u2014 that President Putin\u2019s Russia was behind this attempted murder, two opinions began to be heard.\n\n\n\n\nThe first was that President Trump would remain silent on the matter and fail to offer any real support to Theresa May and the Brits. Very quickly this criticism lost its conditional tone, and it began to be asserted that Trump had actually failed to offer such support. Whole days had gone by and he had still failed to condemn Putin \u2014 and, of course, we all knew why that was, didn\u2019t we? He was in Putin\u2019s pocket and didn\u2019t want to discommode his ally/co-conspirator/boss.\n\nSo what was the timetable?\n\nSkripal and his daughter were found comatose and apparently dying on a park bench in Salisbury on the afternoon of Wednesday, March 7. On Monday, March 12, Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons that according to British experts the Skripals had been poisoned by a nerve agent that Russia had developed. This meant, she said, either that the Russian state had launched a direct attack on Britain or that it had lost control of a potentially catastrophic poison. She demanded a reply from the Russian government by\u00a0midnight\u00a0of Tuesday, March 13. No satisfactory explanation was forthcoming, and on Wednesday, March 14, May declared that it was overwhelmingly likely that the Russian state had directly attacked Britain. She then announced a series of anti-Russian sanctions.\n\nTwo days before that, however, when May was giving her first statement to the Commons, leaving open the question of whether this had been a Russian attack or a loss of control over their stockpiles, Jon Sopel of the BBC asked in a tweet whether there would now be from Trump a \u201ccondemnation\u201d of the attack, as it was a case of \u201cSo far silence from Britain\u2019s closest ally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThat was echoed in the London Times on the 13th \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0i.e., the day before May\u2019s second and more conclusive statement \u2014 in a statement from former foreign secretary and Labour moderate David Miliband: \u201cIt is very significant\u00a0and very worrying, frankly, that the White House has not felt able to point the finger at Russia in the last seven or eight days.\u201d\n\nIn the same edition of the Times, Alex Massie in an op-ed dealt briskly with the awkward problem that Rex Tillerson had condemned the Russian actions in the clearest terms: \u201cWhen Rex Tillerson, in one of his final acts as US secretary of state, condemned Russian aggression in Wiltshire it was obvious that he was barely speaking for his badly understaffed department, let alone for the US administration as a whole.\u201d He concluded gloomily that \u201calliances are based on reliability and no one, least of all its friends, can rely on this American administration.\u201d Anne Applebaum (of whom more later) in the Washington Post joined in this chorus. And Anthony Lane, writing in The New Yorker, had an even more severe judgment on the Tillerson case.\n\nYes, Tillerson had been admirably \u201crobust\u201d in his criticism of Russia\u2019s attack in Wiltshire, he wrote, but that outspokenness had led to serious consequences for him: \u201cHe lost his job.\u201d Of course, we learned almost immediately that Tillerson had been fired three days\u00a0before\u00a0condemning Russia. But that alone would not necessarily have satisfied those suffering from Trump derangement syndrome. They might well have argued that his firing meant that he was now finally free to defy Trump and condemn Putin \u2014 if Trump had not himself condemned Russia in strong terms even as they were writing.\n\n\n\n\nAsked by journalists on Tuesday the 13th (in the interval between May\u2019s two statements), he told the cameras that he would be talking to Theresa May later in the day but that until then: \u201cIt seems to me they think like it\u2019s Russia and I would certainly take that finding as fact. If we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\u201d\n\nTrump says this in about three different ways in the course of 39 seconds. He was widely reported in the American media as having \u201chedged\u201d his support, but in\u00a0the video you can see that he\u2019s saying exactly what May was saying at that time, with the sole qualification that he\u2019s waiting to hear what she has to say to him personally. When they had the conversation later that day, Tuesday the 13th again, the White House put out a report expressing solidarity with the U.K. and stating that \u201cPresident Trump said that the US was with the UK all the way.\u201d That was followed on Wednesday\u00a0and Thursday\u00a0by two statements from the State Department condemning Russia, another from Ambassador Nikki Haley at the United Nations, and above all by a joint statement \u2014 from the U.S., the U.K., France, and Germany \u2014 that called the poisoning of the Skripals \u201cthe first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War. It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and any such use by a State party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all.\u201d In the middle of all these condemnations both the U.S. and the U.K. announced additional sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhich brings me to Brexit \u2014 and to Brexit Derangement Syndrome. In a sort of non-musical counterpoint to the denunciations of Trump, many of the same critics were developing an argument that Brexit meant that Britain was now isolated, alone, and without allies in the face of this Russian assault.\n\nIn a sort of counterpoint to the denunciations of Trump, many critics were developing an argument that Brexit meant that Britain was now isolated.\n\nThere was a little cognitive dissonance in these jeremiads because their authors wanted to suggest both that EU states such France and Germany would no longer be reliable allies for Britain post-Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0that nonetheless they would be much more reliable allies than Trump\u2019s America. The first of these melodies got a brief overture when a spokesman for President Macron described the called British response of anti-Russian sanctions \u201cfantasy politics,\u201d seeming to suggest that the French took the matter lightly. But he was quickly slapped down by Macron himself, who declared that he accepted the British view that the Russians were responsible for the poisoning, that it was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d that there had to be European and transatlantic unity in response, and that France would shortly announce measures in response.\n\nAnne-Elisabeth Moutet in the Telegraph brilliantly explained this turnabout, giving a historical\u00a0tour d\u2019horizon\u00a0of French attitudes, pointing out that, at least since de Gaulle, France has liked to be a reliable ally but a\u00a0difficult\u00a0one, so that its support would not be taken for granted. In general, however, the main theme concerning Brexit was that, in different ways, Britain had isolated itself from allies and therefore from its own security.\n\nThus Alex Massie\u2019s o-ped in the Times, mentioned above, was entitled \u201cBrexit Leaves Us Lonely in a Dangerous World,\u201d and after some reflections on the terrible silence of Trump, it developed this theme:\n\nAt the very moment when the UK needs a reliable partner in Washington it encounters the first \u201cAmerica First\u201d president since the Second World War. And it does so at the precise moment when it is cutting ties with its erstwhile continental partners. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Yes, we wish to maintain close working relationships and alliances with our European neighbours with whom we still have many common interests, but the unavoidable fact remains that a Britain leaving the EU is less well-placed to press the case for firm action against Russia than a Britain that was still a member would have been.\n\nAnne Applebaum in the Washington Post pressed home the same argument in a column entitled \u201cThe nerve agent attack on British soil has exposed London\u2019s isolation.\u201d Indeed, she considers that the Russian attack may even have been prompted by Brexit:\u00a0\u201cMore ominously, it may have been designed to expose Britain\u2019s new isolation: Now that it is leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom no longer has a set of allies it can rely upon to help craft a response.\u201d\n\nAnd she added: \u201cIf the point was to expose British isolation, it has succeeded.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, that was early in the week. Two days later the French, the Germans, and the Yanks were all lined up with the Brits to denounce Russia and to declare solidarity with the U.K. in a joint statement. That was a major development, and it was followed by an announcement of additional U.S. sanctions. But in another somersault \u2013 this time the reverse of Macron\u2019s \u2013 the new German foreign minister in Merkel\u2019s shaky coalition diluted this commitment and said that the Salisbury crisis was a \u201cbilateral\u201d dispute between Britain and Russia, and not a matter for the alliance as a whole. That was certainly a retreat from the joint statement of a few days before and arguably a breach of the solidarity it had proclaimed. But it seemed to have less to do with Brexit than with the drift of the new German government, in which the Social Democrats have more influence over foreign policy, towards a friendlier relationship with Russia \u2013 a \u201cdifficult partner\u201d but a necessary one, as the minister put it. And Berlin is indeed currently quarreling with its other partners in Central Europe, who are proving difficult in that they are resisting Russo-German plans to build a second Nordstream pipeline that would enable Moscow to service Germany with energy while cutting Central Europe out. On this matter, as it happens, the isolated Brits are supporting the Central Europeans.\n\nAnd there was a more general problem with the commentaries lamenting the isolation of Brexit Britain. They left out an extremely important aspect of European solidarity, namely, NATO, which is the main (and for practical purposes, the sole) organization for the defense of Europe. Not only is Britain a member of NATO, but the country is its single most important European member. That is true not only because the U.K. makes a stronger military and financial contribution to NATO than does any other European power, but also for reasons of geography: Germany and France are between the U.K. and the only power threatening European security, Russia. They need Britain far more than Britain needs them in the security realm. That alone makes them reliable allies, if not necessarily active or eager ones. And contrary to Massie\u2019s argument, that reality is not likely to change because the Brits want to set their own tax rates, regulations, and trading rules.\n\nThat leaves hanging Ms. Applebaum\u2019s argument that the U.K.\u2019s isolation born of Brexit prompted the attack. Given the allied support since given to Britain, that seems either a very severe Russian miscalculation or a mistaken analysis by the columnist. What, then, did prompt the attack (other than that Salisbury was where their target lived)? One clue lies in Applebaum\u2019s list of possible responses that the Brits could make to the attack. As she rightly says, it\u2019s hard to come up with sanctions that are both fast and effective. The longer-range sanctions on suspect Russian investment in London are doable, however, and I am more optimistic than she that something serious will now be done. New laws have recently been put in place to police hot and mafia money, and the latest Whitehall briefings in the Sunday newspapers suggest that they will shortly be activated against Putin cronies and oligarchs. We\u2019ll see.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne immediate sanction Applebaum mentions in passing, though, is that Britain \u201ccould reinforce its troops on the Russian border, in the Baltic states.\u201d That proposal leads to the thought that maybe the U.K.\u2019s existing \u201cleading role\u201d (alongside that of the Dutch and the French) in NATO\u2019s enhanced forward presence in the Baltic states was a possible motive for the Russian attack. For the Brits have been more willing than most NATO members to commit troops to the region to deter a Russian incursion \u2014 and that\u2019s very likely to be a bone in Putin\u2019s throat. In other words, it was Britain\u2019s commitment to its European allies that prompted the Russian attack rather than what Applebaum and Massie see as its isolation and estrangement from them.\n\nApplebaum and Massie get some unexpected (and doubtless unwelcome) support, however, from Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. He claims that the Brits are confecting the chemical-poisoning charges against Russia to \u201cdeflect attention\u201d from their difficulties in the Brexit negotiations with the EU. I doubt that he\u2019s suffering from any kind of syndrome, though. More plausibly, he\u2019s exploiting the Brexit derangement syndrome of the Remainers in the West to do some deflecting of his own \u2014 deflecting attention from the Russian threat to the independence of the Baltics and the Kremlin\u2019s real reasons for its reckless breaches of national sovereignty and international law.", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rich Lowry", "body": "aren\u2019t divided because of Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf only Joe McCarthy had lived to see this moment, when it is suddenly in vogue to attribute large-scale events in American politics to the hand of Russia and to inveigh against domestic subversion.\n\nRobert Mueller released an indictment of 13 Russians for crimes related to their social-media campaign to meddle in our internal affairs in the run-up to and aftermath of the 2016 election.\n\nMueller obviously isn\u2019t a McCarthyite, and can\u2019t be held responsible for the hysteria \u2014 and hopeful expectations of an impeachment-level event \u2014 that has built up around his work. His indictment is, as far as anyone can tell, rigorously factual. That\u2019s probably the point of it \u2014 to create a record of an episode that we should want to know as much about as possible and prevent from ever happening again.\n\nThe Russia campaign was a shockingly cynical violation of our sovereignty. President Donald Trump would do himself and the country a favor by frankly denouncing it. But the scale of the operation shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated. In the context of a hugely expensive, obsessively covered, impossibly dramatic presidential election, the Russian contribution on social media was piddling and often laughable.\n\nThe Russians wanted to boost Trump, but as a Facebook executive noted, most of their spending on Facebook ads came after the election. The larger goal was to sow discord, yet we had already primed ourselves for plenty of that.\n\nThe Russia campaign was a shockingly cynical violation of our sovereignty.\n\nDoes anyone believe, absent Russian trolls on Twitter and Facebook, that we were headed to a placid election season involving an incendiary, mediagenic former reality-TV star bent on blowing up the political establishment and a longtime pol who had stoked the enmity of Republicans for 30 years and was under FBI investigation?\n\nIf you read the Mueller indictment, you might think the Russians were everywhere, not only advertising on Facebook (\u201cTrump is our only hope for a better future\u201d; \u201cOhio Wants Hillary 4 Prison\u201d) but organizing rallies around the country. But it\u2019s not clear these rallies even came off.\n\nThe New York Post couldn\u2019t find any evidence of planned pro-Trump and anti-Hillary rallies in New York \u2014 not exactly a swing state \u2014 in June and July of 2016. Pictures and videos that appear to be from Russian-initiated pro-Trump \u201cflash mobs\u201d in Florida show a handful of people in various cities. This at a time when Trump was routinely holding rallies with thousands of people that garnered lavish media coverage.\n\nThe biggest Russian rally success appears to have been an anti-Trump event in New York after the election; it drew 10,000 people. This hardly means that the #resistance was corrupted by Russian influence. Without Kremlin involvement, half a million women marched against Trump in Washington, D.C., and more than 3 million around the country.\n\nThe Russians didn\u2019t do anything to us that we weren\u2019t doing to ourselves, although we were doing it on a much larger, more potent scale. The Russians are just aping the arguments we are already having with one another, and the sewerish level of much of the discussion on social media.\n\nThe New York Times ran a report the other day on Russian bots, in the immediate aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, posting on Twitter about gun control. It\u2019s hard to believe that this is going to rip apart the American body politic when many perfectly respectable, red-blooded Americans themselves advocate for gun control, and often in the immediate aftermath of shootings.\n\nIn a better world, Trump would be less defensive about the Russian investigation, and his opposition would be less obsessively invested in it (at least until such time that it produces a genuine bombshell). We should seek to shut down Russian influence as much as possible, without losing perspective. We aren\u2019t divided because of Russia; we\u2019re divided because we have genuine, deeply held differences. The fault, to the extent there is one, isn\u2019t with the bots, but with ourselves.\n\n\u00a9 2018 by King Features   Lowry is the editor of National Review.

But contrary to how they were portrayed in the media, these were not two stories; they were one story.\n\nIllinois\u2019s third district runs from the southwest side of Chicago to the suburbs on the\u00a0western and southwestern sides of the city, extending into DuPage and Will counties. Lipinski more or less inherited the district from his father, Bill Lipinski, first elected to Congress in 1983. It\u2019s safe Democratic turf, safer than its D+6 rating by Charlie Cook would suggest; there hasn\u2019t been a Republican congressman in this neighborhood since 1975. According to David Nir at DailyKos Elections, the district went 58.3 to 40.4 for Barack Obama in 2008, 55.9 to 42.6 for Obama in 2012, and 55.2-39.9 for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Hillary carried 74.3 percent of the vote in Cook County, 53 percent in DuPage County and 49.95% in Will County; in the entire rest of the state, she carried only 8 out of 99 counties, 5 by a majority and none others with 60 percent of the vote. Mark Kirk also lost all three counties in 2016. Lipinski ran unopposed in 2016, and in a Republican wave years of 2014 and 2010 he won with\u00a064.6 percent and\u00a069.7 percent\u00a0of the vote; his 29-point margin of victory in 2014 was the\u00a0worst of his career. With Republicans scrambling to hold previously safe Republican turf in 2018, spending money and grassroots effort to take out Lipinski could hardly be a lower priority.\n\nBut the safety of his district is also why progressives wanted Lipinksi replaced. Among the dwindling number of Democrats who describe themselves as being pro-life, Lipinski is \u2014\u00a0as Alexandra DeSanctis has noted\u00a0\u2014 one of the few with a voting record of actually putting some deeds behind his words, and the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List poured six-figure money and scores of volunteers into the district in the hopes of preserving even a small foothold for the pro-life movement in the Democratic party, bragging that its canvassers had reached 23,000 people. Pro-choice activists did the same, with presidential hopefuls like Kirsten Gillibrand (herself a former \u201cBlue Dog\u201d now reinventing, or revealing, herself as a Berniecrat) denouncing Lipinski:\n\n\nMy friend @Marie4Congress is running in #IL03 against a Democratic incumbent named Dan Lipinski. He\u2019s anti-choice, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ \u2013 and Marie\u2019s primary is in exactly one week.\n\n\u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) March 13, 2018\n\n\nEnter Arthur Jones. A 70-year-old self-described \u201cwhite racialist\u201d and former leader of the American Nazi Party, he first ran for mayor of Milwaukee on the National Socialist White People\u2019s Party ticket in 1976, and has made five prior efforts to run for Congress. As The Atlantic\u2018s Elaine Godfrey\u00a0notes,\n\nWhen he ran in 1998, the Cook County Republican Central Committee\u00a0denounced\u00a0his candidacy, saying it would be a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d if he was nominated. That year, the GOP nominated Robert Marshall for the seat\u2014who once called drunk driving a \u201cgrossly overblown\u201d problem and began a League of Men Voters to advocate for fathers in custody battles. (Marshall lost.) Most recently, Jones filed to run in the 2016 Republican primary, but the Illinois State Election Board\u00a0threw out\u00a0his petition in response to a GOP challenge, citing invalid signatures.\n\nBut in 2016, Republicans couldn\u2019t recruit an opponent for Lipinski; kicking Jones off the ballot left him unopposed. Similar dynamics were at work this year, while Jones flew under the radar, going door-to-door to collect the required signatures. He touted his foreign-policy goal \u2014 \u201cending America\u2019s wars in the Middle East, which he says primarily serve the interests of Israel\u201d \u2014 which makes him sound more like a Democrat.\n\n\n\nIllinois Republicans have denounced Jones loudly in the most vigorous terms to anyone who would listen, but without an opponent, all they could do was tell people to boycott the unopposed primary:\n\n\nThe Illinois Republican Party has sought to distance itself from Mr. Jones in recent weeks, blanketing the district with campaign fliers and robocalls urging voters to \u201cstop Illinois Nazis,\u201d according to a robocall script provided by the party. Mr. Jones said he had received three robocalls himself.\n\n\u201cArthur Jones is not a real Republican \u2014 he is a Nazi whose disgusting, bigoted views have no place in our nation\u2019s discourse,\u201d Tim Schneider, the Illinois Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. He said the party had urged voters \u201cto skip over his name when they go to the polls\u201d and moving forward planned on \u201cvehemently opposing Jones with real campaign dollars.\u201d\n\n\nThis is where Lipinksi\u2019s primary comes into the picture. Because Illinois has an open primary system, so Republican voters could cross over into the contested race rather than pull the lever for the Nazi. And a pro-life Democrat with national pro-life groups campaigning for him and prominent national Democrats denouncing him is a candidate that more Republicans could in good conscience support.\u00a0As The Intercept\u2018s Ryan Grim reported:\n\nSophia Olazaba, a field manager for the Newman campaign, said she doesn\u2019t doubt that some Republican voters crossed over. \u201cEven when we were canvassing, a lot of homes have had both Jeanne Ives and Dan Lipinski signs, so those people could have crossed over,\u201d she said, referring to the GOP gubernatorial candidate whose entire campaign was premised on her opposition to legal abortion.\n\nAnother volunteer, Sabrina Ithal, also from the 3rd district, mentioned that the open primary format could have actually worked in their favor: \u201cI converted quite a few Republicans who voted Democrat for the first time in 30-40 years today.\u201d\n\nIf you wanted to advance Republican policy priorities in IL-03, you were better off backing Lipinski, an occasional ally on a few topics, than engaging in the pointless Republican primary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, over 90,000 votes were cast in the primary, more than 47,000 of them for Lipinski. Turnout on the unopposed GOP side was not even reported by many sources, although people did come out to vote because there was a contested GOP primary for Illinois Governor; Decision Desk\u2019s Brandon Finnigan reports that Jones got just 16,181 votes, likely many of them people just pulling the party lever without knowing more than the (R). This is a far cry from the 64,000 votes for Lipinski\u2019s opponent in 2014, and even recognizing the difference between county and district lines, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to the 48,000 votes cast in the Rauner-Ives race in DuPage County, 38,000 in Will County, and 130,000 in Cook County (Ives carried DuPage and Will, Rauner carried Cook).\n\n\nBy contrast, Democratic Congressman Danny Davis, under fire for his embrace of notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, got 77,858 votes, winning his primary in Illinois\u2019s seventh district by a 50,000 vote margin. That won\u2019t stop Democrats, who spent much of the last decade downplaying the importance of ties to extremists in Chicago politics, from dining out on the GOP\u2019s failure to keep Jones off the ballot.\u00a0 But the reality is that Jones is a blip in a district that Republicans won\u2019t contest, and Republican voters mostly ignored him or crossed over to back Lipinski.\n\nAnd maybe if Democrats want to marginalize and draw support away from extremists in the Republican fold, they could learn a thing or two from Dan   McLaughlin is an attorney practicing securities and commercial litigation in New York City, and a contributing columnist at National Review", "link": null, "source": "National Review", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mairead Mcardle", "body": "National security adviser H.R.
