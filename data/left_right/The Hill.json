Cris Dush (R), accuse Justices Kevin Dougherty, Christine Donohue, Debra McClosky Todd and David Wecht of misbehavior in office.\n\nA fifth resolution to impeach Supreme Court Justice Max Baer is pending introduction.\n\nIn a memo to fellow House members, Dush said the ruling overriding Pennsylvania\u2019s U.S. House district lines amounted to an overstep of judicial authority under the state Constitution, which lays out the path by which a bill becomes a law \u2014 in this case, a bill to delineate the district lines after the decennial Census and reapportionment process.\n\n\u201cThe five Justices who signed this order that blatantly and clearly contradicts the plain language of the Pennsylvania Constitution engaged in misbehavior in office,\u201d Dush wrote to fellow members.\n\nIn an interview\u00a0 , Dush said he had drafted the resolutions shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s initial order in January. He had hoped to add language from the U.S. Supreme Court, if they took up the case. The U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0 \u00a0denied Pennsylvania Republicans\u2019 request to hear a challenge to the state Supreme Court decision.\n\n\u201cThis is basically 7th grade civics class all over again, the separation of powers and the authority of the legislature,\u201d Dush told The Hill. \u201cThe courts basically are there to interpret when there\u2019s conflict in the law, and they don\u2019t have any sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s January order struck down the existing congressional district maps, under which Republicans won 13 of 18 seats in the 2016 elections. The court gave legislative Republicans just a few weeks to draw new maps, before they imposed district lines drawn by their own special master.\n\n\u201cThe maps are indeed a piece of legislation. We write it out and we break it out by counties, cities, townships, and even down to the very voting precincts and wards if necessary,\u201d Dush added. \u201cThe product the state Supreme Court produced is just a series of maps.\u201d\n\nUnder the new maps, Democrats are expected to pick up at least two seats.\n\nIn a statement issued after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the Republican challenge, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) called the new maps imposed by the state court \u201cfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of Pennsylvania are tired of gerrymandering and the new map corrects past mistakes that created unfair Congressional Districts and attempted to diminish the impact of citizens\u2019 votes,\u201d Wolf said\u00a0 .\n\nBut Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature, and therefore the impeachment process. Dush said Republican leaders in the state legislature were especially keen to target Wecht, who won election to his ten-year term in 2015 while promising to examine the legality of district maps.\n\n\u201cLeadership is definitely interested in going after Wecht because he ran on this as a campaign issue and failed to recuse himself from the order, the opinion or the drawing of the map. So he was fulfilling a campaign promise, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Dush said.\n\nWhile the legislature is run by Republicans, Democrats hold a 5-2 majority on the state Supreme Court.\n\nPennsylvania lawmakers have only impeached one member of the state Supreme Court in the history of the Commonwealth. That vote came in 1994, when the state Supreme Court chief justice was removed from office after being convicted on two counts of conspiracy.\n\nThe state House has the sole power to impeach justices, and Republicans control 120 of 203 state House seats.

According to The New York Times, the recommendation was based on a finding from the Justice Department inspector general that McCabe was not forthcoming during the review, which includes\u00a0an investigation into a decision he made in 2016 to allow FBI officials to speak with reporters about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe exact details of the allegations against McCabe remain unclear.\n\nIt is also unclear why the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, chose to act on his findings\u00a0regarding\u00a0McCabe before closing the overall investigation into decisions made during the 2016 election. Horowitz has said publicly that he expects to issue his final report this spring.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s dismissal\u00a0is another indication of\u00a0the increasingly bitter politics surrounding the federal investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.

His wife, Jill McCabe, accepted almost $500,000 in political donations from a group affiliated with then-Virginia Gov.
