I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value. I hope to do the same w/ @StudentAidCommission. #undocumentedunafraid https://t.co/JpZOOhJfMU\n\n— Lizbeth Mateo, Esq. (@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018\n\n\nThank you Sen. @kdeleon for appointing me to the CalSOAP Advisory Committee. I look forward to working w/ the rest of the committee  the Student Aid Commission in such important task – increase the accessibility of postsecondary education opportunities for low-income students.\n\n— Lizbeth Mateo, Esq. (@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018\n\nShe complained that illegal aliens are not adequately represented in state government, and described her appointment as a step towards correcting that alleged injustice.\n\n“While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made,” Mateo said, as quoted by Fox News.\n\nDe León, who is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), described Mateo as: “a courageous, determined and intelligent young woman who at great personal risk has dedicated herself to fight for those seeking their rightful place in this country,” according to Fox News.\n\nMateo, however, seems somewhat confused about which country she prefers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Facebook post in 2016, apparently celebrating her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo declared, in Spanish: “[E]verything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”\n\nLizbeth Mateo (Facebook)\n\n\nWhile she is the first illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.\n\nDe León and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.\n\nJoel B.

Biden is one of the most popular politicians in our nation’s capital.\n\nHis demeanor, sense of humor, and even his friendly gaffes have allowed him to form close relationships with both Democrats and Republicans. His public image is built around his “Lunch Bucket Joe” persona. As he reminds the American people on regular occasion, he has little wealth to show for his career, despite having reached the vice presidency.\n\nOne of his closest political allies in Washington is former senator and former Secretary of State John Kerry. “Lunch Bucket Joe” he ain’t; Kerry is more patrician than earthy. But the two men became close while serving for several decades together in the US Senate. The two “often talked on matters of foreign policy,” says Jules Witcover in his Biden biography.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo their sons going into business together in June 2009 was not exactly a bolt out of the blue.\n\nBut with whom their sons cut lucrative deals while the elder two were steering the ship of state is more of a surprise.\n\nRead the rest of the story here.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tRead More Stories About:\n\t\tBig Government, Cronyism, National Security, Bank of China, Bohai Capital, China, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, John Kerry, Peter Schweizer, Secret Empires",

    "body": "CNN on Thursday declared former Vice President Joe Biden is the early 2020 frontrunner for the Democrats.\nBiden’s polling average in all national 2020 primary polls is 27%, and the only person even within striking distance right now is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is at 21%, according to the analysis\n\nAt least two of the primary polls (RABA, Politico/Morning Consult) had Oprah Winfrey as one of the potential candidates, and Biden finished ahead of Winfrey and the other Democrats in those polls. CNN, which acknowledged that it is “entirely unreasonable” to forecast a winner this early, also pointed out that Biden is even currently leading in New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary after the Iowa caucuses. A February University of New Hampshire survey found Biden defeating Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom are from the region, by double digits.\n\nBiden, whose advisers are reportedly planning a 2020 run, and Trump got into a war of words this week after Biden said he would take Trump behind the “gym and beat the hell out of him” if they were in high school and Trump made lewd remarks about women. Trump responded on Thursday by tweeting Biden is “trying to act like a tough guy” and “would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.”\n\n\nCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018\n\nAccording to CNN, “Biden versus Trump is probably the highest probability matchup compared to all the others at this moment in time, though it’s still a relative long-shot.”\n\nBiden’s first presidential run was derailed by a plagiarism scandal, and the former vice president will face much more scrutiny after the publication of Breitbart News Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer’s blockbuster new book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the book, the esteemed Clinton Cash and Throw Them All Out author reveals that Biden’s son Hunter’s investment firm signed a $1.5 billion deal with the Chinese government just 10 days after Joe and Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nSchweizer told Breitbart News Tonight on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 this week that the “Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they’ll get better policy positions from our government, and the history indicates in the Obama administration that that’s exactly what happens.”\n\n“Here’s the thing people have to keep in mind: Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese government,” Schweizer added. “He has no background in private equity. He was a lobbyist before his father became vice president for the casino industry. He has no background. He has no business getting a deal like this. He got this deal, pure and simple, because he is the son of a vice president, and the Chinese said, ‘We give him this deal, and his pal, who’s a former aide to John Kerry, they’re going to run it, and by doing so, we are going to curry favor with these guys,’ and you know what? Based on the track record, based on the response of the Obama administration of Secretary of State John Kerry and of Vice President Biden, that’s exactly what they got. They got good action for their money.”",

Schweizer’s last book, Clinton Cash, sparked an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAccording to an exclusive New York Post excerpt from the book, the Biden billion-dollar China deal occurred as follows. In 2013, Hunter Biden and the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry, Chris Heinz, were managing partners in the private equity firm Rosemont Seneca Partners. In December of that year, Vice President Biden and his son Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days after the trip, a subsidiary of the Bank of China named Bohai Capital signed an exclusive deal with Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz’s Rosemont to form a $1 billion joint-investment fund called Bohai Harvest RST. The deal was later increased to $1.5 billion.\n\n“The Chinese government was literally funding a business that they co-owned along with the sons of two of America’s most powerful decision makers,” writes Schweizer in Secret Empires.\n\nNeither Joe Biden or John Kerry have yet to comment on how the son of a sitting vice president and the stepson of a Secretary of State were permitted to bag a billion-dollar deal with the Communist Chinese government—nor whether they had any knowledge or involvement in the deal.\n\nSecret Empires is slated to hit bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, March  More Stories About:\n\t\tBig Government, Cronyism, National Security, Bank of China, Bohai Capital, Bohai Harvest RST, China, Chris Heinz, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, John Kerry, Peter Schweizer, Rosemont, Secret Empires",

Pollak20 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t20 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t20 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe city council of Los Alamitos, California, in Orange County voted 4-1 Monday night for an ordinance to defy the state’s new “sanctuary state” law, and to assist federal law enforcement in stopping illegal immigration.\nAs Breitbart News reported Sunday, the city took on SB 54, the so-called “California Values Act,” which constrains state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice is challenging SB 54 as one of three “sanctuary state” laws that, it claims, violate the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.\n\nMembers of the city council were concerned that SB 54 required them to violate their oaths of office, which require them to uphold and defend the Constitution. Although legal experts say that there is a chance SB 54 will survive in the courts — since unlike the other two law it merely requires state and local government not to assist federal law enforcement, while the other two laws interfere with federal authority — city council members were still concerned,\n\nThe Orange County Register notes that the city council debate on Monday evening was intense on both sides:\n\nWhile the crowd had dwindled both in and outside the chamber when the vote came, people erupted in cheers after the vote and began chanting “USA.” But on the pro-immigrant rights side, there was this chant: “The people united, will never be divided.”\n\nSomeone shouted out to Councilman Warren Kusumoto, who introduced the legislation, “great American patriot!” while someone else screamed out “America first.”\n\n…\n\nThroughout the night, many in the crowd of more than 150 people from Los Alamitos, Long Beach and other communities engaged in heated debate – sometimes in front of the dais, other times with each  reported that Kusumoto was particularly concerned that SB 54 would require him to disobey the Constitution: “California legislators are bulling local elected officials into violating our oath of office,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council also voted to direct the city attorney of Los Alamitos — the county’s second-smallest city — to prepare an amicus brief on the side of the Department of Justice in its case against the State of California.\n\nJoel B.

Considering the fact that so few legislators in Florida met with us and they want the people to forget, that’s disgusting. The fact that they want people to forget about this and elect them again as the child murderers they are, that’s unacceptable and we’re not going to let that happen.”\n\nTo date, state-level gun control proposals include “tougher background checks,” a bump stock ban, a waiting period for long gun purchases, raising minimum age for rifle purchases to 21-years old, and gun confiscation orders similar to California’s Gun Violence Restraining Orders. All of these gun controls were proposed last week by Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and not a single one of them would have prevented the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nProposed gun controls at the federal level include proposals similar to Gov. Scott’s, plus an “assault weapons” ban and “universal background checks.” Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) is a leading voice for these gun controls, even though neither one would have prevented the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. (The “assault weapons” ban would not have prevented the shooting because such a ban, if fashioned like the 1994-2004 ban, does not actually ban certain guns. Rather, it bans cosmetic features. And universal background checks would be impotent because the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, passed a background check for the rifle he used on February 14.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one change that could make an immediate difference in school safety would be to arm teachers as Utah did over 15 years ago, and as is currently being done in school districts in Colorado, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and other states. But David Hogg, Gov. Scott, and Rep. Deutch all oppose arming teachers for school safety.\n\nGov. Scott said we should rely on law enforcement, Deutch said talk of arming teachers is a “distraction,” and Hogg said money that would be used to arm teachers should instead be put into S.T.E.M. studies so teachers “can do more cool stuff and we’ll be able to create jobs in renewable, clean and independent American energy like wind and solar.”\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Tom Suozzi (D-NY) reportedly took time during a Huntington, New York, speech to suggest that people should take up arms against President Trump.\nRoll Call reports the Suozzi talked of putting pressure on Trump, saying, “This is where the Second Amendment comes in, quite frankly. Because you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts? What would you do? What would we do?”\n\nAn audience member responded by asking the essence of the Second Amendment and Suozzi said, “The Second Amendment is the right to bear arms.”\n\nAccording to the New York Post, nervousness was evident among attendees. National Republican Campaign Committee spokesman Chris Martin said, “This video is incredibly disturbing. It’s surreal to watch a sitting member of Congress suggest that his constituents should take up arms against the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Suozzi campaign responded to the criticism by rejecting claims that he was suggesting “armed insurrection.” At the same time, they forwarded a statement from Thomas Jefferson, which said, “What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance.

Gov. Casey Cagle (R) responded to Delta’s decision to sever ties with NRA by announcing he will work to ensure the airline gets no tax breaks unless their political boycott ends.\nOn February 24, Breitbart News reported that over a dozen companies had cut ties with NRA in the wake of an anti-Second Amendment campaign targeting companies that gave discounts and other perks to NRA members. Delta Airlines was one of the companies that announced they were ending their relationship with the NRA:\n\n\nDelta is reaching out to the NRA to let them know we will be ending their contract for discounted rates through our group travel program. We will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website.\n\n— Delta (@Delta) February 24, 2018\n\nOn February 26, Lt. Gov. Cagle responded by making clear there would be no tax cuts for Delta until they ended their political boycott of the NRA:\n\n\nI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA.  Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\n\n— Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018\n\nCagle’s message to Delta came two days after he made clear that “discriminating against law-abiding gun owners will not solve the problem” we face in attacks like the one on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nCagle tweeted:\n\nI’m a lifetime member  of the NRA and a strong supporter of law abiding citizens’ Second Amendment rights. Like all Americans, I’m horrified by the mass shootings we’ve witnessed. If corporate America wants to make a positive difference on gun violence, it should donate a portion of its profits to mental health treatments and school safety initiatives. They should put their money where their mouth is instead of engaging in viewpoint discrimination against conservatives and law-abiding gun owners.\n\nUnited Airlines, Budget, Alamo Rent a Car, First National Bank of Omaha, Hertz, Metlife, and Best Western are among the other companies that caved to the anti-Second Amendment PR campaign as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The results shed a new perspective on the media-hyped “blue wave” stories from the weeks leading up to election day.\nIn the Republican Primary of 2018, Senator Cruz received 1,317,450 votes in a race with four challengers. His Democrat opponent, U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke only received 641,311 votes against two opponents.\n\nFigures from the Secretary of State’s office show that just over one million voters turned out in the Democratic Primary in general across Texas. Cruz alone exceeded the entire Democratic voter turnout by nearly 300,000 votes.\n\nLast week, Texas Secretary of State Spokesman Sam Tayler told Breitbart Texas that in normal gubernatorial primary elections, about 10 percent of registered voters turn out in the Republican primary and five percent in the Democratic primary. At that time, he predicted, based on early voting numbers, that Democrats would match the Republican’s 10 percent turnout. Instead, Democrats fell short on election day. Republican voters slightly exceeded their normal voter turnout with about 11 percent of registered voters coming to their polls. Democrats also raised their turnout, but only to 6.8 percent arrived.\n\nThe race for Texas Governor yielded similar numbers. Governor Greg Abbott received 1,392,294 votes in a field of three candidates while the Democrats split among nine. Just over one million voters cast their ballots in the Democratic gubernatorial race. Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez received 436,658 votes while her main opponent, Houston businessman Andrew White received 278,702 votes. The two Democrats will face off in a May 22 runoff.\n\nIn the leadup to election day, media outlets hyped the early voting turnout numbers as a harbinger of doom for Texas Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN asked in a headline, “Can a Blue Wave Take Down Ted Cruz in Texas?” Fourteen hours later, the network answered it’s own question. “Democrat Turnout Could Signal a Blue Wave in November — But Not in Texas,” the new headline stated.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News also questioned the legitimacy of the Texas blue wave. The newspaper asked in a headline, “Breaking Down the Texas Primaries: How Real is the Democrats’ Blue Wave?”\n\nThere is still cause for concern for Texas Republicans. Democrats increased their gubernatorial election year turnout by nearly 40 percent over 2014 numbers. This added nearly 300,000 Democratic voters to their database which will be used for efforts to turn out voters in November.\n\nIn Harris County, Democrat voters exceeded the number of Republican voters as the state’s largest county continues its trend from purple to blue.\n\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

James Chao, McConnell’s father-in-law, founded Foremost Group, a shipping company that has done “large volumes of business” with Chinese state-owned companies. McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, is the current secretary of transportation.\n\n“So Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, his wife Elaine Chao, who’s the transportation secretary in the Trump administration, her family has deep economic and financial ties to the Chinese government itself,” said Schweizer. “They are in the shipping business, and they own something called the Foremost Group, and really, in 1993, Mitch McConnell, as a senator, travels to China with his father-in-law, James Chao, as guests of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation.”\n\nHe continued, “The China State Shipbuilding Corporation is the largest defense contractor in China, and the projections are that by 2030, if current trends continue, they are going to surpass the U.S. Navy as far as naval capability. Basically, what happens is, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation says to the Chao family, ‘Look, we will build your ships. We will finance the purchase of some of your ships. We will provide crews for your ships. We will provide contracts for you to ship state-owned goods from state-owned companies around the Pacific. In other words, we are going to set you up in the shipping business,’ which is exactly what they do, and, in fact, James Chao — this would be Elaine Chao’s father, Mitch McConnell’s father-in-law — and Elaine’s sister, Angela Chao, actually joined the board, in 2007 and 2008, of something called China State Shipbuilding Corporation, CSSC Holdings, which is a subsidiary of the largest defense contractor in China. So you have this powerful American political family that is making U.S. policy related to China, related to trade, and other critical issues that is highly dependent upon the good graces of the Chinese government.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchweizer framed McConnell’s “increasingly soft” political positioning towards China as a function of his familial and financial ties to the Chinese state.\n\n“McConnell himself has benefited because a few years ago, James Chao gave Mitch McConnell a gift between five and twenty-five million dollars that more than quadrupled his net worth overnight,” noted Schweizer. “So this is not just about Elaine Chao’s family getting wealthy. That wealth has now trickled into Mitch McConnell’s pocket, as well, and it’s a huge problem because if you chart the positions that Sen. McConnell has taken on China over the last twenty years, guess what? Shock of all shocks, he has become increasingly soft as it relates to China, and I think it is directly related to the fact that he knows his family’s financial future is tied to the good graces and good faith of the Chinese communist government.”\n\nSchweizer described the Chinese government as “freaked out” over the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, owing to the 45th president’s decades-long view of the “rising threat of China.”\n\n“So the election of Donald Trump, there’s no other way to say it, it completely freaked out the Chinese government because Trump has really been focused — whether one agrees with him on trade policy or not — he has focused since the 1980s on what he regards as a rising threat of China; whether it relates to trade, economics, or military power,” surmised Schweizer. \n\nAccording to Schweizer, China’s decision to appoint McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, to the Bank of China’s board of directors — ten days after 2016’s presidential election — was a response to the election of Trump to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n“So when [Donald Trump] gets elected in 2016, China is in a panic. So one of the things that happens is, they appoint, really, the first American, or only the second foreigner to the Bank of China,” Schweizer said. “Now, the Bank of China is government-run, government-controlled, is sort of the backbone of the Chinese government’s economic diplomacy around the world. Ten days after Donald Trump is elected, they put Elaine Chao’s sister — Mitch McConnell’s sister-in-law — on the board of directors of the fourth largest bank in the world, which is run by the Chinese communist government. It’s a shocking development, and, again, unprecedented in American history that you would have senior political leaders have immediate family members that are sitting on the board of foreign government-owned businesses.”\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

    "body": "Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the new book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, joined SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight on Monday to detail the involvement of Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden’s second son, in a China-backed private equity firm’s investment in a Chinese atomic energy company indicted for “nuclear power conspiracy against the United States.”\nIn an interview with Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Schweizer highlighted the financial relationship between Hunter Biden and the Chinese state — including a $1.5 billion deal establishing a private equity firm — as an illustration of what he dubbed “the new corruption.” He further explained how foreign governments purchase political influence through “sweetheart deals” with the children of politicians. \n\nMansour asked Schweizer to explain the term “princelings” and its application to the children of high-level politicians. “All of [your] books basically show that corruption is like a game of Whack-a-Mole. You knock it down in one area, and then these corrupt politicians find another avenue for graft, and I’m looking at Secret Empires, and there’s another avenue for graft. I want you to explain to us this concept of ‘the princelings.’ This is something you describe in this book. Tell us what that is.”\n\n\n\nSchweizer explained how political favoritism is procured by foreign governments via business dealings with the children of high-level U.S. politicians.\n\n“Well, Rebecca, you’re exactly right about corruption,” replied Schweizer. “When you have the motive of greed and when you don’t worry too much about ethics, it’s very easy to come up with creative ways to enrich yourself, and one of those is what we call ‘American princelings.’ The term ‘princelings’ is really a term that’s been widely used in China and in the West to talk about China, where in communist China, if you want to get deals done, if you want to get favors from the government, you basically do business with their children, and these children of communist party officials are called the princelings.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchweizer continued, “One of the things I argue in the book is that we are, in a sense, importing that model into the United States, and you see that a lot as it relates to the Chinese government. The Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they’ll get better policy positions from our government, and the history indicates in the Obama administration that that’s exactly what happens.”\n\nAs an example of American princelings, Schweizer pointed to the Chinese government’s provision of $1.5 billion in funding for Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), a private equity firm upon whose board Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, sits.\n\n“In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China,” said Schweizer. “To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.”\n\nElaborating, Schweizer said, “Well, I think the reason he goes soft on China is because with him on that trip, flying on Air Force Two, is his son Hunter Biden, and ten days after they return from China, Hunter Biden — who has this small firm, he has no background in private equity, he has no background in Chinese finance — gets a whopping $1.5 billion deal from the Chinese government. This is the Chinese government giving Joe Biden and a [John] Kerry confidante the management over this money, and they made huge fees off of this money, and it’s an example of this kind of corruption. That’s the first of three major deals that the Chinese government does with people who are either the children — that is the sons — or close aides to Vice President Biden or Secretary of State John Kerry.”\n\nSchweizer discussed national security implications related to modern corruption, highlighting the acquisition of Henniges Automotive —  a formerly America-based company developing “dual-use” technologies with military applications — by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-run military contractor. AVIC acquired Henniges in 2017 with a 51 percent stake purchase. The remaining 49 percent was purchased by the Biden- and-Kerry-linked BHR.\n\n\n\n\n\n“So [Hunter Biden and Devon Archer] get this $1.5 billion to invest, and what they are supposed to do is basically invest in companies that benefit the Chinese government,” stated Schweizer. “So just think about this for a second. This is the vice president of the United States whose father is supposed to be commanding American presence and power in the Pacific to deal with the rising challenge from China, and his son is investing $1.5 billion of Chinese government money. So what do they do? They invest in an American high-precision tools company called Henniges, which used to be owned by Rocket Company, but they produce anti-vibration technologies which have a dual-use application, so this transaction actually requires the approval of the federal government, as it has national security implications. So again, the vice president’s son is helping the Chinese government take over a dual-use military technology-related company called Henniges.”\n\nBHR also invested in a Chinese state-run atomic energy company indicted by the Department of Justice in crimes related to stealing nuclear secrets, Schweizer said.\n\n“But it gets even worse because another investment that they make is in something called CGN — China General Nuclear — which is an atomic power company,” recalled Schweizer. “They invest in this company in 2014. A year later, what happens? The FBI arrests and charges senior officials in this company with stealing nuclear secrets in the United States. Specifically, they’re trying to get access to something called the AP-1000 nuclear reactor that is very similar to the ones that we put on U.S. submarines. So again, you have the son of the vice president, a close aide to the secretary of state who are investing in a company that is trying to steal nuclear secrets in the United States. It’s a stunning story, and here’s the thing: none of this is required to be disclosed because they’ve figured out a way to get around these disclosure laws.”\n\nSchweizer noted the lack of public disclosure regulations regarding the financial relationships of politicians’ family members with foreign governments.\n\n“It’s remarkable,” exclaimed Schweizer. “Think about this. Think about it in Joe Biden’s case. If Joe Biden gets a $1,500 gift or he gets a $1,500 donation for his campaign, he has to disclose it. If his wife gets a $1,500 gift, she has to disclose it. But if his son gets a $1.5 billion private equity deal from the Chinese government, there’s no requirement to disclose it. It’s outrageous, and it’s an example of how they try to work around these disclosure rules.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchweizer emphasized Hunter Biden’s lack of a background in the private equity business, casting his status as the son of a vice president as a golden ticket for Chinese state funds.\n\n“Here’s the thing people have to keep in mind: Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese government,” Schweizer said. “He has no background in private equity. He was a lobbyist before his father became vice president for the casino industry. He has no background. He has no business getting a deal like this. He got this deal, pure and simple, because he is the son of a vice president, and the Chinese said, ‘We give him this deal, and his pal, who’s a former aide to John Kerry, they’re going to run it, and by doing so, we are going to curry favor with these guys,’ and you know what? Based on the track record, based on the response of the Obama administration of Secretary of State John Kerry and of Vice President Biden, that’s exactly what they got. They got good action for their money.”\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.  Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

Some of the ill-gotten funds later found their way into the Obama Foundation.\nBreitbart News Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour asked Schweizer to explain Obama’s “smash and grab” policy. “Tell us about this thing with Obama because I’m looking at all the characters on your cover here of your book. … Tell us about Obama and his best friend and what they did.”\n\nSchweizer spoke of Martin Nesbitt — whom he described as Obama’s “best friend” — monetizing his knowledge of Obama’s regulatory plans.\n\n“This one was really surprising because, I have to say, I did not think of Barack Obama as somebody who was necessarily involved in financial corruption,” replied Schweizer. “I mean, there are all these controversies or certain issues about his policies, but Barack Obama has this best friend that few people have ever heard of, a guy named Marty Nesbitt. When Barack Obama is reelected in 2012, his best friend in the world, Marty Nesbitt, sets up this private equity fund called Vistria, and Vistria says in its corporate documents, explicitly, that it is designed to invest in highly regulated industries, and when your best friend is the regulator-in-chief, I guess that makes sense, and what happens is, they make a series of investments or deals based on companies or industries that are being smashed by the Obama administration’s regulations.”\n\nSchweizer pointed to the acquisition of the University of Phoenix by Vistria Group — the private equity firm run by Nesbitt that he co-founded in 2013 — as an illustration of Obama’s “smash and grab” strategy.\n\n“So to give you one brief example, [the] University of Phoenix, it’s a for-profit school — a lot of people have heard of it — the Obama administration declares that the company is not serving students well, and they say, ‘We are going to suspend GI dollars from the Pentagon for soldiers to study at the University of Phoenix,'” explained Schweizer. \n\n\n\n\n\n“Well, you can imagine, this for-profit university, its stock price goes from like a hundred dollars a share down to three dollars a share overnight. So what happens? Marty Nesbitt, Barack Obama’s best friend, says, ‘Hey! We’ll step in and buy it. We’ll step in and buy the company.’ They do. They basically buy it for three cents on the dollar, and then, lo and behold, imagine what happens next. The Obama administration decides that, ‘No, we are going to allow GI dollars flow to the University of Phoenix,’ thereby boosting the valuation of the company again.”\n\nSchweizer described Obama’s “smash and grab” strategy as repeatedly used across Obama’s presidential tenure, with beneficiaries such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. He further noted that such ill-gotten funds partly find their way into the Obama Foundation via Nesbitt’s financing.\n\n“This pattern is repeated over and over and over again, not just with Marty Nesbitt, but with people like the environmentalist investor Tom Steyer [and] George Soros,” Schweizer said. “Barack Obama smashes coal companies, [and] what do these guys do? They go in, they buy them for pennies on the dollar, and when the regulatory weight is lifted, their valuations increase, and they make a lot of money, and you see that pattern in all of these industries. So what you see is these crusades that Obama is going on related to companies that are supposedly doing all these evil things really has this profit or money-making component to it that I was unaware of, and a lot of other people were unaware of. Now, in a sense, the favor gets returned because Marty Nesbitt is now the chairman of the Obama Foundation and is pouring money into that institution and is responsible for raising it so Barack Obama’s legacy can be applauded in Chicago.”\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.  Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

    "body": "Tuesday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said it would be an impeachable offense if President Donald Trump were to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.\nHEWITT: I’m joined now by United States Senator Lindsey Graham, who I’m sure is following this story as everyone else is. That’s very alarming, Senator, the spread of IED technology just makes you wonder how long it was going to take to come to the United States.\n\nGRAHAM: Yeah, I’m afraid it’s gotten here, and we’ll see when we catch this guy or gal.\n\nHEWITT: Okay, now let me ask you, back in the day, a long time, ago, 1998, you were one of the 13 impeachment managers named by the House to press the case against Bill Clinton. So this is going way back. So I have a very simple question. If the President fired Robert Mueller, do you think that would be an impeachable offense?\n\nGRAHAM: Probably so, if he did it without cause, yeah.\n\nHEWITT: Now Angus King said no last hour. Why do you think it would be?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I think what the President will have done is stopped an investigation in whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign. I can’t see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\n\nHEWITT: You see, I am in agreement with you that an impeachable offense is anything that the Congress says it is, regardless of what scholars might say. And I believe the Congress would say that if it were run by Democrats. Do you think a Republican-led House would impeach the President?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, that’s a good point. Let’s say that Obama fired somebody. I think we’d all have a different view on the Republican side. A high crime and misdemeanor in the Constitution is a fairly vague term. But what is at the essence of impeachment is a check and balance on a President, right?\n\nHEWITT: Yes.\n\nGRAHAM: …who’s gotten out of their lane, who changed the rule of law and basically turns it upside down. I can’t think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president’s campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government, what kind of crimes may have been committed. I’ve seen no evidence of collusion, but to stop investigation without cause, I think, would be a Constitutional crisis.\n\nHEWITT: Have you told him that specifically, Senator Graham, so that he hears it from Republicans, do not fire Bob Mueller?\n\nGRAHAM: I think I just, I think I just did.\n\nHEWITT: Okay.\n\nGRAHAM: Yeah, so here’s the bottom line. The FBI’s handling of the dossier was really unprofessional, inappropriate. The Clinton email investigation was a joke. McCabe probably deserves to be fired, but I can’t say until I look at all the evidence. Maybe so, maybe not. so the President’s right to be upset with the Department of Justice being overly political. He would be wrong, in my view, to try to stop this investigation without cause on the Mueller side. They’re disconnected in time. Mueller came along long after this. He’s looking at things unrelated to the dossier. And we’re a rule of law nation. And it goes for both parties.\n\nHEWITT: Now Secretary Clinton said on this show you can hold two thoughts. And I’ve always repeated that. We can hold the thought that the Special Counsel ought to be left alone, and at the same time, hold the thought that the FISA warrant was badly abused and that we need a second Special Counsel for that.\n\nGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHEWITT: People tend to think you have to be one or the other, but you can actually believe both, right?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I do believe both. Weeks ago, I called for a second special counsel. Why? This is not in Mueller’s lane. So Mueller’s looking forward and what the Russians did to our election, if there was any collusion between the Trump organization, were there any crimes committed. Somebody needs to look at the Department of Justice’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the abuse of the FISA warrant process. Why not DOJ? They can’t grade their own homework. Somebody outside the system needs to take a fresh look. Why not the inspector general? The inspector general doesn’t have the institutional tools to investigate this matter. If you don’t work at the Department of Justice, he has no power to interview you. So you need a second counsel to look at how the FBI agents behaved when it came to the Clinton email scandal. Was the fix it? When they had an insurance policy, they were talking about taking an insurance policy out.\n\nHEWITT: 100 percent agree.\n\nGRAHAM: And they talked about leaving Andy’s office. Was that McCabe’s office? So we need to look at that.",

Rick Scott (R) last week.\nThe Orlando Sentinel reports that “four firearms and 267 rounds of ammunition” were taken from the man, and he was “taken to a hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment.”\n\nThe seized firearms were listed as “a Ruger LCP .380 pistol, an M2 Mauser .45 pistol, a Charter Arms .357 mag snub nose revolver and a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun.”\n\nThe paper notes that “the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under … new legislation — which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward’s Chief Judge Jack Tuter.”\n\nThe confiscatory order also bars the man from making new firearm or ammunition purchases.\n\nOn March 9, Breitbart News reported that Gov. Scott signed a $400 million gun bill that includes orders which allows a family member or law enforcement to petition a judge to order the seizure of an individual’s firearms. The bill also put waiting periods in place for long gun purchases, raised the minimum purchase age for long gun purchases (from 18 to 21), and banned bump stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the confiscatory order that resulted in the seizure of the Lighthouse Point resident’s firearms, Mayor Glenn Troast said, “This is not about the Second Amendment and it’s not about the NRA. We need commonsense gun laws and this is a commonsense gun law that gives police officers new tools they need to help us protect our community.”\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

We’ve looked at some 300,000 documents, 73 interviews that we’ve done across the course of this thing, trying to answer the four questions that were originally set out for the committee to answer,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Yes, the Russians tried to interfere with our election process. Yes, they had cyberattacks, active measures going on. We could find no evidence of collusion between either campaign and the Russians,” he added.\n\nThe draft report contains more than 40 initial findings, which encompass Russian attacks on European allies, Russian cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions and their use of social media to sow discord, and the “lackluster pre-election response to Russian active measures.”\n\nThe report will also concur with the Intelligence Community Assessment’s judgments that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, but disagree with the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin preferred Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.\n\nSome Russian social media efforts appeared to promote events in support of Clinton, according to indictments issued by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe committee will continue its investigations into the unmasking of Americans’ names in intelligence reports, as well as abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other matters, the summary said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also continue to investigate how the Trump dossier “made its way from Russian sources to the Clinton campaign,” as well as “problematic contacts” between senior Intelligence Community officials and the media.\n\nShortly before the summary was released, investigative journalist Sara Carter reported that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper allegedly leaked to CNN early last year that President-Elect Donald Trump and President Obama received a classified briefing on the dossier.",

    "body": "“Everything they’re accusing Trump of … Obama had done,” said Lee Smith of “Trump-Russia collusion” narratives pushed by Democrats and their news media allies.\nSmith, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, joined SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight for a Thursday interview with Breitbart News’s Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak to discuss his latest article, “The Media Stopped Reporting the Russia Collusion Story Because They Helped Create It.”\nSmith highlighted the Washington Post’s Anne Applebaum, the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, and the New Yorker’s David Remnick as hypocritical news media figures in their criticisms of the Trump administration’s supposed appeasement of Russia and Vladimir Putin after ignoring actual appeasement of Russia and Vladimir Putin across eight years of the Obama administration.\nOn March 26, 2012, then-President Barack Obama told then-Russian President Dmitri Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” in shaping U.S. foreign policy toward Russia after that year’s presidential election:\nVIDEO\n“Big-name” and “respected’  journalists like Applebaum, Goldberg, and Remnick “enlisted their bylines in a political campaign on behalf of the Democratic candidate for president,” wrote Smith. In so doing, the trio of left-wing Democrat news media figures “rehearsed the talking points [Christopher Steele] later documented.”\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller’s ostensible investigation into the “Russian government’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election” is predicated on lies within the “Christopher Steele dossier,” said Smith: “The Mueller investigation is premised on the Steele dossier. It’s premised on nonsense.”\n\n\n\n\nSteele’s allegations – paid for by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee – were central to the procurement of surveillance warrants via the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) for Trump campaign operatives Carter Page and George Papadopoulos (FISC) at the request of Justice Department and FBI officials during the Obama administration.\n“It’s insane. … She’s describing some scenario that’s out of a B movie about all these conspiracies taking place,” said Smith of Applebaum’s 2016 warning that Russia would determine the outcome of the year’s presidential election. \nIn her September 8, 2016, article entitled “How Russia could spark a U.S. electoral disaster,” Applebaum warned that “Russian hackers will seek to break into the U.S. voting system [and] attempt to throw the election.” She further claimed the Russian state “might try to get Trump elected,” or even Clinton.” Alternatively — and this would, of course, be even more devastating — [Russia] might try to rig the election for Clinton, perhaps leaving a trail of evidence designed to connect the rigging operation to Clinton’s campaign.”\nAt the time, Pollak described Applebaum’s warning as a “bizarre conspiracy theory.”\nApplebaum is regularly featured across television news media outlets as a non-ideological and non-partisan expert of international affairs, with a focus on Europe and Russia.\n\n\n\n\nLeft-wing and Democrat-aligned news media outlets succeeded in their desire to prompt a federal investigation of Donald Trump and his presidential campaign to diffuse the public’s attention toward the ostensible investigation of Hillary Clinton’s felonious mishandling of classified information and evasion of record-keeping laws, said Smith.\n“Journalists were participating in a political campaign,” said Smith. “Hillary had an investigation, so the idea was, ‘Well, let’s stick Trump with an investigation, too.’ And that’s what they got. They got an investigation of the Trump campaign, which was insane enough.”\nThe fraudulent investigation of the Trump campaign then morphed into an attempt to nullify the outcome of 2016’s presidential election, said Smith.\n“After the election, it turned into something even worse,” said Smith. “It turned into an attack, not just on the president. … The purpose was to delegitimize the political choice that American voters made in electing the person that they wanted to be president. It’s an absolutely obscene campaign that the press waged. First, it was against Trump. Then, it was against the American public.”\nSteele had utilized an “echo chamber” strategy among left-wing and partisan news media allies to push the “Trump-Russia collusion” narrative upon the American electorate, wrote Smith: “Much of the Russiagate campaign was conducted in this circular manner. Steele and Simpson built an echo chamber with their opposition research, parts of the law enforcement and intelligence communities, and the press all reinforcing one another.”\n\n\n\n\nThe news media are broadly avoiding the “falling apart” of Mueller’s ostensible investigation given their central role in its genesis, said Smith.\n“Everything they’re accusing Trump of leaning toward, the Obama administration has done,” said Smith. “In Ukraine, in Syria. Whether or not you agree with Obama’s policy — I did not — but whether or not you agree with it, the fact is this is what the Obama administration did. All of a sudden, for the same people, like David Remnick, like Jeffrey Goldberg, who were speaking with President Obama extensively [and] repeatedly, for them to somehow ignore that this is what Obama had done and that suddenly, Trump was this insane outlier, that this had never happened before, that, in itself, was a huge tell.”\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\nLISTEN:",

    "body": "NORTH WAZIRISTAN, PAKISTAN — Pakistan is building a border wall with Afghanistan, after decades of unsuccessfully controlling the flow of terrorists and criminals who quietly slip back and forth across the porous 1,500-mile border between the two countries, evading capture.\nThe wall is not concrete, but consists of a comprehensive border system that includes two layers of 12-feet-tall barbed-wire fencing, surveillance cameras, solar lights, an intrusion detection system, and hundreds of manned forts and thousands of observation posts. It is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019.\n\nLast week, Breitbart News and two other news outlets were escorted by the Pakistan military into the country’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to one observation post along the border near the Pakistani village of Miran Shah and just about 30 miles from Khost, Afghanistan – once considered a terrorist hotbed.\n\nThere, shiny double-layered fencing could be seen zigzagging the hilly terrain for miles between observation posts, spaced three to five kilometers apart. They are currently being manned by the Pakistan Army Frontier Corps.\n\n\n\nPakistan’s top military officer, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, conceived of the idea when he took command in November 2016 as Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff. Construction began last June.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Pakistan military’s top spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, it has “phenomenally reduced the unchecked border crossings.”\n\nThe fence is being constructed at a critical time between U.S. and Pakistan relations.\n\nPakistan has come under increasing pressure from the U.S. to stop militants in Afghanistan from seeking safe haven in Pakistan. Last year, the U.S. sent an additional 4,000 forces to Afghanistan and in January, the Trump administration announced the cutting of security assistance to Pakistan.\n\nThroughout the 17-year-war, militants have launched attacks against U.S. and Afghan forces in Afghanistan, then melted into the mountainous terrain of the FATA, a semi-autonomous tribal region that makes up roughly a third of Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan.\n\nFormer head of Al Qaeda, now deceased Osama Bin Laden, evaded ten years of capture after masterminding the 9/11 attacks from the border region and then slipping quietly into Pakistan, where he lived in a compound in Abbottabad, about 75 miles north of the capitol of Islamabad.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Pakistani officials deny knowing he was there, it further soured trust between U.S. and Pakistan and increased American suspicion that Pakistan was playing a double game of pledging help but looking the other way on terrorists.\n\nAt the behest of the U.S., Pakistan has cracked down on terrorists in this region, but with uneven success, facing heavy backlash from terrorists. On December 26, 2014, Tehrik-i-Taliban militants — commonly referred to as the “Pakistan Taliban” — struck an Army-run public school in northwest Pakistan, killing 132 children.\n\nIn 2014, the Pakistan Army launched its largest counterterrorism operation to date, dubbed Operation Zarb-e-Azb. In the FATA, that has meant some villages like Miran Shah have been almost completely leveled, in order to root out tunnels terrorists used to hide and store caches of weapons. The city is in the process of being rebuilt and renovated.\n\n\n\nSince the operation began in 2014, the security situation has improved, and Pakistani leaders are eager to capitalize on that success — by building the fence, cracking down on terrorists, and urging an end to the war next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan officials see hope in peace talks. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently offered peace talks to the Taliban, who have expressed some interest but are reluctant to enter into talks unless the U.S. is directly involved.\n\nThe U.S. has so far declined direct talks with the Taliban, urging an Afghan government-led process. Pakistani officials are imploring Americans to enter talks or consider restarting the Quadrilateral Coordination Group, which involved the U.S., Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis also expressed support for political reconciliation during an unannounced visit to Afghanistan this week, but he reiterated the U.S. position that the talks would be Afghan-led and not directly with the Taliban.\n\nStill, Pakistani officials are hopeful that Ghani’s offer is a turning point, and Pakistan can emerge from the specter of terrorism plaguing their country. They say more than 80,000 Pakistanis have been killed by terrorism.\n\nFor Pakistan, the wall is a symbol that enough is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistani officials say previous efforts to control the border have not been easy, for several reasons.\n\nFor one, the border, drawn by the British in 1896, cut across tribes and families. For example, Miran Shah is divided into three sub-divisions, which are divided into 15 sub-tribes, some of which span both sides of the border.\n\n“Many of the sub-tribes live close to the border, but also across the border,” said Pakistan Army Brigadier-General Jawad, commander of forces in Miran Shah.\n\nPakistani officials say locals have exploited easement rights that were granted after the border was drawn, and admit they have been lenient on them.\n\nAnother challenge has been the complexity of the terrain, which includes vast stretches of mountain ranges, some as high as 11,500 feet. Patrolling the mountains is a costly endeavor, and the Pakistan Army is split between its border with Afghanistan and its border with India, particularly in the Kashmir region.\n\n\n\nAnother difficulty has been the lack of cooperation — and capacity — from Afghan officials. Afghanistan does not formally accept the border, and has resisted any formal demarcation.\n\n“There is no corresponding border management on the other side,” said Pakistan Army Maj. Gen. Nadeem Anjum, inspector general of the Frontier Corps in Balochistan. “It is almost unilaterally managed.”\n\nPakistan is planning to build seven times more observation posts than Afghanistan along the border. Officials say the posts on the Afghan side will be clustered together, leaving large gaps in between.\n\nThen there is the sheer enormity of the border crossings.\n\nAt the Chaman border gate in Baluchistan, just south of the FATA, a minimum of 20,000 people and 300 to 400 trucks cross per day. And Chaman is just the second busiest border crossing.\n\nThere, Pakistani officials say Afghans seeking entry into Pakistan will often present border guards with only a handwritten note from an unknown tribal elder. There is also no system for checking the hundreds of trucks that cross the border.\n\n\n\nGiven the many challenges, Pakistan officials have decided to build a fence. It is not clear whether they were inspired by President Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall, but a number of Pakistani officials pointed to the U.S.’s difficulty in controlling its border with Mexico.\n\n“So please understand our predicament,” Ghafoor said.\n\nAsked what would happen if a militant drove an armored military vehicle into the fencing, he replied, “There is no obstacle that is non-negotiable.” But, he added, “It’s an effort to discourage them.”\n\nMaj. Gen. Anjum said there have been attempts in Baluchistan to breach the fencing, but they have been “unsuccessful.”\n\nThe border system will cost Pakistan more than $500 million to build.\n\nPakistan is also trying to implement a passport and identification card regime by the end of this year. A visa office is planned near Chaman Gate, so that Pakistanis do not have to travel to the capital of Islamabad to obtain a visa.\n\nBut in the meantime, the fence will continue being built.\n\n“Fence it. Then manage it,” said Anjum. “It’s the simplest solution in the history of the world.”",

    "body": "The 2018 omnibus budget provides funds to build just 33 miles of new border fence in Texas and denies any funds for President Donald Trump’s preferred border walls.\nPro-immigration Democrats emphasized their funding and symbolic victory over Trump’s populist agenda by directing the business-first GOP leadership to also include a prohibition in the omnibus bill barring the prototype walls which Trump showcased this month:\n\nThe amounts designated in subsection (a)(2) through (a)(4) shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, (Public Law 115–31), such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\n\nThe $641 million allocated for new fences is only 0.05 percent of the $1.3 trillion spending bill, or just 5 cents in a $100 bill.\n\nEven though GOP leaders face a tough election in November, they first negotiated the deal and then blamed the President for the shortfall and the Democrats’ political win, according to a report in the Washington Post. In the meeting with Trump — who has the constitutional power to veto the legislation — the Hill leaders:\n\nall made their pitch to Trump in support of the spending agreement … They argued that he was getting money for the border wall at a level the White House had been signaling was acceptable.\n\nRyan, other GOP leaders and their allies, including Marc Short, Trump’s congressional outreach chief, have long opposed Trump’s populist agenda, despite its central role in the 2016 campaign. The business-first Republicans fear Trump’s populist agenda will help short the supply of cheap foreign labor to their business allies, and subsequently drive up Americans’ wages.\n\nGOP leaders say the bill includes money for roughly 100 miles of fencing — but that number includes roughly 77 miles of second- fending or fencing upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill also marks a big success for Democrats who have fought tooth-and-nail against Trump’s signature project and his high-wage/low immigration economic strategy.\n\nThe Democrats’ win means that Trump will be able to extend the existing variety of walls by only 33 miles during his first two years, leaving him 667 miles short of his 700-mile goal. At that rate of progress, Trump will reach his 700-mile goal after 22 years of bitter argument with the pro-migrant D.C. establishment.\n\nDemocrats are trying to hide their glee. “We’re feeling very good about this,” said the Democrats’ Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer. “When it’s unveiled, you will see. We’re not going to get into any more details.”\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats’ House leader, said:\n\nDemocrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law.  The bill does not allow any increase in deportation officers or detention beds.  We are disappointed that we did not reach agreement on Dreamer protections that were worthy of these patriotic young people.\n\nThe Democrats’ win is especially remarkable because Democrats know their pro-migration agenda is unpopular in the midwestern states where vulnerable Democratic incumbents face the votes in November. After the Democrats voted en-bloc to stop Trump’s popular immigration reforms on February 15, Sen. Dick Durbin told National Public Radio that:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some [Democratic Senators], it’s easy. For others, it is painful. It’s dangerous politically. As I went up to their desks – and many of them were up for re-election – I said ‘Thank you,’ and several of them said to me, ‘If this cost me my Senate seat, so be it.’ You know, those are moments you’re proud to be a senator.\n\nFor 2018, Trump had asked for $1.6 billion to build 74 miles of new walls. But GOP’s business-first leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, traded Trump’s border agenda to Democrats in exchange for other favors, such as Democratic acceptance of $78 billion in Pentagon spending.\n\nThe 2018 omnibus provides only $696 million to build 33 miles of new border fencing — while also ensuring that Schumer will get a similar amount of funding to start building a tunnel in his home state of New York.\n\nIn May 2017, Democrats also stopped Trump from getting money for a new border wall in the 2017 omnibus. Trump had asked the GOP majorities in the House and Senate for $1.5 billion, but Democrats ensured he got only $341 million to repair and replace existing border barriers.\n\nThe 2018 bill does also provide $25 million to build 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego, California, and $445 million to replace existing fencing along the border.\n\nThe legislation says:\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC. 230. (a) Of the amount made available in this Act under ‘‘U.S. Customs and Border Protection—Procurement, Construction, and Improvements’’, $1,571,000,000 shall be available only as follows:\n\n(1) $251,000,000 for approximately 14 miles of secondary fencing, all of which provides for cross barrier visual situational awareness, along the southwest border in the San Diego Sector;\n\n(2) $445,000,000 for 25 miles of primary pedestrian levee fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector;\n\n(3) $196,000,000 for primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector;\n\n(4) $445,000,000 for replacement of existing primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border;\n\n(5) $38,000,000 for border barrier planning and design;\n\n…\n\n(b) The amounts designated in subsection (a)(2) through (a)(4) shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, (Public Law 115–31), such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\n\nThe defeat for Trump’s election-winning border reform was welcome by business interests, which favor the northward flow of migrant customers and low-wage workers into the United States.\n\nThe Democrats — aided by cooperative business-first GOP leaders — added additional measures to help the inflow of illegal immigrants.\n\nDemocrats blocked Trump’s request for new authorities to penalize so-called “sanctuary cities” that protect companies’ use of illegal immigrants, including criminals. “It is absolutely insane what the sanctuary cities are doing,” responded Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert told Fox News.\n\nThey basically have said ‘We want the federal money; in fact, we demand the federal money keep flowing, but otherwise, we’re succeeding from the union. We don’t care what they say about the immigration laws. We don’t care what Congress, or the President has said.\n\nThe Democrats also helped illegal immigrants by blocking funding to increase the number of detention beds. That is important because once border officers have filled the available detention beds with illegal immigrants, they are forced to let additional migrants go free into U.S. cities.\n\nIn general, Democrats support illegal immigration because the cheap labor delivers a major economic subsidy to their cheap-labor business supporters in Democratic-dominated towns. The resulting migrant populations also provide a pool of future Democratic voters and activists — plus a steady supply of new Democratic-leaning citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats also rejected Trump’s offer to extend the DACA amnesty for three years for 690,000 illegals in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funding.\n\nTrump’s immigration priorities are very popular — and carried him to his shocking victory in November.\n\nBusiness groups and Democrats tout misleading, industry-funded “Nation of Immigrants” polls which pressure Americans to say they welcome migrants, including the roughly 680,000 ‘DACA’ illegals and the roughly 3.25 million ‘dreamer’ illegals.",

Prager said:\nI was wrong. My opposition to Donald Trump was wrong, in retrospect. I was wrong. I had friends who supported him, and I didn’t understand them. I said, “Are you not aware of what he said about John McCain? Isn’t that enough to disqualify the guy?” They perceived in him what I did not perceive in him, that these over-the-top statements – as objectionable as the statements themselves may be, and none of them defended the statements – nevertheless, what they perceived was accurate: a man who doesn’t give a damn about what the press says about him. That is the only way to govern. It is the only way to advance the principles of conservatism in the United States is to not give a damn.\n“[Donald Trump] is so much better a president than Mitt Romney would’ve made,” said Prager, describing Romney as “tepid” and concerned with appealing to news media outlets such as The New York Times. \nA president’s actions are a more important metric of presidential success than a president’s demeanor, said Prager:\nWould I like Donald Trump to have Mitt Romney’s temperament, or for that matter Barack Obama’s temperament? Yeah. So what? I would like a whole host of things. People are packages. What a president does is more important to me than a president’s demeanor. He is so much better a president than Mitt Romney would’ve made. Mitt Romney would’ve awakened every day to read The New York Times editorial page to see how he’s covered. Mitt Romney gave us Romneycare in Massachusetts. I campaigned for Mitt Romney, he would’ve been a better president [than Barack Obama]. Any Republican is better than any Democrat, that’s just the way it is. Having said that, Romney would’ve been a tepid president. Nothing comparably conservative compared to Donald Trump.\nConcerns with a president’s demeanor should be secondary to broader analyses of a president’s impact, said Prager.\n\n\n\n\n“He has turned out to be a great president with big communication flaws, in the way he tweets and some of the things he says and his temperament,” said Prager. “My temperament is the opposite. I love dignity. I love understatement. Okay, so be it. So what? I’m not sure I’d be as good a president as he. How do you like that? That’s how good he’s been.”\nLISTEN:\n\nIn April of 2017, Prager invited ostensibly conservative NeverTrump news media figures to celebrate Trump’s presidency. “Do conservatives — or non-leftists, for that matter — appreciate just how terrific Donald Trump has been as president?” he asked. “And how lucky we are that he won the presidency?”\n“What I do know is that they ought to be deeply appreciative of him, and deeply grateful for luck or providence, and certainly for Trump himself, that he was elected president,” continued Prager. “First, it is unlikely that any other Republican would have defeated Hillary Clinton. Second, he has not only surpassed many of our expectations but also thus far governed in a manner more consistent with conservative principles than any president since Ronald Reagan, and arguably Calvin Coolidge.”\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.",

Maxine Waters to Condemn Louis Farrakhan’s ‘Leftist Hate Speech’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty/AP Images\n\n\n\t\t\t\tby Dr. Susan Berry16 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t16 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t16 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe head of a coalition of black pastors says Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) must end their “partisan hypocrisy” and denounce “leftist hate speech” such as that proclaimed by anti-Semite and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.\nIn a press release sent to Breitbart News, Rev. William Owens, president of the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP) refers to Farrakhan’s statement in a recent speech: “White folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God’s grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I’m here to say your time is up, your world is through.”\n\nOwens observes Waters was among those present at Farrakhan’s speech.\n\n“Rep. Waters’ refusal to speak out against Farrakhan and other extremist hate speech is the perfect example of the hypocrisy and moral cowardice of the Congressional Black Caucus,” Owens says. “Rep. Waters lives in a multi-million dollar home, a stark contrast to the poor district she represents. She manipulates African American voters for her own gain. And she’s just one of many black leaders who have sold out our  Rev. William Owens (@caapusa) February 15, 2018\n\nIn February, Waters appeared on a BET special program that focused on President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address – though Waters herself did not attend the event as a protest against the president. She said, nevertheless, that Trump is a “racist.”\n\n“One speech cannot and does not make Donald Trump presidential,” she said. “He’s not presidential, and he never will be presidential. He claims that’s bringing people together but make no mistake, he is a dangerous, unprincipled, divisive, and shameful racist.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in January, a photograph of then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Farrakhan taken in 2005 at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus was released after a 13-year cover-up to protect Obama’s political career.\n\nOwens joined civil rights educator Dr. Alveda King and other black leaders in February to publicly rebuke the CBC as a “disgrace” and “traitors” to black Americans. The leaders accused CBC members of engaging in “childish” behavior during the State of the Union address, with their “sulking in their seats, texting, pretending to be disinterested.”\n\n“Without question, the CBC’s foul demeanor has been a just cause to demand either ‘REPRESENT or GO AWAY,’” Owens said at the time. “I make a strong plea to the black community to embrace this position with openness and hear us out; we have been sidelined by traitors in Washington and must engage.”\n\nOwens and his group have launched a petition to hold the CBC accountable to the “values and needs of the African American community.” The petition further says many “so-called ‘civil rights leaders’ have lost touch with the moral values of mainstream African Americans.”\n\n“We’ve watched for years as Democratic politicians offered African Americans platitudes and promises in exchange for political loyalty,” Owens asserts, adding:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Democratic policies reduced our inner cities to crumbling, crime-ridden, economic wastelands. And yet, we are supposed to continue on, not questioning the policies or politicians that brought us to this point? African American voters have had enough of the double standards and hypocrisy. There is a great hunger for moral leadership in this country. If the Congressional Black Caucus does not step up to meet that demand, they will find themselves in need of new jobs.\n\n“Politicians like Maxine Waters need to step up or go home,” Owens says. “We’ve had enough of their partisan games. They’re stooges of a party that enriches them, but does nothing to help the African American community.”",

Pollak7 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSACRAMENTO, California — California Governor Jerry Brown complained Wednesday that the Trump administration “is basically going to war against the state of California” after Attorney General Jeff Sessions filed a lawsuit Tuesday evening against California’s “sanctuary state” laws.\nThe lawsuit targets three laws in particular: the Immigrant Worker Protection Act (HB 450), the Inspection and Review of Facilities Housing Federal Detainees law (AB 103); and the California Values Act (SB 54). The Trump administration argues that California’s laws are unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause, which states that federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”\n\nSessions flew to Sacramento to mark the occasion with a speech Wednesday morning to a meeting of the California Peace Officers Association, which had opposed SB 54. In his address, Sessions compared California’s resistance to federal immigration law to the efforts of the Old South and the Confederacy to resist the Union.\n\n“There is no nullification.  There is no secession.  Federal law is ‘the supreme law of the land.’  I would invite any doubters to Gettysburg, and to the graves of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln,” Sessions said.\n\nIn response, Brown was enraged.\n\n“This is really unprecedented for the chief law enforcement officer of the United States to come out to California and act more like Fox News than a law enforcement officer. This is a political stunt,” he told reporters, as quoted by The Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nIronically, the Obama administration, through Attorney General Eric Holder, challenged an Arizona immigration law on similar grounds to those that Sessions is using to confront California — and prevailed at the Supreme Court.\n\nNevertheless, Brown warned: “This is basically going to war against the state of California, the engine of the American economy. It’s not wise, it’s not right, and it will not stand.”\n\nIn an additional swipe, the governor declared: “We know the Trump administration is full of liars. They’ve pled guilty already to the special counsel.”\n\nU.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who represents the “sanctuary city” of San Francisco, chimed in as well, accusing the Trump administration of “brazen aggression and intimidation tactics.”\n\n\nThe people of California will not be bowed by the Trump Administration's brazen aggression and intimidation tactics. We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities. #ProtectDREAMers\n\n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) March 7, 2018\n\nJoel B.

The partisan breakdown shows that 74 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of Independents want a special counsel — as do a full 44 percent of Democrats.\n\n\n\n\nIn this particular poll, one fairly positive result for the FBI and Justice Department is that only 35 percent believe these institutions attempted to outright frame President Trump for colluding with the Russians.\nA just-released Rasmussen poll, however, shows that a full 50 percent of Americans “believe it’s at least somewhat likely senior federal law enforcement officials broke the law in an effort to prevent Donald Trump from winning the presidency.” Only 40 percent disagree.\nAnother Rasmussen poll from this week shows that only 42 percent of Americans believe Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election more than the FBI. Moreover, a full 34 percent believe the FBI meddled more than the Russians, while 24 percent are unsure.\nIn other words, we now live in a country where 58 percent of Americans either believe our own FBI meddled in a presidential election more than a hostile foreign government, or are not sure the FBI did not.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s approval rating is running ahead of former-President Obama’s at this point in his failed presidency.\n\n\n\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Agents in this sector lead the nation in the arrest of Bangladesh nationals with 122 so far this year.\nOn March 14 and 15, agents patrolling along the Rio Grande River near Laredo stopped seven illegal immigrants attempting to cross the border in two separate incidents. Further investigation in both cases revealed the individuals were Bangladesh nationals.\n\nBorder Patrol officials stated that 122 Bangladesh nationals have been arrested in the Laredo Sector this fiscal year. Other officials said that number could be much higher.\n\nBorder Patrol Agent Hector Garza, in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 told Breitbart Texas that the Laredo Sector seems to be the focal point for Bangladesh nationals to be smuggled into the U.S.\n\n“The arrest of these people from Bangladesh shows there is a clear pipeline from the Middle East through Mexico to the southern border of Texas,” Garza said in a phone interview. “We have been lucky to catch these but there is no telling how many other people from countries that sponsor terrorism could be utilizing that same pipeline.”\n\nGarza said these people are taught how to avoid being immediately deported at the border.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Many of these people from Bangladesh will claim to be unaccompanied alien minors when they are captured by our agents,” Garza explained. “At that point, they are turned over to immigration officials for processing under the existing catch and release programs for minors.”\n\n“When, during medical and dental examinations, immigration officers determine these people are actually adults, they are issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) and released,” Agent Garza explained.\n\nIt appears no charges are filed against the foreign nationals for initially lying to Border Patrol agents about being juveniles, he said.\n\nLaredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta said crossings in the Laredo Sector is nothing new, KENS CBS5 reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It goes to show that our agents are arresting people from all over the world on a daily basis,” Acosta explained. “Their intentions for entering the country illegally can only be determined after they have been arrested.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe San Antonio CBS affiliate reported other  Border Patrol officials’ claims that the Laredo Sector had the most apprehensions of Bangladesh nationals during the last fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

However, in an interview, Trump said the Russia investigation was also on his mind.\n\nComey told lawmakers that Trump had asked him to let former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn go — who was under FBI investigation — during a private conversation. The president has denied making any such request.\n\nComey later admitted he took notes after conversations with the president, and he gave them to at least one friend to pass to the media after he was no longer FBI director, for the purpose of prompting the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMueller’s team has been negotiating with White House lawyers to work out the specifics of an interview with Trump within “the next few weeks,” according to Axios.\n\nThe “big question” is whether it will be in person, in writing, or a combination of the two.\n\nKenneth Starr, the special counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, told Fox News recently that he did not see any evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\n“I’ve seen nothing in … the firing of [former FBI Director] James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggest the president has obstructed justice,” he told Fox News on February 28.\n\nThe president tweeted repeatedly over the weekend about the special counsel investigation, reflecting his deep frustration over the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Axios’s report is true, it would mean the president was aware during his tweeting that Mueller’s interest is on obstruction of justice, rather than any alleged collusion.\n\nThe president attacked Comey — who is set to launch a book tour next month.\n\n“Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI — A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” he tweeted on Saturday.\n\nTrump also reiterated that there was “no collusion.”\n\n“As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of teh FBI, Justice  State. #DrainTheSwamp.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHe continued tweeting about the probe into Sunday: “The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improerly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nOn Monday, the president continued: “A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!”\n\nDespite his tweets, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said the president had no intention of firing Mueller.\n\n“In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,” he said in a statement.",

    "body": "In its partisan zeal to protect the ongoing witch hunt against President Trump, our Nixonian media went into hyper-drive last week to ensure that the unethical and un-American behavior of President Obama’s FBI and Justice Department remained covered up from the public.\nAfter this cynical effort failed with the release of the Nunes memo Friday, the media quickly switched tactics and is now working feverishly to muddy the waters about the horror show revealed in the memo.\nTo begin with, it is obvious that a hysterical talking point about declaring the release of the memo a “Constitutional Crisis” has been spread far and wide… Naturally, the “constitutional crisis” in question is not the wrongdoing committed by federal law enforcement. Instead, because we are now deep within the head of the media’s fabricated reality where wrong is right and up is down, the “constitutional crisis” is that government wrongdoing was uncovered.\nOne way the media is hoping to shield the federal government from accountability for its indefensible lies, cover-ups, and civil rights violations is to muddy the waters; to distract us with nonsense so that we lose focus on the sins committed by an FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) that abused its power and public trust in unprecedented ways.\nHere are 16 things the media does not want you to know about the Nunes memo:\n\nThe so-called Russian Dossier, the creation of Fusion GPS and former British spy Christopher Steele, is a political document — namely, opposition research, created for the Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nUsing what it knew was opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign, in October of 2016, the FBI and DOJ obtained a FISA warrant from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to install a wiretap to spy on Hillary Clinton’s opponent — the Trump campaign, specifically Carter Page. This spying would last for a year.\nIt should be noted that the FISA court was set up to stop foreign terrorists. The fact that the FBI and DOJ would use this court to not only wiretap an American but to wiretap a presidential campaign belies belief. Why Obama’s FBI and DOJ used this court as opposed to a normal court is obvious. As you will see below, a normal court probably would have denied the wiretap.\nWorse still, in the summer of 2016, Obama’s DOJ had already opened a counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. The fact that nothing from that months-old partisan investigation was used to obtain the Page wiretap is revealing.\nAccording to the Nunes memo, an “essential” part of the FISA wiretap application was the Steele dossier, which again is a partisan political document created for the Clinton campaign.\nSo essential was this partisan dossier, Andrew McCabe, the disgraced former-Deputy Director of the FBI, admitted in December that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” without the dossier.\nNot only did the FBI knowingly use a document from a partisan campaign to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on the competing campaign, the FBI knew the dossier was mostly “salacious and unverified.” We know this because disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey told us so in June of 2017.\nAccording to the Nunes memo, “Steele told [former FBI official Bruce] Ohr, he ‘was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.'”\nOhr, who was part of the FBI’s anti-Trump Russian investigation, was not only friendly with Steele, Ohr’s own wife worked with Steele at Fusion GPS doing opposition research (the dossier) against Trump for the Clinton campaign.\nDespite a) knowing the dossier was opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign b) knowing the dossier was “salacious and unverified” c) knowing Steele was desperate to destroy Trump d) the breathtaking conflict of interest in having an investigator’s own wife working on the dossier, the FBI still went to the FISA court to obtain permission to spy on Hillary Clinton’s opponent.\nIn order to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, all of the conflicts of interest above were withheld from the FISA court — an indefensible (and possibly illegal) lie of omission.\nEven worse, in order to legitimize a warrant request based on a piece of partisan opposition research they knew was “salacious and unverified,” the FBI and DOJ used a media report to bolster the findings in the phony dossier. The FBI and DOJ told the court that the media report was independent verification of the dossier. But this was not true, and, according to the Nunes memo, the FBI and DOJ knew this was not true. The truth is that the phony dossier was the source of this media report.\nAlso hidden from the FISA court was the fact that the FBI obtained Steele as a source but had to fire him in October of 2016 when, in a bid to use his phony dossier to derail the Trump campaign, he leaked his information to the far-left Mother Jones.\nAlthough the FBI and DOJ were willing participants in pushing a “salacious and unverified” narrative against a presidential candidate (primarily through media leaks), this was all hidden from congressional investigators. To begin with, for months, while under oath, Comey said he did not know where the dossier came from — meaning from the Clinton campaign. The Wall Street Journal explains:\n\nWe also know the FBI wasn’t straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators in a briefing on the dossier in January 2017. The FBI did not tell Congress about Mr. Steele’s connection to the Clinton campaign, and the House had to issue subpoenas for Fusion bank records to discover the truth. Nor did the FBI tell investigators that it continued receiving information from Mr. Steele and Fusion even after it had terminated him. The memo says the bureau’s intermediary was Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, whose wife, incredibly, worked for Fusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this dishonesty occurred under Comey, the man our media now holds up as a living saint, a man so desperate to destroy Trump, he not only oversaw those committing the above abuses, he leaked classified information to the news media in order to see a Special Prosecutor appointed against Trump, which his pal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, immediately did.\n\nAnd finally…\n16. Much of the “salacious and unverified” material in the dossier came from the Russians. In other words, those disgusting dossier lies about Trump’s personal behavior came from Russian operatives. So there is no question that it was the Clinton campaign, Democrats, Steele, the FBI, and DOJ who colluded with the Russians to rig a presidential election.\nYes, there was collusion with the Russians, and those in our government currently investigating Trump in the hopes of overturning a presidential election are the colluders.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Andrew Cuomo wants to give illegal aliens brought to the U.S. as children under DACA free tuition at the state’s public colleges.\nCuomo, a Democrat, included a provision in his $168 billion budget that would change the state’s education law to make illegal alien children who were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program eligible to receive free tuition through the Excelsior Scholarship, the New York Post reported.\nThe scholarship gives students free tuition at any New York State public college if their families make $125,000 or less, regardless of grade-point average or standardized test scores.\nThe only condition of the program is that students remain in the state for the “number of years equal to the reward received” to keep the scholarship, meaning that students who receive the free tuition must live and work in the state or pay the money back.\nNot everybody in New York state government is on board with the governor’s proposal. Republicans in the New York State Senate say they would oppose Cuomo’s plan to give free college tuition to illegal aliens.\n“We don’t support giving free college tuition to people who are here illegally,” said Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif.\n\n\n\n\nCuomo proposed other policies that would extend benefits to DACA recipients this week.\nThe New York Democrat announced Tuesday that DACA recipients would receive Medicaid coverage in the state regardless of federal government action.",

    "body": "A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority raises immediate questions about former FBI Director James Comey’s role in utilizing the infamous, largely discredited 35-page anti-Trump dossier to obtain a FISA court warrant to monitor an individual associated with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nOne glaring possible inconsistency centers on Comey’s June 8, 2017 prepared remarks for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where he referred to the anti-Trump dossier as containing “salacious and unverified” material.\nYet, according to the memo crafted by House Republicans, Comey personally signed three FISA court applications utilizing that same dossier that he labeled “salacious and unverified” eight months later to obtain FISA court warrants to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign.\nThe memo documents that on October 21, 2016, the FBI and Justice Department sought and received the FISA order against Page, and that the agencies sought the renewal of the order every 90 days in accordance with court requirements.  Renewals require separate finding of probable cause each time, the memo relates.\nAccording to the memo, Comey “signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.” Sally Yates, then-Acting Deputy Attorney Gernal Dana Boente, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signed one or more of the applications on behalf of the Justice Department.\nThe memo relates the FBI utilized the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as evidence against Page in order to obtain the FISA warrant.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, according to the memo, the FBI and DOJ failed to inform the FISA court of the following:\n\nThat Steele’s Dossier was reportedly funded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm.  “Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,” the memo states.\nThat the initial application notes Steele worked for a “named U.S. person” but does not name the controversial firm Fusion GPS or its founder Glenn Simpson.\nThat Steele reportedly met with Yahoo News at the direction of Fusion GPS.  A Yahoo News article about an alleged trip by Page to Moscow was cited in the FISA warrant, according to the memo.\n\nAfter he allegedly signed three FISA applications based on Steele’s dossier, Comey publically referred to Steele’s work as “salacious and unverified.”\nIn Comey’s June 8, 2017 prepared remarks for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the former FBI chief says that following a January 6 Oval Office meeting with Intelligence Community leaders, Comey “remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.”’\nIt is clear Comey was referring to the dossier since he writes the “salacious and unverified” material was about to be publically reported by the news media.\nHe writes:\n\n\n\n\nThe IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\nFour days after that briefing, the dossier was published by BuzzFeed.\nAlso, in his statement summarizing his conversation with Trump, Comey refers to Russian prostitutes, a key component of the dossier:\nHe said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.\nIn a private White House dinner with Trump on January 27, Comey says the topic of the “salacious material” again came up and he reveals that Trump was considering asking the FBI to investigate the origins of the claims.  Comey pushed back against that idea.\nComey writes:\nDuring the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.\nMeanwhile, despite his role in signing three FISA applications based on a largely debunked dossier that he himself referred to as “unverified,” Comey on Friday took to Twitter to claim the memo’s release “destroyed trust” with the Intelligence community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ  FBI must keep doing their jobs.\n— James Comey (@Comey) February 2, 2018\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Pollak7 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf responded to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s rebuke on Wednesday, telling reporters that Sessions and President Donald Trump were “racist” for conflating criminals with “immigrants.”\nIn a speech earlier to a gathering of the California Peace Officers Association, Sessions had outlined the U.S. Department of Justice’s case against the state’s “sanctuary” laws, which it filed late Tuesday.\n\nHe also delivered a rebuke to Schaaf for warning illegal aliens ahead of a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in February — a warning that ICE said caused 800 illegal aliens, including convicts, to escape: ”\n\n“How dare you.  How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda.”\n\nIn response, Schaaf delivered a statement at a press conference in Oakland (via CBS San Francisco):\n\nMy response to the Attorney General’s statements this morning is as follows:\n\nHow dare you vilify members of our community by trying to frighten the American public into thinking that all undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals — hard-working, law-abiding Oakland’s like Eusebio and Maria Sanchez, whom you ripped away from their American-born children and the cancer patients at our public hospital who relied on Maria’s nursing skills every day?\n\nHow dare you distract the American people from a failed immigration system that tears apart families and forces the workers that out economy depends on to harvest our crops, delver our services, and build our cities to live in fear and work under oppressed conditions?\n\nHow dare you distort the reality about declining violent crime in a diverse sanctuary city like Oakland, California, to advance your racist agenda?\n\nI am confident that the courts will resolve the dispute between the administration and the great State of California. I am ready to get back to work doing my job as the mayor of Oakland — addressing homelessness, building affordable housing, fixing the streets, creating safe neighborhoods, and ensuring that the children of my community, no matter where they came from, or how they got here, have every opportune for success.\n\nOakland’s agenda is a thriving community. Trump’s agenda is bigotry and vindictiveness.\n\nSessions told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview early Tuesday morning that the Department of Justice was investigating Schaaf for her actions in warning illegal aliens of the ICE raids, but said he could not comment on the case until he had received recommendations from the department’s lawyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchaaf argued that most of the people targeted in the February raid had not been convicted of crimes other than illegal immigration.\n\nJoel B.

She also said Mueller should interview 2016 Democratic Party presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State John Kerry, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes and former President Barack Obama as part of his investigation.\n\nINGRAHAM: We finally have indictments in the Mueller investigation related to meddling in the 2016 election and the only ones being charged are Russians. A federal grand jury has now indicted 13 Russian individuals and companies for interfering in the 2016 election.\nThey are charged with a bunch of things like creating fake ads, staging pro and anti-Trump campaign events and also setting up bogus-run organizations, but they’re not accused of rigging the election for Trump, but instead of waging information warfare to sow discord in the political system.\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictments and added this important caveat.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Did you hear that? No American knowingly took part in the meddling and the plot had no effect on the outcome of the election. The facts, as we know them right now, support the president’s argument, an argument we have been making on this show for months, that there was no Russian collusion.\nTrump took a bit of a victory lap, tweeting today, “Russia started their anti-U.S. campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for president. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong. No collusion.”\nWell, it certainly looks that way, but we don’t know for sure what else Mueller may have up his sleeve. Though, I’ll tell you who this totally vindicates. Conservatives and Republicans who have been warning people for years about how devious the Russians can be in this situation.\nRemember, when President Obama sarcastically mocked Mitt Romney’s Russia warning back in 2012 during the presidential debate.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nFORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: When you’re asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not al Qaeda, you said Russia. In the 1980s or now, calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the cold war has been over for 20 years.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Now, Obama was so convinced of that, his DOJ and FBI did next to nothing about the Russian skulduggery. I love that word. His State Department actually approved the visas for the Russian operatives that were indicted by Mueller today.\nHis FBI began spying on Trump Campaign Advisor Carter Page with a FISA warrant in the fall of 2016. Now details in today’s indictment do point to vindication for the Trump team. This is Jonathan Turley from tonight’s “Special Report.”\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJONATHAN TURLEY: This makes more sense than the narratives that everyone has been throwing around in conspiracies. This began in 2014, began before the presidential election. The Russians were taking targets of opportunity and shooting at everybody in the election but certainly working more against Hillary Clinton. But what it does show is that they did a really quite impressive job in finding this cyber trail to these individuals.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: I’ll say. And the indictment describes rallies that took place after the election, both in support of and against Trump, and by the way, some of them happened on the same day, all allegedly promoted by these Russian accounts.\nYou see this ad? Well, according to “Buzzfeed,” this anti-Trump rallies staged just four days after the election was promoted by something called “Black Matters U.S.,” a social media campaign thought to be organized by Russians.\nSo, why would Trump collude with Russians to stage anti-Trump rallies? Does that make any sense? Here’s the bottom line. The Trump campaign did not know about Russian interference in the election. But the Obama administration certainly did and may have in fact enabled it.\nGiven that we already know Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC paid for that fake Russian dossier, it’s time for the special counsel to interview Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes, and maybe even Barack Obama. I say it’s high time that we determine who really colluded with the Russians.",

    "body": "New text messages discovered by congressional investigators between two FBI agents who worked on the Trump-Russia investigation reveal that one of them was close friends with the judge who had presided over Michael Flynn’s case before being abruptly recused.\nThe text messages, handed over by the Justice Department to Congress, show that FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI attorney Lisa Page, had discussed Strzok’s personal relationship with District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras and whether or not it would be a conflict of interest.\n\nAccording to investigative journalist Sara Carter, Page wrote to Strzok on July 25, 2016, referring to the secret court that grants surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: “Rudy is on the FISC! Did you know that? Just appointed two months ago.”\n\nStrzok responds later: “I did. We talked about it before and after. I need to get together with him.”\n\nHe also wrote: “….She brought up a good point about being circumspect in talking to him in terms of not placing him into a situation where he’d have to recuse himself.”\n\nPage responded: “I can’t imagine you either one of you could talk about anything in detail meaningful enough to warrant recusal.”\n\n\n\n\n\nStrzok then expresses skepticism over whether it would not be a conflict of interest, given their friendship.\n\nHe joked: “Really? Rudy. I’m in charge of espionage for the FBI. Any espionage FISA comes before him, what should he do? Given his friend oversees them?”\n\nPage wrote back: “Standards for recusal are quite high. I just don’t think this poses an actual conflict. And he doesn’t know what you do?”\n\nStrzok expressed doubt: “Generally he does know what I do. Not the level or scope or area but he’s super thoughtful and rigorous about ethics and conflicts.”\n\nHe then said someone — whose name is redacted — suggested he and Contreras meet at a “social setting” for “cover.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“(redacted) suggested a social setting with others would probably be better than a one on one meeting. I’m sorry, I’m just going to have to invite you to that cocktail party. Of course, you’ll be there. Have to come up with some other work people cover for action.”\n\nPage replied: “Why more? Six is a perfectly fine dinner party.”\n\nIt is not clear whether Strzok’s relationship with Contreras had anything to do with his recusal on the case, and some legal experts point out that it is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to know judges outside of the courtroom, particularly those serving in the same area.\n\nBut the texts have raised questions for lawmakers exercising oversight of the DOJ.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, member of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, told Carter: “Why did Contreras recuse himself?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Text messages show he had a relationship with Strzok …Why did the DOJ make it difficult for us to get the information? To me, those are the two fundamental questions. We don’t know that answers to either one of those ”\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-SC) told Carter: “I think from my standpoint we’re asking the Department of Justice and the FBI to give us the documents we need to do proper oversight.”\n\n“Failing to be able to provide Congress with those documents in an expeditious manner would certainly strengthen the case for a special prosecutor,” he said. “There is no reason why we cannot get the same documents the Inspector General has.”\n\nTheir complaints come as the chairmen of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling for a second special counsel to look into any improper behavior at the FBI and the DOJ.\n\nStrzok and Page’s text messages occurred July 2016, just as the FBI launched its investigation into the Trump campaign. Later, the FBI would seek a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It is not known which judge signed off on the warrant, though there are unconfirmed reports that it was Contreras.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrzok and another agent would then interview Flynn in January 2017 about his phone conversations with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kisylak. Although Strzok and then-FBI Director James Comey reportedly believed that Flynn had not lied or intentionally misled, Flynn was later charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with one count of lying.\n\nStrzok himself was removed from Mueller’s team in July 2017 after hundreds of pages of text messages between he and Page were found by the Justice Department inspector general, who was investigating bias in handling the Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation. Page had already finished her assignment on the team when they were discovered. The two were reportedly engaged in an extramarital affair.\n\nStrzok and Page had served on the Clinton email investigation, the FBI’s initial investigation into the Trump campaign, and the subsequent special counsel team. In text messages throughout that time, they expressed loathing of Trump and support for Clinton.\n\nContreras presided over Flynn’s Dec. 1, 2017 hearing in which the former national security adviser pleaded guilty. He was abruptly recused from the case days later, on Dec. 7, 2017, without any public explanation. The new judge, Emmet Sullivan, requested that the special counsel provide any evidence that would be favorable to Flynn’s case.\n\nSome legal experts pointed out it was standard operating procedure for Sullivan, but lawyer Margot Cleveland said he also entered a footnote with the order that explained why evidence favorable to Flynn, even after a guilty plea, could be a basis for throwing out the plea.\n\nJordan and other members told Carter they were facing restrictive rules from the DOJ in viewing the text messages.\n\nThey said the DOJ only allowed them to review the text messages at DOJ headquarters and only highly redacted text messages were allowed to be removed for their oversight of the Justice Department’s handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nThey said of 1.2 million documents collected by the Justice Department Inspector General, the House Oversight Committee has only received 3,162 “unique documents.”",

    "body": "China expert Steven Mosher joined Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight to discuss the revelations in Peter Schweizer’s new book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, concerning the Chinese government’s influence peddling via “sweetheart deals” with family members of prominent American politicians.\nMosher, the president of the Population Research Institute and author of Bully of Asia: Why China’s Dream is the New Threat to World Order, explained how Schweizer’s new book documents a form of “officially sanctioned corruption” that is deeply rooted in Chinese political culture. He detailed how the Chinese regime purchases political influence in America via the cultivation of economic relationships with prominent politicians’ family members, including, as Schweizer’s book reveals, the son of Joe Biden, the father- and sister-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and the son-in-law of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn his interview Friday with Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour, Mosher praised Schweizer’s past work, as president of the Government Accountability Institute, in exposing government corruption.\n\n“I have to say that Peter Schweizer — who I’ve known for many years and I regard as a friend — is just a bulldog when it comes to this kind of thing,” Mosher said. “He does his research, he’s gone into the Chinese language websites of some of these firms and translated them into English and made accessible to us information that we would never otherwise know. It’s an amazing piece of research.”\n\nMansour and her guest co-host, actress and author Sam Sorbo, detailed the revelations in Schweizer’s book concerning the Chinese government’s influence peddling in America, including the close ties between the Chinese regime and the family shipping business founded by Elaine Chao’s father. Elaine Chao is Mitch McConnell’s wife and President Trump’s Transportation Secretary.\n\nMansour noted that McConnell’s sister- and father-in-law both sat on the board of China State Shipbuilding Corp. (CSSC), a state-run shipbuilding company described by Schweizer as “a state-owned defense conglomerate … at the heart of the Chinese government’s military-industrial complex.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMansour further noted that, according to Schweizer’s research, the Chinese government-controlled Bank of China appointed McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, to its board of directors “shortly after President Trump was elected.” \n\n“The bank’s board of directors up until that point included all senior Chinese officials and one lone Dutch banker,” said Mansour, before sarcastically remarking, “Now, I’m sure it was all based on her qualifications, and she was the most qualified member of Mitch McConnell’s family to get that position. So I don’t think we have anything to worry about.”\n\nMosher described China’s influence peddling as a “reverse King Midas effect,” drawing on the Greek mythological figure’s ability to turn things to gold with a touch. The Chinese, he said, held gold in their hands as they sought to purchase influence from various figures and companies. He further explained how corrupt influence peddling is deeply rooted in Chinese political history. \n\n\n\n“What we see in China is kind of a reverse King Midas effect,” said Mosher. “We all remember the Greek story of King Midas, who whenever he touched something it turned to gold. Well, whenever the Chinese communists touch anything, they have gold in their hands and they want to pass it along to the person or company they’re dealing with, so it really is all buying influence. This has a long history in China, by the way, going back a couple of thousand years.” \n\n\n\n\n\nMosher explained, “When Chinese officials were appointed to govern a province or …. a county, the emperor who appointed them did not give them a budget, he just gave them permission to go to that county [or] province and extort, accept bribes, accept fees of various kinds, and tax the people into poverty. They were expected to raise their own money [and] budget to support themselves, their households, and all their employees in the official government residence…. They would be on the take from the get-go. That’s what was expected of them, so it was officially sanctioned corruption.”\n\n“The political culture of China from the beginning has been based on this kind of corruption of officials using their authority [and] power to make money [and] to use money to make even more money,” said Mosher. “What we now see on the international stage is this whole Chinese gold play that happens inside of China — it’s happened for hundreds of years — now it’s being exported to other parts of the world like the United States, and again, the reverse King Midas effect, how they’re corrupting everything they touch including the family members of American politicians who actually may not be that hard to bring around to the Chinese point of view.”\n\n“What did China get in exchange?” asked Mansour of Mosher.\n\n“I think there’s no question that China wants something in exchange,” replied Mosher. “These are not free gifts. This is not a market-based investment, for example, into the Rosemont Seneca firm that was set up by Hunter Biden [and] Devon Archer, as [Peter Schweizer] reports. This was a calculated effort to buy influence with the son of the vice president of the United States. … Had you or I walked in with the same proposal, we wouldn’t even have gotten past the receptionist. These people were able to get in because of their parents [and] their family connections to see very high-level officials who consciously wanted to ink a deal in order to rope them in to the Chinese way of seeing and doing things.”\n\nMosher explained the revelation in Schweizer’s book concerning a billion-dollar investment firm established by Hunter Biden — Joe Biden’s son — and the state-run Bank of China.\n\n\n\n\n\n“In [Peter Schweizer’s] account that was published in the New York Post, it’s very clear that one of the consequences of this one-billion dollar investment fund that was set up and guaranteed by China — by the way, so you can’t lose money, again, it’s not a market-based decision; if the Chinese government is guaranteeing the fund then it’s a no-lose proposition — and they went out and bought an American company that had a dual-use technology that was useful in not just a commercial sense, but in a military sense, as well, and for some reason this sale, which should have been blocked, was approved,” related Mosher. “So, I think you can see how it works.”\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration approved a Chinese state-owned company’s 51-percent-majority purchase of Henniges, an American “dual-use” parts manufacturer involved in the production of “anti-vibration” automotive technologies with possible military applications. The deal was approved by the the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), speculated Mosher, in part due to a Biden-linked firm’s purchasing of the remaining 49-percent-minority stake in Henniges.\n\nSorbo noted how Thornton Group —  a “politically connected consultancy firm” connected to Rosemont Seneca — documented its meeting in China with Hunter Biden on the Chinese-language side of its website, but omitted such details from its English-language website.\n\n“On the Chinese side, they were happy to brag about how they had managed win influence and buy friends in the United States, and yet their American partners were much more reticent to reveal exactly what was going on,” stated Mosher. “I wonder why.”\n\nSorbo framed Chinese purchasing of political influence as a function of a self-serving domestic political class: “This is what you get when you get a political class, an elite class, and they feel that they’re untouchable, and they’re using their political power and their access to their own benefit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s influence peddling of the worst kind,” concurred Mosher. “Going back a hundred years, Warren G. Harding got in trouble because his energy secretary was dealing in oil leases. This is far worse than the kind of scandals and corruption we’ve seen in American history because it deals with a selling out America to a hostile foreign power. China does not wish us well. China wishes to replace us on the world stage, and they’re buying influence and buying companies and stealing technology piecemeal. But they have a plan. This is not happening just by chance. They’re targeting the family members of powerful influential American politicians, offering them sweetheart deals knowing that once the deal is inked that they will have that family not in their pocket necessarily, but they’ll certainly get a sympathetic hearing on any China issues that comes up.”\n\nMosher didn’t question Joe  Biden’s patriotism, but noted that when the company or firm of a politician’s family member receives “enormous benefits from these sweetheart deals… it has to soften their views on America’s stance towards China.”\n\nSorbo challenged Mosher’s assessment of Biden’s intentions: “I might have a bit of a harder line than you on this, because my understanding is that Biden flew over [to China] for meetings and brought his son. So he’s the one parading his son around saying, ‘Look at my fine young man. Can you do anything for him?'”\n\nMosher also noted China’s efforts to influence Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor, by offering him $600 million towards an outstanding debt on a Manhattan property owed by Kushner’s family business.\n\n“The Chinese came in and offered [Jared Kushner] $600 million to prop up his loan for the 666 Fifth Avenue building, which is heavily in debt,” said Mosher. “He turned down the offer, but you can see how the Chinese are playing this game. They pick targets of opportunity. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don’t, but every time they succeed they chisel away at American resolve to confront what is, after all, I think a mortal danger to the American republic, a mortal danger certainly to the rule of law in the world and the current world order.”\n\nPeter Schweizer’s new book Secret Empires will hit bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, March 20.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

But we never stopped loving each other, or rooting for each other,” she said. “We respect each other, and we know that as a united front, there is nothing that we cannot conquer.”\n“So let my family be an example, that we do not have to pick sides,” Lawrence added. “We are experiencing the same thing in this country right now. And it’s time to come together. Across ideologies, across parties. It’s time to unite to fix our democracy. Because regardless of where our politics fall, at the grassroots, the American people don’t deserve to pay taxes to a system that is rigged against them.”\nLawrence — who also served as emcee Saturday night — serves on the Board of Directors at Represent.us, a self-described nonpartisan anti-corruption organization and one of the sponsors of the event. The actress previously raffled an opportunity to go wine-tasting with her in California to benefit the organization.\nIn an August interview with Vogue, Lawrence said the country must find a “bridge” between citizens with differing political views.\n\n\n\n\n“We can’t continue this divide and anger. There are issues affecting us as human beings, not as liberals and not as Republicans. We have to protect the foundation of this country, and acceptance,” Lawrence told the magazine. “If you’re preaching acceptance, accept immigrants, accept Muslims, accept everybody.”\nThe A-list actress has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump since well before the 2016 presidential election.\nVIDEO\nA year before the ballots were cast in November 2016, Lawrence predicted it would be the “end of the world” if Trump were elected. In a later appearance on the UK’s Graham Norton Show, the actress said she had once hoped to meet Trump at a concert, so she could tell him, “Hey Trump, f*ck you!” And in a December interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lawrence said she had planned to say something “not nice” to Trump in the event she meets him, and added that it would end “with a martini to the face.”\nThe actress announced in November she would take a brief hiatus from acting, though she is set to appear in several films in 2018.\n\n\n\n\nOther stars at Saturday night’s event included comedians Tig Notaro, Nikki Glaser and Adam Yenser, while the Preservation All-Stars provided musical entertainment.\nWatch the full event above.\n \nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",

They won’t tell us what countries they’re from. What religion they’re from,” said Michael Walsh.\n\nHe said the 300-strong rural community of Lisdoonvarna could be radically changed by such a large and sudden influx, and that many concerned locals were fearful of accusations of racism if they questioned it.\n\n“They just proposed to expand the population of this little village by what? Twenty-five per cent? Thirty-three per cent actually!” he exclaimed in an interview with Breitbart News Editor in Chief Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM.\n\n\n“And [the asylum seekers] are starting to come in this week,” he said, explaining how the contracts for the deal have now been signed this Wednesday, making it a “done deal”, despite 93 per cent of Lisdoonvarna residents last week voting against turning a local hotel into asylum seeker accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The hotelier who had publically said ‘if the people of Lisdoonvarna don’t want this I won’t sign the contract’ has signed the contract. He’s now weaselled back on it,” Mr. Walsh added, speculating that the owner stands to make between one and two million euros from the government in a year.\n\n\nFrom Matchmaking town to #DirectProvision Centre- I’m live in #Lisdoonvarna #Clare @drivetimerte as locals seek postponement of #AsylumSeekers arrival pic.twitter.com/JI5XZSTwj7\n\n— John Cooke (@johncookeradio) February 26, 2018\n\nMr. Walsh – a screenwriter, author, filmmaker, and former Breitbart News editor – grew up in the U.S. but has roots in the isolated town of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, which hosts a popular matchmaking festival in the summer, attracting many tourists.\n\nHe returned to the area in his twenties to “reconnect” with his Irish roots and renovate a property there. Like others, he wanted to experience Irish culture and enjoy life in the traditional community, which he now fears will dramatically change.\n\nMany asylum seekers in Ireland are not from worn torn nations, he claimed, but many will stay in the country indefinitely, even if they are not in danger where they are from.\n\n“Ireland is under the impression that these people will all become Irish, pretty much overnight, and everything will just continue on to be terrific. But, in fact, as history is showing us – in Sweden, France, and Germany – this is not necessarily the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Very many people are concerned, but they’re also concerned about being called racist, and the town is in a real pickle right now,” he said.\n\n\nIrish Govt ‘Paid Press’ to Promote Plan to Grow Population by One Million With Mass Migration https://t.co/yKf7eUZIz1\n\n— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2018\n\nBlasting the lack of consultation on the new asylum seeker home, he said: “It was all done in complete secrecy. No one knew about this until two weeks ago!”\n\nIreland has taken in relatively few asylum seekers compared to other EU nations in recent years, due in part to the nation being physically removed from its European neighbours. However, with the EU’s new forced relocation scheme, numbers are set to increase.\n\nThe forced migration programme comes among revelations that the Irish government paid journalists to give positive coverage of their Ireland 2040 policy to dramatically grow the nation’s population through mass migration.\n\n“Apparently there’s no way to stop [the migrants coming to Lisdoonvarna]. The local [politicians] are all wringing their hands about it,” Mr. Walsh added, arguing that the pro-EU mainstream parties have a stranglehold on Irish politics, allowing for little dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s a good example of how Ireland was a colony of England… and now it’s a slave state again, of Brussels. It’s a very sad commentary on what’s happening in Europe.”",

John McCain (R-AZ), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, attacked the release of the FISA memo, arguing that it does not serve the interests of America, “only Putin’s.”\nMcCain said in a statement:\nIn 2016, the Russian government engaged in an elaborate plot to interfere in an American election and undermine our democracy. Russia employed the same tactics it has used to influence elections around the world, from France and Germany to Ukraine, Montenegro, and beyond. Putin’s regime launched cyberattacks and spread disinformation with the goal of sowing chaos and weakening faith in our institutions. And while we have no evidence that these efforts affected the outcome of our election, I fear they succeeded in fueling political discord and dividing us from one another.\nThe latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests – no party’s, no president’s, only Putin’s. The American people deserve to know all of the facts surrounding Russia’s ongoing efforts to subvert our democracy, which is why Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation must proceed unimpeded. Our nation’s elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin’s job for him.\nThe White House and the House Intelligence Committee released the FISA memo on Friday.\nLast December it was revealed that it McCain who passed the Steele dossier to former FBI Director James Comey. McCain met with Andrew Wood in Halifax, Canada at the Halifax Security Forum in Canada in November 2016, and they discussed the dossier.\nMcCain had his associate David Kramer travel to London to meet with Steele and get briefed on the dossier. They arranged to get a hard copy of the dossier to McCain, and he gave it to Comey.\nThe memo describes how senior Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials used the unverified Trump dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Trump campaign staffer Carter Page. The memo also details how those senior officials in the DOJ and the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on how the Trump dossier was actually opposition research funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).",

    "body": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), fell for a spoof by Russian pranksters who promised in a call with the top House Democrat to furnish him with“kompromat”–compromising dirt–on President Donald Trump.\nSchiff found the early 2017 call with the Russian pranksters, who posed as Ukrainian leaders, “productive,” one of his staffers wrote in an email to the Russians-posing-as-Ukrainians with whom he was communicating. Now, after getting caught in the media by reports in the Atlantic magazine and the U.K. Daily Mail newspaper—as well as audio of the call appearing on YouTube—a Schiff spokesperson claims the powerful Democrat congressman thought the call was “bogus” from the beginning. But that’s not what the record shows.\nLISTEN TO THE AUDIO OF ADAM SCHIFF WITH RUSSIAN PRANKSTERS:\nVIDEO\nThe notorious Russian pranksters, who the Daily Mail’s Alana Goodman notes are “comedians nicknamed ‘Vovan’ and ‘Lexus’” who have become famous for “their phony calls to high-ranking American officials and celebrities, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Elton John,” posed as leading Ukrainian officials in their call to Schiff in early 2017.\n“On an audio recording of the prank call posted online, Adam Schiff can be heard discussing the committee’s Russia investigation and increasingly bizarre allegations about Trump with a man who claimed to be Andriy Parubiy, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament,” Goodman wrote in the Daily Mail.\n\n\n\n\nAs Goodman noted, the call’s existence was first reported by the Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe—who noted that the call took place in early April 2017. Ioffe wrote:\nOn April 10, 2017, an assistant to Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Donald Trump’s campaign for possible collusion with the Kremlin, patched in a long-planned call from Andriy Parubiy, the speaker of the Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Parubiy said he had some potentially explosive information about Trump’s visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013.\nThe call, per the audio available on YouTube, begins with platitudes and introductions and Schiff thanks the man he thinks is Parubiy for his time addressing him as “Mr. Chairman.”\nThe man then pitches that he wants to provide materials to Schiff for his committee’s investigation on “Trump” and the “Russian government,” to which Schiff cautions him that the Russians were likely listening to the call.\n“I would just caution that our Russian friends may be listening to the conversation, so I wouldn’t share anything over the phone that you don’t want them to hear,” Schiff said.\nAfter the Russian prankster posing as the Ukrainian official said he had no concerns with what the Russians may or may not hear, he proceeded to tell Schiff about what would have been explosive allegations against the now-sitting president of the United States if they were true.\n\n\n\n\n“In November 2013, Mr. Trump visited Moscow, he visited competition Miss Universe, and there he met with Russian journalist and celebrity Ksenia Sobchak,” the prankster said.\nSobchak has extensive ties to Putin, the prankster told Schiff, adding that she is “also known as a person who provides girls for escort for oligarchs. And she met with Trump and she brought him one Russian girl, celebrity Olga Buzova.” The prankster even told Schiff that Sobchak is a “special agent of Russian secret service.”\nIn reality, Sobchak is actually anti-Putin—an ex-Playboy model running against the Russian president on an anti-corruption platform after her time as a television anchor. But no matter to Schiff; he was entranced by the possibility of “kompromat” on Trump.\nAfter, per the Russian pranksters posing as Ukrainian officials in their conversation with Schiff, Sobchak introduced Trump to Buzova, Buzova “got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations.”\n“There were pictures of naked Trump,” the prankster said.\n\n\n\n\nSchiff, per the Atlantic report, “betrayed no emotion.”\n“And so Putin was made aware of the availability of the compromising material?” Schiff asked the man he thought was a Ukrainian leader.\n“Yes, of course,” the prankster replied, adding that Putin told Trump “all those compromising materials will never be released if Trump will cancel all Russian sanctions.”\nAdding insult to injury, the pranksters convinced Schiff that they had a recording of Sobchak and Buzov discussing this during a recent visit to Ukraine and that the Ukrainian officials would provide said recording to the FBI and the House Intelligence Committee’s Democratic minority staff.\nBut that’s not all. The pranksters told Schiff that Trump’s ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with Russians in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn speaking in code words. From the Atlantic piece, here is more:\n\n\n\n\nHe told Schiff about meetings that Trump’s former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had had with a Russian pop singer who served as an intermediary for the Kremlin. They’d met at a café in Brighton Beach, a Russian-immigrant enclave in Brooklyn, where, Parubiy said, “they used a special password before their meetings.” One would say, “Weather is good on Deribasovskaya.” The right response was “It rains again on Brighton Beach.”\nSchiff told the men he thought were Ukrainian officials that what they had told him was “very helpful.”\n“All righty. Good, this is very helpful. I appreciate it,” Schiff said. He also pushed for the release of the evidence that the pranksters invented for their stunt to the FBI and the House committee for which Schiff is ranking member.\n“We will try to work with the FBI to figure out, along with your staff, how we can obtain copies,” Schiff said.\nWhat’s more, after the call, Schiff told his staff that it was “productive” and told them to follow up with the pranksters-they-thought-were Ukrainians.\n“I understand Mr. Schiff had a productive call with Mr. Parubiy, and that Mr. Parubiy would like to make some materials available to Mr. Schiff through your Embassy,” Rheanne Wirkkala of the House Intelligence Committee minority staff—Schiff’s team—wrote to the pranksters that Schiff’s team still thought were Ukrainian officials. That email was sent in the early days of April 2017.\nWirkkala is no low-level staffer. She is, per her LinkedIn page, the policy director for the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.\nWirkkala sent a second email during the Democrats’ correspondence with these Russian pranksters that Schiff and the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee originally thought were Ukrainian officials that further illustrates that for several days Schiff and his team thought this was real.\nIn the April 5, 2017, email, Wirkalla asked the men she and Schiff thought were Ukrainian officials: “do you know when we might be able to meet your colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy here in Washington, DC to pick up materials?”\nNow, upon the release of this call in the Atlantic and Daily Mail, and the recording of it on YouTube, Schiff’s team is claiming he always knew it was “bogus.”\n“Before agreeing to take the call, and immediately following it, the committee informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus,” a Schiff spokesperson told the Atlantic.\nIn a statement to the Daily Mail, the Schiff spokesperson added more: “Obviously, it was bogus – which became even more evident during the call – but as with any investigation that is global in scale, we have to chase any number of leads, many of which turn out to be duds.”\nBut as the Daily Mail’s Goodman noted, Schiff’s team has “declined” to respond to the fact that Schiff’s policy director called the call “productive” and moved forward with seeking the production of the fake evidence in emails post-call with the pranksters.\n“The spokesperson declined to address on the record why a staff member pursued the ‘politician’ after the call if the congressman thought it was fake,” Goodman wrote.\nIt remains to be seen what the fallout here is, but Schiff’s office has yet to provide any explanation for the emails and how he handled the actual call. But top Republicans are already pouncing on this demanding that he be sidelined from his role on the committee after this embarrassing development.\n\n.@RepAdamSchiff needs to step down as ranking member of @HouseIntelComm. He’s embarrassing the Committee. https://t.co/rXJLIiSCmG\n— Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) February 6, 2018\nSchiff getting removed from his committee role would have drastically negative consequences on the Democrats’ efforts to stick Trump with the Russia scandal anymore. He has been the public face of the investigation, appearing relentlessly on television and in the media to push it forward—and even fundraising off of Breitbart News articles about his actions.",

Pollak18 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t18 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t18 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFormer CIA Director John Brennan reacted to the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — and President Donald Trump’s celebration of it — by tweeting a strident attack against Trump:\n\nWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America…America will triumph over you. https://t.co/uKppoDbduj\n\n— John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) March 17, 2018\n\nThe president’s critics seems to like Brennan’s tweet. In fact, it confirmed what Trump has been saying all along: that the senior leadership of the intelligence and federal law enforcement services had become highly politicized.\n\nThat impression was only reinforced further by a tweet from former UN Ambassador Samantha Power — whose full role in “unmasking” Americans who appeared in foreign intelligence wiretaps has yet to be exposed:\n\n\nNot a good idea to piss off John Brennan. https://t.co/VLg94OLL2R\n\n— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 17, 2018\n\nPower’s warning echoes that of Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), who warned Trump last January — in the midst of heavy leaks to the media by the FBI and intelligence services: “You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.”\n\nFor these Democrats, it seemed natural to threaten the president with retaliation by the intelligence community. They showed no concern for the abuse of power that might entail.\n\n(By contrast, when evidence emerged in 2014 that the CIA had spied on staffers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the agency’s behavior, calling it “treason.”)\n\n\n\n\n\nPower later tried to walk back her tweet:\n\n\nWhoa! Just home  see much misinterp. of earlier tweet. It’s testament to polarized times that it cd be misread as referring to something other than Brennan’s indignation. So will translate: not a good idea to upset @JohnBrennan bc/ he will raise an angry ( eloquent) voice. https://t.co/YgIjeKGAlp\n\n— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 18, 2018\n\nGiven her own role in “unmasking” American citizens. that revision may be less than convincing.\n\nIn his own statement upon being fired, McCabe blasted the president for having “politicized” law enforcement, accusing him of trying “to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.”\n\nBrennan’s public comments, McCabe’s leaks, and the whole sorry saga of Hillary Clinton’s non-investigation suggest that the politicization happened long before.\n\nJoel B.

    "body": "On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” former State Department spokeswoman in the Obama administration Marie Harf said Hillary Clinton should stop talking about the reasons for her loss in the 2016 presidential election and  “go away.”\n\nPartial transcript as follows: \n\nCHRIS WALLACE: All right, meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is back at it. She was on a book tour in India and continuing to explain why she lost. And here’s why she said she didn’t do well with white married women.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Part of that is a — an identification with the Republican Party and a — a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\nWALLACE: Marie, is it just me or is that kind of a curious analysis from a feminist that women — white, married women were browbeaten by the men around them?\n\nHARF: Yes, you’re right. And she should go away. I hate to say that. I really do. The first female nominee of a major party has an historical, you know, role certainly and the right to speak up. She is not helping the Democratic Party. And I think she should take a very long vacation and leave the future of the party to other people.\n\nI think the future of the party is not with her. And the clearest indication of that is the fact that in the 20 special elections that have taken place so far in 2018, Democrats on averaged have gotten 24 more points than she did. The party of the future is not Hillary Clinton’s party. And I get why she wants to keep explaining it, but it is not —\n\nWALLACE: You say you get why she’s explaining — what’s going on here? Do you think it’s just bitterness? Do you think she’s just a sore loser?\n\nHARF: You know, I wouldn’t use that term. But I think this was a hard-fought competition.\n\nROVE: I would.\n\nHARF: And I think most people, including most Republicans, didn’t think she was going to lose. So I’m not going to psychoanalyze why she keeps giving excuses for it. And there’s probably a time and place for that.\n\nBut it’s not what Mitt Romney did. It’s not what John Kerry did. It’s not what Al Gore did. And if your goal is to help the party and help us understand how to get white working class men and women back in the Midwest, this is not helpful to that cause.\n\n(h/t RCP Video)\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

    "body": "“Watch closely for Barack Obama’s fingerprints,” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA) on Saturday, suggesting the recent alleged partisan weaponization of state surveillance powers could be connected to the 44th president. “[Democrats and their allies] will defend Barack Obama at all costs, and they’ll defend Hillary Clinton almost at all costs unless they have to sacrifice her to protect Barack Obama,” he added.\nKing offered his remarks during an interview with Breitbart News’s Deputy Political Editor Amanda House on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Saturday.\nAgainst the backdrop of Friday’s released memo from the House Intelligence Committee (HIC), King called for further investigation into what role, if any, Obama and his cabinet officials played in procuring state surveillance of Carter Page and George Papadopoulos (two peripheral operatives of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign) via Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications submitted before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).\nThe HIC memo alleges the commission of abuses of power by the FBI and Justice Department (DOJ) under the Obama administration in surveilling Page and Papadopoulos.\n“Look at all of these investigations now,” said King. “Look closely for Barack Obama’s fingerprints. I’ve just identified some that I think are fingerprints, and I think this trail leads to the Obama presidency, to Barack Obama himself, but it’s going to take some time if we get there, and I’m not certain that the evidence trail necessarily leads there. There’s an indication trail that says we need to take a look and find out. But if it’s not Barack Obama, then who is it? Well, it’s Loretta Lynch, for example, and James Comey, and McCabe, and that cast of characters from Sally Yates on down. I don’t think we’ve ever seen such a long row of very high-level executive branch officials wrapped up in something here that is political partisanship, weaponizing the FBI and DOJ to do opposition research that was stimulated by the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and [paid for with her] and the DNC’s  recalled Obama’s denial — made during an interview with Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace on April 10, 2016 — that partisan and political considerations would afford Hillary Clinton favorable treatment by the FBI and DOJ during ostensible federal investigations into her negligent handling of classified information via email and other telecommunications during her tenure as secretary of state.\nPartial transcript below:\nWALLACE:  Mr. President … some people I think are worried whether or not — the decision whether or not, how to handle the [Hillary email] case, will be made on political grounds, not legal grounds. Can you guarantee to the American people, can you direct the Justice Department to say, “Hillary Clinton will be treated as the evidence goes — she will not be, in any way, protected”?\nOBAMA:  I can guarantee that. And I can guarantee that not because I give Attorney General Lynch a directive, [but because] that is institutionally how we have always operated. I do not talk to the attorney general about pending investigations. I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. We have a strict line and always have maintained it.\nWALLACE:  So, just to button this up —\nOBAMA:  I guarantee it.\nWALLACE:  You —\nOBAMA:  I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, or the FBI, not just in this case, but in any case.\nWALLACE:  And she will be —\nOBAMA:  Full stop. Period.\nWALLACE:  And she will be treated no different —\nOBAMA:  Guaranteed. Full stop. Nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department, because nobody is above the law.\nWALLACE:  Even if she ends up as the Democratic nominee?\nOBAMA:  How many times do I have to say it, Chris? Guaranteed.\nDuring his interview with Wallace, Obama further claimed that Hillary Clinton “would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.” King linked Obama’s description of Clinton’s supposedly good intentions to the Obama administration’s ultimate exoneration — via James Comey’s statement on July 5, 2016 — of the former first lady on the grounds of an alleged lack of intent to feloniously mishandle classified information.\nThe Obama administration sought to use state surveillance powers to collect intelligence on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his associates to afford Hillary Clinton’s political campaign advantages, speculated King.\n“[The FBI was doing] opposition research [into the] Trump campaign,” said King. “To think what that means, it looked to me like it was a fishing expedition. They had targeted Carter Page because they saw that he had direct communications with Trump, and they wanted to pick up anything they could pick up on him that could be leaked to the press.”\n\n\n\n\n“This is an arrogance of being high-level operatives in the FBI and DOJ,” said King. “To take your profession that you’re paid to do and decide that you know best who should be president of the United States, and that should be Hillary Clinton.”\nDemocrats, their consultants, and their news media allies will “manufacture arguments… without regard to truth [and] without regard to being objective” on the issue of political and partisan weaponization of the FBI and DOJ in order to “move public opinion,” said King. \n\n“[Democrats want] to destroy the credibility of the objective truth,” added King. “They will defend Barack Obama at all costs, and they’ll defend Hillary Clinton almost at all costs unless they have to sacrifice her to protect Barack Obama.”\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Pacific).\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

He called on Congress to end funding for sanctuary cities.\n\n“If we are not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kill thousands of people and destroy so many people’s lives, we are just doing the wrong thing,” he said. “We have got to get tough.”\n\nTrump specifically vowed to empower law enforcement to crack down on the supply of drugs, including prescription drug reforms targeting doctors and drug companies.\n\n“I love tough guys, we need tough guys,” Trump said, pointing out an ICE agent in the audience.\n\nThe audience in New Hampshire cheered Trump’s proposed solutions, many of them wearing red Make America Great Again campaign hats in support of the president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president also announced a plan to create more advertisements to “scare” young people away from opioid addiction, much like cigarette advertisements.\n\n“The best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with,” he said.\n\nHe promised that the Department of Justice was considering a federal lawsuit against some of the drug companies who manufacture opioids. Trump also announced plans to provide narcan to first responders in areas devastated by opioid addiction. Narcan helps block the effects of opioids, especially in overdose situations.\n\n“I want to win this battle, I don’t want to leave at the end of seven years and have this problem,” Trump said.",

Only the Speaker of the House and the party leaders can hold the floor indefinitely.\nPelosi said she was taking a stand to draw attention to the plight of the so-called “Dreamers,” who are illegal aliens brought into the country as minors.\nDuring her remarks, she hailed the “Dreamers,” whom she said had arrived in the country illegally through no fault of their own.\nShe then went on to thank the parents of the “Dreamers” — i.e. those who deliberately broke the law.\n“I say to their parents: Thank you for bringing these Dreamers to America. We’re in your debt for the courage it took, for you to take the risk, physically, politically, in every way, to do so,” she said.\n\n\n\n\n(Click video link in tweet below to watch.)\n\n\n“I say to their parents: Thank you for bringing these Dreamers to America.

Pollak (@joelpollak) February 7, 2018\nDemocrats actually failed to pass any legislation on immigration when Pelosi was Speaker, and her party controlled both Capitol Hill and the White House from 2009 to 2011. President Barack Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, using — or abusing — his executive powers of prosecutorial discretion on a massive scale to shield some 700,000 applicants from deportation.\nPelosi declared that she would speak until Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) promised a vote on legislation to protect the “Dreamers” — something he has already promised to do, at least with regard to Republican legislation on the issue.\nJust last month, President Donald Trump offered a deal that included a “path to citizenship” for all of the estimated 1.8 million “Dreamers,” including those who did not register for DACA. But Democrats rejected that deal over Trump’s demand for a border wall, plus an end to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi began speaking 7 hours ago. \nThe House Historian's office confirms that Pelosi today set the record for the longest-continuous speech in the House, going back at least to 1909\nContinue watching LIVE on C-SPAN https://t.co/uNLfEP8AKE pic.twitter.com/Irzw1FoSUo\n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 7, 2018\nPelosi’s stand was coordinated with protests by pro-amnesty groups against Trump’s alleged “white supremacy.” Her speech may also have been aimed at impressing Democrats with her strength and stamina, in the midst of speculation that she could be forced to step down, either before or after the November midterm elections.\nRepublicans have made Pelosi a prime target in congressional races, and will privately welcome her extended tenure in leadership.\nJoel B.

    "body": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” syndicated radio talker and CRTV host Mark Levin slammed ranking House Intelligence Committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for the criticism he leveled against his Republican-controlled committee’s handling of an investigation into alleged collusion in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAccording to Levin, given Schiff’s focus on President Donald Trump and his associates and not those of Hillary Clinton that had reported dealings with Russia showed he was the “shill for Russia.”\n\n“Mr. Schiff is a shill for the Russian government,” he said. “And I’m going to tell you why it is Schiff who is a propagandist for the Russian government despite his spending unreleased left-wing TV shows. He put out a list of 30 more interviews he wants to do, even though the Republicans on the committee so there’s no collusion. And he mentions Reince Priebus, Stephen Miller, K. T. McFarland, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, a bunch of consultants, people with the Trump organization. Some of Trump’s lawyers, somebody that runs a group, Christian right activists. Of course, he wants Donald Trump, Jr. to kick around. He wants Jared Kushner to kick around, family members — on and on and on.”\n\nLevin went on to note Schiff wasn’t looking to subpoena Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Susan Rice, the FISA Court judges and others, which made Schiff’s motives questionable and therefore made him to be the one schilling for Russia.\n\nLevin also called on Schiff to take a lie detector test over leaks to the media coming from the House Intelligence Committee to determine if Schiff is responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I have a challenge for you, Mr. Schiff — why don’t you take a lie detector test?” Levin said. “Why don’t you take a lie detector test so the American people can be sure that you, all over TV, ubiquitous, you might as well be on airport radar and sonograms. You’re everywhere, sir. You tell us you don’t leak, okay. Take a lie detector test because I believe you do. Comey leaked. Deputy FBI director McCabe — leaker.

    "body": "Holistic analysis of the Justice Department (DOJ) and FBI’s interconnected and ostensible investigations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump amount to “the worst abuse of political power in American history related to elections,” according to Tom Del Beccaro.\nDel Beccaro, an attorney and contributor to Forbes, joined Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak to discuss his recently published – and continually updated – timeline of events, entitled “Biased FBI and DOJ Officials Broke the Law and Tried to Decide the Election.”\n“The DOJ [and] the entire Obama administration wound down the Hillary email crisis in time for her to really run for office and then ramped up the attacks on candidate Trump to stop him from being president,” said Del Beccaro.\nAs president, Barack Obama signaled to his administration officials that Hillary Clinton was not to be meaningfully investigated for her felonious use of a private email system during her tenure as secretary of state, said Del Beccaro.\n“The FBI was sort of just going through the motions with Hillary, and it’s about March or April, and suddenly the election heats up, and Obama goes on TV, and he says, with Chris Wallace, basically, that she didn’t intend to do anything [wrong]; she didn’t want to harm us,” said Del Beccaro. “That’s  irrelevant to the crime she committed of possessing classified information in an insecure environment. So he announces this, and once he does, the DOJ and the FBI then change their speed [of] work and the manner in which they’re working, the things that they’re doing, and between April and June, they exonerate her, and what I mean by that is they change the language in the memo as to whether she was doing something wrong from ‘gross negligence’ of a crime to … ‘extreme carelessness.’ That’s irrelevant. That’s not legal language: ‘extreme carelessness.’”\nObama’s endorsement of Clinton in May 2016 – while the FBI was ostensibly investigating the former first lady for her handling of classified information and evasion of federal record-keeping laws – suggests the FBI’s running of a “sham investigation” of Clinton’s email conduct, said Del Beccaro.\n\n\n\n\nObama’s first campaign appearance with Clinton was July 5, 2016, the same day former FBI Director James Comey publicly advised against an indictment of Clinton for criminal handling of classified information.\n“Early May, [Obama] endorses her, [and] it’s very rare in our history for a president to endorse in a divided primary within his own party,” said Del Beccaro. “If there wasn’t a sham investigation going on, why would he take a risk endorsing a candidate under investigation by the FBI when on its face she broke the law? His first appearance with her [was] on the afternoon of July 5. You know what happened on the morning of July 5? James Comey goes on TV to exonerate her. This cannot be coincidental.”\n“Seems pretty much like they knew what they were doing to me, don’t you think?” asked Del Beccaro, rhetorically.\nObama kept tabs on the surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign and associates via intelligence briefings, said Del Beccaro. The FBI’s surveillance of Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were considered a counterintelligence operation, not a criminal investigation. \n“What happens every morning for a president, the first thing that he gets?” asked Del Beccaro. “His intelligence briefing is put together by the FBI, the NSA, [and other intelligence agencies]. So Obama was able to keep track of everything.”\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance of Carter Page, said Del Beccaro, was done for the purpose of monitoring Trump and his presidential campaign. Carter Page was no longer a campaign operative for Trump when the FBI resumed its surveillance of him in 2016.\n“[Carter Page] is a Russophile; he wants to do business there,” said Del Beccaro. “He’s a promoter of himself and those kinda things. What’s really important here [is that] he had been working with the FBI in 2015 on investigations of other people, so our government knew exactly who this guy was all along. The fact that he went to Russia again in the summer of 2016 while he is an adviser to the Trump campaign, to me, is just a ruse. They needed someone to do something so that they could start the spying, and once you start spying on one, you can spread it just a bit. So I think he’s just a straw horse for them to do a wider spying operation.”\nComey lied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) when presenting fraudulent information composed by Christopher Steele (the “Steele dossier”) as evidence in pursuit of a surveillance warrant, said Del Beccaro.\n“When James Comey is doing this application and he puts this dossier in, he has to say to the court, ‘This is valid evidence. This is good evidence for you to use,'” said Del Beccaro. “Of course, we now know that at two different times in 2017, he said it was never validated. You cannot have both of those positions at the same time. He clearly lied to the FISA court by trumping up this evidence. That’s how they started this spying operation.”\nClinton violated campaign finance laws by using a law firm as an intermediary through which to pay Fusion GPS for opposition research on Trump, said Del Beccaro. \n\n\n\n\n“Hillary lied on her campaign finance disclosure by paying the law firm in May to start the dossier,” said Del Beccaro. “If she hadn’t had done that lie, it would have come out that she was paying Fusion GPS in May, and then reporters could have challenged her and asked, ‘What is this for?’ It’s a clear campaign violation.”\nOriginally published at Forbes, Del Beccaro’s timeline has moved to Political Vanguard as an ongoing project with regular updates.\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

If we cannot defend our borders and maintain our security, he has said, then our hard-won liberties – like the freedom of movement in the EU – will be in jeopardy,” Kovács wrote.\n\n“That we’re finally calling them by name signals a step in the right direction,” adds the Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy in a blog post which noted how Hungary was attacked by figures and organisations including the BBC for daring highlight the issue of ‘no-go’ areas.\n\n\nNo-Go Zones: UK Govt Warns People Travelling to Sweden Beware ‘Gang Crime, Shootings, and Explosions’   https://t.co/EbBpfyl7im\n\n— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2018\n\nDespite the public broadcaster having itself produced a documentary entitled No Go Britain, which looked at parts of London “where people are just too scared to go – particularly at night”, BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis told a Hungarian minister it was “just ridiculous” to claim that there are crime-ridden, migrant-occupied regions of the UK where people fear for their safety.\n\nJust before the New Year, Breitbart London reported how London delivery drivers have described large parts of the capital as “no-go zones” in which they are too afraid to work as a result of rampant knife crime and acid attacks.\n\nBreitbart London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam has written a book on No-Go Zones, which can be found here.",

Such orders allow firearms to be confiscated with a judge’s approval.\n\nThe White House suggests that ERPOs “allow law enforcement, with approval from a court, to remove firearms from individuals who are a demonstrated threat to themselves or others and temporarily to prevent individuals from purchasing new firearms.” They stressed that the orders “should be carefully tailored to ensure the due process rights of law-abiding citizens are protected.”\n\nCalifornia adopted similar gun confiscation laws in 2015 and Southern California Public Radio reports that 190 orders requiring confiscation were issued 2016-2017 alone.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed California-style confiscation orders into law on Friday and the White House is urging other states to follow suit.\n\nOn March 1, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence took pains to focus on the need to guard “due process” in issuing ERPOs. Trump responded to Pence’s statement by saying, “Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Paul Gosar (R-AZ)31 Jan 20180\t\t\t\t31 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\t31 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAt a press conference before the President’s State of the Union speech, Nancy Pelosi said my request to enforce federal law was “outside the circle of decency in terms of members of Congress.” Man that is rich.\nBut it makes sense. Today we have men who say they are really women. We have multi-millionaire athletes complaining about how bad our country is. We have school teachers claiming our military is made up of low IQ bad people.\nSo it makes sense in a world of indecency and hypocrisy that my request to enforce the law is “indecent.” It makes sense that Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Jeff Flake work harder for non-citizens then citizens and taxpayers. It makes sense that, pointing out that a country with no borders is not a country, makes me an “indecent” xenophobe.\nI’ll continue to fight for our nation. Our borders. Our security. I’ll stand with the taxpayers and those who honor our laws. I’ll happily be chastised by the immoral leftists who despise our great nation and our laws.\nWhat is truly indecent is an open violation of our laws in the sanctity of our nation’s Capitol. Corruption and poverty follows where the Rule of Law is ignored. I will oppose the ongoing violation of our values as long as I can. I believe in an America that values lawful behavior and welcomes immigrants with talent and a burning desire to make our country great.\nIf your first act in our country is to violate our laws, I say you have no respect for our nation and don’t belong here. Tens of millions of people immigrated here lawfully, many waiting years and paying thousands of dollars. Citizenship is a privilege that can’t be stolen. Those who think it can, like Nancy Pelosi and her ilk, are the truly indecent ones.\n\n\n\n\nPaul A.

    "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions will speak Wednesday about his Department of Justice’s (DOJ) first-of-its-kind lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of three of California’s “sanctuary” laws, Breitbart News has learned.\nRelying on both federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, DOJ will ask the U.S. District Court for the District of Eastern California to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of these laws intended to protect illegal aliens by preventing cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. DOJ will also seek declaratory judgement that these laws are unconstitutional – “preempted” by federal immigration law – when it files late Tuesday night.\n\n“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,” Attorney General Sessions is expected to tell a gathering of California police officers Wednesday in Sacramento. “We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America. And I believe that we are going to win.”\n\nThe defendants are the State of California, Gov. Jerry Brown, and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra – the elected official who, perhaps more than any other, has made protection of criminal illegal aliens and “resistance” to President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda his signature policy.\n\nThe doctrine of “preemption” dictates that, as federal law reigns supreme over state law, states may not enforce laws that frustrate federal policies. It has a long history, dating back nearly to the dawn of the Republic with 1819’s McCulloch v. Maryland. In the immigration context, the doctrine was widely heralded by open borders advocates in 2012, when the Supreme Court relied on it to strike down sections of Arizona’s tough SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration bill in Arizona v. U.S.\n\nThe legal shoe is on the other foot now, as the Trump administration seeks to have California’s leading-edge sanctuary laws overturned on a similar theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three laws, passed in response to Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election, added new dimensions to California’s role as the nation’s leading “sanctuary” for illegal aliens. Not content with being merely a typical sanctuary jurisdiction, where, as a matter of policy, police do not contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents about suspected illegal aliens, collect information on an arrestee’s immigration status, or comply with requests to hold suspected illegal aliens for ICE pickup, California enacted HB 450, SB 54, and HB 103.\n\nHB 450 came into effect at the beginning of the year. It prohibits private employers from cooperating with ICE. Under the law, if employers do not refuse to allow ICE officials onto their property without a warrant, they face stiff fines. If they try to check an employee’s immigration status a second time, they face fines. If they do not inform employees of ICE enforcement efforts about which they know, they face fines.\n\nDuring the first round of ICE raids after HB 450 went into effect, Becerra was very clear that his office “will prosecute” employers who cooperate.\n\nIn the case of HB 450, the California State Assembly’s Judiciary Committee made clear they were passing this law specifically because of “an expected increase in federal immigration enforcement.”\n\nSB 54, also coming into effect January 1, affects law enforcement officials, holding them statewide to the “sanctuary” standard previously in place in cities like San Francisco under penalty of state law. Under HB 54, California’s police officers and sheriffs cannot provide ICE with the release dates of the criminal illegal aliens whom they are holdings. Except for those held for a narrow set of serious crimes, these law enforcement officers cannot transfer detainees to federal custody voluntarily.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, AB 103 is a 2017 law Becerra has used to “inspect” facilities the Department of Homeland Security uses to house suspected illegal aliens who are awaiting removal proceedings. DOJ believes these inspections have demanded access to proprietary DHS documents and information.\n\nThe government will first seek to have a preliminary injunction put in place to block enforcement of all three laws while their constitutionality is considered. DOJ will therefore have to show some irreparable harm that will come from allowing California to use these laws in the meantime. Senior DOJ officials were confident that, with a typical briefing schedule, they expect a ruling on their preliminary injunction within weeks.",

    "body": "The “Russiagate” collusion theory took a huge blow this week, as the House Intelligence Committee’s probe into Russia meddling came to an end.\nWhile the special counsel probe continues, the House Intelligence Committee’s conclusion of “no collusion” underscored the lack of any evidence to date of any such activities.\n\n“The collusion conspiracy theory is breaking down. There is no evidence of collusion at this point after year-plus investigations in the House and Senate. [Rep. Adam Schiff] claimed a year ago he had more than circumstantial evidence of collusion, but he still can’t produce it,” said a source involved in Congress’s Russia investigations.\n\n“And we’ve seen nothing on collusion from [special counsel Robert] Mueller. In addition, everyone now knows the Steele dossier is a fraud, and that the FBI was using it anyway. So the only thing sustaining the collusion narrative now is the media’s complicity in it.”\n\nDemocrats on the committee complained they just were not allowed to dig deep enough — after more than a year of investigating and 73 witness interviews. They have vowed to keep investigating, although without the power to compel witnesses or documents, it is hard to imagine they will make much progress.\n\nAnd they continue to argue that disparate incidents amounted to collusion — a London professor telling Trump volunteer campaign aide George Papadopoulos that the Russians had thousands of emails that were embarrassing to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Jr. showing receptivity by accepting a meeting with a Russian lawyer who purportedly had dirt on Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the lead Republican on the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), dismissed that idea, telling reporters after the committee’s conclusion was announced:\n\nOnly Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn or someone else like that could take this series of inadvertent contacts with each other, or meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a fictional page-turner spy thriller. But we’re not dealing with fiction, we’re dealing with facts. And we found no evidence of any collusion, of anything that people were actually doing, other than taking a meeting they shouldn’t have taken or inadvertently being in the same building.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blow to Democrats is the loss of the probe as a political vehicle ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), had become a cable news fixture talking about Russia collusion and suspected leaker to CNN about the probe. The RNC tracked Schiff’s TV interviews in the last 13 months about the probe at 227.\n\n“It’s not shocking that the person most upset by the outcome had used the investigation to launch his TV career,” Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told the Washington Examiner.\n\nSchiff also tried to fundraise off of the Russia probe, claiming in one campaign ad that Trump and his “friends at Breitbart” were going after him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees continue their investigations, the top Democrats on those committees have been nowhere near as vocal or partisan. And there are no signs that either committee has found any collusion yet. In October, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) told reporters that he had no “initial findings” on collusion, ten months after the investigation began.\n\nContrary to Trump critics’ fears and accusations, the end of the House probe does not appear to affect the special counsel’s investigation. According to the New York Times, Mueller opened a new avenue of inquiry in recent weeks, requesting all documents related to Russia from the Trump Organization, despite the president’s warning Mueller to stay out of his finances.\n\nBut Andrew McCarthy, senior fellow at the National Review and a former prosecutor, said any evidence of collusion found by the special counsel would have likely leaked by now. He also noted that indictments against former National Security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, his business associate Rick Gates, and former volunteer campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have not been related to collusion.\n\n“If you look at the charging instruments that Mueller has filed, the indictments and information that’s come out, the guilty pleas that have come out,” he said, “he’s even got guys who clearly have connections with Russia, like Papadopoulos and Flynn and Manafort and Gates, and there’s not a whisper in any of these charges that there was a conspiracy between Trump and Russia.”\n\nThe ending of the House Intelligence Committee probe could mean a second special counsel, however, now that House Republican lawmakers have more time to investigate potential misbehavior at the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has said the committee will continue to investigate FISA abuse, the unmasking of Americans’ names in intelligence reports, the origins and use of the Trump dossier, and intelligence community leaks.\n\nAdditionally, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), House Intelligence Committee member and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, recently requested — along with House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) — that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint a second special counsel.\n\nThat request has now been echoed by four senators, including the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, increasing the chances that it will happen, or that a DOJ prosecutor will be assigned to investigate the matter.\n\nA second special counsel could ensure that any investigation into the DOJ and FBI continues, even if Democrats take the House in the 2018 midterm elections, which, historically, they are favored to do, as the opposing party of an incumbent president.\n\nHowever, the pressure is on House Republicans to do as much as they can before that might happen, McCarthy noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s a limited number of legislative days that they have left in an election year,” he said. “If they lose control of the House, the investigation’s over because the Democrats will kill the investigation.”",

    "body": "Two leading Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a redacted top secret email Monday that Obama administration National Security Advisor Susan Rice appears to have sent herself just minutes after President Donald Trump took office.\nThe email contains Rice’s impressions from a January 5, 2017 meeting on “Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential election” between then-President Barack Obama, then-FBI Director James Comey, and “intelligence community leadership.”\nAccording to Rice, President Obama and Comey had a “follow-on conversation” after the formal meeting during which Obama told Comey that “from a national security perspective” he wanted “to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.” President Obama then asked Comey to inform him of any changes that would affect how his White House should share classified information with the incoming Trump administration.\nSeperately, Rice claims Obama told Comey that  he wanted the Russia investigation handled “by the book” and that “from a law enforcement perspective” he was not “asking about, initiating or instructing anything.”\nRice herself claims to have been present at the meeting and to have stayed for this “follow-on conversation,” along with then-Vice President Joe Biden, and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who weeks later would become a darling of the left-leaning press after she was fired over her refusal to enforce President Trump’s first travel ban on certain terror-prone Muslim majority countries.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee obtained the email from the National Archives as part of its investigation into potential political bias and influence in the FBI’s handling of the “Russia investigation” and the infamous Fusion GPS “dossier” that was used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant on one-time Trump associate Carter Page.\n\n\n\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee chairman, announced their discovery of the email Monday when they released a letter they addressed to Rice on February 8. The two senators tell Rice:\nIt strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation.  In addition, despite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed “by the book,” substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed “by the book.” \nThe public version of the letter includes a redacted version of Rice’s email indicating it once held a “top secret” classification. The letter makes reference to an unredacted still-classified version of the email.\n2018-02-08 CEG LG to Rice (Russia Investigation Email) by Breitbart News on Scribd\n\nGrassley and Graham are demanding Rice provide their Committee answers about her email by a February 22 deadline. The questions included are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1. Did you send the email attached to this letter to yourself? Do you have any reason to dispute the timestamp of the email?\n2. When did you first become aware of the FBI’s investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia?\n3. When did you become aware of any surveillance activities, including FISA applications, undertaken by the FBI in conducting that investigation? At the time you wrote this email to yourself, were you aware of either the October 2016 FISA application for surveillance of Carter Page or the January 2017 renewal?\n4. Did anyone instruct, request, suggest, or imply that you should send yourself the aforementioned Inauguration Day email memorializing President Obama’s meeting with Mr. Comey about the Trump/Russia investigation? If so, who and why?\n5. Is the account of the January 5, 2017 meeting presented in your email accurate? Did you omit any other portions of the conversation?\n6. Other than that email, did you document the January 5, 2017 meeting in any way, such as contemporaneous notes or a formal memo? To the best of your knowledge, did anyone else at that meeting take notes or otherwise memorialize the meeting?\n7. During the meeting, did Mr. Comey or Ms. Yates mention potential press coverage of the Steele dossier? If so, what did they say?\n8. During the meeting, did Mr. Comey describe the status of the FBI’s relationship with Mr. Steele, or the basis for that status?\n9. When and how did you first become aware of the allegations made by Christopher Steele?\n10. When and how did you first become aware that the Clinton Campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded Mr. Steele’s efforts?\n11. You wrote that President Obama stressed that he was “not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective.” Did President Obama ask about, initiate, or instruct anything from any other perspective relating to the FBI’s investigation?\n12. Did President Obama have any other meetings with Mr. Comey, Ms. Yates, or other government officials about the FBI’s investigation of allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russia? If so, when did these occur, who participated, and what was discussed?\nThe January 5, 2017 meeting Rice references in her email would have occurred just months after, as Rice herself has admitted, she “unmasked” certain Trump campaign members’ communications during the transition.\nRice, who in her retirement from public service has taken up a research post at American University, has remained critical of the Trump administration’s foreign policy, but has largely refrained from weighing in on the Russia investigation.",

Kerry reportedly added that Abbas should “stay strong in his spirit and play for time, that he will not break and will not yield to President Trump’s demands.”\nEver imagining that he is the one man who can broker a long-dreamed-of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Kerry added that it was time for Abbas to present his own peace plan. “Maybe it is time for the Palestinians to define their peace principles and present a positive plan,” Kerry purportedly said.\nKerry, who took over as Obama’s secretary of state when Hillary Clinton vacated the position, confided that deep state insiders in the Department of State and the U.S. intelligence community do not like President Trump. He also allegedly urged Abbas to launch personal attacks on Trump meant to enrage the president and force him to make errors.\nThe failed 2004 Democratic candidate for president also said he does not feel his advanced age is a problem for another bid for the White House. Were he to actually win the presidency in 2020, Kerry would be 77 years old on inauguration day, and that would make him the oldest president in U.S. history.\n\n\n\n\nKerry’s alleged assurances to the Palestinian strongman that the U.S. would soon be able to acquiesce to Palestinian Authority demands are reminiscent of the time then-President Barack Obama was heard on an open mic assuring Russian President Dmitri Medvedev that after he was safely re-elected, he would be better able to bow to Vladimir Putin’s demands.\nThe former Massachusetts senator’s secret visit aimed at undermining U.S. foreign policy in favor of an enemy is also reminiscent of another Massachusetts senator’s secret efforts to aid an enemy. In 1983, Sen. Ted Kennedy sent overtures to the Soviet Union promising his help in undermining the policies of President Ronald Reagan if only the USSR would, in return, help him launch a successful bid to beat back Reagan’s re-election and place Kennedy in the White House.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.",

We will not be bargaining chips for the criminalization and deportation of other immigrants.

Kasich responded:\nI don’t think they should be citizens, but I think they should be able to be here, yes, and live in our country. But the idea that we would try to just go round them up… and look, these stories where these ICE agents are going into people’s homes, to me, that’s not my country. That’s not the way that I think we should handle these things. I think it’s dead wrong. [Emphasis added]\n\nMy podcast: John Kasich speaks to a different side of the Republican Party https://t.co/RxeRDwMvoQ via @Audioboom\n— JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) February 2, 2018\nEarlier in the interview, Kasich said he opposed President Trump’s popular, pro-American views on immigration, favoring a multicultural society.\n“I happen to believe that a society that allows people to come in with kind of different views, different attitudes, different beliefs, strengthens your country, it doesn’t weaken your country,” Kasich said.\nKasich’s open borders views remain out-of-tune with the majority of Americans who, when polled this week, said they want to see the construction of Trump’s planned wall for the U.S.-Mexico border, as Breitbart News reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, a plurality of Americans said they want to see legal immigration levels reduced to one to 250,000 legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. a year – a plan that would raise the wages of American workers while increasing the quality of life and decreasing the immigration burden for America’s working and middle-class communities.\nWhen asked, “In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year,” 48 percent of black Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris poll said they would like to see between one and 250,000 legal immigrants brought to the U.S. a year.\n\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.\n\n\n\n\n\nMass legal immigration to the U.S. has come at the expense of America’s working and middle class, which has suffered from poor job growth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs to offset the importation of millions of low-skilled foreign nationals.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He wouldn't come down. Here's my Facebook Live coverage: https://t.co/FzxOyljoK5 pic.twitter.com/PxjoALcyn8\n— Michael Moore (@MMFlint) November 13, 2016\n\n“I’m going to join the people who’ve formed a protest of this racist, sociopath on his way to the White House,” Moore said in a widely-viewed Facebook Live video at the time.\nThe filmmaker had attempted to gain access to Trump Tower during the protest, but was rebuffed by Secret Service agents, as Breitbart News reported.\n\n\n\n\nHe later left a note with a doorman that read: “Mr. Trump. I’m here. I want to talk with you.”\nMoore has previously accused Trump of colluding with the Russians during the 2016 campaign. In a March post to his Instagram account, the filmmaker called on Democrats to announce a “national emergency” until such time as the FBI could determine the extent of the allegations.\n“No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation,” Moore wrote. “His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI – and an independent investigative committee — discovers the truth.”\nMoore most recently appeared at the “People’s State of the Union,” a rally organized by celebrity critics of the Trump administration held the day before the president’s first State of the Union address.\n“The need to remove him — and also any Democrat who is in the way of removing him — that is, at this point, a moral imperative for each and every one of us,” he said at the event. “Removing him, and Pence, and the whole disgusting lot of them… still won’t be enough. We must remove and replace the system and the culture that gave us Trump in the first place.”\n\n\n\n\n \nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",

Pollak25 Jan 20180\t\t\t\t25 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\t25 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA photograph of then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that was taken in 2005 at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, has been released after a 13-year cover-up to protect Obama’s political career.\nJournalist Askia Muhammad told TriceEdneyWire.com that he took the photograph after Obama had engaged “in a warm conversation with constituent and fellow Chicagoan Minister Louis Farrakhan.” However, he realized that the photograph could endanger Obama’s presidential ambitions, which were already being widely discussed.\nFarrakhan is a black supremacist and antisemite who also holds anti-gay views. Rumors of an association between Obama and Farrakhan circulated during the 2008 presidential campaign in the wake of revelations about Obama’s decades-long membership in the Trinity United Church of Christ, led by the racist preacher Jeremiah Wright. Those rumors could not be substantiated, however — and the story of Muhammad’s long-hidden photograph explains why.\nAsia told TraceEdneyWire.com that he was confronted by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus about the photograph, and that he eventually surrendered it to Farrakhan’s chief of staff. He secretly kept a copy of the image for himself, but he never told anyone and never released the image, for fear of burglary or retaliation against him, he told the left-wing Talking Points Memo website.\nHe told TraceEdneyWire.com that he believed the photograph would have destroyed Obama’s electoral chances:\n“I gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy,” Muhammad said in an exclusive interview with the Trice Edney News Wire this week. “But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover.”\nAs for any debate that the photo could have made a difference in the outcome of the Obama presidential election, Muhammad is emphatic: “I insist. It absolutely would have made a difference.”\nThe photograph also includes “Minister Farrakhan’s son-in-law, Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad; His son and security chief, Mustapha Farrakhan; Minister Farrakhan’s son Joshua Farrakhan; and the Rev. Willie Wilson, executive producer of the program for Farrakhan’s Million Man March in 1995 and a chairman of the 20th anniversary,” according to  told Talking Points Memo that he felt more at ease about the photograph after Farrakhan publicly revealed in 2016 that he had met with then-Senator Obama, and he obtained Farrakhan’s permission to publish the photograph as he was preparing a memoir last year.\nThe late NBC journalist Tim Russert asked then-candidate Obama at a 2008 debate in Cleveland, Ohio whether he accepted Farrakhan’s public support. Obama responded by claiming he had denounced Farrakhan and had “consistently distanced” himself from him.\nObamas said:\nYou know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan’s antisemitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can’t censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we’re not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.\n…\nI live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I’ve been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him.\nObama did not explicitly reject Farrakhan’s support.\nThere are other, similar instances in which Obama claimed to have had no association with radicals and was later discovered to have lied. For example, Obama claimed during the 2008 campaign that he had no continuing links with former Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers, with whom Obama had served on a board in the 1990s. Breitbart News discovered that then-Sen. Obama had attended a barbecue at Ayers’s home in Chicago in July 2005.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Breitbart News launched an investigative series, “The Vetting,” devoted to uncovering those aspects of Barack Obama’s past that the media had overlooked or deliberately hidden. The Muhammad photograph proves that there was a rich mine of information that was withheld from the public to protect Obama’s career and policy goals.\nJoel B.

He talks about Africans’ weaknesses frankly.”\nIn a later tweet, Museveni reiterated his message, arguing that “Africans need to solve their problems.”\n“Donald Trump speaks to Africa frankly.

Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?”\n\nWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2017\nIn the months since that tweet, everything Trump suggested has been proven correct.\nThanks to congressional investigators (and no thanks to a media that has worked overtime to stop these facts from coming out), we now know that 1) some of the most salacious and discredited details in the dossier came from Russian operatives. 2) Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign paid millions of dollars for the phony dossier. 3) the FBI also funded the dossier by hiring its author, former-British spy Christopher Steele, who was determined to see Trump defeated in the presidential election.\nMoreover, even disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey has declared the dossier “salacious and unverified.” Unless you want to count mundane details that do not matter, in the months since October, despite billions of corporate media dollars being spent to verify the dossier, still nothing is verified in what we now know is a political document paid for by Democrats to spy on their political opponent, which, to their disgrace, the FBI did.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s tweet was dead on accurate — every single point in it, every word. And yet, here is CNN’s left-wing Cillizza smearing Trump as “crazy” and bonkers,” even though CNN had no way of knowing if his tweet was or was not accurate [emphasis added]:\nThe bigger issue — at least to me — is that Trump is suggesting that the dossier itself was funded by some combination of a foreign power, the opposition political party and a federal law enforcement agency.\nIt’s easy to roll your eyes at the very suggestion and dismiss that idea as just Trump being Trump. “You guys always take him literally,” Trump’s supporters will say. “You shouldn’t.\nBut here’s the thing: President Trump is, um, the President. Which means he is held to the same standard every past president is held to. And by that standard, this tweet is crazy.\n…\nThe point here is that it is deeply irresponsible for a president of the United States to even flirt with this sort of conspiracy talk. You can love Donald Trump and still believe that the idea that the Russians, the Democrats and the FBI co-funded a dossier designed to discredit Trump’s 2016 campaign is totally bonkers.\nWithout knowing the facts, CNN declaring Trump “crazy” and “bonkers” is, of course, more evidence of the Climate of Hate the last-place cable channel has been building around Trump for almost two years.\nThe failing network has been working overtime to plant the idea that Trump is a unique danger to America, or as CNN anti-Trump commentator Jake Tapper regularly puts it, Trump is “un-American,” “unpatriotic,” “unmoored,” and “unhinged.”\nDespite the Daily Caller calling Cillizza and CNN out for this false reporting, nothing has been updated, corrected, or retracted.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Because that’s another system. Because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early. Like, in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida, he had a lot of firearms — they saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So, you could do exactly what you’re saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on  More Stories About:\n\t\t2nd Amendment, Breitbart TV, Donald Trump, due process, gun control",

This is in addition to notices of inspection issued to 77 businesses in northern California just weeks ago.\nOne hundred and ninety-five of the 212 arrested included convicted criminals, those who failed to leave the United States after being issued a final order of removal, and those who returned to the U.S. after being removed.\nMore than 55 percent of those arrested were serious or violent felons or had been convicted on significant or multiple misdemeanors. Their crimes include child sex crimes, weapons charges, and assault.\nICE Deputy Director Thomas D. Homan remarked:\nBecause sanctuary jurisdictions like Los Angeles prevent ICE from arresting criminal aliens in the secure confines of a jail, our officers are forced to conduct at-large arrests in the community, putting officers, the general public and the aliens at greater risk and increasing the incidents of collateral arrests.\nICE focuses its enforcement efforts on individuals who “pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security.” This does not mean that any class of illegal aliens are exempt from enforcement actions.\n\n\n\n\nNotices of inspection went to a variety of businesses. “A notice of inspection alerts business owners that ICE is going to audit their hiring records to determine whether or not they are in compliance with the law,” according to ICE. “If the businesses are found to not be in compliance with the law, they will face civil fines and potential criminal prosecution.”\nHoman added:\nFewer jail arrests mean more arrests on the street, and that also requires more resources, which is why we are forced to send additional resources to those areas to meet operational needs and officer safety. Consistent with our public safety mission, 88 percent of those arrested during this operation were convicted criminals.\nSome of the 212 arrested this week will face federal criminal prosecution, while others will be processed for removal from the United States.\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",

Bush and President Barack Obama failed to implement.\nTrump said:\nBut if they don’t take them back, we’ll put sanctions on the countries. We’ll put tariffs on the countries. They’ll take them back so fast your head will spin. We’ll just tariff their goods coming in, and they’ll take them back in two seconds. You have a lot of people from those countries, and they’ll take them back. [Emphasis added]\nWe’ve had a very weak policy. We bring them back; they say, “We don’t want them.” And why should they? They killed five people. Why would they want them? And we will do something with regard to sanctions and tariffs, where they will — your head will spin how fast they get taken back. Okay? Every country is the same.\nAnd the other is, we give a lot of aid to some of those countries. And to those countries, we’ll stop giving aid, and they will take them back instantaneously. Okay? You just have to let us know just who they are. A lot of ways to handle it. But you can only handle it economically, because otherwise — you know, you’re not going to force them in. And that’s so easy to solve. It sounded difficult, but it’s not. That’s an easy one. [Emphasis added]\nAssistant Secretary of State Carl Risch said some of the worst offenders of not taking back their nationals include China, noting that a number of foreign countries have already been hit with sanctions by the State Department.\n“The worst offenders, numerically — countries like China, for example, has a long history of not taking back their removal cases,” Risch said. “But most recently, in September, we started a visa sanction plan with Guinea, Eritrea, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia. And we’re seeing some progress there. The visa sanctions do work in these cases, sir.  And we’re seeing that there are people going back to these countries that would not have gone back a year or two ago.”\nAs Breitbart News reported, Trump’s State Department hit Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Cambodia, and Guinea with sanctions back in mid-2017 after the countries would not take back their nationals from the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nThe move by the Trump administration comes in the form of a “visa suspension,” where foreign nationals are barred from entering the U.S. on any of the various visa programs.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Yanez is now a graduate of the University of Houston, where he was a student when he contributed to the Times.\nBut Yanez has since come to appreciate President Donald Trump and told Fox  Friends Weekend that he believes the Republican president has shown “leadership and compassion” toward him and other “Dreamers.”\n“Hilario Yanez, who goes by Eli, said Trump showed courage to tackle the illegal immigration issue comprehensively during his first year in office,” Fox reported.\n“Here’s a guy who wants to provide a pathway to citizenship for myself and really make a difference in my life,” said Yanez, who works as a technology analyst at Accenture Technology in Houston.\nYanez said, on the other hand, Democrat leaders have “no clear message” on immigration other than to “us[e] us as pawns,” Fox reported.\n\n\n\n\nTrump has proposed an immigration framework that would provide amnesty and an eventual pathway to citizenship to 1.8 million illegal aliens. His plan also includes more border security, an end to the lottery visa system, and an end to chain migration, which allows legal immigration based on family relations.\nYanez also told Fox he would support a border wall and said he is in favor of skilled-based immigration law, even if his mother, who brought him to the United States illegally when he was one-year-old, would probably not qualify under such a system.\n“I think it’s time for people who want to come to the United States to focus … on skills so [they] contribute to the American economy right way,” Yanez, who was born in Mexico, told Fox.\nYanez said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) should not shut down the federal government over DACA.\n“There is plenty of time on the table to fix this,” Yanez told Fox. “March 5 is the deadline.”\n\n\n\n\nYanez also said, if asked, he would serve in the U.S. military.\n“I thank God for being homeless, growing up without a father, living in a rough neighborhood, and most importantly for being undocumented,” Yanez wrote in the Times. “These struggles and challenges have made me the person I am today.”\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter",

Rick Scott (R), among others. Hoffman was a major contributor to the George W. Bush presidential campaign. He also donated more than $1 million to a PAC supporting Jeb Bush’s failed presidential campaign bid.\nHoffman wrote, “For how many years now have we been doing this — having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings — and how many years has it been that nothing’s been done? It’s the end of the road for me.” He added, “I will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons. Enough is enough!”\nHoffman did not define an “assault weapon,” did not say whether it is a set type of firearm or just any rifle that has the cosmetic features banned by Democrats from 1994-2004. It must be noted that the Democrat ban did not ban the rifles, only the cosmetic features. Is that what Hoffman has in mind?\nOr is Hoffman focused on the semiautomatic action of “assault weapons.” If so, will semiautomatic handguns have to be banned to appease him as well?\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Eleven percent of Americans say they are unsure what contributed to the occurrence of the mass shooting.\n\nWhen the sample group was adjusted so as to focus only on Americans “who have children of elementary or secondary school age,” the percentage of Americans who cite government failure as causal jumped to 61 and the percentage who blamed guns dropped to 23.\n\nOn February 23 Breitbart News summarized government’s failure:\n\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBCSO) received 911 calls about Nikolas Cruz in November 2017. The calls referenced violence and erratic behavior. CNN reports that in one of the calls with the host family, with whom Cruz was living after the death of his mother, told PBCSO they feared Cruz was going to turn a gun on the family. The family member told deputies that Cruz was “buying “tons of ammo” and had allegedly put “put [a] gun to others heads in the past.” No charges were filed, no arrest made.\nOn January 5, 2018, the FBI received a tip describing “Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” The FBI did not act on the tip.\nOn February 14 Cruz attacked students and unarmed teachers in Stoneman Douglas High. A report from CNN claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were at the school as the attack was taking place but not one of them entered the school. On February 22 Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told ABC 13 that video showed deputy Scott Peterson by building 12 on campus, yet Peterson never went inside to confront Cruz. The CNN report quotes Coral Springs sources that claim there were actually four Broward County deputies on scene who did not enter the building.\n\nAdditionally, Breitbart News reported that Broward County Sheriff’s deputy Scott Peterson was outside the school’s building 12 while the attack occurred. He never went in to confront Nikolas Cruz.\n\nOn the other hand, the 19-year-old who attacked the school complied with gun control laws in acquiring his rifle. He passed a background check at a gun store just as the law demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school was gun-free zone, and he ignored that, as criminals regularly ignore laws that would otherwise hinder them from carrying out their crimes.  The school was also an ammunition-free zone, but Cruz ignored that too.\n\nHe also ignored statutes against murder.\n\nWhat difference would once more law have made?\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

    "body": "George W. Bush Praises Cheap Labor Immigration: ‘We Ought to Say Thank You and Welcome Them’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAP Photo/Seth Wenig\n\t\t\t\tby John Binder8 Feb 2018Washington, D.C.0\t\t\t\t8 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\t8 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFormer President George W. Bush praised the current inflow of illegal and legal immigrants to the United States, saying Americans should “say thank you” to immigrants and “welcome them.”\nAddressing a summit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Bush criticized President Trump’s decision to end the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gave temporary amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens.\n“America’s their home,” Bush said, according to the Associated Press. “They’ve got to get it fixed.”\nBush also explained how he tried to pass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens during his time in the White House, using mass immigration talking points often used by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and big business lobby to continue the inflow of more than one million mostly low-skilled illegal and legal immigrants arriving in the country every year.\n“There are people willing to do jobs that Americans won’t do,” Bush said. “Americans don’t want to pick cotton at 105 degrees (Fahrenheit), but there are people who want put food on their family’s tables and are willing to do that. We ought to say thank you and welcome them.”\nAutomation and robots are set to wipe out 30 percent of the U.S. workforce, though, as farmers and the agricultural industry mechanizes, needing less low-skilled labor.\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO\nBush’s suggestion that Americans are unwilling to do blue-collar jobs is not backed up by data collected and analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies.\nFor example, research by Steven Camarota found that of the more than 460 occupations analyzed, only four were dominated by foreign-born workers. Those four occupations accounted for less than one percent of the total U.S. workforce.\nIn jobs like housekeeping, construction work, butchers, and even taxi drivers, native-born Americans continue to make up the majority of the workforce.\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than one million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.\n\n\n\n\nMass legal immigration to the U.S. has come at the expense of America’s working and middle class, which has suffered from poor job growth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs to offset the importation of millions of low-skilled foreign nationals.\n\nFor blue-collar American workers, mass immigration has not only kept wages down, but in many cases, decreased wages, as Breitbart News reported. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues importing more foreign nationals against whom working-class Americans are forced to compete. In 2016, the U.S. brought in about 1.8 million mostly low-skilled immigrants.\nFor white-collar American workers, mass immigration has become a tool for the big business lobby, cheap labor industry, and Silicon Valley elites to replace U.S. citizens with cheaper foreign workers. For example, as Breitbart News reported, 71 percent of tech workers in coveted high-paying, white-collar Silicon Valley jobs are foreign-born, while the tech industry in the San Francisco, Oakland, and Hayward area is made up of 50 percent foreign-born tech workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian earning of full-time, year-round workers, 15 years and older, 1960 to 2016.\nThe massive importation of low-skilled foreign nationals to the U.S. has translated to a cheap labor economy that has aided in keeping American mens’ wages stagnant for at least 44 years, as Breitbart News reported. Median earnings for American men working full-time were actually lower in 2016 than they were in 2007.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",

The law exempted Homeland Security from dozens of laws if it deemed a wall to be in national security interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Tyler Houlton praised the decision by the San Diego court, saying that border walls “have proven to be extremely effective in preventing the flow of drugs and illegal aliens across our borders.”\n\n“Walls have worked in Yuma, Arizona and San Diego, California, where both areas have seen a 95 percent drop in attempted illegal border crossings,” Houlton said. “Simply put – walls work. The Department of Homeland Security looks forward to building the wall where our frontline operators say it is needed and in accordance with all applicable laws.”\n\nThe decision will allow the Trump administration to move forward on construction of the border wall, although the process to build the wall has been stuck in the prototype stage for nearly half a year with no clear vision of when the wall will actually be fully constructed and completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

    "body": "Interim San Francisco Mayor Mark Farrell is reportedly willing to go to jail to ensure his city always remains a “sanctuary city.”\nFarrell assured hundreds of amnesty activists last week who were blocking and protesting in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building that San Francisco will forever be a “sanctuary city.” He also, according to ABC7, “said he is willing to get arrested if that’s what it takes to defend sanctuary city policies,” echoing comments that Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf recently made.\n\nThe activists gathered to protest after ICE detained more than 200 illegal immigrants, nearly half of whom had criminal records, last week in various Bay Area raids. After Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tipped off illegal immigrants that ICE would be conducting sweeps, Thomas Homan, the agency’s acting director, said on last week that more than 800 illegal immigrants remained at large in the community because of Schaaf’s “irresponsible decision.”\n\nAccording to KTVU, the “Power, not Panic Emergency Response Committee” organized the emergency rally. The group is composed of entities like: the “ACLU, the Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership, Full Rights Equality  Empowerment SF, Contra Costa East Bay Interfaith Immigration Coalition, the Services, Immigrant Rights, and Education Network, Centro Legal de la Raza, the California Immigrant Policy Center.”\n\nThe activists had signs that read “ICE, go melt yourself,” “ICE out of CA,” “Stop Racist Deportations,” and “Sanctuary for All.” They also chanted “Shut down ICE.”\n\nICE said sanctuary cities like “San Francisco and Oakland force” the agency to “focus additional resources to conduct at-large arrests in the community, putting officers, the general public and aliens at greater risk and increasing the incidents of collateral arrests.” In 2015, an illegal immigrant who had been previously deported multiple times told authorities after he murdered Kate Steinle that he came to San Francisco because he knew it was a “sanctuary city.” Steinle’s tragic death allowed Donald Trump to make illegal immigration a national issue, which enabled him to surge to the front of the GOP field and never look back.\n\n\n\n\n\nICE also singled out two illegal immigrants currently believed to be living in Oakland who were not detained possibly because of Schaaf’s “irresponsible” alert:\n\na Honduran citizen who was previously arrested in San Francisco County multiple times for cocaine possession and transport, probation violations and sex with a minor under 16, and;\n\na citizen of Mexico who was previously arrested and convicted for carrying a loaded firearm, transportation and sale of narcotics and DUI.\n\nA recent NBC Bay Area investigation of the sanctuary city also found “more than 300 piles of feces and 100 drug needles” lining downtown San Francisco, and an infectious disease expert at U.C. Berkeley said the contamination is “much greater” than the slums in developing nations like India, Brazil, and Kenya.\n\n\nSan Francisco stands with our immigrant communities.

    "body": "After the first year of his presidency, Donald Trump’s shakeup of his presidential cabinet and West Wing advisors continues leaving even the most comfortable administration officials on edge.\n“I’ve gotten to know a lot of people very well over the last year,” Trump told reporters after firing Rex Tillerson and replacing him with his CIA director Mike Pompeo. “And I’m really at a point where we’re getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.”\n\nTrump’s decision to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter sent a wave of shock across Washington, as the president seemed reenergized after catching the world by surprise.\n\nHere is a rundown of where things stand:\n\nChief of Staff Gen. John Kelly:\n\nTrump likes Kelly, but does not like the idea that he is being controlled by the former general.\n\n\n\n\n\n“You know, we have General Kelly here, four star, and he’s doing a great job in Washington.” Trump told Marines in California on Tuesday. “I think he likes what you do better than what he does, but he’s doing a great job. He misses you.”\n\nFox News reports that Kelly might be shifted out of the West Wing in favor of Budget director Mick Mulvaney as chief of staff. Mulvaney’s staff stresses to Breitbart News that the former congressman is happy in his current position at OMB.\n\nNational Security Advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster:\n\nRumors of McMaster’s exit have swirled for months, but Trump appears ready to bring in someone new. Ambassador John Bolton is the rumored replacement, as he met with the president earlier in the week. Bolton has canceled media appearances this week as the rumors continue.\n\nJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump: \n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is reportedly ready for them to return to New York, but at this point, the couple does not seem inclined to do so.\n\nIf Kelly leaves both Jared and Ivanka could break free of the restraints he has put on their positions at the White House and start rebuilding their political careers.\n\nThere is a discussion about Kushner possibly returning to the 2020 presidential campaign, but in a rotating power struggle in the West Wing, he could see the benefits of staying.\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nShulkin is rumored to leave amidst power struggles in the agency. Rick Perry is among the rumored replacements, although he dismissed those rumors “fake news” and says he enjoys his position as Secretary of Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions:\n\nTrump has been angry at Sessions since he recused himself in the Russia investigation, even driving the former Alabama senator to the point where he submitted his letter of resignation before he was convinced by Reince Priebus to stay.\n\nThe rumors are a stretch at this point, as additional drama in the Justice Department would drive more questions about the Russia investigation but one scenario is that Sessions would move on and be replaced by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nCarson could be in trouble after a story about his requested $31,000 cabinet furniture won’t go away. If Trump wants Carson to go, he has an excuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nDevos is coming off a disastrous CBS 60 Minutes interview. Trump pays close attention to TV and a bad performance could raise concerns that he does not have the right person in the job.",

    "body": "NEW YORK — Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with the author of the largely discredited 35-page anti-Trump dossier, signed disclosure forms for his former firm to represent a Russian billionaire known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s favorite oligarch.\nThe detail, being brought to light herein, may raise immediate questions about the origins of the dossier. The oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, had a reported business dispute with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, is closely tied to Putin and has long been viewed as pushing Russian national interests.\n\nAlready, there have been questions about Deripaska’s possible relationship with dossier author Christopher Steele amid reports that the billionaire may have served as a source for the dossier itself.\n\nAlso, recently leaked text messages show extensive communication between a Russia-connected lawyer and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The attorney, Adam Waldman, was a paid lobbyist for Deripaska.  The messages show Warner attempted to arrange a meeting with Steele through Waldman.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley recently sent a letter to an attorney believed to be working for Deripaska asking whether the lawyer had hired Steele’s private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence Limited, to do work on behalf of Deripaska. A recent New Yorker article profiling Steele also raised the possibility that Deripaska was one of Steele’s private clients.\n\nAt a hearing last month, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) asked FBI Director Christopher Wray whether there was information that Steele was working with Deripaska when he compiled the dossier. Wray responded that he could not answer the question at a public hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA January letter from Grassley sent to John Podesta, who served as chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, asked Podesta to provide the Senate Judicial Committee with correspondence with numerous individuals, including Deripaska. That same letter was sent to the Perkins Coie law firm, which represented Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Steele was commissioned to produce the dossier by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition research firm, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the DNC via Perkins Coie.\n\nWhile questions surround Steele’s possible ties to Deripaska, the news media and legislative investigators may have missed a confirmed link between Deripaska and a State Department official involved in passing anti-Trump claims to Steele during the period that the dossier was compiled – namely Winer.\n\nAfter his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\nWiner further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an “old friend.” Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal – which Winer in turn gave to Steele – originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals.\n\nThe Steele dossier was reportedly utilized by the FBI in part to conduct its probe into Trump over unsubstantiated claims of collusion with Russia. According to House Intelligence Committee documents, the questionable dossier was also used by Obama administration officials to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign. The political origins of the dossier and issues relating to Steele’s credibility as a source were kept from the FISA court, a House Republican memo documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiner’s firm represented Deripaska in visa dispute\n\nIn July 2006, the U.S. cancelled a multi-entry visa that Deripaska had secured one year earlier, with the Wall Street Journal linking the decision to concerns over the mogul’s alleged ties to organized crime. Deripaska has denied these charges.\n\nIn 2005, Deripaska hired the Alston  Bird law firm to lobby on his behalf, paying the firm about $260,000, according to disclosure forms obtained at the time by Reuters. The lobby work was related to “Department of State visa policies and procedures,” the documents state.\n\nWiner at the time was a partner at Alston  Bird. He was the individual who filed the forms to represent Deripaska, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nWiner exchanged information with Steele\n\n\n\n\n\nWiner served in Bill Clinton’s administration as the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement. He wrote in his recent Washington Post oped that he rejoined the State Department in 2013 at the insistence of John Kerry. “In 2013, I returned to the State Department at the request of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, whom I had previously served as Senate counsel,” he wrote.\n\nIn the Post piece, Winer related that while he was at the State Department, he repeatedly passed Russia-related documents from Steele to State officials, including to Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry. “Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele’s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful,” he wrote.\n\nWiner wrote that in the summer of 2016, Steele “told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials.”\n\nWiner says that he met with Steele in September 2016 to discuss details that would later become known as the anti-Trump dossier. Winer wrote that he prepared a two-page summary of Steele’s information and “shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.”\n\nBesides bringing Steele’s dossier information to the State Department, Winer conceded that he also passed information from Blumenthal to Steele, specifically charges about Trump that originated with Shearer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiner described what he claimed was the evolution of his contacts with Blumenthal regarding Shearer’s information:\n\nIn late September, I spoke with an old friend, Sidney Blumenthal, whom I met 30 years ago when I was investigating the Iran-Contra affair for then-Sen. Kerry and Blumenthal was a reporter at the Post. At the time, Russian hacking was at the front and center in the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails of Blumenthal, who had a long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, had been hacked in 2013 through a Russian server.\n\nWhile talking about that hacking, Blumenthal and I discussed Steele’s reports. He showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.\n\nWhat struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele’s but appeared to involve different sources.\n\nShearer has numerous close personal and family connections to the Clintons and has reportedly been involved in numerous antics tied to them. National Review previously dubbed Shearer a “Creepy Clinton Confidante” and “The Strangest Character in Hillary’s Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.”\n\nPutin’s favorite oligarch\n\nDeripaska, with an estimated net worth of $6.4 billion, is founder and owner of Basic Element, one of Russia’s largest diversified industrial groups. The firm operates “energy, metals and mining, machinery, aviation, financial services and agriculture businesses worldwide,” according to a Bloomberg profile.\n\nBloomberg documented the other vast portfolios of Basic Element:\n\nIt produces aluminum; generates hydropower and nuclear energy; produces automotive components, aircraft, building materials, military hardware, road-building and construction equipment, and freight cars; manages facilities; develops and produces hi-tech equipment and multi-functional vehicles; trades carbon emissions; designs and constructs residential infrastructure; provides civil and infrastructure construction services; manages commercial property and lets office premises, production sites and warehouses; provides legal and financial support.\n\nCanada’s Globe and Mail previously profiled Deripaska in an extensive piece titled, “At home with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.” The newspaper reported that Deripaska “is said to be Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s favourite industrialist.”\n\nThe New Yorker also reported this month that Deripaska “has been described as Putin’s favorite oligarch.”\n\nThe billionaire’s relationship with Putin was temporarily publicly strained in 2009 due to a financial crisis in Russia, but the strong ties soon recovered and some say the short-lived tension was public theater.\n\nThe Globe and Mail documented:\n\nThe crisis appeared to damage Mr. Deripaska’s relationship with Mr. Putin, however. In a televised broadcast in mid-2009 in a hard-hit Russian industrial town called Pikalyovo, Mr. Putin compared industrial barons who left workers’ wages unpaid to cockroaches. He then forced Mr. Deripaska to sign a document safeguarding the future of a local factory, snapping “And give me back my pen,” the moment the crestfallen oligarch did so.\n\nThe event played well in recession-racked Russia, but may have been staged political theatre. There no longer appears to be any friction between the two men.\n\nDeripaska has official past connections to the Russian government. He won the Order of Friendship from the Russian Federation in 1999 and was appointed by Putin to represent the Russian Federation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council in 2004.\n\nA U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks and dated from 2006 described Deripaska as “among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis.”\n\nDeripaska and Manafort\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Deripaska’s past business dispute with Manafort, which dated back to the mid-2000s when Manafort was advising politicians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Post reported:\n\nManafort and Deripaska have both confirmed that they had a business relationship in which Manafort was paid as an investment consultant. In 2014, Deripaska accused Manafort in a Cayman Islands court of taking nearly $19 million intended for investments and then failing to account for the funds, return them or respond to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was used. There are no signs in court documents that the case has been closed.\n\nThe Post also cited “people familiar with the discussions” claiming that Manafort offered to privately brief Deripaska on the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHowever, the newspaper allowed:\n\nThere is no evidence in the documents showing that Deripaska received Manafort’s offer or that any briefings took place. And a spokeswoman for Deripaska dismissed the email ex­changes as scheming by “consultants in the notorious ‘beltway bandit’ industry.”\n\nQuestions raised about Deripaska’s ties to the dossier\n\nWhile the Winer-Deripaska link has not yet been debated, questions about whether dossier author Steele’s firm did work for the oligarch during the time the dossier was compiled has prompted concerns about the origins of the already controversial document.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) recently told Breitbart News in an interview that he was familiar with accusations that Deripaska may have been a source for dossier author Steele, explaining he cannot share information on the matter publicly, before adding, “It is a concern of ours.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) raised questions last month relating to Deripaska and Steele. “The other important news last week was watch what Sen. Cotton asked Wray. Was Steele being employed by paid by this Russian oligarch? The answer was interesting,” Jordan told The Daily Caller in an interview at CPAC.\n\nJordan continued: “We don’t know if he was getting paid by this oligarch. Stop and think. So the guy who put together this dossier, that was taken to a secret court, that was given a secret warrant to spy on someone associated with the Trump campaign — a fellow American citizen. That dossier was paid for by Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and maybe a Russian oligarch? You’ve got to be kidding me. So that is why we have to get to the bottom of all of this and keep pushing.”\n\nWriting at Tablet about the possibility of a Steele-Deripaska link, author Lee Smith opined:\n\nIf Steele worked for a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin, it is likely to change prevailing views of the Russia investigations of the past year and a half. The three congressional inquiries (Senate Judiciary, Senate Intelligence and House Intelligence), as well as special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, are based largely on allegations made in the dossier. Was Steele paid by Deripaska at the same time he was paid by the Washington, D.C. communications firm Fusion GPS for his work on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee? Did his work on behalf of Deripaska influence his investigations into the Trump team’s possible ties to Russia? Was Deripaska one of Steele’s Kremlin-insider sources — and what does that tell us about the contents and purpose of the Steele dossier?\n\nIn an oped at the Washington Post, Ed Rogers, a contributor to the PostPartisan blog, asked:\n\nSo, today, when the Democrats and their allies in the media insist that we need to know what the Russians did to influence the election and interfere in the democratic process, it is fair to ask which Russians are they talking about? Are they talking about the Russians who were solicited by Steele and his Democrat paymasters? What were the Russians’ interests and were any of them paying Steele? (A new story links Steele to Putin ally Oleg Deripaska.)\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

    "body": "The House passed the $1.3 trillion, 2,232-page omnibus spending bill on Thursday, sending the bill to the Senate; Congress must pass the omnibus before midnight on Friday to avert a government shutdown.\nThe House passed the omnibus 255-167, featuring bipartisan support despite conservative opposition to the legislation.\n\nThe House voted to advance the legislation to a floor vote on Thursday morning 211-207.\n\nRepublican leadership released the omnibus bill on Wednesday night giving legislators less than 17 hours to read the bill. \n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) slammed the passage of the omnibus in a statement on Thursday:\n\nThis is wrong. This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents—our employers—deserve better.\n\nRepublicans in Congress today were faced with a choice: Vote ‘yes’ and fund the military while embracing record levels of spending with a list of unfulfilled promises; Or vote no, go back to the drawing board, and get to work on a real proposal, with a real process, that funds our troops and actually fights to deliver the bill of goods that we promised the American people.\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus chose to vote no, because this omnibus doesn’t just forget the promises we made to voters—it flatly rejects them.\n\nThe White House backed the omnibus spending bill after President Donald Trump discussed the bill with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement:\n\n\nThe president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill, which includes more funds to rebuild the military, such as the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall and other key domestic priorities, like combatting the opioid crisis and rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure.\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on Wednesday night, “Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included.”\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadows lamented in an interview with Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday that the “Senate Democrats seem to be calling most of the shots.”\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall.\n\nThe omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican leadership also included provisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct gun research. The omnibus also includes the Fix NICS Act, which would allow for unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans’ right to purchase firearms without due process.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus sternly opposed the omnibus bill; the conservatives sent a letter to the White House, urging president Donald Trump to reject the legislation.\n\nThe House conservatives said that the bill “outright rejects” the promises conservatives made to the voters.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) told Fox News on Sunday that Democrats have not abandoned their base by refusing to shut down the government over DACA illegal aliens.\n\n\n\n\n\nDurbin said, “We’re not going to have a shutdown, but I’m urging leaders to come together and understand there’s an emergency here. We have to move on a bipartisan basis.”\n\n“We got about 80% of what we were trying to get, and if you can’t accept 80%, then the system can’t function,” Congressman John Yarmuth (D-KY) said in an interview.",

Trump made the move under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 after extensive Department of Commerce research into the issue. The tariffs are being imposed on the basis of economic and national security.\n\nFlake was swift to declare his active resistance to the tariffs:\n\nThese so-called ‘flexible tariffs’ are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty. Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster. I will immediately draft and introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, and I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\n\nTrump spoke of imposing tariffs during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDuring a June 2016 Pittsburgh campaign speech, Trump called out China specifically over “theft of American trade secrets” and vowed to remedy trade disputes with tariffs. He specifically cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which he used to impose the tariffs on Thursday.\n\nThe United States has lost six aluminum smelters since 2013, leaving just five, according to one senior administration official. Of those five, only two are operating at full capacity, and just one produces military grade high purity aluminum. That official stated that if the one military grade producing smelter were to shut down, the U.S. would be forced to buy this material from China or the Middle East. The official called it a significant vulnerability for the U.S. The steel industry has lost an estimated 50,000 jobs since 2000, according to the official.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter  More Stories About:\n\t\tBig Government, Economics, aluminum, China, Donald Trump, Jeff Flake, steel, Tariffs",

The calls referenced violence and erratic behavior. CNN reports that in one of the calls the host family, with whom Cruz was living after the death of his mother, told PBCSO they feared Cruz was going to turn a gun on the family. The family member deputies that Cruz was “buying “tons of ammo” and had allegedly put “put [a] gun to others heads in the past.” No charges were filed, no arrest made.\nOn January 5, 2018, the FBI received a tip describing “Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” The FBI did not act on the tip.\nOn February 14 Cruz attacked students and unarmed teachers in Stoneman Douglas High. A report from CNN claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were at the school as the attack was taking place but not one of them entered the school. On February 22 Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told ABC 13 that video showed deputy Scott Peterson by building 12 on campus, yet Peterson never went inside to confront Cruz. The CNN report quotes Coral Springs sources that claim there were actually four Broward County deputies on scene who did not enter the building.\n\nWhen Cruz attacked the school he faced no armed resistance because the teachers were not allowed to carry. President Trump noted that the lack of armed teachers is a weakness too great to ignore and, on February 21, called for “20 percent” of our nation’s public school teachers to be armed for school safety. The next day he reiterated his call, noting that first responders are “5 to 8 minutes” away when a school shooting occurs, but teachers are on scene to shoot sickos “immediately.”\n\nAnd how did government officials respond to the call for teachers to be armed to defend themselves? The Hill reported that Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called Trump’s push for armed teachers “abhorrent.” He intimated that arming teachers for self-defense was “an anathema.”\n\nBlumenthal was not without like-minded Republicans who rejected calls to arm teachers as well. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) voiced his opposition to armed teachers on February 21 and Gov. Rick Scott (R) voiced his opposition to armed teachers on February 23.\n\nIronically, when Scott voiced his opposition, he said, “I think you need to have individuals that are trained, well-trained. My focus is let law enforcement do the keeping us safe and let teachers focus on teaching.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment officials like Gov. Scott ignore the fact that “well-trained” law enforcement personnel failed us during the February 14 attack. Local law enforcement, the FBI, and even the federal gun-free school law failed us.  And when we seek to arm teachers to prevent another scenario where an armed attacker finds a school full of sitting ducks, Sens. like Blumenthal and Rubio are quick to tell us teachers ought not be armed for school safety.\n\nGovernment failed to protect us and they do not want us to protect ourselves.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Google and Facebook both have the ability to significantly influence elections. Facebook has previously boosted voter registration and turnout by significant margins, while research on search engine manipulation shows that services like Google Search have the potential to change the preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more.\n\nBrad Parscale, current campaign manager for the president’s 2020 re-election bid, previously managed Trump’s digital campaign in 2016. In public interviews, Parscale has argued that social media, not traditional media, was the key to Trump’s victory in 2016, and identified Facebook as particularly critical to the president’s success. His selection suggests that the digital campaigning will be given even greater emphasis in 2020.\n\nHis comment follows weeks of high-profile revelations about Silicon Valley openly limiting the reach of conservatives. Last week, we reported that algorithm changes at Facebook have caused the President’s engagement on the platform to fall by 45 percent. The same change has hit engagement on the pages of conservative news websites, while leaving the mainstream media’s pages virtually unchanged.\n\nDuring the same week, YouTube launched a massive crackdown against conservatives and alternative media channels, taking down videos and banning channels. The channel for Alex Jones’ InfoWars, which interviewed the President during his 2016 election campaign, is now one strike away from a permanent ban on the platform.\n\nTwitter also continues to be caught up in bias scandals: we recently reported that the platform is hiding tweets from President Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The platform also conducted a recent mass-lockout of Trump supporters, and has refused to apply their terms of service evenly, allowing a campaign of harassment against Pamela Geller’s daughters while banning right-wingers for stating facts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllum Bokhari is the Senior Tech Correspondent at Breitbart News.

Michelle Mortensen gets just ten percent, Scott Hammond gets nine percent, and David McKeon gets one percent. Victoria Seaman, who dropped out of the race upon Tarkanian’s entry with Trump’s endorsement, got nine percent—while 34 percent were undecided.\n\nThe survey of 400 respondents was conducted from March 10 to March 11 by Strategic National, with a margin of error of 4.9 percent, and provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\n\nTarkanian, a strong supporter of President Trump, was the GOP nominee for this very seat in 2016, but lost to now Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the general election after 2016 GOP senate nominee in Nevada, then-Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) tanked Republicans statewide by distancing himself from Trump in the leadup to election day. Rosen is running for the U.S. Senate and is expected to face off against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in the November general election.\n\nTrump’s approval rating in the survey of Nevada third district GOP voters is very high. A whopping 72 percent have an “extremely favorable” opinion of Trump, and another 16 percent have a “somewhat favorable” opinion of the president. Only four percent have a “somewhat unfavorable” opinion of Trump, and just  six percent have an “extremely unfavorable” opinion of him.\n\nTarkanian was running against Heller for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate until Trump asked him to switch to the House race so as to give the party a better chance in the general election in both the Senate and House races.\n\n\n\n\n\nTarkanian announced Trump’s endorsement of his congressional campaign in a statement last week. He said:\n\nI entered the U.S. Senate race after receiving an outpouring of requests from Trump supporters throughout Nevada, many of whom stood by both me and Donald Trump in 2016. These grassroots supporters saw in me a fierce defender of President Trump’s America First agenda. Late Wednesday, the President and members of his political team reached out to me and asked me to consider supporting the America First agenda as a Congressional candidate by running again in CD3, where I nearly won in 2016 in what was one of the most expensive and closest Congressional races in America. This was not something I ever considered. In my travels throughout the state, I’ve had so many wonderful people thank me for running for the US Senate. They believe in our message and the cause. My incredible staff, mostly volunteers, have invested thousands of hours into this cause. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to them all. I do not want to let any of them down. I have always believed that public service is doing what is in the best interest of the people you represent, not yourself politically. I believe with every ounce of my body that the future of our country, and a better life for our children, requires the implementation of the America First agenda. I am confident I would have won the US Senate race and done a great job representing the people of Nevada in the Senate, but the President is adamant that a unified Republican ticket in Nevada is the best direction for the America First movement. With President Trump’s full support and endorsement, I am filing to run again in CD3 with the firm belief that we will finish what we started in 2016 and win in 2018.\n\nThat came after a Trump tweet urged Tarkanian to switch to the House race from the Senate race, adding that he would have the president’s backing in doing so.\n\n\nIt would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it’s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2018\n\nIn a subsequent appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, Tarkanian laid out the stakes of this race.\n\n“It’s a seat the Democrats currently hold, so we can take a seat back from the Democrats,” Tarkanian said. “Right now, you keep hearing all the talk that the Democrats are going to go after maybe 40 plus seats, maybe 50 seats that the Republicans hold right now, and try and switch them. This is one that’s very likely to go back to the Republican side.”\n\nIn a year where Democrats are on the offensive, Tarkanian is exactly right that if the GOP has a chance of holding the House they need every advantage they can possibly get—especially pickup opportunities like this one. This particular district is one of a handful in the country where a Democrat currently represents it, but Republicans have a decent shot at a pickup. Assuming Tarkanian’s lead holds and he solidifies the nomination quickly, with Trump’s support in the general election, he will face off against Democrat Susie Lee in the general.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee is considered an easy target to beat, given her close ties to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and problems already piling up for her campaign.\n\nSupporters of the president and his agenda are hopeful that the other contenders in the primary clear out of the way for Tarkanian to represent the party, as the president wants, in the general election. If that happens, the district could represent a battle between two national movements: The Women’s March, #MeToo-fueled leftist resistance to Trump versus the economic nationalist conservative base of the president. Republicans and Democrats will likely both nationalize this race, and both parties are likely to compete heavily in Nevada’s third district.\n\nThe suburban district just outside Las Vegas has traditionally been a swing district, but Republicans have generally held it in its current form.",

    "body": "An FBI informant told three congressional committees in a written statement that Moscow routed millions to America with the expectation it would benefit Bill Clinton’s charitable efforts as then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pushed through a “reset” in U.S.-Russia relations, the Hill reported.\nThe informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement, which was obtained by the Hill, that Russian nuclear executives told him Moscow hired American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide because it would influence the Obama administration and specifically Hillary Clinton.\nCampbell testified, according to the Hill,  that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clinton’s Global Initiative.”\n“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over 12 months. APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement. “\nAPCO officials told the Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and involved different divisions of the firm. They also said their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but instead focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.\n“APCO Worldwide’s activities involving client work on behalf of Tenex and The Clinton Global Initiative were totally separate and unconnected in any way,” APCO told the Hill in a statement. “All actions on these two unconnected activities were appropriate, publicly documented from the outset and consistent with regulations and the law. Any assertion otherwise is false and unfounded.”\n\n\n\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill Campbell’s testimony is part of a GOP effort to distract investigators from President Trump’s “problems.”\n“Just yesterday the committee made clear that this secret informant charade was just that, a charade. Along with the widely debunked text-message-gate and Nunes’ embarrassing memo episode, we have a trifecta of GOP-manufactured scandals designed to distract from their own President’s problems and the threat to democracy he poses,” he told the Hill.\nCampbell on Wednesday testified before staff from both parties on the Senate Judiciary, House Intelligence and House Oversight and Government Reform Committees.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, asserted in a letter this week that Justice Department officials told both parties during a briefing in December that they ultimately found they “could not trust” Campbell when he was working as an FBI informant.\nRepublicans note that the FBI found Campbell’s undercover work valuable enough to reward him with a $50,000 check in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n“My FBI handlers praised my work. They told me on various occasions that details from the undercover probe had been briefed directly to FBI top officials. On two occasions my handlers were particularly excited, claiming that my undercover work had been briefed to President Obama as part of his daily presidential briefing,” he said in the testimony.\nCampbell said in his testimony that Obama administration officials made decisions that benefitted the Russian nuclear industry, which was seeking to build a monopoly in the global uranium market to help President Vladimir Putin seek geopolitical advantage over the U.S.\nHe wrote that wrote that Russian nuclear executives “boasted” during vodka-fueled meetings monitored by the FBI about “how weak the U.S. government was in giving away uranium business and were confident that Russia would secure the strategic advantage it was seeking in the U.S. uranium market.”\nCampbell said he asked his FBI handlers why the U.S. was not more aggressive.\n“I expressed these concerns repeatedly to my FBI handlers. The response I got was that politics was somehow involved,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nGOP investigators are interested in how Campbell’s experience connects with the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal, which gave Russian mining giant Rosatom control of roughly 20 percent of the U.S.’s capacity to mine uranium.\nThat deal was approved unanimously in 2010 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency board that includes the State, Defense, and Justice Departments, in addition to other agencies. The purpose of CFIUS is to block deals that could threaten U.S. national security.\nClinton was secretary of state at the time the deal went through, although Clinton associates say she had nothing to do with it.\nMeanwhile, Campbell had helped the FBI gather evidence as early as 2009 that the Russian nuclear industry was engaged in a kickback, bribery and racketeering scheme on U.S. soil, the Hill reported last fall. The scheme compromised the U.S. trucking firm that had the sensitive job of transporting uranium around America.\nCampbell said he provided the FBI that evidence months before the Obama administration approved a series of favorable decisions that enriched Rosatom, including the Uranium One deal.\n\n\n\n\nCampbell could not discuss the case with Congress until the Justice Department freed him to do so last year.\nHe also gave congressional committees documents he said he provided to his FBI handlers in 2010 showing that the Russian and American executives implicated in the Tenex bribery scheme specifically asked him to try to help get the Uranium One deal approved by the Obama administration.\nAccording to the Hill, Campbell said:\n“In 2010, officials inside Tenex became interested in helping another Rosatom subsidiary, ARMZ, win Obama administration approval to purchase Uranium One, a Canadian company with massive Kazakh and large U.S. uranium assets.\n…\n“Although Tenex and ARMZ are separate subsidiaries, Tenex had its own interest in Uranium One. Tenex would become responsible for finding commercial markets and revenue for those uranium assets once they were mined.\n“The emails and documents I intercepted during 2010 made clear that Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One – for both its Kazakh and American assets – was part of Russia’s geopolitical strategy to gain leverage in global energy markets.\n…\n“I obtained documentary proof that Tenex was helping Rosatom win CFIUS approval, including an October 6, 2010 email … asking me specifically to help overcome opposition to the Uranium One deal.”\nCampbell said the purchase of the Uranium One assets and the securing of billions of new uranium sales contracts inside the U.S. during the Obama years were part of the “Russian uranium dominance strategy.”\n“The importance of the Uranium One decision to Tenex was made clear by the fact that the Russian government directed Mikerin to open a new U.S. office for Tenex and to create a new American entity called Tenam in early October 2010, just weeks before Rosatom and ARMZ won the Obama administration approval to buy Uranium One,” he said, according to the testimony.\n“Rosatom/Tenex threw a party to celebrate, which was widely attended by American nuclear industry officials. At the request of the FBI, I attended and recorded video footage of Tenam’s new offices,” he said.\nCampbell also testified that under the FBI’s direction, he conducted a failed sting effort to lure Putin to the United States and gathered evidence that Russia was helping Iran build its nuclear capability.\nHe gave Congress an April 16, 2010, memo he said he wrote and gave to the FBI that spelled out Russian efforts to aid Iran.\n“Tenex continues to supply Iran fuel through their Russian company,” he wrote in that memo, obtained by the Hill. “They continue to assist with construction consult [sic] and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor. Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult” of Russians.\n“The final fabricators to Iran are being flown by Russian air transport due to the sensitive nature of the equipment,” his 2010 memo to the FBI added.\nCampbell also said he was never reimbursed by the FBI for the hundreds of thousands of dollars he used of his own money to make bribe payments under the FBI’s direction to the Russians to facilitate his cover.\nCampbell said what he witnessed frustrated him.\n“I was frustrated watching the U.S. government make numerous decisions benefiting Rosatom and Tenex while those entities were engaged in serious criminal conduct on U.S. soil,” he wrote.\n“Tenex and Rosatom were raking in billions of U.S. dollars by signing contracts with American nuclear utility clients at the same time they were indulging in extortion by using threats to get bribes and kickbacks, with a portion going to Russia for high ranking officials.”",

And the beautiful thing about the Constitution is they left open amendments to change things because things change over time.”\nIn November of 2017, Kerr said, “To solve [the issue of guns]. I think we almost have to look at it like a public health issue. Too often we get caught up in political rhetoric, 2nd amendment rights, NRA stuff.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), described Mateo as: “a courageous, determined and intelligent young woman who at great personal risk has dedicated herself to fight for those seeking their rightful place in this country,” according to Fox News.\n\nMateo, however, seems somewhat confused about which country she prefers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Facebook post in 2016, apparently celebrating her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo declared, in Spanish: “[E]verything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”\n\nLizbeth Mateo (Facebook)\n\n\nWhile she is the first illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California.

Biden is one of the most popular politicians in our nation’s capital.\n\nHis demeanor, sense of humor, and even his friendly gaffes have allowed him to form close relationships with both Democrats and Republicans. His public image is built around his “Lunch Bucket Joe” persona. As he reminds the American people on regular occasion, he has little wealth to show for his career, despite having reached the vice presidency.\n\nOne of his closest political allies in Washington is former senator and former Secretary of State John Kerry. “Lunch Bucket Joe” he ain’t; Kerry is more patrician than earthy. But the two men became close while serving for several decades together in the US Senate. The two “often talked on matters of foreign policy,” says Jules Witcover in his Biden biography.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo their sons going into business together in June 2009 was not exactly a bolt out of the blue.\n\nBut with whom their sons cut lucrative deals while the elder two were steering the ship of state is more of a surprise.\n\nRead the rest of the story here.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tRead More Stories About:\n\t\tBig Government, Cronyism, National Security, Bank of China, Bohai Capital, China, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, John Kerry, Peter Schweizer, Secret Empires",

    "body": "CNN on Thursday declared former Vice President Joe Biden is the early 2020 frontrunner for the Democrats.\nBiden’s polling average in all national 2020 primary polls is 27%, and the only person even within striking distance right now is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is at 21%, according to the analysis\n\nAt least two of the primary polls (RABA, Politico/Morning Consult) had Oprah Winfrey as one of the potential candidates, and Biden finished ahead of Winfrey and the other Democrats in those polls. CNN, which acknowledged that it is “entirely unreasonable” to forecast a winner this early, also pointed out that Biden is even currently leading in New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary after the Iowa caucuses. A February University of New Hampshire survey found Biden defeating Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom are from the region, by double digits.\n\nBiden, whose advisers are reportedly planning a 2020 run, and Trump got into a war of words this week after Biden said he would take Trump behind the “gym and beat the hell out of him” if they were in high school and Trump made lewd remarks about women. Trump responded on Thursday by tweeting Biden is “trying to act like a tough guy” and “would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.”\n\n\nCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018\n\nAccording to CNN, “Biden versus Trump is probably the highest probability matchup compared to all the others at this moment in time, though it’s still a relative long-shot.”\n\nBiden’s first presidential run was derailed by a plagiarism scandal, and the former vice president will face much more scrutiny after the publication of Breitbart News Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer’s blockbuster new book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the book, the esteemed Clinton Cash and Throw Them All Out author reveals that Biden’s son Hunter’s investment firm signed a $1.5 billion deal with the Chinese government just 10 days after Joe and Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nSchweizer told Breitbart News Tonight on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 this week that the “Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they’ll get better policy positions from our government, and the history indicates in the Obama administration that that’s exactly what happens.”\n\n“Here’s the thing people have to keep in mind: Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese government,” Schweizer added. “He has no background in private equity. He was a lobbyist before his father became vice president for the casino industry. He has no background. He has no business getting a deal like this. He got this deal, pure and simple, because he is the son of a vice president, and the Chinese said, ‘We give him this deal, and his pal, who’s a former aide to John Kerry, they’re going to run it, and by doing so, we are going to curry favor with these guys,’ and you know what? Based on the track record, based on the response of the Obama administration of Secretary of State John Kerry and of Vice President Biden, that’s exactly what they got. They got good action for their money.”",

Schweizer’s last book, Clinton Cash, sparked an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAccording to an exclusive New York Post excerpt from the book, the Biden billion-dollar China deal occurred as follows. In 2013, Hunter Biden and the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry, Chris Heinz, were managing partners in the private equity firm Rosemont Seneca Partners. In December of that year, Vice President Biden and his son Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days after the trip, a subsidiary of the Bank of China named Bohai Capital signed an exclusive deal with Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz’s Rosemont to form a $1 billion joint-investment fund called Bohai Harvest RST. The deal was later increased to $1.5 billion.\n\n“The Chinese government was literally funding a business that they co-owned along with the sons of two of America’s most powerful decision makers,” writes Schweizer in Secret Empires.\n\nNeither Joe Biden or John Kerry have yet to comment on how the son of a sitting vice president and the stepson of a Secretary of State were permitted to bag a billion-dollar deal with the Communist Chinese government—nor whether they had any knowledge or involvement in the deal.\n\nSecret Empires is slated to hit bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, March  More Stories About:\n\t\tBig Government, Cronyism, National Security, Bank of China, Bohai Capital, Bohai Harvest RST, China, Chris Heinz, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, John Kerry, Peter Schweizer, Rosemont, Secret Empires",

Pollak20 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t20 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t20 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe city council of Los Alamitos, California, in Orange County voted 4-1 Monday night for an ordinance to defy the state’s new “sanctuary state” law, and to assist federal law enforcement in stopping illegal immigration.\nAs Breitbart News reported Sunday, the city took on SB 54, the so-called “California Values Act,” which constrains state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice is challenging SB 54 as one of three “sanctuary state” laws that, it claims, violate the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.\n\nMembers of the city council were concerned that SB 54 required them to violate their oaths of office, which require them to uphold and defend the Constitution. Although legal experts say that there is a chance SB 54 will survive in the courts — since unlike the other two law it merely requires state and local government not to assist federal law enforcement, while the other two laws interfere with federal authority — city council members were still concerned,\n\nThe Orange County Register notes that the city council debate on Monday evening was intense on both sides:\n\nWhile the crowd had dwindled both in and outside the chamber when the vote came, people erupted in cheers after the vote and began chanting “USA.” But on the pro-immigrant rights side, there was this chant: “The people united, will never be divided.”\n\nSomeone shouted out to Councilman Warren Kusumoto, who introduced the legislation, “great American patriot!” while someone else screamed out “America first.”\n\n…\n\nThroughout the night, many in the crowd of more than 150 people from Los Alamitos, Long Beach and other communities engaged in heated debate – sometimes in front of the dais, other times with each  reported that Kusumoto was particularly concerned that SB 54 would require him to disobey the Constitution: “California legislators are bulling local elected officials into violating our oath of office,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council also voted to direct the city attorney of Los Alamitos — the county’s second-smallest city — to prepare an amicus brief on the side of the Department of Justice in its case against the State of California.\n\nJoel B.

Considering the fact that so few legislators in Florida met with us and they want the people to forget, that’s disgusting. The fact that they want people to forget about this and elect them again as the child murderers they are, that’s unacceptable and we’re not going to let that happen.”\n\nTo date, state-level gun control proposals include “tougher background checks,” a bump stock ban, a waiting period for long gun purchases, raising minimum age for rifle purchases to 21-years old, and gun confiscation orders similar to California’s Gun Violence Restraining Orders. All of these gun controls were proposed last week by Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and not a single one of them would have prevented the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nProposed gun controls at the federal level include proposals similar to Gov. Scott’s, plus an “assault weapons” ban and “universal background checks.” Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) is a leading voice for these gun controls, even though neither one would have prevented the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. (The “assault weapons” ban would not have prevented the shooting because such a ban, if fashioned like the 1994-2004 ban, does not actually ban certain guns. Rather, it bans cosmetic features. And universal background checks would be impotent because the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, passed a background check for the rifle he used on February 14.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one change that could make an immediate difference in school safety would be to arm teachers as Utah did over 15 years ago, and as is currently being done in school districts in Colorado, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and other states. But David Hogg, Gov. Scott, and Rep. Deutch all oppose arming teachers for school safety.\n\nGov. Scott said we should rely on law enforcement, Deutch said talk of arming teachers is a “distraction,” and Hogg said money that would be used to arm teachers should instead be put into S.T.E.M. studies so teachers “can do more cool stuff and we’ll be able to create jobs in renewable, clean and independent American energy like wind and solar.”\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Suggests Taking Up Arms Against President Trump\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tby AWR Hawkins19 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t19 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t19 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY) reportedly took time during a Huntington, New York, speech to suggest that people should take up arms against President Trump.\nRoll Call reports the Suozzi talked of putting pressure on Trump, saying, “This is where the Second Amendment comes in, quite frankly. Because you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts? What would you do? What would we do?”\n\nAn audience member responded by asking the essence of the Second Amendment and Suozzi said, “The Second Amendment is the right to bear arms.”\n\nAccording to the New York Post, nervousness was evident among attendees. National Republican Campaign Committee spokesman Chris Martin said, “This video is incredibly disturbing. It’s surreal to watch a sitting member of Congress suggest that his constituents should take up arms against the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Suozzi campaign responded to the criticism by rejecting claims that he was suggesting “armed insurrection.” At the same time, they forwarded a statement from Thomas Jefferson, which said, “What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.”\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Gov Vows No Tax Break for Delta if Airline Continues Political Boycott of NRA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tby AWR Hawkins26 Feb 20180\n\t\t\t\t26 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\t26 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeorgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle (R) responded to Delta’s decision to sever ties with NRA by announcing he will work to ensure the airline gets no tax breaks unless their political boycott ends.\nOn February 24, Breitbart News reported that over a dozen companies had cut ties with NRA in the wake of an anti-Second Amendment campaign targeting companies that gave discounts and other perks to NRA members. Delta Airlines was one of the companies that announced they were ending their relationship with the NRA:\n\n\nDelta is reaching out to the NRA to let them know we will be ending their contract for discounted rates through our group travel program. We will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website.\n\n— Delta (@Delta) February 24, 2018\n\nOn February 26, Lt. Gov. Cagle responded by making clear there would be no tax cuts for Delta until they ended their political boycott of the NRA:\n\n\nI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA.  Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\n\n— Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018\n\nCagle’s message to Delta came two days after he made clear that “discriminating against law-abiding gun owners will not solve the problem” we face in attacks like the one on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nCagle tweeted:\n\nI’m a lifetime member  of the NRA and a strong supporter of law abiding citizens’ Second Amendment rights. Like all Americans, I’m horrified by the mass shootings we’ve witnessed. If corporate America wants to make a positive difference on gun violence, it should donate a portion of its profits to mental health treatments and school safety initiatives. They should put their money where their mouth is instead of engaging in viewpoint discrimination against conservatives and law-abiding gun owners.\n\nUnited Airlines, Budget, Alamo Rent a Car, First National Bank of Omaha, Hertz, Metlife, and Best Western are among the other companies that caved to the anti-Second Amendment PR campaign as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The results shed a new perspective on the media-hyped “blue wave” stories from the weeks leading up to election day.\nIn the Republican Primary of 2018, Senator Cruz received 1,317,450 votes in a race with four challengers. His Democrat opponent, U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke only received 641,311 votes against two opponents.\n\nFigures from the Secretary of State’s office show that just over one million voters turned out in the Democratic Primary in general across Texas. Cruz alone exceeded the entire Democratic voter turnout by nearly 300,000 votes.\n\nLast week, Texas Secretary of State Spokesman Sam Tayler told Breitbart Texas that in normal gubernatorial primary elections, about 10 percent of registered voters turn out in the Republican primary and five percent in the Democratic primary. At that time, he predicted, based on early voting numbers, that Democrats would match the Republican’s 10 percent turnout. Instead, Democrats fell short on election day. Republican voters slightly exceeded their normal voter turnout with about 11 percent of registered voters coming to their polls. Democrats also raised their turnout, but only to 6.8 percent arrived.\n\nThe race for Texas Governor yielded similar numbers. Governor Greg Abbott received 1,392,294 votes in a field of three candidates while the Democrats split among nine. Just over one million voters cast their ballots in the Democratic gubernatorial race. Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez received 436,658 votes while her main opponent, Houston businessman Andrew White received 278,702 votes. The two Democrats will face off in a May 22 runoff.\n\nIn the leadup to election day, media outlets hyped the early voting turnout numbers as a harbinger of doom for Texas Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN asked in a headline, “Can a Blue Wave Take Down Ted Cruz in Texas?” Fourteen hours later, the network answered it’s own question. “Democrat Turnout Could Signal a Blue Wave in November — But Not in Texas,” the new headline stated.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News also questioned the legitimacy of the Texas blue wave. The newspaper asked in a headline, “Breaking Down the Texas Primaries: How Real is the Democrats’ Blue Wave?”\n\nThere is still cause for concern for Texas Republicans. Democrats increased their gubernatorial election year turnout by nearly 40 percent over 2014 numbers. This added nearly 300,000 Democratic voters to their database which will be used for efforts to turn out voters in November.\n\nIn Harris County, Democrat voters exceeded the number of Republican voters as the state’s largest county continues its trend from purple to blue.\n\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

    "body": "Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, highlighted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) financial ties to the Chinese government as an example of how politicians monetize political influence while evading financial disclosure regulations.\nSchweizer joined Monday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight for an interview with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak to discuss McConnell’s linkages to China, as detailed in his latest book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends. \n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) familial ties to the Chinese state via his father- and sisters-in-law are causes for concern, deduced Schweizer. James Chao, McConnell’s father-in-law, founded Foremost Group, a shipping company that has done “large volumes of business” with Chinese state-owned companies. McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, is the current secretary of transportation.\n\n“So Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, his wife Elaine Chao, who’s the transportation secretary in the Trump administration, her family has deep economic and financial ties to the Chinese government itself,” said Schweizer. “They are in the shipping business, and they own something called the Foremost Group, and really, in 1993, Mitch McConnell, as a senator, travels to China with his father-in-law, James Chao, as guests of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation.”\n\nHe continued, “The China State Shipbuilding Corporation is the largest defense contractor in China, and the projections are that by 2030, if current trends continue, they are going to surpass the U.S. Navy as far as naval capability. Basically, what happens is, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation says to the Chao family, ‘Look, we will build your ships. We will finance the purchase of some of your ships. We will provide crews for your ships. We will provide contracts for you to ship state-owned goods from state-owned companies around the Pacific. In other words, we are going to set you up in the shipping business,’ which is exactly what they do, and, in fact, James Chao — this would be Elaine Chao’s father, Mitch McConnell’s father-in-law — and Elaine’s sister, Angela Chao, actually joined the board, in 2007 and 2008, of something called China State Shipbuilding Corporation, CSSC Holdings, which is a subsidiary of the largest defense contractor in China. So you have this powerful American political family that is making U.S. policy related to China, related to trade, and other critical issues that is highly dependent upon the good graces of the Chinese government.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchweizer framed McConnell’s “increasingly soft” political positioning towards China as a function of his familial and financial ties to the Chinese state.\n\n“McConnell himself has benefited because a few years ago, James Chao gave Mitch McConnell a gift between five and twenty-five million dollars that more than quadrupled his net worth overnight,” noted Schweizer. “So this is not just about Elaine Chao’s family getting wealthy. That wealth has now trickled into Mitch McConnell’s pocket, as well, and it’s a huge problem because if you chart the positions that Sen. McConnell has taken on China over the last twenty years, guess what? Shock of all shocks, he has become increasingly soft as it relates to China, and I think it is directly related to the fact that he knows his family’s financial future is tied to the good graces and good faith of the Chinese communist government.”\n\nSchweizer described the Chinese government as “freaked out” over the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, owing to the 45th president’s decades-long view of the “rising threat of China.”\n\n“So the election of Donald Trump, there’s no other way to say it, it completely freaked out the Chinese government because Trump has really been focused — whether one agrees with him on trade policy or not — he has focused since the 1980s on what he regards as a rising threat of China; whether it relates to trade, economics, or military power,” surmised Schweizer. \n\nAccording to Schweizer, China’s decision to appoint McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, to the Bank of China’s board of directors — ten days after 2016’s presidential election — was a response to the election of Trump to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n“So when [Donald Trump] gets elected in 2016, China is in a panic. So one of the things that happens is, they appoint, really, the first American, or only the second foreigner to the Bank of China,” Schweizer said. “Now, the Bank of China is government-run, government-controlled, is sort of the backbone of the Chinese government’s economic diplomacy around the world. Ten days after Donald Trump is elected, they put Elaine Chao’s sister — Mitch McConnell’s sister-in-law — on the board of directors of the fourth largest bank in the world, which is run by the Chinese communist government. It’s a shocking development, and, again, unprecedented in American history that you would have senior political leaders have immediate family members that are sitting on the board of foreign government-owned businesses.”\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

    "body": "Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the new book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, joined SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight on Monday to detail the involvement of Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden’s second son, in a China-backed private equity firm’s investment in a Chinese atomic energy company indicted for “nuclear power conspiracy against the United States.”\nIn an interview with Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Schweizer highlighted the financial relationship between Hunter Biden and the Chinese state — including a $1.5 billion deal establishing a private equity firm — as an illustration of what he dubbed “the new corruption.” He further explained how foreign governments purchase political influence through “sweetheart deals” with the children of politicians. \n\nMansour asked Schweizer to explain the term “princelings” and its application to the children of high-level politicians. “All of [your] books basically show that corruption is like a game of Whack-a-Mole. You knock it down in one area, and then these corrupt politicians find another avenue for graft, and I’m looking at Secret Empires, and there’s another avenue for graft. I want you to explain to us this concept of ‘the princelings.’ This is something you describe in this book. Tell us what that is.”\n\n\n\nSchweizer explained how political favoritism is procured by foreign governments via business dealings with the children of high-level U.S. politicians.\n\n“Well, Rebecca, you’re exactly right about corruption,” replied Schweizer. “When you have the motive of greed and when you don’t worry too much about ethics, it’s very easy to come up with creative ways to enrich yourself, and one of those is what we call ‘American princelings.’ The term ‘princelings’ is really a term that’s been widely used in China and in the West to talk about China, where in communist China, if you want to get deals done, if you want to get favors from the government, you basically do business with their children, and these children of communist party officials are called the princelings.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchweizer continued, “One of the things I argue in the book is that we are, in a sense, importing that model into the United States, and you see that a lot as it relates to the Chinese government. The Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they’ll get better policy positions from our government, and the history indicates in the Obama administration that that’s exactly what happens.”\n\nAs an example of American princelings, Schweizer pointed to the Chinese government’s provision of $1.5 billion in funding for Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), a private equity firm upon whose board Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, sits.\n\n“In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China,” said Schweizer. “To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.”\n\nElaborating, Schweizer said, “Well, I think the reason he goes soft on China is because with him on that trip, flying on Air Force Two, is his son Hunter Biden, and ten days after they return from China, Hunter Biden — who has this small firm, he has no background in private equity, he has no background in Chinese finance — gets a whopping $1.5 billion deal from the Chinese government. This is the Chinese government giving Joe Biden and a [John] Kerry confidante the management over this money, and they made huge fees off of this money, and it’s an example of this kind of corruption. That’s the first of three major deals that the Chinese government does with people who are either the children — that is the sons — or close aides to Vice President Biden or Secretary of State John Kerry.”\n\nSchweizer discussed national security implications related to modern corruption, highlighting the acquisition of Henniges Automotive —  a formerly America-based company developing “dual-use” technologies with military applications — by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-run military contractor. AVIC acquired Henniges in 2017 with a 51 percent stake purchase. The remaining 49 percent was purchased by the Biden- and-Kerry-linked BHR.\n\n\n\n\n\n“So [Hunter Biden and Devon Archer] get this $1.5 billion to invest, and what they are supposed to do is basically invest in companies that benefit the Chinese government,” stated Schweizer. “So just think about this for a second. This is the vice president of the United States whose father is supposed to be commanding American presence and power in the Pacific to deal with the rising challenge from China, and his son is investing $1.5 billion of Chinese government money. So what do they do? They invest in an American high-precision tools company called Henniges, which used to be owned by Rocket Company, but they produce anti-vibration technologies which have a dual-use application, so this transaction actually requires the approval of the federal government, as it has national security implications. So again, the vice president’s son is helping the Chinese government take over a dual-use military technology-related company called Henniges.”\n\nBHR also invested in a Chinese state-run atomic energy company indicted by the Department of Justice in crimes related to stealing nuclear secrets, Schweizer said.\n\n“But it gets even worse because another investment that they make is in something called CGN — China General Nuclear — which is an atomic power company,” recalled Schweizer. “They invest in this company in 2014. A year later, what happens? The FBI arrests and charges senior officials in this company with stealing nuclear secrets in the United States. Specifically, they’re trying to get access to something called the AP-1000 nuclear reactor that is very similar to the ones that we put on U.S. submarines. So again, you have the son of the vice president, a close aide to the secretary of state who are investing in a company that is trying to steal nuclear secrets in the United States. It’s a stunning story, and here’s the thing: none of this is required to be disclosed because they’ve figured out a way to get around these disclosure laws.”\n\nSchweizer noted the lack of public disclosure regulations regarding the financial relationships of politicians’ family members with foreign governments.\n\n“It’s remarkable,” exclaimed Schweizer. “Think about this. Think about it in Joe Biden’s case. If Joe Biden gets a $1,500 gift or he gets a $1,500 donation for his campaign, he has to disclose it. If his wife gets a $1,500 gift, she has to disclose it. But if his son gets a $1.5 billion private equity deal from the Chinese government, there’s no requirement to disclose it. It’s outrageous, and it’s an example of how they try to work around these disclosure rules.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchweizer emphasized Hunter Biden’s lack of a background in the private equity business, casting his status as the son of a vice president as a golden ticket for Chinese state funds.\n\n“Here’s the thing people have to keep in mind: Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese government,” Schweizer said. “He has no background in private equity. He was a lobbyist before his father became vice president for the casino industry. He has no background. He has no business getting a deal like this. He got this deal, pure and simple, because he is the son of a vice president, and the Chinese said, ‘We give him this deal, and his pal, who’s a former aide to John Kerry, they’re going to run it, and by doing so, we are going to curry favor with these guys,’ and you know what? Based on the track record, based on the response of the Obama administration of Secretary of State John Kerry and of Vice President Biden, that’s exactly what they got. They got good action for their money.”\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.  Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

    "body": "Exclusive–‘Smash and Grab’: Schweizer Explains How Obama Weaponized Regulations to Enrich His Buddies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAP Photo/Charles Dharapak\n\n\n\t\t\t\tby Robert Kraychik20 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t20 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t20 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPeter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, joined Monday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight to discuss revelations in his latest book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, including how former President Barack Obama’s “smash and grab” strategy allowed friends to buy up various companies for “pennies on the dollar” following market devaluations resulting from the Obama administration’s regulatory policies. Some of the ill-gotten funds later found their way into the Obama Foundation.\nBreitbart News Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour asked Schweizer to explain Obama’s “smash and grab” policy. “Tell us about this thing with Obama because I’m looking at all the characters on your cover here of your book. … Tell us about Obama and his best friend and what they did.”\n\nSchweizer spoke of Martin Nesbitt — whom he described as Obama’s “best friend” — monetizing his knowledge of Obama’s regulatory plans.\n\n“This one was really surprising because, I have to say, I did not think of Barack Obama as somebody who was necessarily involved in financial corruption,” replied Schweizer. “I mean, there are all these controversies or certain issues about his policies, but Barack Obama has this best friend that few people have ever heard of, a guy named Marty Nesbitt. When Barack Obama is reelected in 2012, his best friend in the world, Marty Nesbitt, sets up this private equity fund called Vistria, and Vistria says in its corporate documents, explicitly, that it is designed to invest in highly regulated industries, and when your best friend is the regulator-in-chief, I guess that makes sense, and what happens is, they make a series of investments or deals based on companies or industries that are being smashed by the Obama administration’s regulations.”\n\nSchweizer pointed to the acquisition of the University of Phoenix by Vistria Group — the private equity firm run by Nesbitt that he co-founded in 2013 — as an illustration of Obama’s “smash and grab” strategy.\n\n“So to give you one brief example, [the] University of Phoenix, it’s a for-profit school — a lot of people have heard of it — the Obama administration declares that the company is not serving students well, and they say, ‘We are going to suspend GI dollars from the Pentagon for soldiers to study at the University of Phoenix,'” explained Schweizer. \n\n\n\n\n\n“Well, you can imagine, this for-profit university, its stock price goes from like a hundred dollars a share down to three dollars a share overnight. So what happens? Marty Nesbitt, Barack Obama’s best friend, says, ‘Hey! We’ll step in and buy it. We’ll step in and buy the company.’ They do. They basically buy it for three cents on the dollar, and then, lo and behold, imagine what happens next. The Obama administration decides that, ‘No, we are going to allow GI dollars flow to the University of Phoenix,’ thereby boosting the valuation of the company again.”\n\nSchweizer described Obama’s “smash and grab” strategy as repeatedly used across Obama’s presidential tenure, with beneficiaries such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. He further noted that such ill-gotten funds partly find their way into the Obama Foundation via Nesbitt’s financing.\n\n“This pattern is repeated over and over and over again, not just with Marty Nesbitt, but with people like the environmentalist investor Tom Steyer [and] George Soros,” Schweizer said. “Barack Obama smashes coal companies, [and] what do these guys do? They go in, they buy them for pennies on the dollar, and when the regulatory weight is lifted, their valuations increase, and they make a lot of money, and you see that pattern in all of these industries. So what you see is these crusades that Obama is going on related to companies that are supposedly doing all these evil things really has this profit or money-making component to it that I was unaware of, and a lot of other people were unaware of. Now, in a sense, the favor gets returned because Marty Nesbitt is now the chairman of the Obama Foundation and is pouring money into that institution and is responsible for raising it so Barack Obama’s legacy can be applauded in Chicago.”\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.  Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

    "body": "Tuesday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said it would be an impeachable offense if President Donald Trump were to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.\nHEWITT: I’m joined now by United States Senator Lindsey Graham, who I’m sure is following this story as everyone else is. That’s very alarming, Senator, the spread of IED technology just makes you wonder how long it was going to take to come to the United States.\n\nGRAHAM: Yeah, I’m afraid it’s gotten here, and we’ll see when we catch this guy or gal.\n\nHEWITT: Okay, now let me ask you, back in the day, a long time, ago, 1998, you were one of the 13 impeachment managers named by the House to press the case against Bill Clinton. So this is going way back. So I have a very simple question. If the President fired Robert Mueller, do you think that would be an impeachable offense?\n\nGRAHAM: Probably so, if he did it without cause, yeah.\n\nHEWITT: Now Angus King said no last hour. Why do you think it would be?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I think what the President will have done is stopped an investigation in whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign. I can’t see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\n\nHEWITT: You see, I am in agreement with you that an impeachable offense is anything that the Congress says it is, regardless of what scholars might say. And I believe the Congress would say that if it were run by Democrats. Do you think a Republican-led House would impeach the President?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, that’s a good point. Let’s say that Obama fired somebody. I think we’d all have a different view on the Republican side. A high crime and misdemeanor in the Constitution is a fairly vague term. But what is at the essence of impeachment is a check and balance on a President, right?\n\nHEWITT: Yes.\n\nGRAHAM: …who’s gotten out of their lane, who changed the rule of law and basically turns it upside down. I can’t think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president’s campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government, what kind of crimes may have been committed. I’ve seen no evidence of collusion, but to stop investigation without cause, I think, would be a Constitutional crisis.\n\nHEWITT: Have you told him that specifically, Senator Graham, so that he hears it from Republicans, do not fire Bob Mueller?\n\nGRAHAM: I think I just, I think I just did.\n\nHEWITT: Okay.\n\nGRAHAM: Yeah, so here’s the bottom line. The FBI’s handling of the dossier was really unprofessional, inappropriate. The Clinton email investigation was a joke. McCabe probably deserves to be fired, but I can’t say until I look at all the evidence. Maybe so, maybe not. so the President’s right to be upset with the Department of Justice being overly political. He would be wrong, in my view, to try to stop this investigation without cause on the Mueller side. They’re disconnected in time. Mueller came along long after this. He’s looking at things unrelated to the dossier. And we’re a rule of law nation. And it goes for both parties.\n\nHEWITT: Now Secretary Clinton said on this show you can hold two thoughts. And I’ve always repeated that. We can hold the thought that the Special Counsel ought to be left alone, and at the same time, hold the thought that the FISA warrant was badly abused and that we need a second Special Counsel for that.\n\nGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHEWITT: People tend to think you have to be one or the other, but you can actually believe both, right?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I do believe both. Weeks ago, I called for a second special counsel. Why? This is not in Mueller’s lane. So Mueller’s looking forward and what the Russians did to our election, if there was any collusion between the Trump organization, were there any crimes committed. Somebody needs to look at the Department of Justice’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the abuse of the FISA warrant process. Why not DOJ? They can’t grade their own homework. Somebody outside the system needs to take a fresh look. Why not the inspector general? The inspector general doesn’t have the institutional tools to investigate this matter. If you don’t work at the Department of Justice, he has no power to interview you. So you need a second counsel to look at how the FBI agents behaved when it came to the Clinton email scandal. Was the fix it? When they had an insurance policy, they were talking about taking an insurance policy out.\n\nHEWITT: 100 percent agree.\n\nGRAHAM: And they talked about leaving Andy’s office. Was that McCabe’s office? So we need to look at that.",

Rick Scott (R) last week.\nThe Orlando Sentinel reports that “four firearms and 267 rounds of ammunition” were taken from the man, and he was “taken to a hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment.”\n\nThe seized firearms were listed as “a Ruger LCP .380 pistol, an M2 Mauser .45 pistol, a Charter Arms .357 mag snub nose revolver and a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun.”\n\nThe paper notes that “the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under … new legislation — which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward’s Chief Judge Jack Tuter.”\n\nThe confiscatory order also bars the man from making new firearm or ammunition purchases.\n\nOn March 9, Breitbart News reported that Gov. Scott signed a $400 million gun bill that includes orders which allows a family member or law enforcement to petition a judge to order the seizure of an individual’s firearms. The bill also put waiting periods in place for long gun purchases, raised the minimum purchase age for long gun purchases (from 18 to 21), and banned bump stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the confiscatory order that resulted in the seizure of the Lighthouse Point resident’s firearms, Mayor Glenn Troast said, “This is not about the Second Amendment and it’s not about the NRA. We need commonsense gun laws and this is a commonsense gun law that gives police officers new tools they need to help us protect our community.”\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Mike Conaway (R-TX), who ran the committee’s probe, discussed the extensive efforts behind the findings on Fox News’ Special Report after the summary was released.\n\n“Well, the headlines are that we’ve reached that point where we’ve interviewed all the folks we need to. We’ve looked at some 300,000 documents, 73 interviews that we’ve done across the course of this thing, trying to answer the four questions that were originally set out for the committee to answer,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Yes, the Russians tried to interfere with our election process. Yes, they had cyberattacks, active measures going on. We could find no evidence of collusion between either campaign and the Russians,” he added.\n\nThe draft report contains more than 40 initial findings, which encompass Russian attacks on European allies, Russian cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions and their use of social media to sow discord, and the “lackluster pre-election response to Russian active measures.”\n\nThe report will also concur with the Intelligence Community Assessment’s judgments that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, but disagree with the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin preferred Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.\n\nSome Russian social media efforts appeared to promote events in support of Clinton, according to indictments issued by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe committee will continue its investigations into the unmasking of Americans’ names in intelligence reports, as well as abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other matters, the summary said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also continue to investigate how the Trump dossier “made its way from Russian sources to the Clinton campaign,” as well as “problematic contacts” between senior Intelligence Community officials and the media.\n\nShortly before the summary was released, investigative journalist Sara Carter reported that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper allegedly leaked to CNN early last year that President-Elect Donald Trump and President Obama received a classified briefing on the dossier.",

    "body": "“Everything they’re accusing Trump of … Obama had done,” said Lee Smith of “Trump-Russia collusion” narratives pushed by Democrats and their news media allies.\nSmith, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, joined SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight for a Thursday interview with Breitbart News’s Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak to discuss his latest article, “The Media Stopped Reporting the Russia Collusion Story Because They Helped Create It.”\nSmith highlighted the Washington Post’s Anne Applebaum, the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, and the New Yorker’s David Remnick as hypocritical news media figures in their criticisms of the Trump administration’s supposed appeasement of Russia and Vladimir Putin after ignoring actual appeasement of Russia and Vladimir Putin across eight years of the Obama administration.\nOn March 26, 2012, then-President Barack Obama told then-Russian President Dmitri Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” in shaping U.S. foreign policy toward Russia after that year’s presidential election:\nVIDEO\n“Big-name” and “respected’  journalists like Applebaum, Goldberg, and Remnick “enlisted their bylines in a political campaign on behalf of the Democratic candidate for president,” wrote Smith. In so doing, the trio of left-wing Democrat news media figures “rehearsed the talking points [Christopher Steele] later documented.”\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller’s ostensible investigation into the “Russian government’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election” is predicated on lies within the “Christopher Steele dossier,” said Smith: “The Mueller investigation is premised on the Steele dossier. It’s premised on nonsense.”\n\n\n\n\nSteele’s allegations – paid for by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee – were central to the procurement of surveillance warrants via the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) for Trump campaign operatives Carter Page and George Papadopoulos (FISC) at the request of Justice Department and FBI officials during the Obama administration.\n“It’s insane. … She’s describing some scenario that’s out of a B movie about all these conspiracies taking place,” said Smith of Applebaum’s 2016 warning that Russia would determine the outcome of the year’s presidential election. \nIn her September 8, 2016, article entitled “How Russia could spark a U.S. electoral disaster,” Applebaum warned that “Russian hackers will seek to break into the U.S. voting system [and] attempt to throw the election.” She further claimed the Russian state “might try to get Trump elected,” or even Clinton.” Alternatively — and this would, of course, be even more devastating — [Russia] might try to rig the election for Clinton, perhaps leaving a trail of evidence designed to connect the rigging operation to Clinton’s campaign.”\nAt the time, Pollak described Applebaum’s warning as a “bizarre conspiracy theory.”\nApplebaum is regularly featured across television news media outlets as a non-ideological and non-partisan expert of international affairs, with a focus on Europe and Russia.\n\n\n\n\nLeft-wing and Democrat-aligned news media outlets succeeded in their desire to prompt a federal investigation of Donald Trump and his presidential campaign to diffuse the public’s attention toward the ostensible investigation of Hillary Clinton’s felonious mishandling of classified information and evasion of record-keeping laws, said Smith.\n“Journalists were participating in a political campaign,” said Smith. “Hillary had an investigation, so the idea was, ‘Well, let’s stick Trump with an investigation, too.’ And that’s what they got. They got an investigation of the Trump campaign, which was insane enough.”\nThe fraudulent investigation of the Trump campaign then morphed into an attempt to nullify the outcome of 2016’s presidential election, said Smith.\n“After the election, it turned into something even worse,” said Smith. “It turned into an attack, not just on the president. … The purpose was to delegitimize the political choice that American voters made in electing the person that they wanted to be president. It’s an absolutely obscene campaign that the press waged. First, it was against Trump. Then, it was against the American public.”\nSteele had utilized an “echo chamber” strategy among left-wing and partisan news media allies to push the “Trump-Russia collusion” narrative upon the American electorate, wrote Smith: “Much of the Russiagate campaign was conducted in this circular manner. Steele and Simpson built an echo chamber with their opposition research, parts of the law enforcement and intelligence communities, and the press all reinforcing one another.”\n\n\n\n\nThe news media are broadly avoiding the “falling apart” of Mueller’s ostensible investigation given their central role in its genesis, said Smith.\n“Everything they’re accusing Trump of leaning toward, the Obama administration has done,” said Smith. “In Ukraine, in Syria. Whether or not you agree with Obama’s policy — I did not — but whether or not you agree with it, the fact is this is what the Obama administration did. All of a sudden, for the same people, like David Remnick, like Jeffrey Goldberg, who were speaking with President Obama extensively [and] repeatedly, for them to somehow ignore that this is what Obama had done and that suddenly, Trump was this insane outlier, that this had never happened before, that, in itself, was a huge tell.”\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\nLISTEN:",

It is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019.\n\nLast week, Breitbart News and two other news outlets were escorted by the Pakistan military into the country’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to one observation post along the border near the Pakistani village of Miran Shah and just about 30 miles from Khost, Afghanistan – once considered a terrorist hotbed.\n\nThere, shiny double-layered fencing could be seen zigzagging the hilly terrain for miles between observation posts, spaced three to five kilometers apart. They are currently being manned by the Pakistan Army Frontier Corps.\n\n\n\nPakistan’s top military officer, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, conceived of the idea when he took command in November 2016 as Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff. Construction began last June.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Pakistan military’s top spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, it has “phenomenally reduced the unchecked border crossings.”\n\nThe fence is being constructed at a critical time between U.S. and Pakistan relations.\n\nPakistan has come under increasing pressure from the U.S. to stop militants in Afghanistan from seeking safe haven in Pakistan. Last year, the U.S. sent an additional 4,000 forces to Afghanistan and in January, the Trump administration announced the cutting of security assistance to Pakistan.\n\nThroughout the 17-year-war, militants have launched attacks against U.S. and Afghan forces in Afghanistan, then melted into the mountainous terrain of the FATA, a semi-autonomous tribal region that makes up roughly a third of Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan.\n\nFormer head of Al Qaeda, now deceased Osama Bin Laden, evaded ten years of capture after masterminding the 9/11 attacks from the border region and then slipping quietly into Pakistan, where he lived in a compound in Abbottabad, about 75 miles north of the capitol of Islamabad.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Pakistani officials deny knowing he was there, it further soured trust between U.S. and Pakistan and increased American suspicion that Pakistan was playing a double game of pledging help but looking the other way on terrorists.\n\nAt the behest of the U.S., Pakistan has cracked down on terrorists in this region, but with uneven success, facing heavy backlash from terrorists. On December 26, 2014, Tehrik-i-Taliban militants — commonly referred to as the “Pakistan Taliban” — struck an Army-run public school in northwest Pakistan, killing 132 children.\n\nIn 2014, the Pakistan Army launched its largest counterterrorism operation to date, dubbed Operation Zarb-e-Azb. In the FATA, that has meant some villages like Miran Shah have been almost completely leveled, in order to root out tunnels terrorists used to hide and store caches of weapons. The city is in the process of being rebuilt and renovated.\n\n\n\nSince the operation began in 2014, the security situation has improved, and Pakistani leaders are eager to capitalize on that success — by building the fence, cracking down on terrorists, and urging an end to the war next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan officials see hope in peace talks. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently offered peace talks to the Taliban, who have expressed some interest but are reluctant to enter into talks unless the U.S. is directly involved.\n\nThe U.S. has so far declined direct talks with the Taliban, urging an Afghan government-led process. Pakistani officials are imploring Americans to enter talks or consider restarting the Quadrilateral Coordination Group, which involved the U.S., Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis also expressed support for political reconciliation during an unannounced visit to Afghanistan this week, but he reiterated the U.S. position that the talks would be Afghan-led and not directly with the Taliban.\n\nStill, Pakistani officials are hopeful that Ghani’s offer is a turning point, and Pakistan can emerge from the specter of terrorism plaguing their country. They say more than 80,000 Pakistanis have been killed by terrorism.\n\nFor Pakistan, the wall is a symbol that enough is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistani officials say previous efforts to control the border have not been easy, for several reasons.\n\nFor one, the border, drawn by the British in 1896, cut across tribes and families. For example, Miran Shah is divided into three sub-divisions, which are divided into 15 sub-tribes, some of which span both sides of the border.\n\n“Many of the sub-tribes live close to the border, but also across the border,” said Pakistan Army Brigadier-General Jawad, commander of forces in Miran Shah.\n\nPakistani officials say locals have exploited easement rights that were granted after the border was drawn, and admit they have been lenient on them.\n\nAnother challenge has been the complexity of the terrain, which includes vast stretches of mountain ranges, some as high as 11,500 feet. Patrolling the mountains is a costly endeavor, and the Pakistan Army is split between its border with Afghanistan and its border with India, particularly in the Kashmir region.\n\n\n\nAnother difficulty has been the lack of cooperation — and capacity — from Afghan officials. Afghanistan does not formally accept the border, and has resisted any formal demarcation.\n\n“There is no corresponding border management on the other side,” said Pakistan Army Maj. Gen. Nadeem Anjum, inspector general of the Frontier Corps in Balochistan. “It is almost unilaterally managed.”\n\nPakistan is planning to build seven times more observation posts than Afghanistan along the border. Officials say the posts on the Afghan side will be clustered together, leaving large gaps in between.\n\nThen there is the sheer enormity of the border crossings.\n\nAt the Chaman border gate in Baluchistan, just south of the FATA, a minimum of 20,000 people and 300 to 400 trucks cross per day. And Chaman is just the second busiest border crossing.\n\nThere, Pakistani officials say Afghans seeking entry into Pakistan will often present border guards with only a handwritten note from an unknown tribal elder. There is also no system for checking the hundreds of trucks that cross the border.\n\n\n\nGiven the many challenges, Pakistan officials have decided to build a fence. It is not clear whether they were inspired by President Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall, but a number of Pakistani officials pointed to the U.S.’s difficulty in controlling its border with Mexico.\n\n“So please understand our predicament,” Ghafoor said.\n\nAsked what would happen if a militant drove an armored military vehicle into the fencing, he replied, “There is no obstacle that is non-negotiable.” But, he added, “It’s an effort to discourage them.”\n\nMaj. Gen. Anjum said there have been attempts in Baluchistan to breach the fencing, but they have been “unsuccessful.”\n\nThe border system will cost Pakistan more than $500 million to build.\n\nPakistan is also trying to implement a passport and identification card regime by the end of this year. A visa office is planned near Chaman Gate, so that Pakistanis do not have to travel to the capital of Islamabad to obtain a visa.\n\nBut in the meantime, the fence will continue being built.\n\n“Fence it. Then manage it,” said Anjum. “It’s the simplest solution in the history of the world.”",

    "body": "The 2018 omnibus budget provides funds to build just 33 miles of new border fence in Texas and denies any funds for President Donald Trump’s preferred border walls.\nPro-immigration Democrats emphasized their funding and symbolic victory over Trump’s populist agenda by directing the business-first GOP leadership to also include a prohibition in the omnibus bill barring the prototype walls which Trump showcased this month:\n\nThe amounts designated in subsection (a)(2) through (a)(4) shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, (Public Law 115–31), such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\n\nThe $641 million allocated for new fences is only 0.05 percent of the $1.3 trillion spending bill, or just 5 cents in a $100 bill.\n\nEven though GOP leaders face a tough election in November, they first negotiated the deal and then blamed the President for the shortfall and the Democrats’ political win, according to a report in the Washington Post. In the meeting with Trump — who has the constitutional power to veto the legislation — the Hill leaders:\n\nall made their pitch to Trump in support of the spending agreement … They argued that he was getting money for the border wall at a level the White House had been signaling was acceptable.\n\nRyan, other GOP leaders and their allies, including Marc Short, Trump’s congressional outreach chief, have long opposed Trump’s populist agenda, despite its central role in the 2016 campaign. The business-first Republicans fear Trump’s populist agenda will help short the supply of cheap foreign labor to their business allies, and subsequently drive up Americans’ wages.\n\nGOP leaders say the bill includes money for roughly 100 miles of fencing — but that number includes roughly 77 miles of second- fending or fencing upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill also marks a big success for Democrats who have fought tooth-and-nail against Trump’s signature project and his high-wage/low immigration economic strategy.\n\nThe Democrats’ win means that Trump will be able to extend the existing variety of walls by only 33 miles during his first two years, leaving him 667 miles short of his 700-mile goal. At that rate of progress, Trump will reach his 700-mile goal after 22 years of bitter argument with the pro-migrant D.C. establishment.\n\nDemocrats are trying to hide their glee. “We’re feeling very good about this,” said the Democrats’ Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer. “When it’s unveiled, you will see. We’re not going to get into any more details.”\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats’ House leader, said:\n\nDemocrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law.  The bill does not allow any increase in deportation officers or detention beds.  We are disappointed that we did not reach agreement on Dreamer protections that were worthy of these patriotic young people.\n\nThe Democrats’ win is especially remarkable because Democrats know their pro-migration agenda is unpopular in the midwestern states where vulnerable Democratic incumbents face the votes in November. After the Democrats voted en-bloc to stop Trump’s popular immigration reforms on February 15, Sen. Dick Durbin told National Public Radio that:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some [Democratic Senators], it’s easy. For others, it is painful. It’s dangerous politically. As I went up to their desks – and many of them were up for re-election – I said ‘Thank you,’ and several of them said to me, ‘If this cost me my Senate seat, so be it.’ You know, those are moments you’re proud to be a senator.\n\nFor 2018, Trump had asked for $1.6 billion to build 74 miles of new walls. But GOP’s business-first leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, traded Trump’s border agenda to Democrats in exchange for other favors, such as Democratic acceptance of $78 billion in Pentagon spending.\n\nThe 2018 omnibus provides only $696 million to build 33 miles of new border fencing — while also ensuring that Schumer will get a similar amount of funding to start building a tunnel in his home state of New York.\n\nIn May 2017, Democrats also stopped Trump from getting money for a new border wall in the 2017 omnibus. Trump had asked the GOP majorities in the House and Senate for $1.5 billion, but Democrats ensured he got only $341 million to repair and replace existing border barriers.\n\nThe 2018 bill does also provide $25 million to build 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego, California, and $445 million to replace existing fencing along the border.\n\nThe legislation says:\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC. 230. (a) Of the amount made available in this Act under ‘‘U.S. Customs and Border Protection—Procurement, Construction, and Improvements’’, $1,571,000,000 shall be available only as follows:\n\n(1) $251,000,000 for approximately 14 miles of secondary fencing, all of which provides for cross barrier visual situational awareness, along the southwest border in the San Diego Sector;\n\n(2) $445,000,000 for 25 miles of primary pedestrian levee fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector;\n\n(3) $196,000,000 for primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector;\n\n(4) $445,000,000 for replacement of existing primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border;\n\n(5) $38,000,000 for border barrier planning and design;\n\n…\n\n(b) The amounts designated in subsection (a)(2) through (a)(4) shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, (Public Law 115–31), such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\n\nThe defeat for Trump’s election-winning border reform was welcome by business interests, which favor the northward flow of migrant customers and low-wage workers into the United States.\n\nThe Democrats — aided by cooperative business-first GOP leaders — added additional measures to help the inflow of illegal immigrants.\n\nDemocrats blocked Trump’s request for new authorities to penalize so-called “sanctuary cities” that protect companies’ use of illegal immigrants, including criminals. “It is absolutely insane what the sanctuary cities are doing,” responded Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert told Fox News.\n\nThey basically have said ‘We want the federal money; in fact, we demand the federal money keep flowing, but otherwise, we’re succeeding from the union. We don’t care what they say about the immigration laws. We don’t care what Congress, or the President has said.\n\nThe Democrats also helped illegal immigrants by blocking funding to increase the number of detention beds. That is important because once border officers have filled the available detention beds with illegal immigrants, they are forced to let additional migrants go free into U.S. cities.\n\nIn general, Democrats support illegal immigration because the cheap labor delivers a major economic subsidy to their cheap-labor business supporters in Democratic-dominated towns. The resulting migrant populations also provide a pool of future Democratic voters and activists — plus a steady supply of new Democratic-leaning citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats also rejected Trump’s offer to extend the DACA amnesty for three years for 690,000 illegals in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funding.\n\nTrump’s immigration priorities are very popular — and carried him to his shocking victory in November.\n\nBusiness groups and Democrats tout misleading, industry-funded “Nation of Immigrants” polls which pressure Americans to say they welcome migrants, including the roughly 680,000 ‘DACA’ illegals and the roughly 3.25 million ‘dreamer’ illegals.",

Prager said:\nI was wrong. My opposition to Donald Trump was wrong, in retrospect. I was wrong. I had friends who supported him, and I didn’t understand them. I said, “Are you not aware of what he said about John McCain? Isn’t that enough to disqualify the guy?” They perceived in him what I did not perceive in him, that these over-the-top statements – as objectionable as the statements themselves may be, and none of them defended the statements – nevertheless, what they perceived was accurate: a man who doesn’t give a damn about what the press says about him. That is the only way to govern. It is the only way to advance the principles of conservatism in the United States is to not give a damn.\n“[Donald Trump] is so much better a president than Mitt Romney would’ve made,” said Prager, describing Romney as “tepid” and concerned with appealing to news media outlets such as The New York Times. \nA president’s actions are a more important metric of presidential success than a president’s demeanor, said Prager:\nWould I like Donald Trump to have Mitt Romney’s temperament, or for that matter Barack Obama’s temperament? Yeah. So what? I would like a whole host of things. People are packages. What a president does is more important to me than a president’s demeanor. He is so much better a president than Mitt Romney would’ve made. Mitt Romney would’ve awakened every day to read The New York Times editorial page to see how he’s covered. Mitt Romney gave us Romneycare in Massachusetts. I campaigned for Mitt Romney, he would’ve been a better president [than Barack Obama]. Any Republican is better than any Democrat, that’s just the way it is. Having said that, Romney would’ve been a tepid president. Nothing comparably conservative compared to Donald Trump.\nConcerns with a president’s demeanor should be secondary to broader analyses of a president’s impact, said Prager.\n\n\n\n\n“He has turned out to be a great president with big communication flaws, in the way he tweets and some of the things he says and his temperament,” said Prager. “My temperament is the opposite. I love dignity. I love understatement. Okay, so be it. So what? I’m not sure I’d be as good a president as he. How do you like that? That’s how good he’s been.”\nLISTEN:\n\nIn April of 2017, Prager invited ostensibly conservative NeverTrump news media figures to celebrate Trump’s presidency. “Do conservatives — or non-leftists, for that matter — appreciate just how terrific Donald Trump has been as president?” he asked. “And how lucky we are that he won the presidency?”\n“What I do know is that they ought to be deeply appreciative of him, and deeply grateful for luck or providence, and certainly for Trump himself, that he was elected president,” continued Prager. “First, it is unlikely that any other Republican would have defeated Hillary Clinton. Second, he has not only surpassed many of our expectations but also thus far governed in a manner more consistent with conservative principles than any president since Ronald Reagan, and arguably Calvin Coolidge.”\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.",

William Owens, president of the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP) refers to Farrakhan’s statement in a recent speech: “White folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God’s grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I’m here to say your time is up, your world is through.”\n\nOwens observes Waters was among those present at Farrakhan’s speech.\n\n“Rep. Waters’ refusal to speak out against Farrakhan and other extremist hate speech is the perfect example of the hypocrisy and moral cowardice of the Congressional Black Caucus,” Owens says. “Rep. Waters lives in a multi-million dollar home, a stark contrast to the poor district she represents. She manipulates African American voters for her own gain. And she’s just one of many black leaders who have sold out our  Rev. William Owens (@caapusa) February 15, 2018\n\nIn February, Waters appeared on a BET special program that focused on President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address – though Waters herself did not attend the event as a protest against the president. She said, nevertheless, that Trump is a “racist.”\n\n“One speech cannot and does not make Donald Trump presidential,” she said. “He’s not presidential, and he never will be presidential. He claims that’s bringing people together but make no mistake, he is a dangerous, unprincipled, divisive, and shameful racist.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in January, a photograph of then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Farrakhan taken in 2005 at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus was released after a 13-year cover-up to protect Obama’s political career.\n\nOwens joined civil rights educator Dr. Alveda King and other black leaders in February to publicly rebuke the CBC as a “disgrace” and “traitors” to black Americans. The leaders accused CBC members of engaging in “childish” behavior during the State of the Union address, with their “sulking in their seats, texting, pretending to be disinterested.”\n\n“Without question, the CBC’s foul demeanor has been a just cause to demand either ‘REPRESENT or GO AWAY,’” Owens said at the time. “I make a strong plea to the black community to embrace this position with openness and hear us out; we have been sidelined by traitors in Washington and must engage.”\n\nOwens and his group have launched a petition to hold the CBC accountable to the “values and needs of the African American community.” The petition further says many “so-called ‘civil rights leaders’ have lost touch with the moral values of mainstream African Americans.”\n\n“We’ve watched for years as Democratic politicians offered African Americans platitudes and promises in exchange for political loyalty,” Owens asserts, adding:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Democratic policies reduced our inner cities to crumbling, crime-ridden, economic wastelands. And yet, we are supposed to continue on, not questioning the policies or politicians that brought us to this point? African American voters have had enough of the double standards and hypocrisy. There is a great hunger for moral leadership in this country. If the Congressional Black Caucus does not step up to meet that demand, they will find themselves in need of new jobs.\n\n“Politicians like Maxine Waters need to step up or go home,” Owens says. “We’ve had enough of their partisan games. They’re stooges of a party that enriches them, but does nothing to help the African American community.”",

Pollak7 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSACRAMENTO, California — California Governor Jerry Brown complained Wednesday that the Trump administration “is basically going to war against the state of California” after Attorney General Jeff Sessions filed a lawsuit Tuesday evening against California’s “sanctuary state” laws.\nThe lawsuit targets three laws in particular: the Immigrant Worker Protection Act (HB 450), the Inspection and Review of Facilities Housing Federal Detainees law (AB 103); and the California Values Act (SB 54). The Trump administration argues that California’s laws are unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause, which states that federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”\n\nSessions flew to Sacramento to mark the occasion with a speech Wednesday morning to a meeting of the California Peace Officers Association, which had opposed SB 54. In his address, Sessions compared California’s resistance to federal immigration law to the efforts of the Old South and the Confederacy to resist the Union.\n\n“There is no nullification.  There is no secession.  Federal law is ‘the supreme law of the land.’  I would invite any doubters to Gettysburg, and to the graves of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln,” Sessions said.\n\nIn response, Brown was enraged.\n\n“This is really unprecedented for the chief law enforcement officer of the United States to come out to California and act more like Fox News than a law enforcement officer. This is a political stunt,” he told reporters, as quoted by The Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nIronically, the Obama administration, through Attorney General Eric Holder, challenged an Arizona immigration law on similar grounds to those that Sessions is using to confront California — and prevailed at the Supreme Court.\n\nNevertheless, Brown warned: “This is basically going to war against the state of California, the engine of the American economy. It’s not wise, it’s not right, and it will not stand.”\n\nIn an additional swipe, the governor declared: “We know the Trump administration is full of liars. They’ve pled guilty already to the special counsel.”\n\nU.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who represents the “sanctuary city” of San Francisco, chimed in as well, accusing the Trump administration of “brazen aggression and intimidation tactics.”\n\n\nThe people of California will not be bowed by the Trump Administration's brazen aggression and intimidation tactics. We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities. #ProtectDREAMers\n\n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) March 7, 2018\n\nJoel B.

The partisan breakdown shows that 74 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of Independents want a special counsel — as do a full 44 percent of Democrats.\n\n\n\n\nIn this particular poll, one fairly positive result for the FBI and Justice Department is that only 35 percent believe these institutions attempted to outright frame President Trump for colluding with the Russians.\nA just-released Rasmussen poll, however, shows that a full 50 percent of Americans “believe it’s at least somewhat likely senior federal law enforcement officials broke the law in an effort to prevent Donald Trump from winning the presidency.” Only 40 percent disagree.\nAnother Rasmussen poll from this week shows that only 42 percent of Americans believe Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election more than the FBI. Moreover, a full 34 percent believe the FBI meddled more than the Russians, while 24 percent are unsure.\nIn other words, we now live in a country where 58 percent of Americans either believe our own FBI meddled in a presidential election more than a hostile foreign government, or are not sure the FBI did not.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s approval rating is running ahead of former-President Obama’s at this point in his failed presidency.\n\n\n\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Agents in this sector lead the nation in the arrest of Bangladesh nationals with 122 so far this year.\nOn March 14 and 15, agents patrolling along the Rio Grande River near Laredo stopped seven illegal immigrants attempting to cross the border in two separate incidents. Further investigation in both cases revealed the individuals were Bangladesh nationals.\n\nBorder Patrol officials stated that 122 Bangladesh nationals have been arrested in the Laredo Sector this fiscal year. Other officials said that number could be much higher.\n\nBorder Patrol Agent Hector Garza, in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 told Breitbart Texas that the Laredo Sector seems to be the focal point for Bangladesh nationals to be smuggled into the U.S.\n\n“The arrest of these people from Bangladesh shows there is a clear pipeline from the Middle East through Mexico to the southern border of Texas,” Garza said in a phone interview. “We have been lucky to catch these but there is no telling how many other people from countries that sponsor terrorism could be utilizing that same pipeline.”\n\nGarza said these people are taught how to avoid being immediately deported at the border.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Many of these people from Bangladesh will claim to be unaccompanied alien minors when they are captured by our agents,” Garza explained. “At that point, they are turned over to immigration officials for processing under the existing catch and release programs for minors.”\n\n“When, during medical and dental examinations, immigration officers determine these people are actually adults, they are issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) and released,” Agent Garza explained.\n\nIt appears no charges are filed against the foreign nationals for initially lying to Border Patrol agents about being juveniles, he said.\n\nLaredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta said crossings in the Laredo Sector is nothing new, KENS CBS5 reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It goes to show that our agents are arresting people from all over the world on a daily basis,” Acosta explained. “Their intentions for entering the country illegally can only be determined after they have been arrested.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe San Antonio CBS affiliate reported other  Border Patrol officials’ claims that the Laredo Sector had the most apprehensions of Bangladesh nationals during the last fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

However, in an interview, Trump said the Russia investigation was also on his mind.\n\nComey told lawmakers that Trump had asked him to let former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn go — who was under FBI investigation — during a private conversation. The president has denied making any such request.\n\nComey later admitted he took notes after conversations with the president, and he gave them to at least one friend to pass to the media after he was no longer FBI director, for the purpose of prompting the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMueller’s team has been negotiating with White House lawyers to work out the specifics of an interview with Trump within “the next few weeks,” according to Axios.\n\nThe “big question” is whether it will be in person, in writing, or a combination of the two.\n\nKenneth Starr, the special counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, told Fox News recently that he did not see any evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\n“I’ve seen nothing in … the firing of [former FBI Director] James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggest the president has obstructed justice,” he told Fox News on February 28.\n\nThe president tweeted repeatedly over the weekend about the special counsel investigation, reflecting his deep frustration over the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Axios’s report is true, it would mean the president was aware during his tweeting that Mueller’s interest is on obstruction of justice, rather than any alleged collusion.\n\nThe president attacked Comey — who is set to launch a book tour next month.\n\n“Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI — A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” he tweeted on Saturday.\n\nTrump also reiterated that there was “no collusion.”\n\n“As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of teh FBI, Justice  State. #DrainTheSwamp.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHe continued tweeting about the probe into Sunday: “The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improerly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nOn Monday, the president continued: “A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!”\n\nDespite his tweets, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said the president had no intention of firing Mueller.\n\n“In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,” he said in a statement.",

Instead, because we are now deep within the head of the media’s fabricated reality where wrong is right and up is down, the “constitutional crisis” is that government wrongdoing was uncovered.\nOne way the media is hoping to shield the federal government from accountability for its indefensible lies, cover-ups, and civil rights violations is to muddy the waters; to distract us with nonsense so that we lose focus on the sins committed by an FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) that abused its power and public trust in unprecedented ways.\nHere are 16 things the media does not want you to know about the Nunes memo:\n\nThe so-called Russian Dossier, the creation of Fusion GPS and former British spy Christopher Steele, is a political document — namely, opposition research, created for the Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nUsing what it knew was opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign, in October of 2016, the FBI and DOJ obtained a FISA warrant from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to install a wiretap to spy on Hillary Clinton’s opponent — the Trump campaign, specifically Carter Page. This spying would last for a year.\nIt should be noted that the FISA court was set up to stop foreign terrorists. The fact that the FBI and DOJ would use this court to not only wiretap an American but to wiretap a presidential campaign belies belief. Why Obama’s FBI and DOJ used this court as opposed to a normal court is obvious. As you will see below, a normal court probably would have denied the wiretap.\nWorse still, in the summer of 2016, Obama’s DOJ had already opened a counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. The fact that nothing from that months-old partisan investigation was used to obtain the Page wiretap is revealing.\nAccording to the Nunes memo, an “essential” part of the FISA wiretap application was the Steele dossier, which again is a partisan political document created for the Clinton campaign.\nSo essential was this partisan dossier, Andrew McCabe, the disgraced former-Deputy Director of the FBI, admitted in December that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” without the dossier.\nNot only did the FBI knowingly use a document from a partisan campaign to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on the competing campaign, the FBI knew the dossier was mostly “salacious and unverified.” We know this because disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey told us so in June of 2017.\nAccording to the Nunes memo, “Steele told [former FBI official Bruce] Ohr, he ‘was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.'”\nOhr, who was part of the FBI’s anti-Trump Russian investigation, was not only friendly with Steele, Ohr’s own wife worked with Steele at Fusion GPS doing opposition research (the dossier) against Trump for the Clinton campaign.\nDespite a) knowing the dossier was opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign b) knowing the dossier was “salacious and unverified” c) knowing Steele was desperate to destroy Trump d) the breathtaking conflict of interest in having an investigator’s own wife working on the dossier, the FBI still went to the FISA court to obtain permission to spy on Hillary Clinton’s opponent.\nIn order to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, all of the conflicts of interest above were withheld from the FISA court — an indefensible (and possibly illegal) lie of omission.\nEven worse, in order to legitimize a warrant request based on a piece of partisan opposition research they knew was “salacious and unverified,” the FBI and DOJ used a media report to bolster the findings in the phony dossier. The FBI and DOJ told the court that the media report was independent verification of the dossier. But this was not true, and, according to the Nunes memo, the FBI and DOJ knew this was not true. The truth is that the phony dossier was the source of this media report.\nAlso hidden from the FISA court was the fact that the FBI obtained Steele as a source but had to fire him in October of 2016 when, in a bid to use his phony dossier to derail the Trump campaign, he leaked his information to the far-left Mother Jones.\nAlthough the FBI and DOJ were willing participants in pushing a “salacious and unverified” narrative against a presidential candidate (primarily through media leaks), this was all hidden from congressional investigators. To begin with, for months, while under oath, Comey said he did not know where the dossier came from — meaning from the Clinton campaign. The Wall Street Journal explains:\n\nWe also know the FBI wasn’t straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators in a briefing on the dossier in January 2017. The FBI did not tell Congress about Mr. Steele’s connection to the Clinton campaign, and the House had to issue subpoenas for Fusion bank records to discover the truth. Nor did the FBI tell investigators that it continued receiving information from Mr. Steele and Fusion even after it had terminated him. The memo says the bureau’s intermediary was Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, whose wife, incredibly, worked for Fusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this dishonesty occurred under Comey, the man our media now holds up as a living saint, a man so desperate to destroy Trump, he not only oversaw those committing the above abuses, he leaked classified information to the news media in order to see a Special Prosecutor appointed against Trump, which his pal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, immediately did.\n\nAnd finally…\n16. Much of the “salacious and unverified” material in the dossier came from the Russians. In other words, those disgusting dossier lies about Trump’s personal behavior came from Russian operatives. So there is no question that it was the Clinton campaign, Democrats, Steele, the FBI, and DOJ who colluded with the Russians to rig a presidential election.\nYes, there was collusion with the Russians, and those in our government currently investigating Trump in the hopes of overturning a presidential election are the colluders.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Cuomo Wants to Give DACA Recipients Free Tuition at State Colleges\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tby Katherine Rodriguez25 Jan 20180\t\t\t\t25 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\t25 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to give illegal aliens brought to the U.S. as children under DACA free tuition at the state’s public colleges.\nCuomo, a Democrat, included a provision in his $168 billion budget that would change the state’s education law to make illegal alien children who were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program eligible to receive free tuition through the Excelsior Scholarship, the New York Post reported.\nThe scholarship gives students free tuition at any New York State public college if their families make $125,000 or less, regardless of grade-point average or standardized test scores.\nThe only condition of the program is that students remain in the state for the “number of years equal to the reward received” to keep the scholarship, meaning that students who receive the free tuition must live and work in the state or pay the money back.\nNot everybody in New York state government is on board with the governor’s proposal. Republicans in the New York State Senate say they would oppose Cuomo’s plan to give free college tuition to illegal aliens.\n“We don’t support giving free college tuition to people who are here illegally,” said Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif.\n\n\n\n\nCuomo proposed other policies that would extend benefits to DACA recipients this week.\nThe New York Democrat announced Tuesday that DACA recipients would receive Medicaid coverage in the state regardless of federal government action.",

    "body": "A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority raises immediate questions about former FBI Director James Comey’s role in utilizing the infamous, largely discredited 35-page anti-Trump dossier to obtain a FISA court warrant to monitor an individual associated with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nOne glaring possible inconsistency centers on Comey’s June 8, 2017 prepared remarks for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where he referred to the anti-Trump dossier as containing “salacious and unverified” material.\nYet, according to the memo crafted by House Republicans, Comey personally signed three FISA court applications utilizing that same dossier that he labeled “salacious and unverified” eight months later to obtain FISA court warrants to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign.\nThe memo documents that on October 21, 2016, the FBI and Justice Department sought and received the FISA order against Page, and that the agencies sought the renewal of the order every 90 days in accordance with court requirements.  Renewals require separate finding of probable cause each time, the memo relates.\nAccording to the memo, Comey “signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.” Sally Yates, then-Acting Deputy Attorney Gernal Dana Boente, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signed one or more of the applications on behalf of the Justice Department.\nThe memo relates the FBI utilized the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as evidence against Page in order to obtain the FISA warrant.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, according to the memo, the FBI and DOJ failed to inform the FISA court of the following:\n\nThat Steele’s Dossier was reportedly funded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm.  “Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,” the memo states.\nThat the initial application notes Steele worked for a “named U.S. person” but does not name the controversial firm Fusion GPS or its founder Glenn Simpson.\nThat Steele reportedly met with Yahoo News at the direction of Fusion GPS.  A Yahoo News article about an alleged trip by Page to Moscow was cited in the FISA warrant, according to the memo.\n\nAfter he allegedly signed three FISA applications based on Steele’s dossier, Comey publically referred to Steele’s work as “salacious and unverified.”\nIn Comey’s June 8, 2017 prepared remarks for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the former FBI chief says that following a January 6 Oval Office meeting with Intelligence Community leaders, Comey “remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.”’\nIt is clear Comey was referring to the dossier since he writes the “salacious and unverified” material was about to be publically reported by the news media.\nHe writes:\n\n\n\n\nThe IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\nFour days after that briefing, the dossier was published by BuzzFeed.\nAlso, in his statement summarizing his conversation with Trump, Comey refers to Russian prostitutes, a key component of the dossier:\nHe said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.\nIn a private White House dinner with Trump on January 27, Comey says the topic of the “salacious material” again came up and he reveals that Trump was considering asking the FBI to investigate the origins of the claims.  Comey pushed back against that idea.\nComey writes:\nDuring the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.\nMeanwhile, despite his role in signing three FISA applications based on a largely debunked dossier that he himself referred to as “unverified,” Comey on Friday took to Twitter to claim the memo’s release “destroyed trust” with the Intelligence community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ  FBI must keep doing their jobs.\n— James Comey (@Comey) February 2, 2018\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Pollak7 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t7 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf responded to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s rebuke on Wednesday, telling reporters that Sessions and President Donald Trump were “racist” for conflating criminals with “immigrants.”\nIn a speech earlier to a gathering of the California Peace Officers Association, Sessions had outlined the U.S. Department of Justice’s case against the state’s “sanctuary” laws, which it filed late Tuesday.\n\nHe also delivered a rebuke to Schaaf for warning illegal aliens ahead of a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in February — a warning that ICE said caused 800 illegal aliens, including convicts, to escape: ”\n\n“How dare you.  How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda.”\n\nIn response, Schaaf delivered a statement at a press conference in Oakland (via CBS San Francisco):\n\nMy response to the Attorney General’s statements this morning is as follows:\n\nHow dare you vilify members of our community by trying to frighten the American public into thinking that all undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals — hard-working, law-abiding Oakland’s like Eusebio and Maria Sanchez, whom you ripped away from their American-born children and the cancer patients at our public hospital who relied on Maria’s nursing skills every day?\n\nHow dare you distract the American people from a failed immigration system that tears apart families and forces the workers that out economy depends on to harvest our crops, delver our services, and build our cities to live in fear and work under oppressed conditions?\n\nHow dare you distort the reality about declining violent crime in a diverse sanctuary city like Oakland, California, to advance your racist agenda?\n\nI am confident that the courts will resolve the dispute between the administration and the great State of California. I am ready to get back to work doing my job as the mayor of Oakland — addressing homelessness, building affordable housing, fixing the streets, creating safe neighborhoods, and ensuring that the children of my community, no matter where they came from, or how they got here, have every opportune for success.\n\nOakland’s agenda is a thriving community. Trump’s agenda is bigotry and vindictiveness.\n\nSessions told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview early Tuesday morning that the Department of Justice was investigating Schaaf for her actions in warning illegal aliens of the ICE raids, but said he could not comment on the case until he had received recommendations from the department’s lawyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchaaf argued that most of the people targeted in the February raid had not been convicted of crimes other than illegal immigration.\n\nJoel B.

    "body": "Friday on Fox News Channel’s “The Ingraham Angle,” host Laura Ingraham gave her take on the indictments handed down by special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe regarding interference in the 2016 presidential election.Ingraham told viewers the indictments illustrated how Russia was still a threat to the United States despite then-President Barack Obama’s dismissal during the 2012 presidential election. She also said Mueller should interview 2016 Democratic Party presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State John Kerry, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes and former President Barack Obama as part of his investigation.\n\nINGRAHAM: We finally have indictments in the Mueller investigation related to meddling in the 2016 election and the only ones being charged are Russians. A federal grand jury has now indicted 13 Russian individuals and companies for interfering in the 2016 election.\nThey are charged with a bunch of things like creating fake ads, staging pro and anti-Trump campaign events and also setting up bogus-run organizations, but they’re not accused of rigging the election for Trump, but instead of waging information warfare to sow discord in the political system.\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictments and added this important caveat.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Did you hear that? No American knowingly took part in the meddling and the plot had no effect on the outcome of the election. The facts, as we know them right now, support the president’s argument, an argument we have been making on this show for months, that there was no Russian collusion.\nTrump took a bit of a victory lap, tweeting today, “Russia started their anti-U.S. campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for president. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong. No collusion.”\nWell, it certainly looks that way, but we don’t know for sure what else Mueller may have up his sleeve. Though, I’ll tell you who this totally vindicates. Conservatives and Republicans who have been warning people for years about how devious the Russians can be in this situation.\nRemember, when President Obama sarcastically mocked Mitt Romney’s Russia warning back in 2012 during the presidential debate.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nFORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: When you’re asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not al Qaeda, you said Russia. In the 1980s or now, calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the cold war has been over for 20 years.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Now, Obama was so convinced of that, his DOJ and FBI did next to nothing about the Russian skulduggery. I love that word. His State Department actually approved the visas for the Russian operatives that were indicted by Mueller today.\nHis FBI began spying on Trump Campaign Advisor Carter Page with a FISA warrant in the fall of 2016. Now details in today’s indictment do point to vindication for the Trump team. This is Jonathan Turley from tonight’s “Special Report.”\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJONATHAN TURLEY: This makes more sense than the narratives that everyone has been throwing around in conspiracies. This began in 2014, began before the presidential election. The Russians were taking targets of opportunity and shooting at everybody in the election but certainly working more against Hillary Clinton. But what it does show is that they did a really quite impressive job in finding this cyber trail to these individuals.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: I’ll say. And the indictment describes rallies that took place after the election, both in support of and against Trump, and by the way, some of them happened on the same day, all allegedly promoted by these Russian accounts.\nYou see this ad? Well, according to “Buzzfeed,” this anti-Trump rallies staged just four days after the election was promoted by something called “Black Matters U.S.,” a social media campaign thought to be organized by Russians.\nSo, why would Trump collude with Russians to stage anti-Trump rallies? Does that make any sense? Here’s the bottom line. The Trump campaign did not know about Russian interference in the election. But the Obama administration certainly did and may have in fact enabled it.\nGiven that we already know Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC paid for that fake Russian dossier, it’s time for the special counsel to interview Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes, and maybe even Barack Obama. I say it’s high time that we determine who really colluded with the Russians.",

    "body": "New text messages discovered by congressional investigators between two FBI agents who worked on the Trump-Russia investigation reveal that one of them was close friends with the judge who had presided over Michael Flynn’s case before being abruptly recused.\nThe text messages, handed over by the Justice Department to Congress, show that FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI attorney Lisa Page, had discussed Strzok’s personal relationship with District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras and whether or not it would be a conflict of interest.\n\nAccording to investigative journalist Sara Carter, Page wrote to Strzok on July 25, 2016, referring to the secret court that grants surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: “Rudy is on the FISC! Did you know that? Just appointed two months ago.”\n\nStrzok responds later: “I did. We talked about it before and after. I need to get together with him.”\n\nHe also wrote: “….She brought up a good point about being circumspect in talking to him in terms of not placing him into a situation where he’d have to recuse himself.”\n\nPage responded: “I can’t imagine you either one of you could talk about anything in detail meaningful enough to warrant recusal.”\n\n\n\n\n\nStrzok then expresses skepticism over whether it would not be a conflict of interest, given their friendship.\n\nHe joked: “Really? Rudy. I’m in charge of espionage for the FBI. Any espionage FISA comes before him, what should he do? Given his friend oversees them?”\n\nPage wrote back: “Standards for recusal are quite high. I just don’t think this poses an actual conflict. And he doesn’t know what you do?”\n\nStrzok expressed doubt: “Generally he does know what I do. Not the level or scope or area but he’s super thoughtful and rigorous about ethics and conflicts.”\n\nHe then said someone — whose name is redacted — suggested he and Contreras meet at a “social setting” for “cover.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“(redacted) suggested a social setting with others would probably be better than a one on one meeting. I’m sorry, I’m just going to have to invite you to that cocktail party. Of course, you’ll be there. Have to come up with some other work people cover for action.”\n\nPage replied: “Why more? Six is a perfectly fine dinner party.”\n\nIt is not clear whether Strzok’s relationship with Contreras had anything to do with his recusal on the case, and some legal experts point out that it is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to know judges outside of the courtroom, particularly those serving in the same area.\n\nBut the texts have raised questions for lawmakers exercising oversight of the DOJ.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, member of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, told Carter: “Why did Contreras recuse himself?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Text messages show he had a relationship with Strzok …Why did the DOJ make it difficult for us to get the information? To me, those are the two fundamental questions. We don’t know that answers to either one of those ”\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-SC) told Carter: “I think from my standpoint we’re asking the Department of Justice and the FBI to give us the documents we need to do proper oversight.”\n\n“Failing to be able to provide Congress with those documents in an expeditious manner would certainly strengthen the case for a special prosecutor,” he said. “There is no reason why we cannot get the same documents the Inspector General has.”\n\nTheir complaints come as the chairmen of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling for a second special counsel to look into any improper behavior at the FBI and the DOJ.\n\nStrzok and Page’s text messages occurred July 2016, just as the FBI launched its investigation into the Trump campaign. Later, the FBI would seek a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It is not known which judge signed off on the warrant, though there are unconfirmed reports that it was Contreras.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrzok and another agent would then interview Flynn in January 2017 about his phone conversations with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kisylak. Although Strzok and then-FBI Director James Comey reportedly believed that Flynn had not lied or intentionally misled, Flynn was later charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with one count of lying.\n\nStrzok himself was removed from Mueller’s team in July 2017 after hundreds of pages of text messages between he and Page were found by the Justice Department inspector general, who was investigating bias in handling the Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation. Page had already finished her assignment on the team when they were discovered. The two were reportedly engaged in an extramarital affair.\n\nStrzok and Page had served on the Clinton email investigation, the FBI’s initial investigation into the Trump campaign, and the subsequent special counsel team. In text messages throughout that time, they expressed loathing of Trump and support for Clinton.\n\nContreras presided over Flynn’s Dec. 1, 2017 hearing in which the former national security adviser pleaded guilty. He was abruptly recused from the case days later, on Dec. 7, 2017, without any public explanation. The new judge, Emmet Sullivan, requested that the special counsel provide any evidence that would be favorable to Flynn’s case.\n\nSome legal experts pointed out it was standard operating procedure for Sullivan, but lawyer Margot Cleveland said he also entered a footnote with the order that explained why evidence favorable to Flynn, even after a guilty plea, could be a basis for throwing out the plea.\n\nJordan and other members told Carter they were facing restrictive rules from the DOJ in viewing the text messages.\n\nThey said the DOJ only allowed them to review the text messages at DOJ headquarters and only highly redacted text messages were allowed to be removed for their oversight of the Justice Department’s handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nThey said of 1.2 million documents collected by the Justice Department Inspector General, the House Oversight Committee has only received 3,162 “unique documents.”",

    "body": "China expert Steven Mosher joined Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight to discuss the revelations in Peter Schweizer’s new book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, concerning the Chinese government’s influence peddling via “sweetheart deals” with family members of prominent American politicians.\nMosher, the president of the Population Research Institute and author of Bully of Asia: Why China’s Dream is the New Threat to World Order, explained how Schweizer’s new book documents a form of “officially sanctioned corruption” that is deeply rooted in Chinese political culture. He detailed how the Chinese regime purchases political influence in America via the cultivation of economic relationships with prominent politicians’ family members, including, as Schweizer’s book reveals, the son of Joe Biden, the father- and sister-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and the son-in-law of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn his interview Friday with Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour, Mosher praised Schweizer’s past work, as president of the Government Accountability Institute, in exposing government corruption.\n\n“I have to say that Peter Schweizer — who I’ve known for many years and I regard as a friend — is just a bulldog when it comes to this kind of thing,” Mosher said. “He does his research, he’s gone into the Chinese language websites of some of these firms and translated them into English and made accessible to us information that we would never otherwise know. It’s an amazing piece of research.”\n\nMansour and her guest co-host, actress and author Sam Sorbo, detailed the revelations in Schweizer’s book concerning the Chinese government’s influence peddling in America, including the close ties between the Chinese regime and the family shipping business founded by Elaine Chao’s father. Elaine Chao is Mitch McConnell’s wife and President Trump’s Transportation Secretary.\n\nMansour noted that McConnell’s sister- and father-in-law both sat on the board of China State Shipbuilding Corp. (CSSC), a state-run shipbuilding company described by Schweizer as “a state-owned defense conglomerate … at the heart of the Chinese government’s military-industrial complex.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMansour further noted that, according to Schweizer’s research, the Chinese government-controlled Bank of China appointed McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, to its board of directors “shortly after President Trump was elected.” \n\n“The bank’s board of directors up until that point included all senior Chinese officials and one lone Dutch banker,” said Mansour, before sarcastically remarking, “Now, I’m sure it was all based on her qualifications, and she was the most qualified member of Mitch McConnell’s family to get that position. So I don’t think we have anything to worry about.”\n\nMosher described China’s influence peddling as a “reverse King Midas effect,” drawing on the Greek mythological figure’s ability to turn things to gold with a touch. The Chinese, he said, held gold in their hands as they sought to purchase influence from various figures and companies. He further explained how corrupt influence peddling is deeply rooted in Chinese political history. \n\n\n\n“What we see in China is kind of a reverse King Midas effect,” said Mosher. “We all remember the Greek story of King Midas, who whenever he touched something it turned to gold. Well, whenever the Chinese communists touch anything, they have gold in their hands and they want to pass it along to the person or company they’re dealing with, so it really is all buying influence. This has a long history in China, by the way, going back a couple of thousand years.” \n\n\n\n\n\nMosher explained, “When Chinese officials were appointed to govern a province or …. a county, the emperor who appointed them did not give them a budget, he just gave them permission to go to that county [or] province and extort, accept bribes, accept fees of various kinds, and tax the people into poverty. They were expected to raise their own money [and] budget to support themselves, their households, and all their employees in the official government residence…. They would be on the take from the get-go. That’s what was expected of them, so it was officially sanctioned corruption.”\n\n“The political culture of China from the beginning has been based on this kind of corruption of officials using their authority [and] power to make money [and] to use money to make even more money,” said Mosher. “What we now see on the international stage is this whole Chinese gold play that happens inside of China — it’s happened for hundreds of years — now it’s being exported to other parts of the world like the United States, and again, the reverse King Midas effect, how they’re corrupting everything they touch including the family members of American politicians who actually may not be that hard to bring around to the Chinese point of view.”\n\n“What did China get in exchange?” asked Mansour of Mosher.\n\n“I think there’s no question that China wants something in exchange,” replied Mosher. “These are not free gifts. This is not a market-based investment, for example, into the Rosemont Seneca firm that was set up by Hunter Biden [and] Devon Archer, as [Peter Schweizer] reports. This was a calculated effort to buy influence with the son of the vice president of the United States. … Had you or I walked in with the same proposal, we wouldn’t even have gotten past the receptionist. These people were able to get in because of their parents [and] their family connections to see very high-level officials who consciously wanted to ink a deal in order to rope them in to the Chinese way of seeing and doing things.”\n\nMosher explained the revelation in Schweizer’s book concerning a billion-dollar investment firm established by Hunter Biden — Joe Biden’s son — and the state-run Bank of China.\n\n\n\n\n\n“In [Peter Schweizer’s] account that was published in the New York Post, it’s very clear that one of the consequences of this one-billion dollar investment fund that was set up and guaranteed by China — by the way, so you can’t lose money, again, it’s not a market-based decision; if the Chinese government is guaranteeing the fund then it’s a no-lose proposition — and they went out and bought an American company that had a dual-use technology that was useful in not just a commercial sense, but in a military sense, as well, and for some reason this sale, which should have been blocked, was approved,” related Mosher. “So, I think you can see how it works.”\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration approved a Chinese state-owned company’s 51-percent-majority purchase of Henniges, an American “dual-use” parts manufacturer involved in the production of “anti-vibration” automotive technologies with possible military applications. The deal was approved by the the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), speculated Mosher, in part due to a Biden-linked firm’s purchasing of the remaining 49-percent-minority stake in Henniges.\n\nSorbo noted how Thornton Group —  a “politically connected consultancy firm” connected to Rosemont Seneca — documented its meeting in China with Hunter Biden on the Chinese-language side of its website, but omitted such details from its English-language website.\n\n“On the Chinese side, they were happy to brag about how they had managed win influence and buy friends in the United States, and yet their American partners were much more reticent to reveal exactly what was going on,” stated Mosher. “I wonder why.”\n\nSorbo framed Chinese purchasing of political influence as a function of a self-serving domestic political class: “This is what you get when you get a political class, an elite class, and they feel that they’re untouchable, and they’re using their political power and their access to their own benefit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s influence peddling of the worst kind,” concurred Mosher. “Going back a hundred years, Warren G. Harding got in trouble because his energy secretary was dealing in oil leases. This is far worse than the kind of scandals and corruption we’ve seen in American history because it deals with a selling out America to a hostile foreign power. China does not wish us well. China wishes to replace us on the world stage, and they’re buying influence and buying companies and stealing technology piecemeal. But they have a plan. This is not happening just by chance. They’re targeting the family members of powerful influential American politicians, offering them sweetheart deals knowing that once the deal is inked that they will have that family not in their pocket necessarily, but they’ll certainly get a sympathetic hearing on any China issues that comes up.”\n\nMosher didn’t question Joe  Biden’s patriotism, but noted that when the company or firm of a politician’s family member receives “enormous benefits from these sweetheart deals… it has to soften their views on America’s stance towards China.”\n\nSorbo challenged Mosher’s assessment of Biden’s intentions: “I might have a bit of a harder line than you on this, because my understanding is that Biden flew over [to China] for meetings and brought his son. So he’s the one parading his son around saying, ‘Look at my fine young man. Can you do anything for him?'”\n\nMosher also noted China’s efforts to influence Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor, by offering him $600 million towards an outstanding debt on a Manhattan property owed by Kushner’s family business.\n\n“The Chinese came in and offered [Jared Kushner] $600 million to prop up his loan for the 666 Fifth Avenue building, which is heavily in debt,” said Mosher. “He turned down the offer, but you can see how the Chinese are playing this game. They pick targets of opportunity. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don’t, but every time they succeed they chisel away at American resolve to confront what is, after all, I think a mortal danger to the American republic, a mortal danger certainly to the rule of law in the world and the current world order.”\n\nPeter Schweizer’s new book Secret Empires will hit bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, March 20.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

But we never stopped loving each other, or rooting for each other,” she said. “We respect each other, and we know that as a united front, there is nothing that we cannot conquer.”\n“So let my family be an example, that we do not have to pick sides,” Lawrence added. “We are experiencing the same thing in this country right now. And it’s time to come together. Across ideologies, across parties. It’s time to unite to fix our democracy. Because regardless of where our politics fall, at the grassroots, the American people don’t deserve to pay taxes to a system that is rigged against them.”\nLawrence — who also served as emcee Saturday night — serves on the Board of Directors at Represent.us, a self-described nonpartisan anti-corruption organization and one of the sponsors of the event. The actress previously raffled an opportunity to go wine-tasting with her in California to benefit the organization.\nIn an August interview with Vogue, Lawrence said the country must find a “bridge” between citizens with differing political views.\n\n\n\n\n“We can’t continue this divide and anger. There are issues affecting us as human beings, not as liberals and not as Republicans. We have to protect the foundation of this country, and acceptance,” Lawrence told the magazine. “If you’re preaching acceptance, accept immigrants, accept Muslims, accept everybody.”\nThe A-list actress has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump since well before the 2016 presidential election.\nVIDEO\nA year before the ballots were cast in November 2016, Lawrence predicted it would be the “end of the world” if Trump were elected. In a later appearance on the UK’s Graham Norton Show, the actress said she had once hoped to meet Trump at a concert, so she could tell him, “Hey Trump, f*ck you!” And in a December interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lawrence said she had planned to say something “not nice” to Trump in the event she meets him, and added that it would end “with a martini to the face.”\nThe actress announced in November she would take a brief hiatus from acting, though she is set to appear in several films in 2018.\n\n\n\n\nOther stars at Saturday night’s event included comedians Tig Notaro, Nikki Glaser and Adam Yenser, while the Preservation All-Stars provided musical entertainment.\nWatch the full event above.\n \nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",

They won’t tell us what countries they’re from. What religion they’re from,” said Michael Walsh.\n\nHe said the 300-strong rural community of Lisdoonvarna could be radically changed by such a large and sudden influx, and that many concerned locals were fearful of accusations of racism if they questioned it.\n\n“They just proposed to expand the population of this little village by what? Twenty-five per cent? Thirty-three per cent actually!” he exclaimed in an interview with Breitbart News Editor in Chief Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM.\n\n\n“And [the asylum seekers] are starting to come in this week,” he said, explaining how the contracts for the deal have now been signed this Wednesday, making it a “done deal”, despite 93 per cent of Lisdoonvarna residents last week voting against turning a local hotel into asylum seeker accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The hotelier who had publically said ‘if the people of Lisdoonvarna don’t want this I won’t sign the contract’ has signed the contract. He’s now weaselled back on it,” Mr. Walsh added, speculating that the owner stands to make between one and two million euros from the government in a year.\n\n\nFrom Matchmaking town to #DirectProvision Centre- I’m live in #Lisdoonvarna #Clare @drivetimerte as locals seek postponement of #AsylumSeekers arrival pic.twitter.com/JI5XZSTwj7\n\n— John Cooke (@johncookeradio) February 26, 2018\n\nMr. Walsh – a screenwriter, author, filmmaker, and former Breitbart News editor – grew up in the U.S. but has roots in the isolated town of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, which hosts a popular matchmaking festival in the summer, attracting many tourists.\n\nHe returned to the area in his twenties to “reconnect” with his Irish roots and renovate a property there. Like others, he wanted to experience Irish culture and enjoy life in the traditional community, which he now fears will dramatically change.\n\nMany asylum seekers in Ireland are not from worn torn nations, he claimed, but many will stay in the country indefinitely, even if they are not in danger where they are from.\n\n“Ireland is under the impression that these people will all become Irish, pretty much overnight, and everything will just continue on to be terrific. But, in fact, as history is showing us – in Sweden, France, and Germany – this is not necessarily the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Very many people are concerned, but they’re also concerned about being called racist, and the town is in a real pickle right now,” he said.\n\n\nIrish Govt ‘Paid Press’ to Promote Plan to Grow Population by One Million With Mass Migration https://t.co/yKf7eUZIz1\n\n— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2018\n\nBlasting the lack of consultation on the new asylum seeker home, he said: “It was all done in complete secrecy. No one knew about this until two weeks ago!”\n\nIreland has taken in relatively few asylum seekers compared to other EU nations in recent years, due in part to the nation being physically removed from its European neighbours. However, with the EU’s new forced relocation scheme, numbers are set to increase.\n\nThe forced migration programme comes among revelations that the Irish government paid journalists to give positive coverage of their Ireland 2040 policy to dramatically grow the nation’s population through mass migration.\n\n“Apparently there’s no way to stop [the migrants coming to Lisdoonvarna]. The local [politicians] are all wringing their hands about it,” Mr. Walsh added, arguing that the pro-EU mainstream parties have a stranglehold on Irish politics, allowing for little dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s a good example of how Ireland was a colony of England… and now it’s a slave state again, of Brussels. It’s a very sad commentary on what’s happening in Europe.”",

    "body": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), fell for a spoof by Russian pranksters who promised in a call with the top House Democrat to furnish him with“kompromat”–compromising dirt–on President Donald Trump.\nSchiff found the early 2017 call with the Russian pranksters, who posed as Ukrainian leaders, “productive,” one of his staffers wrote in an email to the Russians-posing-as-Ukrainians with whom he was communicating. Now, after getting caught in the media by reports in the Atlantic magazine and the U.K. Daily Mail newspaper—as well as audio of the call appearing on YouTube—a Schiff spokesperson claims the powerful Democrat congressman thought the call was “bogus” from the beginning. But that’s not what the record shows.\nLISTEN TO THE AUDIO OF ADAM SCHIFF WITH RUSSIAN PRANKSTERS:\nVIDEO\nThe notorious Russian pranksters, who the Daily Mail’s Alana Goodman notes are “comedians nicknamed ‘Vovan’ and ‘Lexus’” who have become famous for “their phony calls to high-ranking American officials and celebrities, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Elton John,” posed as leading Ukrainian officials in their call to Schiff in early 2017.\n“On an audio recording of the prank call posted online, Adam Schiff can be heard discussing the committee’s Russia investigation and increasingly bizarre allegations about Trump with a man who claimed to be Andriy Parubiy, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament,” Goodman wrote in the Daily Mail.\n\n\n\n\nAs Goodman noted, the call’s existence was first reported by the Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe—who noted that the call took place in early April 2017. Ioffe wrote:\nOn April 10, 2017, an assistant to Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Donald Trump’s campaign for possible collusion with the Kremlin, patched in a long-planned call from Andriy Parubiy, the speaker of the Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Parubiy said he had some potentially explosive information about Trump’s visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013.\nThe call, per the audio available on YouTube, begins with platitudes and introductions and Schiff thanks the man he thinks is Parubiy for his time addressing him as “Mr. Chairman.”\nThe man then pitches that he wants to provide materials to Schiff for his committee’s investigation on “Trump” and the “Russian government,” to which Schiff cautions him that the Russians were likely listening to the call.\n“I would just caution that our Russian friends may be listening to the conversation, so I wouldn’t share anything over the phone that you don’t want them to hear,” Schiff said.\nAfter the Russian prankster posing as the Ukrainian official said he had no concerns with what the Russians may or may not hear, he proceeded to tell Schiff about what would have been explosive allegations against the now-sitting president of the United States if they were true.\n\n\n\n\n“In November 2013, Mr. Trump visited Moscow, he visited competition Miss Universe, and there he met with Russian journalist and celebrity Ksenia Sobchak,” the prankster said.\nSobchak has extensive ties to Putin, the prankster told Schiff, adding that she is “also known as a person who provides girls for escort for oligarchs. And she met with Trump and she brought him one Russian girl, celebrity Olga Buzova.” The prankster even told Schiff that Sobchak is a “special agent of Russian secret service.”\nIn reality, Sobchak is actually anti-Putin—an ex-Playboy model running against the Russian president on an anti-corruption platform after her time as a television anchor. But no matter to Schiff; he was entranced by the possibility of “kompromat” on Trump.\nAfter, per the Russian pranksters posing as Ukrainian officials in their conversation with Schiff, Sobchak introduced Trump to Buzova, Buzova “got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations.”\n“There were pictures of naked Trump,” the prankster said.\n\n\n\n\nSchiff, per the Atlantic report, “betrayed no emotion.”\n“And so Putin was made aware of the availability of the compromising material?” Schiff asked the man he thought was a Ukrainian leader.\n“Yes, of course,” the prankster replied, adding that Putin told Trump “all those compromising materials will never be released if Trump will cancel all Russian sanctions.”\nAdding insult to injury, the pranksters convinced Schiff that they had a recording of Sobchak and Buzov discussing this during a recent visit to Ukraine and that the Ukrainian officials would provide said recording to the FBI and the House Intelligence Committee’s Democratic minority staff.\nBut that’s not all. The pranksters told Schiff that Trump’s ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with Russians in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn speaking in code words. From the Atlantic piece, here is more:\n\n\n\n\nHe told Schiff about meetings that Trump’s former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had had with a Russian pop singer who served as an intermediary for the Kremlin. They’d met at a café in Brighton Beach, a Russian-immigrant enclave in Brooklyn, where, Parubiy said, “they used a special password before their meetings.” One would say, “Weather is good on Deribasovskaya.” The right response was “It rains again on Brighton Beach.”\nSchiff told the men he thought were Ukrainian officials that what they had told him was “very helpful.”\n“All righty. Good, this is very helpful. I appreciate it,” Schiff said. He also pushed for the release of the evidence that the pranksters invented for their stunt to the FBI and the House committee for which Schiff is ranking member.\n“We will try to work with the FBI to figure out, along with your staff, how we can obtain copies,” Schiff said.\nWhat’s more, after the call, Schiff told his staff that it was “productive” and told them to follow up with the pranksters-they-thought-were Ukrainians.\n“I understand Mr. Schiff had a productive call with Mr. Parubiy, and that Mr. Parubiy would like to make some materials available to Mr. Schiff through your Embassy,” Rheanne Wirkkala of the House Intelligence Committee minority staff—Schiff’s team—wrote to the pranksters that Schiff’s team still thought were Ukrainian officials. That email was sent in the early days of April 2017.\nWirkkala is no low-level staffer. She is, per her LinkedIn page, the policy director for the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.\nWirkkala sent a second email during the Democrats’ correspondence with these Russian pranksters that Schiff and the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee originally thought were Ukrainian officials that further illustrates that for several days Schiff and his team thought this was real.\nIn the April 5, 2017, email, Wirkalla asked the men she and Schiff thought were Ukrainian officials: “do you know when we might be able to meet your colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy here in Washington, DC to pick up materials?”\nNow, upon the release of this call in the Atlantic and Daily Mail, and the recording of it on YouTube, Schiff’s team is claiming he always knew it was “bogus.”\n“Before agreeing to take the call, and immediately following it, the committee informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus,” a Schiff spokesperson told the Atlantic.\nIn a statement to the Daily Mail, the Schiff spokesperson added more: “Obviously, it was bogus – which became even more evident during the call – but as with any investigation that is global in scale, we have to chase any number of leads, many of which turn out to be duds.”\nBut as the Daily Mail’s Goodman noted, Schiff’s team has “declined” to respond to the fact that Schiff’s policy director called the call “productive” and moved forward with seeking the production of the fake evidence in emails post-call with the pranksters.\n“The spokesperson declined to address on the record why a staff member pursued the ‘politician’ after the call if the congressman thought it was fake,” Goodman wrote.\nIt remains to be seen what the fallout here is, but Schiff’s office has yet to provide any explanation for the emails and how he handled the actual call. But top Republicans are already pouncing on this demanding that he be sidelined from his role on the committee after this embarrassing development.\n\n.@RepAdamSchiff needs to step down as ranking member of @HouseIntelComm. He’s embarrassing the Committee. https://t.co/rXJLIiSCmG\n— Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) February 6, 2018\nSchiff getting removed from his committee role would have drastically negative consequences on the Democrats’ efforts to stick Trump with the Russia scandal anymore. He has been the public face of the investigation, appearing relentlessly on television and in the media to push it forward—and even fundraising off of Breitbart News articles about his actions.",

Paul Gosar, DDS (@RepGosar) January 30, 2018\nThere are nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\nIn September 2017, Sessions announced that DACA would officially end in March 2018. Since then, the open borders lobby, Republican establishment, corporate interests, and Democrats have worked tirelessly to push a large-scale amnesty for millions of illegal aliens through Congress.\nSince DACA’s inception, more than 2,100 illegal aliens have been kicked off the program for being criminals or gang members.\nAs Breitbart News reported, DACA illegal aliens have protested members of Congress and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outside his New York City apartment this month, saying they and the entire illegal alien population are entitled to an amnesty and pathway to U.S. citizenship.\n\nIf Chuck won’t let us Dream, we won’t let him sleep!

This population could boom already high legal immigration levels to an unprecedented high. An amnesty for illegal aliens would also likely triple the number of border-crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Pollak18 Mar 20180\n\t\t\t\t18 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\t18 Mar, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFormer CIA Director John Brennan reacted to the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — and President Donald Trump’s celebration of it — by tweeting a strident attack against Trump:\n\nWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America…America will triumph over you. https://t.co/uKppoDbduj\n\n— John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) March 17, 2018\n\nThe president’s critics seems to like Brennan’s tweet. In fact, it confirmed what Trump has been saying all along: that the senior leadership of the intelligence and federal law enforcement services had become highly politicized.\n\nThat impression was only reinforced further by a tweet from former UN Ambassador Samantha Power — whose full role in “unmasking” Americans who appeared in foreign intelligence wiretaps has yet to be exposed:\n\n\nNot a good idea to piss off John Brennan. https://t.co/VLg94OLL2R\n\n— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 17, 2018\n\nPower’s warning echoes that of Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), who warned Trump last January — in the midst of heavy leaks to the media by the FBI and intelligence services: “You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.”\n\nFor these Democrats, it seemed natural to threaten the president with retaliation by the intelligence community. They showed no concern for the abuse of power that might entail.\n\n(By contrast, when evidence emerged in 2014 that the CIA had spied on staffers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the agency’s behavior, calling it “treason.”)\n\n\n\n\n\nPower later tried to walk back her tweet:\n\n\nWhoa! Just home  see much misinterp. of earlier tweet. It’s testament to polarized times that it cd be misread as referring to something other than Brennan’s indignation. So will translate: not a good idea to upset @JohnBrennan bc/ he will raise an angry ( eloquent) voice. https://t.co/YgIjeKGAlp\n\n— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 18, 2018\n\nGiven her own role in “unmasking” American citizens. that revision may be less than convincing.\n\nIn his own statement upon being fired, McCabe blasted the president for having “politicized” law enforcement, accusing him of trying “to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.”\n\nBrennan’s public comments, McCabe’s leaks, and the whole sorry saga of Hillary Clinton’s non-investigation suggest that the politicization happened long before.\n\nJoel B.

She was on a book tour in India and continuing to explain why she lost. And here’s why she said she didn’t do well with white married women.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Part of that is a — an identification with the Republican Party and a — a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\nWALLACE: Marie, is it just me or is that kind of a curious analysis from a feminist that women — white, married women were browbeaten by the men around them?\n\nHARF: Yes, you’re right. And she should go away. I hate to say that. I really do. The first female nominee of a major party has an historical, you know, role certainly and the right to speak up. She is not helping the Democratic Party. And I think she should take a very long vacation and leave the future of the party to other people.\n\nI think the future of the party is not with her. And the clearest indication of that is the fact that in the 20 special elections that have taken place so far in 2018, Democrats on averaged have gotten 24 more points than she did. The party of the future is not Hillary Clinton’s party. And I get why she wants to keep explaining it, but it is not —\n\nWALLACE: You say you get why she’s explaining — what’s going on here? Do you think it’s just bitterness? Do you think she’s just a sore loser?\n\nHARF: You know, I wouldn’t use that term. But I think this was a hard-fought competition.\n\nROVE: I would.\n\nHARF: And I think most people, including most Republicans, didn’t think she was going to lose. So I’m not going to psychoanalyze why she keeps giving excuses for it. And there’s probably a time and place for that.\n\nBut it’s not what Mitt Romney did. It’s not what John Kerry did. It’s not what Al Gore did. And if your goal is to help the party and help us understand how to get white working class men and women back in the Midwest, this is not helpful to that cause.\n\n(h/t RCP Video)\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

    "body": "“Watch closely for Barack Obama’s fingerprints,” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA) on Saturday, suggesting the recent alleged partisan weaponization of state surveillance powers could be connected to the 44th president. “[Democrats and their allies] will defend Barack Obama at all costs, and they’ll defend Hillary Clinton almost at all costs unless they have to sacrifice her to protect Barack Obama,” he added.\nKing offered his remarks during an interview with Breitbart News’s Deputy Political Editor Amanda House on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Saturday.\nAgainst the backdrop of Friday’s released memo from the House Intelligence Committee (HIC), King called for further investigation into what role, if any, Obama and his cabinet officials played in procuring state surveillance of Carter Page and George Papadopoulos (two peripheral operatives of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign) via Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications submitted before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).\nThe HIC memo alleges the commission of abuses of power by the FBI and Justice Department (DOJ) under the Obama administration in surveilling Page and Papadopoulos.\n“Look at all of these investigations now,” said King. “Look closely for Barack Obama’s fingerprints. I’ve just identified some that I think are fingerprints, and I think this trail leads to the Obama presidency, to Barack Obama himself, but it’s going to take some time if we get there, and I’m not certain that the evidence trail necessarily leads there. There’s an indication trail that says we need to take a look and find out. But if it’s not Barack Obama, then who is it? Well, it’s Loretta Lynch, for example, and James Comey, and McCabe, and that cast of characters from Sally Yates on down. I don’t think we’ve ever seen such a long row of very high-level executive branch officials wrapped up in something here that is political partisanship, weaponizing the FBI and DOJ to do opposition research that was stimulated by the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and [paid for with her] and the DNC’s  recalled Obama’s denial — made during an interview with Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace on April 10, 2016 — that partisan and political considerations would afford Hillary Clinton favorable treatment by the FBI and DOJ during ostensible federal investigations into her negligent handling of classified information via email and other telecommunications during her tenure as secretary of state.\nPartial transcript below:\nWALLACE:  Mr. President … some people I think are worried whether or not — the decision whether or not, how to handle the [Hillary email] case, will be made on political grounds, not legal grounds. Can you guarantee to the American people, can you direct the Justice Department to say, “Hillary Clinton will be treated as the evidence goes — she will not be, in any way, protected”?\nOBAMA:  I can guarantee that. And I can guarantee that not because I give Attorney General Lynch a directive, [but because] that is institutionally how we have always operated. I do not talk to the attorney general about pending investigations. I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. We have a strict line and always have maintained it.\nWALLACE:  So, just to button this up —\nOBAMA:  I guarantee it.\nWALLACE:  You —\nOBAMA:  I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, or the FBI, not just in this case, but in any case.\nWALLACE:  And she will be —\nOBAMA:  Full stop. Period.\nWALLACE:  And she will be treated no different —\nOBAMA:  Guaranteed. Full stop. Nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department, because nobody is above the law.\nWALLACE:  Even if she ends up as the Democratic nominee?\nOBAMA:  How many times do I have to say it, Chris? Guaranteed.\nDuring his interview with Wallace, Obama further claimed that Hillary Clinton “would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.” King linked Obama’s description of Clinton’s supposedly good intentions to the Obama administration’s ultimate exoneration — via James Comey’s statement on July 5, 2016 — of the former first lady on the grounds of an alleged lack of intent to feloniously mishandle classified information.\nThe Obama administration sought to use state surveillance powers to collect intelligence on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his associates to afford Hillary Clinton’s political campaign advantages, speculated King.\n“[The FBI was doing] opposition research [into the] Trump campaign,” said King. “To think what that means, it looked to me like it was a fishing expedition. They had targeted Carter Page because they saw that he had direct communications with Trump, and they wanted to pick up anything they could pick up on him that could be leaked to the press.”\n\n\n\n\n“This is an arrogance of being high-level operatives in the FBI and DOJ,” said King. “To take your profession that you’re paid to do and decide that you know best who should be president of the United States, and that should be Hillary Clinton.”\nDemocrats, their consultants, and their news media allies will “manufacture arguments… without regard to truth [and] without regard to being objective” on the issue of political and partisan weaponization of the FBI and DOJ in order to “move public opinion,” said King. \n\n“[Democrats want] to destroy the credibility of the objective truth,” added King. “They will defend Barack Obama at all costs, and they’ll defend Hillary Clinton almost at all costs unless they have to sacrifice her to protect Barack Obama.”\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Pacific).\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

He called on Congress to end funding for sanctuary cities.\n\n“If we are not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kill thousands of people and destroy so many people’s lives, we are just doing the wrong thing,” he said. “We have got to get tough.”\n\nTrump specifically vowed to empower law enforcement to crack down on the supply of drugs, including prescription drug reforms targeting doctors and drug companies.\n\n“I love tough guys, we need tough guys,” Trump said, pointing out an ICE agent in the audience.\n\nThe audience in New Hampshire cheered Trump’s proposed solutions, many of them wearing red Make America Great Again campaign hats in support of the president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president also announced a plan to create more advertisements to “scare” young people away from opioid addiction, much like cigarette advertisements.\n\n“The best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with,” he said.\n\nHe promised that the Department of Justice was considering a federal lawsuit against some of the drug companies who manufacture opioids. Trump also announced plans to provide narcan to first responders in areas devastated by opioid addiction. Narcan helps block the effects of opioids, especially in overdose situations.\n\n“I want to win this battle, I don’t want to leave at the end of seven years and have this problem,” Trump said.",

Pollak7 Feb 20180\t\t\t\t7 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\t7 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) launched into an extended monologue on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, using her prerogative as a party leader to mount a filibuster to draw attention to the cause of illegal aliens.\nThe House, unlike the Senate, does not actually have a filibuster rule that allows members to speak as long as they want. Only the Speaker of the House and the party leaders can hold the floor indefinitely.\nPelosi said she was taking a stand to draw attention to the plight of the so-called “Dreamers,” who are illegal aliens brought into the country as minors.\nDuring her remarks, she hailed the “Dreamers,” whom she said had arrived in the country illegally through no fault of their own.\nShe then went on to thank the parents of the “Dreamers” — i.e. those who deliberately broke the law.\n“I say to their parents: Thank you for bringing these Dreamers to America. We’re in your debt for the courage it took, for you to take the risk, physically, politically, in every way, to do so,” she said.\n\n\n\n\n(Click video link in tweet below to watch.)\n\n\n“I say to their parents: Thank you for bringing these Dreamers to America. We’re in your debt for the courage it took, for you to take the risk, physically, politically, in every way, to do so.” – @NancyPelosi https://t.co/NdBs0rlQVo\n— Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) February 7, 2018\nDemocrats actually failed to pass any legislation on immigration when Pelosi was Speaker, and her party controlled both Capitol Hill and the White House from 2009 to 2011. President Barack Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, using — or abusing — his executive powers of prosecutorial discretion on a massive scale to shield some 700,000 applicants from deportation.\nPelosi declared that she would speak until Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) promised a vote on legislation to protect the “Dreamers” — something he has already promised to do, at least with regard to Republican legislation on the issue.\nJust last month, President Donald Trump offered a deal that included a “path to citizenship” for all of the estimated 1.8 million “Dreamers,” including those who did not register for DACA. But Democrats rejected that deal over Trump’s demand for a border wall, plus an end to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi began speaking 7 hours ago. \nThe House Historian's office confirms that Pelosi today set the record for the longest-continuous speech in the House, going back at least to 1909\nContinue watching LIVE on C-SPAN https://t.co/uNLfEP8AKE pic.twitter.com/Irzw1FoSUo\n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 7, 2018\nPelosi’s stand was coordinated with protests by pro-amnesty groups against Trump’s alleged “white supremacy.” Her speech may also have been aimed at impressing Democrats with her strength and stamina, in the midst of speculation that she could be forced to step down, either before or after the November midterm elections.\nRepublicans have made Pelosi a prime target in congressional races, and will privately welcome her extended tenure in leadership.\nJoel B.

    "body": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” syndicated radio talker and CRTV host Mark Levin slammed ranking House Intelligence Committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for the criticism he leveled against his Republican-controlled committee’s handling of an investigation into alleged collusion in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAccording to Levin, given Schiff’s focus on President Donald Trump and his associates and not those of Hillary Clinton that had reported dealings with Russia showed he was the “shill for Russia.”\n\n“Mr. Schiff is a shill for the Russian government,” he said. “And I’m going to tell you why it is Schiff who is a propagandist for the Russian government despite his spending unreleased left-wing TV shows. He put out a list of 30 more interviews he wants to do, even though the Republicans on the committee so there’s no collusion. And he mentions Reince Priebus, Stephen Miller, K. T. McFarland, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, a bunch of consultants, people with the Trump organization. Some of Trump’s lawyers, somebody that runs a group, Christian right activists. Of course, he wants Donald Trump, Jr. to kick around. He wants Jared Kushner to kick around, family members — on and on and on.”\n\nLevin went on to note Schiff wasn’t looking to subpoena Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Susan Rice, the FISA Court judges and others, which made Schiff’s motives questionable and therefore made him to be the one schilling for Russia.\n\nLevin also called on Schiff to take a lie detector test over leaks to the media coming from the House Intelligence Committee to determine if Schiff is responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I have a challenge for you, Mr. Schiff — why don’t you take a lie detector test?” Levin said. “Why don’t you take a lie detector test so the American people can be sure that you, all over TV, ubiquitous, you might as well be on airport radar and sonograms. You’re everywhere, sir. You tell us you don’t leak, okay. Take a lie detector test because I believe you do. Comey leaked. Deputy FBI director McCabe — leaker. James Clapper, according to a new book, national intelligence director, leaker.”\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

    "body": "Holistic analysis of the Justice Department (DOJ) and FBI’s interconnected and ostensible investigations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump amount to “the worst abuse of political power in American history related to elections,” according to Tom Del Beccaro.\nDel Beccaro, an attorney and contributor to Forbes, joined Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak to discuss his recently published – and continually updated – timeline of events, entitled “Biased FBI and DOJ Officials Broke the Law and Tried to Decide the Election.”\n“The DOJ [and] the entire Obama administration wound down the Hillary email crisis in time for her to really run for office and then ramped up the attacks on candidate Trump to stop him from being president,” said Del Beccaro.\nAs president, Barack Obama signaled to his administration officials that Hillary Clinton was not to be meaningfully investigated for her felonious use of a private email system during her tenure as secretary of state, said Del Beccaro.\n“The FBI was sort of just going through the motions with Hillary, and it’s about March or April, and suddenly the election heats up, and Obama goes on TV, and he says, with Chris Wallace, basically, that she didn’t intend to do anything [wrong]; she didn’t want to harm us,” said Del Beccaro. “That’s  irrelevant to the crime she committed of possessing classified information in an insecure environment. So he announces this, and once he does, the DOJ and the FBI then change their speed [of] work and the manner in which they’re working, the things that they’re doing, and between April and June, they exonerate her, and what I mean by that is they change the language in the memo as to whether she was doing something wrong from ‘gross negligence’ of a crime to … ‘extreme carelessness.’ That’s irrelevant. That’s not legal language: ‘extreme carelessness.’”\nObama’s endorsement of Clinton in May 2016 – while the FBI was ostensibly investigating the former first lady for her handling of classified information and evasion of federal record-keeping laws – suggests the FBI’s running of a “sham investigation” of Clinton’s email conduct, said Del Beccaro.\n\n\n\n\nObama’s first campaign appearance with Clinton was July 5, 2016, the same day former FBI Director James Comey publicly advised against an indictment of Clinton for criminal handling of classified information.\n“Early May, [Obama] endorses her, [and] it’s very rare in our history for a president to endorse in a divided primary within his own party,” said Del Beccaro. “If there wasn’t a sham investigation going on, why would he take a risk endorsing a candidate under investigation by the FBI when on its face she broke the law? His first appearance with her [was] on the afternoon of July 5. You know what happened on the morning of July 5? James Comey goes on TV to exonerate her. This cannot be coincidental.”\n“Seems pretty much like they knew what they were doing to me, don’t you think?” asked Del Beccaro, rhetorically.\nObama kept tabs on the surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign and associates via intelligence briefings, said Del Beccaro. The FBI’s surveillance of Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were considered a counterintelligence operation, not a criminal investigation. \n“What happens every morning for a president, the first thing that he gets?” asked Del Beccaro. “His intelligence briefing is put together by the FBI, the NSA, [and other intelligence agencies]. So Obama was able to keep track of everything.”\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance of Carter Page, said Del Beccaro, was done for the purpose of monitoring Trump and his presidential campaign. Carter Page was no longer a campaign operative for Trump when the FBI resumed its surveillance of him in 2016.\n“[Carter Page] is a Russophile; he wants to do business there,” said Del Beccaro. “He’s a promoter of himself and those kinda things. What’s really important here [is that] he had been working with the FBI in 2015 on investigations of other people, so our government knew exactly who this guy was all along. The fact that he went to Russia again in the summer of 2016 while he is an adviser to the Trump campaign, to me, is just a ruse. They needed someone to do something so that they could start the spying, and once you start spying on one, you can spread it just a bit. So I think he’s just a straw horse for them to do a wider spying operation.”\nComey lied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) when presenting fraudulent information composed by Christopher Steele (the “Steele dossier”) as evidence in pursuit of a surveillance warrant, said Del Beccaro.\n“When James Comey is doing this application and he puts this dossier in, he has to say to the court, ‘This is valid evidence. This is good evidence for you to use,'” said Del Beccaro. “Of course, we now know that at two different times in 2017, he said it was never validated. You cannot have both of those positions at the same time. He clearly lied to the FISA court by trumping up this evidence. That’s how they started this spying operation.”\nClinton violated campaign finance laws by using a law firm as an intermediary through which to pay Fusion GPS for opposition research on Trump, said Del Beccaro. \n\n\n\n\n“Hillary lied on her campaign finance disclosure by paying the law firm in May to start the dossier,” said Del Beccaro. “If she hadn’t had done that lie, it would have come out that she was paying Fusion GPS in May, and then reporters could have challenged her and asked, ‘What is this for?’ It’s a clear campaign violation.”\nOriginally published at Forbes, Del Beccaro’s timeline has moved to Political Vanguard as an ongoing project with regular updates.\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.",

Such orders allow firearms to be confiscated with a judge’s approval.\n\nThe White House suggests that ERPOs “allow law enforcement, with approval from a court, to remove firearms from individuals who are a demonstrated threat to themselves or others and temporarily to prevent individuals from purchasing new firearms.” They stressed that the orders “should be carefully tailored to ensure the due process rights of law-abiding citizens are protected.”\n\nCalifornia adopted similar gun confiscation laws in 2015 and Southern California Public Radio reports that 190 orders requiring confiscation were issued 2016-2017 alone.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed California-style confiscation orders into law on Friday and the White House is urging other states to follow suit.\n\nOn March 1, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence took pains to focus on the need to guard “due process” in issuing ERPOs.

I’ll stand with the taxpayers and those who honor our laws.

I believe in an America that values lawful behavior and welcomes immigrants with talent and a burning desire to make our country great.\nIf your first act in our country is to violate our laws, I say you have no respect for our nation and don’t belong here.

    "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions will speak Wednesday about his Department of Justice’s (DOJ) first-of-its-kind lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of three of California’s “sanctuary” laws, Breitbart News has learned.\nRelying on both federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, DOJ will ask the U.S. District Court for the District of Eastern California to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of these laws intended to protect illegal aliens by preventing cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. DOJ will also seek declaratory judgement that these laws are unconstitutional – “preempted” by federal immigration law – when it files late Tuesday night.\n\n“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,” Attorney General Sessions is expected to tell a gathering of California police officers Wednesday in Sacramento. “We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America. And I believe that we are going to win.”\n\nThe defendants are the State of California, Gov. Jerry Brown, and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra – the elected official who, perhaps more than any other, has made protection of criminal illegal aliens and “resistance” to President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda his signature policy.\n\nThe doctrine of “preemption” dictates that, as federal law reigns supreme over state law, states may not enforce laws that frustrate federal policies. It has a long history, dating back nearly to the dawn of the Republic with 1819’s McCulloch v. Maryland. In the immigration context, the doctrine was widely heralded by open borders advocates in 2012, when the Supreme Court relied on it to strike down sections of Arizona’s tough SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration bill in Arizona v. U.S.\n\nThe legal shoe is on the other foot now, as the Trump administration seeks to have California’s leading-edge sanctuary laws overturned on a similar theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three laws, passed in response to Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election, added new dimensions to California’s role as the nation’s leading “sanctuary” for illegal aliens. Not content with being merely a typical sanctuary jurisdiction, where, as a matter of policy, police do not contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents about suspected illegal aliens, collect information on an arrestee’s immigration status, or comply with requests to hold suspected illegal aliens for ICE pickup, California enacted HB 450, SB 54, and HB 103.\n\nHB 450 came into effect at the beginning of the year. It prohibits private employers from cooperating with ICE. Under the law, if employers do not refuse to allow ICE officials onto their property without a warrant, they face stiff fines. If they try to check an employee’s immigration status a second time, they face fines. If they do not inform employees of ICE enforcement efforts about which they know, they face fines.\n\nDuring the first round of ICE raids after HB 450 went into effect, Becerra was very clear that his office “will prosecute” employers who cooperate.\n\nIn the case of HB 450, the California State Assembly’s Judiciary Committee made clear they were passing this law specifically because of “an expected increase in federal immigration enforcement.”\n\nSB 54, also coming into effect January 1, affects law enforcement officials, holding them statewide to the “sanctuary” standard previously in place in cities like San Francisco under penalty of state law. Under HB 54, California’s police officers and sheriffs cannot provide ICE with the release dates of the criminal illegal aliens whom they are holdings. Except for those held for a narrow set of serious crimes, these law enforcement officers cannot transfer detainees to federal custody voluntarily.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, AB 103 is a 2017 law Becerra has used to “inspect” facilities the Department of Homeland Security uses to house suspected illegal aliens who are awaiting removal proceedings. DOJ believes these inspections have demanded access to proprietary DHS documents and information.\n\nThe government will first seek to have a preliminary injunction put in place to block enforcement of all three laws while their constitutionality is considered. DOJ will therefore have to show some irreparable harm that will come from allowing California to use these laws in the meantime. Senior DOJ officials were confident that, with a typical briefing schedule, they expect a ruling on their preliminary injunction within weeks.",

    "body": "The “Russiagate” collusion theory took a huge blow this week, as the House Intelligence Committee’s probe into Russia meddling came to an end.\nWhile the special counsel probe continues, the House Intelligence Committee’s conclusion of “no collusion” underscored the lack of any evidence to date of any such activities.\n\n“The collusion conspiracy theory is breaking down. There is no evidence of collusion at this point after year-plus investigations in the House and Senate. [Rep. Adam Schiff] claimed a year ago he had more than circumstantial evidence of collusion, but he still can’t produce it,” said a source involved in Congress’s Russia investigations.\n\n“And we’ve seen nothing on collusion from [special counsel Robert] Mueller. In addition, everyone now knows the Steele dossier is a fraud, and that the FBI was using it anyway. So the only thing sustaining the collusion narrative now is the media’s complicity in it.”\n\nDemocrats on the committee complained they just were not allowed to dig deep enough — after more than a year of investigating and 73 witness interviews. They have vowed to keep investigating, although without the power to compel witnesses or documents, it is hard to imagine they will make much progress.\n\nAnd they continue to argue that disparate incidents amounted to collusion — a London professor telling Trump volunteer campaign aide George Papadopoulos that the Russians had thousands of emails that were embarrassing to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Jr. showing receptivity by accepting a meeting with a Russian lawyer who purportedly had dirt on Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the lead Republican on the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), dismissed that idea, telling reporters after the committee’s conclusion was announced:\n\nOnly Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn or someone else like that could take this series of inadvertent contacts with each other, or meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a fictional page-turner spy thriller. But we’re not dealing with fiction, we’re dealing with facts. And we found no evidence of any collusion, of anything that people were actually doing, other than taking a meeting they shouldn’t have taken or inadvertently being in the same building.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blow to Democrats is the loss of the probe as a political vehicle ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), had become a cable news fixture talking about Russia collusion and suspected leaker to CNN about the probe. The RNC tracked Schiff’s TV interviews in the last 13 months about the probe at 227.\n\n“It’s not shocking that the person most upset by the outcome had used the investigation to launch his TV career,” Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told the Washington Examiner.\n\nSchiff also tried to fundraise off of the Russia probe, claiming in one campaign ad that Trump and his “friends at Breitbart” were going after him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees continue their investigations, the top Democrats on those committees have been nowhere near as vocal or partisan. And there are no signs that either committee has found any collusion yet. In October, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) told reporters that he had no “initial findings” on collusion, ten months after the investigation began.\n\nContrary to Trump critics’ fears and accusations, the end of the House probe does not appear to affect the special counsel’s investigation. According to the New York Times, Mueller opened a new avenue of inquiry in recent weeks, requesting all documents related to Russia from the Trump Organization, despite the president’s warning Mueller to stay out of his finances.\n\nBut Andrew McCarthy, senior fellow at the National Review and a former prosecutor, said any evidence of collusion found by the special counsel would have likely leaked by now. He also noted that indictments against former National Security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, his business associate Rick Gates, and former volunteer campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have not been related to collusion.\n\n“If you look at the charging instruments that Mueller has filed, the indictments and information that’s come out, the guilty pleas that have come out,” he said, “he’s even got guys who clearly have connections with Russia, like Papadopoulos and Flynn and Manafort and Gates, and there’s not a whisper in any of these charges that there was a conspiracy between Trump and Russia.”\n\nThe ending of the House Intelligence Committee probe could mean a second special counsel, however, now that House Republican lawmakers have more time to investigate potential misbehavior at the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has said the committee will continue to investigate FISA abuse, the unmasking of Americans’ names in intelligence reports, the origins and use of the Trump dossier, and intelligence community leaks.\n\nAdditionally, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), House Intelligence Committee member and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, recently requested — along with House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) — that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint a second special counsel.\n\nThat request has now been echoed by four senators, including the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, increasing the chances that it will happen, or that a DOJ prosecutor will be assigned to investigate the matter.\n\nA second special counsel could ensure that any investigation into the DOJ and FBI continues, even if Democrats take the House in the 2018 midterm elections, which, historically, they are favored to do, as the opposing party of an incumbent president.\n\nHowever, the pressure is on House Republicans to do as much as they can before that might happen, McCarthy noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s a limited number of legislative days that they have left in an election year,” he said. “If they lose control of the House, the investigation’s over because the Democrats will kill the investigation.”",

    "body": "Two leading Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a redacted top secret email Monday that Obama administration National Security Advisor Susan Rice appears to have sent herself just minutes after President Donald Trump took office.\nThe email contains Rice’s impressions from a January 5, 2017 meeting on “Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential election” between then-President Barack Obama, then-FBI Director James Comey, and “intelligence community leadership.”\nAccording to Rice, President Obama and Comey had a “follow-on conversation” after the formal meeting during which Obama told Comey that “from a national security perspective” he wanted “to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.” President Obama then asked Comey to inform him of any changes that would affect how his White House should share classified information with the incoming Trump administration.\nSeperately, Rice claims Obama told Comey that  he wanted the Russia investigation handled “by the book” and that “from a law enforcement perspective” he was not “asking about, initiating or instructing anything.”\nRice herself claims to have been present at the meeting and to have stayed for this “follow-on conversation,” along with then-Vice President Joe Biden, and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who weeks later would become a darling of the left-leaning press after she was fired over her refusal to enforce President Trump’s first travel ban on certain terror-prone Muslim majority countries.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee obtained the email from the National Archives as part of its investigation into potential political bias and influence in the FBI’s handling of the “Russia investigation” and the infamous Fusion GPS “dossier” that was used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant on one-time Trump associate Carter Page.\n\n\n\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee chairman, announced their discovery of the email Monday when they released a letter they addressed to Rice on February 8. The two senators tell Rice:\nIt strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation.  In addition, despite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed “by the book,” substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed “by the book.” \nThe public version of the letter includes a redacted version of Rice’s email indicating it once held a “top secret” classification. The letter makes reference to an unredacted still-classified version of the email.\n2018-02-08 CEG LG to Rice (Russia Investigation Email) by Breitbart News on Scribd\n\nGrassley and Graham are demanding Rice provide their Committee answers about her email by a February 22 deadline. The questions included are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1. Did you send the email attached to this letter to yourself? Do you have any reason to dispute the timestamp of the email?\n2. When did you first become aware of the FBI’s investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia?\n3. When did you become aware of any surveillance activities, including FISA applications, undertaken by the FBI in conducting that investigation? At the time you wrote this email to yourself, were you aware of either the October 2016 FISA application for surveillance of Carter Page or the January 2017 renewal?\n4. Did anyone instruct, request, suggest, or imply that you should send yourself the aforementioned Inauguration Day email memorializing President Obama’s meeting with Mr. Comey about the Trump/Russia investigation? If so, who and why?\n5. Is the account of the January 5, 2017 meeting presented in your email accurate? Did you omit any other portions of the conversation?\n6. Other than that email, did you document the January 5, 2017 meeting in any way, such as contemporaneous notes or a formal memo? To the best of your knowledge, did anyone else at that meeting take notes or otherwise memorialize the meeting?\n7. During the meeting, did Mr. Comey or Ms. Yates mention potential press coverage of the Steele dossier? If so, what did they say?\n8. During the meeting, did Mr. Comey describe the status of the FBI’s relationship with Mr. Steele, or the basis for that status?\n9. When and how did you first become aware of the allegations made by Christopher Steele?\n10. When and how did you first become aware that the Clinton Campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded Mr. Steele’s efforts?\n11. You wrote that President Obama stressed that he was “not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective.” Did President Obama ask about, initiate, or instruct anything from any other perspective relating to the FBI’s investigation?\n12. Did President Obama have any other meetings with Mr. Comey, Ms. Yates, or other government officials about the FBI’s investigation of allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russia? If so, when did these occur, who participated, and what was discussed?\nThe January 5, 2017 meeting Rice references in her email would have occurred just months after, as Rice herself has admitted, she “unmasked” certain Trump campaign members’ communications during the transition.\nRice, who in her retirement from public service has taken up a research post at American University, has remained critical of the Trump administration’s foreign policy, but has largely refrained from weighing in on the Russia investigation.",

Kerry reportedly added that Abbas should “stay strong in his spirit and play for time, that he will not break and will not yield to President Trump’s demands.”\nEver imagining that he is the one man who can broker a long-dreamed-of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Kerry added that it was time for Abbas to present his own peace plan. “Maybe it is time for the Palestinians to define their peace principles and present a positive plan,” Kerry purportedly said.\nKerry, who took over as Obama’s secretary of state when Hillary Clinton vacated the position, confided that deep state insiders in the Department of State and the U.S. intelligence community do not like President Trump. He also allegedly urged Abbas to launch personal attacks on Trump meant to enrage the president and force him to make errors.\nThe failed 2004 Democratic candidate for president also said he does not feel his advanced age is a problem for another bid for the White House. Were he to actually win the presidency in 2020, Kerry would be 77 years old on inauguration day, and that would make him the oldest president in U.S. history.\n\n\n\n\nKerry’s alleged assurances to the Palestinian strongman that the U.S. would soon be able to acquiesce to Palestinian Authority demands are reminiscent of the time then-President Barack Obama was heard on an open mic assuring Russian President Dmitri Medvedev that after he was safely re-elected, he would be better able to bow to Vladimir Putin’s demands.\nThe former Massachusetts senator’s secret visit aimed at undermining U.S. foreign policy in favor of an enemy is also reminiscent of another Massachusetts senator’s secret efforts to aid an enemy. In 1983, Sen. Ted Kennedy sent overtures to the Soviet Union promising his help in undermining the policies of President Ronald Reagan if only the USSR would, in return, help him launch a successful bid to beat back Reagan’s re-election and place Kennedy in the White House.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.",

We will not be bargaining chips for the criminalization and deportation of other immigrants.

Kasich responded:\nI don’t think they should be citizens, but I think they should be able to be here, yes, and live in our country. But the idea that we would try to just go round them up… and look, these stories where these ICE agents are going into people’s homes, to me, that’s not my country. That’s not the way that I think we should handle these things. I think it’s dead wrong. [Emphasis added]\n\nMy podcast: John Kasich speaks to a different side of the Republican Party https://t.co/RxeRDwMvoQ via @Audioboom\n— JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) February 2, 2018\nEarlier in the interview, Kasich said he opposed President Trump’s popular, pro-American views on immigration, favoring a multicultural society.\n“I happen to believe that a society that allows people to come in with kind of different views, different attitudes, different beliefs, strengthens your country, it doesn’t weaken your country,” Kasich said.\nKasich’s open borders views remain out-of-tune with the majority of Americans who, when polled this week, said they want to see the construction of Trump’s planned wall for the U.S.-Mexico border, as Breitbart News reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, a plurality of Americans said they want to see legal immigration levels reduced to one to 250,000 legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. a year – a plan that would raise the wages of American workers while increasing the quality of life and decreasing the immigration burden for America’s working and middle-class communities.\nWhen asked, “In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year,” 48 percent of black Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris poll said they would like to see between one and 250,000 legal immigrants brought to the U.S. a year.\n\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.\n\n\n\n\n\nMass legal immigration to the U.S. has come at the expense of America’s working and middle class, which has suffered from poor job growth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs to offset the importation of millions of low-skilled foreign nationals.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He wouldn't come down. Here's my Facebook Live coverage: https://t.co/FzxOyljoK5 pic.twitter.com/PxjoALcyn8\n— Michael Moore (@MMFlint) November 13, 2016\n\n“I’m going to join the people who’ve formed a protest of this racist, sociopath on his way to the White House,” Moore said in a widely-viewed Facebook Live video at the time.\nThe filmmaker had attempted to gain access to Trump Tower during the protest, but was rebuffed by Secret Service agents, as Breitbart News reported.\n\n\n\n\nHe later left a note with a doorman that read: “Mr. Trump. I’m here. I want to talk with you.”\nMoore has previously accused Trump of colluding with the Russians during the 2016 campaign. In a March post to his Instagram account, the filmmaker called on Democrats to announce a “national emergency” until such time as the FBI could determine the extent of the allegations.\n“No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation,” Moore wrote. “His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI – and an independent investigative committee — discovers the truth.”\nMoore most recently appeared at the “People’s State of the Union,” a rally organized by celebrity critics of the Trump administration held the day before the president’s first State of the Union address.\n“The need to remove him — and also any Democrat who is in the way of removing him — that is, at this point, a moral imperative for each and every one of us,” he said at the event. “Removing him, and Pence, and the whole disgusting lot of them… still won’t be enough. We must remove and replace the system and the culture that gave us Trump in the first place.”\n\n\n\n\n \nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",

Pollak25 Jan 20180\t\t\t\t25 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\t25 Jan, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA photograph of then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that was taken in 2005 at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, has been released after a 13-year cover-up to protect Obama’s political career.\nJournalist Askia Muhammad told TriceEdneyWire.com that he took the photograph after Obama had engaged “in a warm conversation with constituent and fellow Chicagoan Minister Louis Farrakhan.” However, he realized that the photograph could endanger Obama’s presidential ambitions, which were already being widely discussed.\nFarrakhan is a black supremacist and antisemite who also holds anti-gay views. Rumors of an association between Obama and Farrakhan circulated during the 2008 presidential campaign in the wake of revelations about Obama’s decades-long membership in the Trinity United Church of Christ, led by the racist preacher Jeremiah Wright. Those rumors could not be substantiated, however — and the story of Muhammad’s long-hidden photograph explains why.\nAsia told TraceEdneyWire.com that he was confronted by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus about the photograph, and that he eventually surrendered it to Farrakhan’s chief of staff. He secretly kept a copy of the image for himself, but he never told anyone and never released the image, for fear of burglary or retaliation against him, he told the left-wing Talking Points Memo website.\nHe told TraceEdneyWire.com that he believed the photograph would have destroyed Obama’s electoral chances:\n“I gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy,” Muhammad said in an exclusive interview with the Trice Edney News Wire this week. “But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover.”\nAs for any debate that the photo could have made a difference in the outcome of the Obama presidential election, Muhammad is emphatic: “I insist. It absolutely would have made a difference.”\nThe photograph also includes “Minister Farrakhan’s son-in-law, Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad; His son and security chief, Mustapha Farrakhan; Minister Farrakhan’s son Joshua Farrakhan; and the Rev. Willie Wilson, executive producer of the program for Farrakhan’s Million Man March in 1995 and a chairman of the 20th anniversary,” according to  told Talking Points Memo that he felt more at ease about the photograph after Farrakhan publicly revealed in 2016 that he had met with then-Senator Obama, and he obtained Farrakhan’s permission to publish the photograph as he was preparing a memoir last year.\nThe late NBC journalist Tim Russert asked then-candidate Obama at a 2008 debate in Cleveland, Ohio whether he accepted Farrakhan’s public support. Obama responded by claiming he had denounced Farrakhan and had “consistently distanced” himself from him.\nObamas said:\nYou know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan’s antisemitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can’t censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we’re not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.\n…\nI live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I’ve been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him.\nObama did not explicitly reject Farrakhan’s support.\nThere are other, similar instances in which Obama claimed to have had no association with radicals and was later discovered to have lied. For example, Obama claimed during the 2008 campaign that he had no continuing links with former Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers, with whom Obama had served on a board in the 1990s. Breitbart News discovered that then-Sen. Obama had attended a barbecue at Ayers’s home in Chicago in July 2005.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Breitbart News launched an investigative series, “The Vetting,” devoted to uncovering those aspects of Barack Obama’s past that the media had overlooked or deliberately hidden. The Muhammad photograph proves that there was a rich mine of information that was withheld from the public to protect Obama’s career and policy goals.\nJoel B.

He talks about Africans’ weaknesses frankly.”\nIn a later tweet, Museveni reiterated his message, arguing that “Africans need to solve their problems.”\n“Donald Trump speaks to Africa frankly.

According to the Washington Post report about Trump’s “shithole countries” remarks, Trump reportedly “also suggested he would be open to more immigrants from Asian countries because he felt that they help the United States economically.”\n\n“I think two plus two is four, and that makes a racist policy,” Gutierrez insisted.\n\nGutierrez, whose over-the-top anti-Trump rhetoric has endeared him to the “Resistance Wing,” also said that the “glue” that holds the GOP House caucus together is “being anti-immigrant.”\n\n“Elections are coming up… and I intend to take the kind of actions to break up that glue,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGutierrez, who is retiring from Congress after his term ends, is touring the country to build a left-wing infrastructure to combat Trump.

Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?”\n\nWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2017\nIn the months since that tweet, everything Trump suggested has been proven correct.\nThanks to congressional investigators (and no thanks to a media that has worked overtime to stop these facts from coming out), we now know that 1) some of the most salacious and discredited details in the dossier came from Russian operatives. 2) Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign paid millions of dollars for the phony dossier. 3) the FBI also funded the dossier by hiring its author, former-British spy Christopher Steele, who was determined to see Trump defeated in the presidential election.\nMoreover, even disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey has declared the dossier “salacious and unverified.” Unless you want to count mundane details that do not matter, in the months since October, despite billions of corporate media dollars being spent to verify the dossier, still nothing is verified in what we now know is a political document paid for by Democrats to spy on their political opponent, which, to their disgrace, the FBI did.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s tweet was dead on accurate — every single point in it, every word. And yet, here is CNN’s left-wing Cillizza smearing Trump as “crazy” and bonkers,” even though CNN had no way of knowing if his tweet was or was not accurate [emphasis added]:\nThe bigger issue — at least to me — is that Trump is suggesting that the dossier itself was funded by some combination of a foreign power, the opposition political party and a federal law enforcement agency.\nIt’s easy to roll your eyes at the very suggestion and dismiss that idea as just Trump being Trump. “You guys always take him literally,” Trump’s supporters will say. “You shouldn’t.\nBut here’s the thing: President Trump is, um, the President. Which means he is held to the same standard every past president is held to. And by that standard, this tweet is crazy.\n…\nThe point here is that it is deeply irresponsible for a president of the United States to even flirt with this sort of conspiracy talk. You can love Donald Trump and still believe that the idea that the Russians, the Democrats and the FBI co-funded a dossier designed to discredit Trump’s 2016 campaign is totally bonkers.\nWithout knowing the facts, CNN declaring Trump “crazy” and “bonkers” is, of course, more evidence of the Climate of Hate the last-place cable channel has been building around Trump for almost two years.\nThe failing network has been working overtime to plant the idea that Trump is a unique danger to America, or as CNN anti-Trump commentator Jake Tapper regularly puts it, Trump is “un-American,” “unpatriotic,” “unmoored,” and “unhinged.”\nDespite the Daily Caller calling Cillizza and CNN out for this false reporting, nothing has been updated, corrected, or retracted.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

This is in addition to notices of inspection issued to 77 businesses in northern California just weeks ago.\nOne hundred and ninety-five of the 212 arrested included convicted criminals, those who failed to leave the United States after being issued a final order of removal, and those who returned to the U.S. after being removed.\nMore than 55 percent of those arrested were serious or violent felons or had been convicted on significant or multiple misdemeanors. Their crimes include child sex crimes, weapons charges, and assault.\nICE Deputy Director Thomas D. Homan remarked:\nBecause sanctuary jurisdictions like Los Angeles prevent ICE from arresting criminal aliens in the secure confines of a jail, our officers are forced to conduct at-large arrests in the community, putting officers, the general public and the aliens at greater risk and increasing the incidents of collateral arrests.\nICE focuses its enforcement efforts on individuals who “pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security.” This does not mean that any class of illegal aliens are exempt from enforcement actions.\n\n\n\n\nNotices of inspection went to a variety of businesses. “A notice of inspection alerts business owners that ICE is going to audit their hiring records to determine whether or not they are in compliance with the law,” according to ICE. “If the businesses are found to not be in compliance with the law, they will face civil fines and potential criminal prosecution.”\nHoman added:\nFewer jail arrests mean more arrests on the street, and that also requires more resources, which is why we are forced to send additional resources to those areas to meet operational needs and officer safety. Consistent with our public safety mission, 88 percent of those arrested during this operation were convicted criminals.\nSome of the 212 arrested this week will face federal criminal prosecution, while others will be processed for removal from the United States.\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",

Bush and President Barack Obama failed to implement.\nTrump said:\nBut if they don’t take them back, we’ll put sanctions on the countries. We’ll put tariffs on the countries. They’ll take them back so fast your head will spin. We’ll just tariff their goods coming in, and they’ll take them back in two seconds. You have a lot of people from those countries, and they’ll take them back. [Emphasis added]\nWe’ve had a very weak policy. We bring them back; they say, “We don’t want them.” And why should they? They killed five people. Why would they want them? And we will do something with regard to sanctions and tariffs, where they will — your head will spin how fast they get taken back. Okay? Every country is the same.\nAnd the other is, we give a lot of aid to some of those countries. And to those countries, we’ll stop giving aid, and they will take them back instantaneously. Okay? You just have to let us know just who they are. A lot of ways to handle it. But you can only handle it economically, because otherwise — you know, you’re not going to force them in. And that’s so easy to solve. It sounded difficult, but it’s not. That’s an easy one. [Emphasis added]\nAssistant Secretary of State Carl Risch said some of the worst offenders of not taking back their nationals include China, noting that a number of foreign countries have already been hit with sanctions by the State Department.\n“The worst offenders, numerically — countries like China, for example, has a long history of not taking back their removal cases,” Risch said. “But most recently, in September, we started a visa sanction plan with Guinea, Eritrea, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia. And we’re seeing some progress there. The visa sanctions do work in these cases, sir.  And we’re seeing that there are people going back to these countries that would not have gone back a year or two ago.”\nAs Breitbart News reported, Trump’s State Department hit Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Cambodia, and Guinea with sanctions back in mid-2017 after the countries would not take back their nationals from the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nThe move by the Trump administration comes in the form of a “visa suspension,” where foreign nationals are barred from entering the U.S. on any of the various visa programs.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Yanez is now a graduate of the University of Houston, where he was a student when he contributed to the Times.\nBut Yanez has since come to appreciate President Donald Trump and told Fox  Friends Weekend that he believes the Republican president has shown “leadership and compassion” toward him and other “Dreamers.”\n“Hilario Yanez, who goes by Eli, said Trump showed courage to tackle the illegal immigration issue comprehensively during his first year in office,” Fox reported.\n“Here’s a guy who wants to provide a pathway to citizenship for myself and really make a difference in my life,” said Yanez, who works as a technology analyst at Accenture Technology in Houston.\nYanez said, on the other hand, Democrat leaders have “no clear message” on immigration other than to “us[e] us as pawns,” Fox reported.\n\n\n\n\nTrump has proposed an immigration framework that would provide amnesty and an eventual pathway to citizenship to 1.8 million illegal aliens. His plan also includes more border security, an end to the lottery visa system, and an end to chain migration, which allows legal immigration based on family relations.\nYanez also told Fox he would support a border wall and said he is in favor of skilled-based immigration law, even if his mother, who brought him to the United States illegally when he was one-year-old, would probably not qualify under such a system.\n“I think it’s time for people who want to come to the United States to focus … on skills so [they] contribute to the American economy right way,” Yanez, who was born in Mexico, told Fox.\nYanez said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) should not shut down the federal government over DACA.\n“There is plenty of time on the table to fix this,” Yanez told Fox. “March 5 is the deadline.”\n\n\n\n\nYanez also said, if asked, he would serve in the U.S. military.\n“I thank God for being homeless, growing up without a father, living in a rough neighborhood, and most importantly for being undocumented,” Yanez wrote in the Times. “These struggles and challenges have made me the person I am today.”\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter",

Rick Scott (R), among others. Hoffman was a major contributor to the George W. Bush presidential campaign. He also donated more than $1 million to a PAC supporting Jeb Bush’s failed presidential campaign bid.\nHoffman wrote, “For how many years now have we been doing this — having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings — and how many years has it been that nothing’s been done? It’s the end of the road for me.” He added, “I will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons. Enough is enough!”\nHoffman did not define an “assault weapon,” did not say whether it is a set type of firearm or just any rifle that has the cosmetic features banned by Democrats from 1994-2004. It must be noted that the Democrat ban did not ban the rifles, only the cosmetic features. Is that what Hoffman has in mind?\nOr is Hoffman focused on the semiautomatic action of “assault weapons.” If so, will semiautomatic handguns have to be banned to appease him as well?\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Eleven percent of Americans say they are unsure what contributed to the occurrence of the mass shooting.\n\nWhen the sample group was adjusted so as to focus only on Americans “who have children of elementary or secondary school age,” the percentage of Americans who cite government failure as causal jumped to 61 and the percentage who blamed guns dropped to 23.\n\nOn February 23 Breitbart News summarized government’s failure:\n\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBCSO) received 911 calls about Nikolas Cruz in November 2017. The calls referenced violence and erratic behavior. CNN reports that in one of the calls with the host family, with whom Cruz was living after the death of his mother, told PBCSO they feared Cruz was going to turn a gun on the family. The family member told deputies that Cruz was “buying “tons of ammo” and had allegedly put “put [a] gun to others heads in the past.” No charges were filed, no arrest made.\nOn January 5, 2018, the FBI received a tip describing “Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” The FBI did not act on the tip.\nOn February 14 Cruz attacked students and unarmed teachers in Stoneman Douglas High. A report from CNN claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were at the school as the attack was taking place but not one of them entered the school. On February 22 Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told ABC 13 that video showed deputy Scott Peterson by building 12 on campus, yet Peterson never went inside to confront Cruz. The CNN report quotes Coral Springs sources that claim there were actually four Broward County deputies on scene who did not enter the building.\n\nAdditionally, Breitbart News reported that Broward County Sheriff’s deputy Scott Peterson was outside the school’s building 12 while the attack occurred. He never went in to confront Nikolas Cruz.\n\nOn the other hand, the 19-year-old who attacked the school complied with gun control laws in acquiring his rifle. He passed a background check at a gun store just as the law demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school was gun-free zone, and he ignored that, as criminals regularly ignore laws that would otherwise hinder them from carrying out their crimes.  The school was also an ammunition-free zone, but Cruz ignored that too.\n\nHe also ignored statutes against murder.\n\nWhat difference would once more law have made?\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Bush Praises Cheap Labor Immigration: ‘We Ought to Say Thank You and Welcome Them’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAP Photo/Seth Wenig\n\t\t\t\tby John Binder8 Feb 2018Washington, D.C.0\t\t\t\t8 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\t8 Feb, 2018\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFormer President George W. Bush praised the current inflow of illegal and legal immigrants to the United States, saying Americans should “say thank you” to immigrants and “welcome them.”\nAddressing a summit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Bush criticized President Trump’s decision to end the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gave temporary amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens.\n“America’s their home,” Bush said, according to the Associated Press. “They’ve got to get it fixed.”\nBush also explained how he tried to pass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens during his time in the White House, using mass immigration talking points often used by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and big business lobby to continue the inflow of more than one million mostly low-skilled illegal and legal immigrants arriving in the country every year.\n“There are people willing to do jobs that Americans won’t do,” Bush said. “Americans don’t want to pick cotton at 105 degrees (Fahrenheit), but there are people who want put food on their family’s tables and are willing to do that. We ought to say thank you and welcome them.”\nAutomation and robots are set to wipe out 30 percent of the U.S. workforce, though, as farmers and the agricultural industry mechanizes, needing less low-skilled labor.\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO\nBush’s suggestion that Americans are unwilling to do blue-collar jobs is not backed up by data collected and analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies.\nFor example, research by Steven Camarota found that of the more than 460 occupations analyzed, only four were dominated by foreign-born workers. Those four occupations accounted for less than one percent of the total U.S. workforce.\nIn jobs like housekeeping, construction work, butchers, and even taxi drivers, native-born Americans continue to make up the majority of the workforce.\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than one million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.\n\n\n\n\nMass legal immigration to the U.S. has come at the expense of America’s working and middle class, which has suffered from poor job growth, stagnant wages, and increased public costs to offset the importation of millions of low-skilled foreign nationals.\n\nFor blue-collar American workers, mass immigration has not only kept wages down, but in many cases, decreased wages, as Breitbart News reported. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues importing more foreign nationals against whom working-class Americans are forced to compete. In 2016, the U.S. brought in about 1.8 million mostly low-skilled immigrants.\nFor white-collar American workers, mass immigration has become a tool for the big business lobby, cheap labor industry, and Silicon Valley elites to replace U.S. citizens with cheaper foreign workers. For example, as Breitbart News reported, 71 percent of tech workers in coveted high-paying, white-collar Silicon Valley jobs are foreign-born, while the tech industry in the San Francisco, Oakland, and Hayward area is made up of 50 percent foreign-born tech workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian earning of full-time, year-round workers, 15 years and older, 1960 to 2016.\nThe massive importation of low-skilled foreign nationals to the U.S. has translated to a cheap labor economy that has aided in keeping American mens’ wages stagnant for at least 44 years, as Breitbart News reported. Median earnings for American men working full-time were actually lower in 2016 than they were in 2007.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",

The law exempted Homeland Security from dozens of laws if it deemed a wall to be in national security interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Tyler Houlton praised the decision by the San Diego court, saying that border walls “have proven to be extremely effective in preventing the flow of drugs and illegal aliens across our borders.”\n\n“Walls have worked in Yuma, Arizona and San Diego, California, where both areas have seen a 95 percent drop in attempted illegal border crossings,” Houlton said. “Simply put – walls work. The Department of Homeland Security looks forward to building the wall where our frontline operators say it is needed and in accordance with all applicable laws.”\n\nThe decision will allow the Trump administration to move forward on construction of the border wall, although the process to build the wall has been stuck in the prototype stage for nearly half a year with no clear vision of when the wall will actually be fully constructed and completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

    "body": "Interim San Francisco Mayor Mark Farrell is reportedly willing to go to jail to ensure his city always remains a “sanctuary city.”\nFarrell assured hundreds of amnesty activists last week who were blocking and protesting in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building that San Francisco will forever be a “sanctuary city.” He also, according to ABC7, “said he is willing to get arrested if that’s what it takes to defend sanctuary city policies,” echoing comments that Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf recently made.\n\nThe activists gathered to protest after ICE detained more than 200 illegal immigrants, nearly half of whom had criminal records, last week in various Bay Area raids. After Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tipped off illegal immigrants that ICE would be conducting sweeps, Thomas Homan, the agency’s acting director, said on last week that more than 800 illegal immigrants remained at large in the community because of Schaaf’s “irresponsible decision.”\n\nAccording to KTVU, the “Power, not Panic Emergency Response Committee” organized the emergency rally. The group is composed of entities like: the “ACLU, the Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership, Full Rights Equality  Empowerment SF, Contra Costa East Bay Interfaith Immigration Coalition, the Services, Immigrant Rights, and Education Network, Centro Legal de la Raza, the California Immigrant Policy Center.”\n\nThe activists had signs that read “ICE, go melt yourself,” “ICE out of CA,” “Stop Racist Deportations,” and “Sanctuary for All.” They also chanted “Shut down ICE.”\n\nICE said sanctuary cities like “San Francisco and Oakland force” the agency to “focus additional resources to conduct at-large arrests in the community, putting officers, the general public and aliens at greater risk and increasing the incidents of collateral arrests.” In 2015, an illegal immigrant who had been previously deported multiple times told authorities after he murdered Kate Steinle that he came to San Francisco because he knew it was a “sanctuary city.” Steinle’s tragic death allowed Donald Trump to make illegal immigration a national issue, which enabled him to surge to the front of the GOP field and never look back.\n\n\n\n\n\nICE also singled out two illegal immigrants currently believed to be living in Oakland who were not detained possibly because of Schaaf’s “irresponsible” alert:\n\na Honduran citizen who was previously arrested in San Francisco County multiple times for cocaine possession and transport, probation violations and sex with a minor under 16, and;\n\na citizen of Mexico who was previously arrested and convicted for carrying a loaded firearm, transportation and sale of narcotics and DUI.\n\nA recent NBC Bay Area investigation of the sanctuary city also found “more than 300 piles of feces and 100 drug needles” lining downtown San Francisco, and an infectious disease expert at U.C. Berkeley said the contamination is “much greater” than the slums in developing nations like India, Brazil, and Kenya.\n\n\nSan Francisco stands with our immigrant communities.

    "body": "After the first year of his presidency, Donald Trump’s shakeup of his presidential cabinet and West Wing advisors continues leaving even the most comfortable administration officials on edge.\n“I’ve gotten to know a lot of people very well over the last year,” Trump told reporters after firing Rex Tillerson and replacing him with his CIA director Mike Pompeo. “And I’m really at a point where we’re getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.”\n\nTrump’s decision to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter sent a wave of shock across Washington, as the president seemed reenergized after catching the world by surprise.\n\nHere is a rundown of where things stand:\n\nChief of Staff Gen. John Kelly:\n\nTrump likes Kelly, but does not like the idea that he is being controlled by the former general.\n\n\n\n\n\n“You know, we have General Kelly here, four star, and he’s doing a great job in Washington.” Trump told Marines in California on Tuesday. “I think he likes what you do better than what he does, but he’s doing a great job. He misses you.”\n\nFox News reports that Kelly might be shifted out of the West Wing in favor of Budget director Mick Mulvaney as chief of staff. Mulvaney’s staff stresses to Breitbart News that the former congressman is happy in his current position at OMB.\n\nNational Security Advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster:\n\nRumors of McMaster’s exit have swirled for months, but Trump appears ready to bring in someone new. Ambassador John Bolton is the rumored replacement, as he met with the president earlier in the week. Bolton has canceled media appearances this week as the rumors continue.\n\nJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump: \n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is reportedly ready for them to return to New York, but at this point, the couple does not seem inclined to do so.\n\nIf Kelly leaves both Jared and Ivanka could break free of the restraints he has put on their positions at the White House and start rebuilding their political careers.\n\nThere is a discussion about Kushner possibly returning to the 2020 presidential campaign, but in a rotating power struggle in the West Wing, he could see the benefits of staying.\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nShulkin is rumored to leave amidst power struggles in the agency. Rick Perry is among the rumored replacements, although he dismissed those rumors “fake news” and says he enjoys his position as Secretary of Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions:\n\nTrump has been angry at Sessions since he recused himself in the Russia investigation, even driving the former Alabama senator to the point where he submitted his letter of resignation before he was convinced by Reince Priebus to stay.\n\nThe rumors are a stretch at this point, as additional drama in the Justice Department would drive more questions about the Russia investigation but one scenario is that Sessions would move on and be replaced by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nCarson could be in trouble after a story about his requested $31,000 cabinet furniture won’t go away. If Trump wants Carson to go, he has an excuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nDevos is coming off a disastrous CBS 60 Minutes interview. Trump pays close attention to TV and a bad performance could raise concerns that he does not have the right person in the job.",

    "body": "NEW YORK — Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with the author of the largely discredited 35-page anti-Trump dossier, signed disclosure forms for his former firm to represent a Russian billionaire known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s favorite oligarch.\nThe detail, being brought to light herein, may raise immediate questions about the origins of the dossier. The oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, had a reported business dispute with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, is closely tied to Putin and has long been viewed as pushing Russian national interests.\n\nAlready, there have been questions about Deripaska’s possible relationship with dossier author Christopher Steele amid reports that the billionaire may have served as a source for the dossier itself.\n\nAlso, recently leaked text messages show extensive communication between a Russia-connected lawyer and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The attorney, Adam Waldman, was a paid lobbyist for Deripaska.  The messages show Warner attempted to arrange a meeting with Steele through Waldman.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley recently sent a letter to an attorney believed to be working for Deripaska asking whether the lawyer had hired Steele’s private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence Limited, to do work on behalf of Deripaska. A recent New Yorker article profiling Steele also raised the possibility that Deripaska was one of Steele’s private clients.\n\nAt a hearing last month, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) asked FBI Director Christopher Wray whether there was information that Steele was working with Deripaska when he compiled the dossier. Wray responded that he could not answer the question at a public hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA January letter from Grassley sent to John Podesta, who served as chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, asked Podesta to provide the Senate Judicial Committee with correspondence with numerous individuals, including Deripaska. That same letter was sent to the Perkins Coie law firm, which represented Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Steele was commissioned to produce the dossier by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition research firm, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the DNC via Perkins Coie.\n\nWhile questions surround Steele’s possible ties to Deripaska, the news media and legislative investigators may have missed a confirmed link between Deripaska and a State Department official involved in passing anti-Trump claims to Steele during the period that the dossier was compiled – namely Winer.\n\nAfter his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\nWiner further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an “old friend.” Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal – which Winer in turn gave to Steele – originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals.\n\nThe Steele dossier was reportedly utilized by the FBI in part to conduct its probe into Trump over unsubstantiated claims of collusion with Russia. According to House Intelligence Committee documents, the questionable dossier was also used by Obama administration officials to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign. The political origins of the dossier and issues relating to Steele’s credibility as a source were kept from the FISA court, a House Republican memo documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiner’s firm represented Deripaska in visa dispute\n\nIn July 2006, the U.S. cancelled a multi-entry visa that Deripaska had secured one year earlier, with the Wall Street Journal linking the decision to concerns over the mogul’s alleged ties to organized crime. Deripaska has denied these charges.\n\nIn 2005, Deripaska hired the Alston  Bird law firm to lobby on his behalf, paying the firm about $260,000, according to disclosure forms obtained at the time by Reuters. The lobby work was related to “Department of State visa policies and procedures,” the documents state.\n\nWiner at the time was a partner at Alston  Bird. He was the individual who filed the forms to represent Deripaska, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nWiner exchanged information with Steele\n\n\n\n\n\nWiner served in Bill Clinton’s administration as the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement. He wrote in his recent Washington Post oped that he rejoined the State Department in 2013 at the insistence of John Kerry. “In 2013, I returned to the State Department at the request of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, whom I had previously served as Senate counsel,” he wrote.\n\nIn the Post piece, Winer related that while he was at the State Department, he repeatedly passed Russia-related documents from Steele to State officials, including to Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry. “Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele’s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful,” he wrote.\n\nWiner wrote that in the summer of 2016, Steele “told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials.”\n\nWiner says that he met with Steele in September 2016 to discuss details that would later become known as the anti-Trump dossier. Winer wrote that he prepared a two-page summary of Steele’s information and “shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.”\n\nBesides bringing Steele’s dossier information to the State Department, Winer conceded that he also passed information from Blumenthal to Steele, specifically charges about Trump that originated with Shearer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiner described what he claimed was the evolution of his contacts with Blumenthal regarding Shearer’s information:\n\nIn late September, I spoke with an old friend, Sidney Blumenthal, whom I met 30 years ago when I was investigating the Iran-Contra affair for then-Sen. Kerry and Blumenthal was a reporter at the Post. At the time, Russian hacking was at the front and center in the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails of Blumenthal, who had a long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, had been hacked in 2013 through a Russian server.\n\nWhile talking about that hacking, Blumenthal and I discussed Steele’s reports. He showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.\n\nWhat struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele’s but appeared to involve different sources.\n\nShearer has numerous close personal and family connections to the Clintons and has reportedly been involved in numerous antics tied to them. National Review previously dubbed Shearer a “Creepy Clinton Confidante” and “The Strangest Character in Hillary’s Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.”\n\nPutin’s favorite oligarch\n\nDeripaska, with an estimated net worth of $6.4 billion, is founder and owner of Basic Element, one of Russia’s largest diversified industrial groups. The firm operates “energy, metals and mining, machinery, aviation, financial services and agriculture businesses worldwide,” according to a Bloomberg profile.\n\nBloomberg documented the other vast portfolios of Basic Element:\n\nIt produces aluminum; generates hydropower and nuclear energy; produces automotive components, aircraft, building materials, military hardware, road-building and construction equipment, and freight cars; manages facilities; develops and produces hi-tech equipment and multi-functional vehicles; trades carbon emissions; designs and constructs residential infrastructure; provides civil and infrastructure construction services; manages commercial property and lets office premises, production sites and warehouses; provides legal and financial support.\n\nCanada’s Globe and Mail previously profiled Deripaska in an extensive piece titled, “At home with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.” The newspaper reported that Deripaska “is said to be Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s favourite industrialist.”\n\nThe New Yorker also reported this month that Deripaska “has been described as Putin’s favorite oligarch.”\n\nThe billionaire’s relationship with Putin was temporarily publicly strained in 2009 due to a financial crisis in Russia, but the strong ties soon recovered and some say the short-lived tension was public theater.\n\nThe Globe and Mail documented:\n\nThe crisis appeared to damage Mr. Deripaska’s relationship with Mr. Putin, however. In a televised broadcast in mid-2009 in a hard-hit Russian industrial town called Pikalyovo, Mr. Putin compared industrial barons who left workers’ wages unpaid to cockroaches. He then forced Mr. Deripaska to sign a document safeguarding the future of a local factory, snapping “And give me back my pen,” the moment the crestfallen oligarch did so.\n\nThe event played well in recession-racked Russia, but may have been staged political theatre. There no longer appears to be any friction between the two men.\n\nDeripaska has official past connections to the Russian government. He won the Order of Friendship from the Russian Federation in 1999 and was appointed by Putin to represent the Russian Federation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council in 2004.\n\nA U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks and dated from 2006 described Deripaska as “among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis.”\n\nDeripaska and Manafort\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Deripaska’s past business dispute with Manafort, which dated back to the mid-2000s when Manafort was advising politicians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Post reported:\n\nManafort and Deripaska have both confirmed that they had a business relationship in which Manafort was paid as an investment consultant. In 2014, Deripaska accused Manafort in a Cayman Islands court of taking nearly $19 million intended for investments and then failing to account for the funds, return them or respond to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was used. There are no signs in court documents that the case has been closed.\n\nThe Post also cited “people familiar with the discussions” claiming that Manafort offered to privately brief Deripaska on the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHowever, the newspaper allowed:\n\nThere is no evidence in the documents showing that Deripaska received Manafort’s offer or that any briefings took place. And a spokeswoman for Deripaska dismissed the email ex­changes as scheming by “consultants in the notorious ‘beltway bandit’ industry.”\n\nQuestions raised about Deripaska’s ties to the dossier\n\nWhile the Winer-Deripaska link has not yet been debated, questions about whether dossier author Steele’s firm did work for the oligarch during the time the dossier was compiled has prompted concerns about the origins of the already controversial document.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) recently told Breitbart News in an interview that he was familiar with accusations that Deripaska may have been a source for dossier author Steele, explaining he cannot share information on the matter publicly, before adding, “It is a concern of ours.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) raised questions last month relating to Deripaska and Steele. “The other important news last week was watch what Sen. Cotton asked Wray. Was Steele being employed by paid by this Russian oligarch? The answer was interesting,” Jordan told The Daily Caller in an interview at CPAC.\n\nJordan continued: “We don’t know if he was getting paid by this oligarch. Stop and think. So the guy who put together this dossier, that was taken to a secret court, that was given a secret warrant to spy on someone associated with the Trump campaign — a fellow American citizen. That dossier was paid for by Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and maybe a Russian oligarch? You’ve got to be kidding me. So that is why we have to get to the bottom of all of this and keep pushing.”\n\nWriting at Tablet about the possibility of a Steele-Deripaska link, author Lee Smith opined:\n\nIf Steele worked for a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin, it is likely to change prevailing views of the Russia investigations of the past year and a half. The three congressional inquiries (Senate Judiciary, Senate Intelligence and House Intelligence), as well as special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, are based largely on allegations made in the dossier. Was Steele paid by Deripaska at the same time he was paid by the Washington, D.C. communications firm Fusion GPS for his work on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee? Did his work on behalf of Deripaska influence his investigations into the Trump team’s possible ties to Russia? Was Deripaska one of Steele’s Kremlin-insider sources — and what does that tell us about the contents and purpose of the Steele dossier?\n\nIn an oped at the Washington Post, Ed Rogers, a contributor to the PostPartisan blog, asked:\n\nSo, today, when the Democrats and their allies in the media insist that we need to know what the Russians did to influence the election and interfere in the democratic process, it is fair to ask which Russians are they talking about? Are they talking about the Russians who were solicited by Steele and his Democrat paymasters? What were the Russians’ interests and were any of them paying Steele? (A new story links Steele to Putin ally Oleg Deripaska.)\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

    "body": "The House passed the $1.3 trillion, 2,232-page omnibus spending bill on Thursday, sending the bill to the Senate; Congress must pass the omnibus before midnight on Friday to avert a government shutdown.\nThe House passed the omnibus 255-167, featuring bipartisan support despite conservative opposition to the legislation.\n\nThe House voted to advance the legislation to a floor vote on Thursday morning 211-207.\n\nRepublican leadership released the omnibus bill on Wednesday night giving legislators less than 17 hours to read the bill. \n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) slammed the passage of the omnibus in a statement on Thursday:\n\nThis is wrong. This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents—our employers—deserve better.\n\nRepublicans in Congress today were faced with a choice: Vote ‘yes’ and fund the military while embracing record levels of spending with a list of unfulfilled promises; Or vote no, go back to the drawing board, and get to work on a real proposal, with a real process, that funds our troops and actually fights to deliver the bill of goods that we promised the American people.\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus chose to vote no, because this omnibus doesn’t just forget the promises we made to voters—it flatly rejects them.\n\nThe White House backed the omnibus spending bill after President Donald Trump discussed the bill with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement:\n\n\nThe president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill, which includes more funds to rebuild the military, such as the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall and other key domestic priorities, like combatting the opioid crisis and rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure.\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on Wednesday night, “Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included.”\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadows lamented in an interview with Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday that the “Senate Democrats seem to be calling most of the shots.”\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall.\n\nThe omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican leadership also included provisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct gun research. The omnibus also includes the Fix NICS Act, which would allow for unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans’ right to purchase firearms without due process.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus sternly opposed the omnibus bill; the conservatives sent a letter to the White House, urging president Donald Trump to reject the legislation.\n\nThe House conservatives said that the bill “outright rejects” the promises conservatives made to the voters.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) told Fox News on Sunday that Democrats have not abandoned their base by refusing to shut down the government over DACA illegal aliens.\n\n\n\n\n\nDurbin said, “We’re not going to have a shutdown, but I’m urging leaders to come together and understand there’s an emergency here. We have to move on a bipartisan basis.”\n\n“We got about 80% of what we were trying to get, and if you can’t accept 80%, then the system can’t function,” Congressman John Yarmuth (D-KY) said in an interview.",

Trump made the move under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 after extensive Department of Commerce research into the issue. The tariffs are being imposed on the basis of economic and national security.\n\nFlake was swift to declare his active resistance to the tariffs:\n\nThese so-called ‘flexible tariffs’ are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty. Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster. I will immediately draft and introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, and I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\n\nTrump spoke of imposing tariffs during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDuring a June 2016 Pittsburgh campaign speech, Trump called out China specifically over “theft of American trade secrets” and vowed to remedy trade disputes with tariffs. He specifically cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which he used to impose the tariffs on Thursday.\n\nThe United States has lost six aluminum smelters since 2013, leaving just five, according to one senior administration official. Of those five, only two are operating at full capacity, and just one produces military grade high purity aluminum. That official stated that if the one military grade producing smelter were to shut down, the U.S. would be forced to buy this material from China or the Middle East. The official called it a significant vulnerability for the U.S. The steel industry has lost an estimated 50,000 jobs since 2000, according to the official.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter  More Stories About:\n\t\tBig Government, Economics, aluminum, China, Donald Trump, Jeff Flake, steel, Tariffs",

The calls referenced violence and erratic behavior. CNN reports that in one of the calls the host family, with whom Cruz was living after the death of his mother, told PBCSO they feared Cruz was going to turn a gun on the family. The family member deputies that Cruz was “buying “tons of ammo” and had allegedly put “put [a] gun to others heads in the past.” No charges were filed, no arrest made.\nOn January 5, 2018, the FBI received a tip describing “Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” The FBI did not act on the tip.\nOn February 14 Cruz attacked students and unarmed teachers in Stoneman Douglas High. A report from CNN claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were at the school as the attack was taking place but not one of them entered the school. On February 22 Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told ABC 13 that video showed deputy Scott Peterson by building 12 on campus, yet Peterson never went inside to confront Cruz. The CNN report quotes Coral Springs sources that claim there were actually four Broward County deputies on scene who did not enter the building.\n\nWhen Cruz attacked the school he faced no armed resistance because the teachers were not allowed to carry. President Trump noted that the lack of armed teachers is a weakness too great to ignore and, on February 21, called for “20 percent” of our nation’s public school teachers to be armed for school safety. The next day he reiterated his call, noting that first responders are “5 to 8 minutes” away when a school shooting occurs, but teachers are on scene to shoot sickos “immediately.”\n\nAnd how did government officials respond to the call for teachers to be armed to defend themselves? The Hill reported that Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called Trump’s push for armed teachers “abhorrent.” He intimated that arming teachers for self-defense was “an anathema.”\n\nBlumenthal was not without like-minded Republicans who rejected calls to arm teachers as well. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) voiced his opposition to armed teachers on February 21 and Gov. Rick Scott (R) voiced his opposition to armed teachers on February 23.\n\nIronically, when Scott voiced his opposition, he said, “I think you need to have individuals that are trained, well-trained. My focus is let law enforcement do the keeping us safe and let teachers focus on teaching.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment officials like Gov. Scott ignore the fact that “well-trained” law enforcement personnel failed us during the February 14 attack. Local law enforcement, the FBI, and even the federal gun-free school law failed us.  And when we seek to arm teachers to prevent another scenario where an armed attacker finds a school full of sitting ducks, Sens. like Blumenthal and Rubio are quick to tell us teachers ought not be armed for school safety.\n\nGovernment failed to protect us and they do not want us to protect ourselves.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Google and Facebook both have the ability to significantly influence elections. Facebook has previously boosted voter registration and turnout by significant margins, while research on search engine manipulation shows that services like Google Search have the potential to change the preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more.\n\nBrad Parscale, current campaign manager for the president’s 2020 re-election bid, previously managed Trump’s digital campaign in 2016. In public interviews, Parscale has argued that social media, not traditional media, was the key to Trump’s victory in 2016, and identified Facebook as particularly critical to the president’s success. His selection suggests that the digital campaigning will be given even greater emphasis in 2020.\n\nHis comment follows weeks of high-profile revelations about Silicon Valley openly limiting the reach of conservatives. Last week, we reported that algorithm changes at Facebook have caused the President’s engagement on the platform to fall by 45 percent. The same change has hit engagement on the pages of conservative news websites, while leaving the mainstream media’s pages virtually unchanged.\n\nDuring the same week, YouTube launched a massive crackdown against conservatives and alternative media channels, taking down videos and banning channels. The channel for Alex Jones’ InfoWars, which interviewed the President during his 2016 election campaign, is now one strike away from a permanent ban on the platform.\n\nTwitter also continues to be caught up in bias scandals: we recently reported that the platform is hiding tweets from President Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The platform also conducted a recent mass-lockout of Trump supporters, and has refused to apply their terms of service evenly, allowing a campaign of harassment against Pamela Geller’s daughters while banning right-wingers for stating facts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllum Bokhari is the Senior Tech Correspondent at Breitbart News.

Michelle Mortensen gets just ten percent, Scott Hammond gets nine percent, and David McKeon gets one percent. Victoria Seaman, who dropped out of the race upon Tarkanian’s entry with Trump’s endorsement, got nine percent—while 34 percent were undecided.\n\nThe survey of 400 respondents was conducted from March 10 to March 11 by Strategic National, with a margin of error of 4.9 percent, and provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\n\nTarkanian, a strong supporter of President Trump, was the GOP nominee for this very seat in 2016, but lost to now Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the general election after 2016 GOP senate nominee in Nevada, then-Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) tanked Republicans statewide by distancing himself from Trump in the leadup to election day. Rosen is running for the U.S. Senate and is expected to face off against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in the November general election.\n\nTrump’s approval rating in the survey of Nevada third district GOP voters is very high. A whopping 72 percent have an “extremely favorable” opinion of Trump, and another 16 percent have a “somewhat favorable” opinion of the president. Only four percent have a “somewhat unfavorable” opinion of Trump, and just  six percent have an “extremely unfavorable” opinion of him.\n\nTarkanian was running against Heller for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate until Trump asked him to switch to the House race so as to give the party a better chance in the general election in both the Senate and House races.\n\n\n\n\n\nTarkanian announced Trump’s endorsement of his congressional campaign in a statement last week. He said:\n\nI entered the U.S. Senate race after receiving an outpouring of requests from Trump supporters throughout Nevada, many of whom stood by both me and Donald Trump in 2016. These grassroots supporters saw in me a fierce defender of President Trump’s America First agenda. Late Wednesday, the President and members of his political team reached out to me and asked me to consider supporting the America First agenda as a Congressional candidate by running again in CD3, where I nearly won in 2016 in what was one of the most expensive and closest Congressional races in America. This was not something I ever considered. In my travels throughout the state, I’ve had so many wonderful people thank me for running for the US Senate. They believe in our message and the cause. My incredible staff, mostly volunteers, have invested thousands of hours into this cause. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to them all. I do not want to let any of them down. I have always believed that public service is doing what is in the best interest of the people you represent, not yourself politically. I believe with every ounce of my body that the future of our country, and a better life for our children, requires the implementation of the America First agenda. I am confident I would have won the US Senate race and done a great job representing the people of Nevada in the Senate, but the President is adamant that a unified Republican ticket in Nevada is the best direction for the America First movement. With President Trump’s full support and endorsement, I am filing to run again in CD3 with the firm belief that we will finish what we started in 2016 and win in 2018.\n\nThat came after a Trump tweet urged Tarkanian to switch to the House race from the Senate race, adding that he would have the president’s backing in doing so.\n\n\nIt would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it’s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2018\n\nIn a subsequent appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, Tarkanian laid out the stakes of this race.\n\n“It’s a seat the Democrats currently hold, so we can take a seat back from the Democrats,” Tarkanian said. “Right now, you keep hearing all the talk that the Democrats are going to go after maybe 40 plus seats, maybe 50 seats that the Republicans hold right now, and try and switch them. This is one that’s very likely to go back to the Republican side.”\n\nIn a year where Democrats are on the offensive, Tarkanian is exactly right that if the GOP has a chance of holding the House they need every advantage they can possibly get—especially pickup opportunities like this one. This particular district is one of a handful in the country where a Democrat currently represents it, but Republicans have a decent shot at a pickup. Assuming Tarkanian’s lead holds and he solidifies the nomination quickly, with Trump’s support in the general election, he will face off against Democrat Susie Lee in the general.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee is considered an easy target to beat, given her close ties to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and problems already piling up for her campaign.\n\nSupporters of the president and his agenda are hopeful that the other contenders in the primary clear out of the way for Tarkanian to represent the party, as the president wants, in the general election. If that happens, the district could represent a battle between two national movements: The Women’s March, #MeToo-fueled leftist resistance to Trump versus the economic nationalist conservative base of the president. Republicans and Democrats will likely both nationalize this race, and both parties are likely to compete heavily in Nevada’s third district.\n\nThe suburban district just outside Las Vegas has traditionally been a swing district, but Republicans have generally held it in its current form.",

    "body": "An FBI informant told three congressional committees in a written statement that Moscow routed millions to America with the expectation it would benefit Bill Clinton’s charitable efforts as then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pushed through a “reset” in U.S.-Russia relations, the Hill reported.\nThe informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement, which was obtained by the Hill, that Russian nuclear executives told him Moscow hired American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide because it would influence the Obama administration and specifically Hillary Clinton.\nCampbell testified, according to the Hill,  that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clinton’s Global Initiative.”\n“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over 12 months. APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement. “\nAPCO officials told the Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and involved different divisions of the firm. They also said their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but instead focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.\n“APCO Worldwide’s activities involving client work on behalf of Tenex and The Clinton Global Initiative were totally separate and unconnected in any way,” APCO told the Hill in a statement. “All actions on these two unconnected activities were appropriate, publicly documented from the outset and consistent with regulations and the law. Any assertion otherwise is false and unfounded.”\n\n\n\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill Campbell’s testimony is part of a GOP effort to distract investigators from President Trump’s “problems.”\n“Just yesterday the committee made clear that this secret informant charade was just that, a charade. Along with the widely debunked text-message-gate and Nunes’ embarrassing memo episode, we have a trifecta of GOP-manufactured scandals designed to distract from their own President’s problems and the threat to democracy he poses,” he told the Hill.\nCampbell on Wednesday testified before staff from both parties on the Senate Judiciary, House Intelligence and House Oversight and Government Reform Committees.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, asserted in a letter this week that Justice Department officials told both parties during a briefing in December that they ultimately found they “could not trust” Campbell when he was working as an FBI informant.\nRepublicans note that the FBI found Campbell’s undercover work valuable enough to reward him with a $50,000 check in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n“My FBI handlers praised my work. They told me on various occasions that details from the undercover probe had been briefed directly to FBI top officials. On two occasions my handlers were particularly excited, claiming that my undercover work had been briefed to President Obama as part of his daily presidential briefing,” he said in the testimony.\nCampbell said in his testimony that Obama administration officials made decisions that benefitted the Russian nuclear industry, which was seeking to build a monopoly in the global uranium market to help President Vladimir Putin seek geopolitical advantage over the U.S.\nHe wrote that wrote that Russian nuclear executives “boasted” during vodka-fueled meetings monitored by the FBI about “how weak the U.S. government was in giving away uranium business and were confident that Russia would secure the strategic advantage it was seeking in the U.S. uranium market.”\nCampbell said he asked his FBI handlers why the U.S. was not more aggressive.\n“I expressed these concerns repeatedly to my FBI handlers. The response I got was that politics was somehow involved,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nGOP investigators are interested in how Campbell’s experience connects with the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal, which gave Russian mining giant Rosatom control of roughly 20 percent of the U.S.’s capacity to mine uranium.\nThat deal was approved unanimously in 2010 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency board that includes the State, Defense, and Justice Departments, in addition to other agencies. The purpose of CFIUS is to block deals that could threaten U.S. national security.\nClinton was secretary of state at the time the deal went through, although Clinton associates say she had nothing to do with it.\nMeanwhile, Campbell had helped the FBI gather evidence as early as 2009 that the Russian nuclear industry was engaged in a kickback, bribery and racketeering scheme on U.S. soil, the Hill reported last fall. The scheme compromised the U.S. trucking firm that had the sensitive job of transporting uranium around America.\nCampbell said he provided the FBI that evidence months before the Obama administration approved a series of favorable decisions that enriched Rosatom, including the Uranium One deal.\n\n\n\n\nCampbell could not discuss the case with Congress until the Justice Department freed him to do so last year.\nHe also gave congressional committees documents he said he provided to his FBI handlers in 2010 showing that the Russian and American executives implicated in the Tenex bribery scheme specifically asked him to try to help get the Uranium One deal approved by the Obama administration.\nAccording to the Hill, Campbell said:\n“In 2010, officials inside Tenex became interested in helping another Rosatom subsidiary, ARMZ, win Obama administration approval to purchase Uranium One, a Canadian company with massive Kazakh and large U.S. uranium assets.\n…\n“Although Tenex and ARMZ are separate subsidiaries, Tenex had its own interest in Uranium One. Tenex would become responsible for finding commercial markets and revenue for those uranium assets once they were mined.\n“The emails and documents I intercepted during 2010 made clear that Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One – for both its Kazakh and American assets – was part of Russia’s geopolitical strategy to gain leverage in global energy markets.\n…\n“I obtained documentary proof that Tenex was helping Rosatom win CFIUS approval, including an October 6, 2010 email … asking me specifically to help overcome opposition to the Uranium One deal.”\nCampbell said the purchase of the Uranium One assets and the securing of billions of new uranium sales contracts inside the U.S. during the Obama years were part of the “Russian uranium dominance strategy.”\n“The importance of the Uranium One decision to Tenex was made clear by the fact that the Russian government directed Mikerin to open a new U.S. office for Tenex and to create a new American entity called Tenam in early October 2010, just weeks before Rosatom and ARMZ won the Obama administration approval to buy Uranium One,” he said, according to the testimony.\n“Rosatom/Tenex threw a party to celebrate, which was widely attended by American nuclear industry officials. At the request of the FBI, I attended and recorded video footage of Tenam’s new offices,” he said.\nCampbell also testified that under the FBI’s direction, he conducted a failed sting effort to lure Putin to the United States and gathered evidence that Russia was helping Iran build its nuclear capability.\nHe gave Congress an April 16, 2010, memo he said he wrote and gave to the FBI that spelled out Russian efforts to aid Iran.\n“Tenex continues to supply Iran fuel through their Russian company,” he wrote in that memo, obtained by the Hill. “They continue to assist with construction consult [sic] and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor. Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult” of Russians.\n“The final fabricators to Iran are being flown by Russian air transport due to the sensitive nature of the equipment,” his 2010 memo to the FBI added.\nCampbell also said he was never reimbursed by the FBI for the hundreds of thousands of dollars he used of his own money to make bribe payments under the FBI’s direction to the Russians to facilitate his cover.\nCampbell said what he witnessed frustrated him.\n“I was frustrated watching the U.S. government make numerous decisions benefiting Rosatom and Tenex while those entities were engaged in serious criminal conduct on U.S. soil,” he wrote.\n“Tenex and Rosatom were raking in billions of U.S. dollars by signing contracts with American nuclear utility clients at the same time they were indulging in extortion by using threats to get bribes and kickbacks, with a portion going to Russia for high ranking officials.”",

While talking to reporters, Kerr was asked about the Florida shooting and his level of frustration about how the nothing appears to be happening to prevent such shootings.\nHere is Kerr’s response:\n\nSteve Kerr’s powerful message on the shooting massacre in Florida. pic.twitter.com/Lo4k66JG4G\n— Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) February 15, 2018\nKerr’s response is unsurprising, the Golden State coach has been an outspoken critic of the 2nd Amendment. On a podcast in June of 2016, Kerr said, “Our government is insane. We are insane. And what bugs me is this adherence to the right to bear arms, you know. That was back in 1776. People didn’t own automatic rifles. You had to have a musket in case the Redcoats were coming. The British were coming. And the beautiful thing about the Constitution is they left open amendments to change things because things change over time.”\nIn November of 2017, Kerr said, “To solve [the issue of guns]. I think we almost have to look at it like a public health issue. Too often we get caught up in political rhetoric, 2nd amendment rights, NRA stuff. We have to look at this as it having nothing to do with partisanship, political parties. It’s got to be a public safety issue, a public health issue.”\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tRead More Stories About:\n\t\tBreitbart Sports, 2nd Amendment, Florida Attack, NRA, Steve Kerr",
