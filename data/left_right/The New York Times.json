[{"author": "Michael S.

Mr. Trump has insisted he should sit for an interview with the special counsel\u2019s office, even though Mr. Dowd believed it was a bad idea.\n\nIt is not clear who will take over the legal team. Mr. Trump\u2019s other personal lawyer for the investigation, Jay Sekulow, is liked by the president and recently brought on one of his longtime friends, Joseph E. diGenova, to join the team. Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer for the investigation, came aboard around the same time as Mr. Dowd and Mr. Sekulow and advocated on behalf of cooperating with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russia\u2019s election interference and possible ties to Trump associates.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Landler", "body": "Mr. Bolton, who will take office April 9, has met regularly with Mr. Trump to discuss foreign policy, and was on a list of candidates for national security adviser. He was in the West Wing with Mr. Trump to discuss the job on Thursday.\n\n\u201cH.R. McMaster has served his country with distinction for more than 30 years. He has won many battles and his bravery and toughness are legendary,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cGeneral McMaster\u2019s leadership of the National Security Council staff has helped my administration accomplish great things to bolster America\u2019s national security.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster had struggled for months to impose order not only on a fractious national security team but on a president who resisted the sort of discipline customary in the military. Although General McMaster has been a maverick voice at times during a long military career, the Washington foreign policy establishment had hoped he would keep the president from making rash decisions.\n\nYet the president and the general, who had never met before Mr. Trump interviewed General McMaster for the post, had little chemistry from the start, and often clashed behind the scenes.\n\nGeneral McMaster\u2019s serious, somber style and preference for order made him an uncomfortable fit with a president whose style is looser, and who has little patience for the detail and nuance of complex national security issues. They had differed on policy, with General McMaster cautioning against ripping up the nuclear deal with Iran without a strategy for what would come next, and tangling with Mr. Trump over the strategy for American forces in Afghanistan.\n\nTheir tensions seeped into public view in February, when General McMaster said at a security conference in Munich that the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was beyond dispute. The statement drew a swift rebuke from the president, who vented his anger on Twitter.\n\n\u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, using his campaign nickname for Hillary Clinton. \u201cRemember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump selected General McMaster last February after pushing out Michael T. Flynn, his first national security adviser, for not being forthright about a conversation with Russia\u2019s ambassador at the time. (Mr. Flynn has since pleaded guilty of making a false statement to the F.B.I. and is cooperating with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.)\n\nGeneral McMaster carried out a slow-rolling purge of hard-liners at the National Security Council who had been installed by Mr. Flynn and were allied ideologically with Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, earning the ire of conservatives who complained that his moves represented the foreign policy establishment reasserting itself over a president who had promised a different approach.\n\nGeneral McMaster\u2019s position at the White House had been seen as precarious for months, and he had become the target of a concerted campaign by hard-line activists outside the administration who accused him of undermining the president\u2019s agenda and pushed for his ouster, even creating a social media effort branded with a #FireMcMaster hashtag.\n\nLast summer, Mr. Trump balked at a plan General McMaster presented to bolster the presence of United States forces in Afghanistan, although the president ultimately embraced a strategy that would require thousands more American troops.\n\nGeneral McMaster had been among the most hard-line administration officials in his approach to North Korea, publicly raising the specter of a \u201cpreventive war\u201d against the North. He was among those who expressed concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision this month to meet Kim Jong-un, according to a senior official.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "The New York Times", "body": "In the days after the shooting in Parkland, some of the students began drawing national attention with impassioned speeches at rallies, television appearances and pointed responses to critics on social media.

Oprah Winfrey and the couple George and Amal Clooney each donated $500,000 to the cause, and other celebrities such as Steven Spielberg have followed suit. Big political names in the anti-gun movement, such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Everytown for Gun Safety, have contributed help as well.\n\nThe activists themselves have raised several million dollars on crowdfunding websites. And Deena Katz, an organizer of the Los Angeles Women\u2019s March, is pitching in as an adviser.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama hand-penned a letter in support of the movement that was obtained by the news outlet Mic, and former President Bill Clinton voiced his support for the activists on Twitter.\n\nPerhaps the most formidable political foe the students face is the National Rifle Association.\n\nIts leaders have questioned whether the students were mature enough to lead a discussion about national policy, and representatives have also accused the movement of being backed by \u201cradicals with a history of violent threats,\u201d a claim that the fact-checking website Politifact deemed untrue.\n\nSupporters of gun rights have opted to protest in some areas on Saturday, and to stand down in others.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, a rally for gun rights will begin just before the rally for gun control. Both marches will take the same route, from a high school to the Utah Capitol.\n\nThe gun rights rally there is led by Bryan Melchior, 45, a co-owner of a website that sells firearms and firearm accessories. Mr. Melchior said that in recent days he had been contacted by many young people who felt that the swell of calls for stricter gun laws did not represent their views.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re marching for the safety, security and protection of the children,\u201d he said, adding that he supports arming teachers and fortifying schools and has developed a school safety program he hopes will be adopted by administrators.\n\nSome supporters of gun rights in Vermont said they were not planning to hold counterdemonstrations during Saturday\u2019s march.\n\n\u201cMost times counterprotesting looks bad, especially counterprotesting kids that want to feel safe in school,\u201d said Jace Laquerre, a student at the University of Vermont who has spoken out in support of gun rights.\u201cWe agree with their message to feel safe in school, we just have different solutions is all.\u201d\n\nMr. Laquerre said he was still planning to appear on CNN on Saturday with survivors of the Parkland shooting.\n\nMr. Trump has grappled publicly with how to respond after the Parkland shooting.\n\nHe emerged from an emotionally raw meeting with students, as well as parents of those who were killed, appearing moved. Days later, he declared: \u201cWe have to have action. We don\u2019t have any action.\u201d\n\nBut in March, he quickly abandoned a brief promise to work for gun control measures opposed by the National Rifle Association. He has also discussed measures such as arming teachers and reopening mental institutions to prevent school shootings.\n\nOn Friday, he criticized Mr. Obama over bump stocks, an accessory that can make a semiautomatic weapon fire more rapidly, in tweeting about the Justice Department\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cAs I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\u201d\n\nAmong the demonstrations planned for this weekend are small events in Hong Kong and Tokyo, two Asian cities where guns are highly restricted and shootings are rare.\n\nAmericans living there said they still felt connected to the events in the United States and wanted to express solidarity with the people demonstrating for stronger gun laws.\n\nMarney Schaumann, who has lived abroad for about 10 years, previously lived in Parkland, less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas.\n\nA friend who still lives in Parkland asked if she would help organize a march overseas, and Ms. Schaumann was able to find other volunteers through a local Facebook group for a short march Sunday in the Central district of Hong Kong Island.\n\n\u201cEven though we live abroad we still love and care for our country and the students there,\u201d she said.\n\nAt an event scheduled for Saturday in Tokyo, participants planned to hold signs bearing the names of people who have been killed in gun violence.\n\n\u201cI think it is important not just to call for changes to our gun laws, not just to debate the subtleties of the Second Amendment, but to remember that it is people who have died because of our gun laws,\u201d said Linda Gould, an American in Japan who is organizing the Tokyo vigil.\n\nAnd in Nagoya, Japan, Mieko Hattori, the mother of Yoshihiro Hattori, a Japanese exchange student who was shot and killed in Baton Rouge, La., in the early 1990s, said that the students had inspired her.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to convey our message, we support you from Japan,\u201d said Ms. Hattori.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jonah Engel Bromwich", "body": "Mr. Schwab said in interviews with The San Francisco Chronicle and CNN that he had been frustrated by the remarks, and had quit \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want to perpetuate misleading facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked them to change the information,\u201d he told The Chronicle, referring to the 864 people to whom the statement alluded. \u201cI told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn\u2019t agree with that.

He campaigned extensively with Mr. Trump and members of his administration and relied heavily on campaign spending from outside Republican groups that attempted to make Ms. Pelosi a central voting issue. Conservative outside groups also sought to promote the tax cuts recently enacted by the party, but found that message had little effect.\n\nYet at midday on Wednesday, Mr. Saccone trailed by just over 600 votes with only a handful of ballots yet to be counted. He has not conceded and could conceivably challenge the results through litigation. In a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the party\u2019s campaign committee, described the race as \u201ctoo close to call,\u201d according to a person who heard his presentation.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan and Mr. Stivers also called the election a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Republican lawmakers, telling them that they could not afford to fall behind on fund-raising, as Mr. Saccone did.\n\nMr. Lamb raised $3.9 million and spent $3 million, compared to Mr. Saccone\u2019s $900,000 raised and $600,000 spent as of February 21. But Republican outside groups swamped the district. Between conservative \u201csuperPACs\u201d and the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mr. Saccone had more than $14 million spent on his behalf.\n\nMr. Lamb got just over $2 million.\n\nAs Republican lawmakers spilled out of their morning conference meeting, few seemed willing to come to grips with how much Mr. Trump is energizing Democrats and turning off independent voters. Some of them even argued that Mr. Saccone only made the race close thanks to the president\u2019s rally in the district on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,\u201d said Mr. Ryan.\n\nOthers in the conference, however, talked more openly about the political difficulties of breaking with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is no benefit from running away from the president,\u201d said Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, a member of his party\u2019s leadership, noting that Republican candidates need core conservative voters to show up and this constituency still backs the president.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get them the same thing as Lamb opposing Pelosi,\u201d said Mr. McHenry.\n\nBut Mr. Lamb\u2019s margin and the turnout levels in the district\u2019s suburban precincts proved crucial, and a handful of Republican House veterans conceded this broader vulnerability.\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s probably where the president\u2019s appeal is the weakest,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime party strategist, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern we\u2019ve seen throughout.\u201d\n\nBut he argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity in high-income areas would not as adversely impact incumbents who have their own identity and are steeled for difficult races.\n\nYet even as most of the Republicans pinned the blame on Mr. Saccone\u2019s fund-raising weakness or held up Mr. Lamb\u2019s willingness to oppose Ms. Pelosi, refusing to fault Mr. Trump, one retiring lawmaker was more blunt.\n\n\u201cDenial isn\u2019t just a river in Egypt,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a frequent critic of the president. \u201cI\u2019ve been through wave elections before.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were buoyant as Mr. Lamb declared victory, viewing his upset as both a harbinger of a November wave and perhaps a sign that the party had overcome some of the most stinging Republican attack lines of the Obama years. Polling in both parties found Ms. Pelosi widely disliked among voters in the district, but the Republican ads featuring her failed to disqualify Mr. Lamb.\n\nPittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, said Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign showed that the Republicans\u2019 anti-Pelosi playbook had real limitations. The race, he said, should embolden Democrats to contest difficult districts in the Midwest with an economic message that appeals to elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cConor Lamb was talking about redevelopment and economic growth, and the Republicans were talking about Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t help themselves.\u201d\n\nMr. Peduto urged the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the electioneering vehicle for House Democrats, to expand its target list in the Trump-aligned Midwest.\n\n\u201cLook through the Rust Belt, in areas that used to be blue,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a congressional district that\u2019s 8, 10 or 12 points carried by Trump, I would hope that the D.C.C.C. is now putting that in the target.\u201d\n\nTo the extent that Democrats attempt further incursions into Trump country, it may test their party\u2019s willingness to tolerate Lamb-like deviation on matters like gun control, and perhaps more widespread rejection of Ms. Pelosi.\n\nDemocrats in Washington have already faced criticism from liberal activists for intervening in primary elections, in states like Texas and California, to promote candidates that they view as more electable. Putting forward a slate of moderates in Republican areas could prove more controversial than boosting just one in a special election.\n\nUp to this point, however, Democratic leaders and their campaign tacticians have taken a just-win approach \u2014 a far more permissive attitude than their Republican counterparts when it comes to Mr. Trump.\n\nClarke Tucker, a Democratic state legislator in Arkansas who is challenging Representative French Hill, a Republican, said on Wednesday that he took Mr. Lamb\u2019s victory as a validation of a throw-the-bums-out message he planned to deliver in his own race. Campaigning in a seat that comprises Little Rock and its suburbs, Mr. Tucker said he seldom spoke about Mr. Trump and announced up front that he would not back Ms. Pelosi.\n\nMr. Tucker, who was aggressively recruited by the D.C.C.C., said he had told Democrats in Washington that he was \u201cvery frustrated with the leadership of the House in both parties\u201d and no one attempted to dissuade him from delivering that message.\n\n\u201cThat district is a lot like the one I\u2019m running in,\u201d Mr. Tucker said of Mr. Lamb\u2019s seat. \u201cI think voters are interested in changing the leadership in Washington.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Liam Stack", "body": "A spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said those dollars would be used to support an independent candidate in the November general election.

At the time, Mr. Bolton said Iraqis would welcome American troops and the United States\u2019 military role would be over quickly as Iraqis exercised their new freedom from Saddam Hussein and established a democracy. It was the sort of simplistic and wrongheaded position he takes on most policies.\n\nMr. Bolton will replace H.R. McMaster, the three-star general who had cautioned against jettisoning the Iran nuclear deal without a plan for what came next, among other policy differences with the president. Mr. Bolton would be the third national security adviser in Mr. Trump\u2019s 14 chaotic months in office.\n\nWhile General McMaster never had a smooth time in the White House, Mr. Bolton already has a relationship of sorts with Mr. Trump since he has met with the president a number of times and is a commentator on Fox News, which the president spends much of his time watching.\n\nHe campaigned hard for the job, even after Mr. Trump previously rejected him for both that position and secretary of state, in part because the president didn\u2019t like his bushy mustache \u2014 seriously.\n\nThe national security adviser is the person who makes sure the president hears the views of all the national security agencies, including the State Department and Defense Department, and drives policy toward a decision. It is hard to see Mr. Bolton playing the honest broker. Mr. Bolton is known to play a ruthless inside game as he maneuvered to win bureaucratic battles and freeze out people he thinks crossed him. He has been such a lightening rod that he couldn\u2019t get confirmed as United Nations ambassador in 2005 so President George W. Bush gave him a recess appointment, and he stayed in the job about a year. It was considered unlikely that the Senate could have confirmed him as secretary of state, but the national security adviser job doesn\u2019t require confirmation.\n\nBringing on the fiery Mr. Bolton now, at a delicate moment with North Korea, is a terrible decision. While Mr. Trump has often threatened North Korea with military action, he accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to a summit, brokered by South Korea\u2019s president, who is eager for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis.\n\nMr. Bolton, by contrast, told Fox News earlier this month that talks would be worthless and has called South Korean leaders \u201cputty in North Korea\u2019s hands.\u201d On February 28, he insisted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that \u201cit is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nLast summer he wrote in the Journal, \u201cThe U.S. should obviously seek South Korea\u2019s agreement (and Japan\u2019s) before using force, but no foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nOn Iran, Mr. Bolton and the president are in sync, with both arguing that the United States should withdraw from the nuclear agreement by a May deadline. In March 2015, he argued in a New York Times op-ed that only military action like Israel\u2019s 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor \u201ccan accomplish what is required.\u201d\n\nGoing to war in either of these cases would not only create unnecessary bloodshed, it would be disastrous for the United States and its allies, South Korea and Japan. The Iran deal has substantially halted the nuclear program and needs to be maintained. Negotiations between the United States and North Korea, given a new impetus by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, needs to be tested.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s position on Russia, that NATO must have a strong response to the Kremlin-linked poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, is somewhat better than Mr. Trump\u2019s. But his rejection of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and endorsement of a book by the anti-Muslim activist Pam Geller are unacceptable positions for a top American official.\n\nMr. Bolton is certain to accelerate American alienation from its allies and the rest of the world.

She had ruled on Monday that Mr. Shkreli would also have to forfeit $7.36 million to the government to cover his fraud.\n\nJudge Matsumoto also authorized the government to seize Mr. Shkreli\u2019s assets, including a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album and a Picasso, if he was otherwise unable to come up with the required restitution.\n\nMr. Shkreli\u2019s supporters argued, in letters submitted to the judge before sentencing, that he was a bright, nerdy child who became consumed with internet fame.\n\nRaised in Brooklyn, Mr. Shkreli was physically abused by both of his Albanian immigrant parents and witnessed domestic abuse in his home, according to a submission from a consultant hired by his lawyers that was reviewed by The New York Times.

After that, Judge Matsumoto revoked his bail and sent him to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.

And he is a potential witness to the question of whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has taunted Mr. McCabe both publicly and privately, and Republican allies have cast him as the center of a \u201cdeep state\u201d effort to undermine the Trump presidency.\nAs a witness, Mr. McCabe would be in a position to corroborate the testimony of the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who kept contemporaneous notes on his conversations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump prodded him to publicly exonerate the president on the question of Russian collusion and encouraged him to shut down an investigation into his national security adviser.\nMr. McCabe, a 21-year F.B.I. veteran, was eligible for a government pension if he retired on Sunday. The firing jeopardizes that benefit, though it was not immediately clear how much he might lose.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unfair to my reputation after a 21-year career,\u201d Mr. McCabe said. He said the president\u2019s public attacks were aimed at several targets. \u201cThe real damage is being done to the F.B.I., law enforcement and the special counsel,\u201d he said.\nMr. McCabe was the F.B.I.\u2019s second in command during one of the most tumultuous periods in the bureau\u2019s history. He oversaw investigations into both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server \u2014 and he dealt with the fallout from both. He became the acting F.B.I. director after the sudden firing of his boss, Mr. Comey, and he publicly contradicted the White House on national television over whether Mr. Comey had lost the support of rank-and-file F.B.I. agents.\nSince then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled him out for public attack, suggesting that he helped protect Mrs. Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. As evidence, he pointed to the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons.\nAs recently as Thursday, even as the White House said it left Mr. McCabe\u2019s fate in Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s hands, officials there left little doubt where the president stood. \u201cIt is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost the race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mrs. McCabe\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\n        \n        \n            Problem is that the acting head of the FBI  the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!        \n \u2014\n        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n        July 25, 2017\n    \n    \n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report faults Mr. McCabe for his candor in interviews with internal investigators. The report has not been released, but people briefed on it say the allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which revealed in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation.\nMr. McCabe, working through the F.B.I. press office, authorized a spokesman and a bureau lawyer to speak with The Journal in order to rebut allegations that Mr. McCabe had put the brakes on the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the article ultimately noted, Mr. McCabe had insisted that his agents had the authority to investigate the foundation, even if the Justice Department refused to authorize grand jury subpoenas.\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Mr. Comey groomed him for senior leadership from a young age, rankling some agents who saw him as too academic and not enough of a traditional crime-fighter. But senior F.B.I. officials and his counterparts in other agencies praised his intellect and ability to manage complicated worldwide national security issues.\n\n    \n                Katie Benner contributed reporting from Austin, Tex.\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n        Continue reading the main story", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Rosenberg", "body": "The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news.

They had much to celebrate.\n\nMr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama\u2019s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters\u2019 behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.\n\nThe group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.\n\nThen a chance meeting bought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.\n\nMr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America\u2019s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Bannon declined to comment.\n\nMr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.\n\nThe Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.\n\nWhen Mr. Wylie\u2019s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.\n\n\u201cITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Wylie\u2019s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.\n\nBut those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.\n\nMr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from the their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew \u2014 a claim that has been disputed.\n\nWhen the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs \u2014 more than $800,000 \u2014 and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.\n\nAll he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \u201ca very standard vanilla Facebook app.\u201d\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users \u2014 those who participated in the survey \u2014 had consented to having their data harvested.\n\nMr. Wylie said the Facebook data was \u201cthe saving grace\u201d that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted as much as we could get,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhere it came from, who said we could have it \u2014 we weren\u2019t really asking.\u201d\n\nMr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan\u2019s contributions as \u201cfruitless.\u201d\n\nJust as Dr. Kogan\u2019s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL\u2019s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie\u2019s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.\n\nBut in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.\n\nIn a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself \u201cfrom substantive management\u201d of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, \u201cto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.\u201d\n\nIn summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \u201cpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\u201d Mr. Nix \u201cnever had any strategic or operational role\u201d in an American election campaign, the company said.\n\nWhether the company\u2019s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees\u2019 roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.\n\nCambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.\n\nUnder the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.\n\nCambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm\u2019s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u2014 statements disputed by other campaign officials \u2014 but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.\n\nIn a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on \u201clegacy psychographics\u201d built for the Cruz campaign.\n\nBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former \u201ccontractors\u201d as engaging in \u201cwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\u201d\n\nNear the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \u201ccarefully investigating this situation\u201d and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.\n\nFacebook verified the leak and \u2014 without publicly acknowledging it \u2014 sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \u201cThis data was obtained and used without permission,\u201d said a letter that was obtained by the Times. \u201cIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and \u201cSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201d\n\nBut copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook\u2019s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.\n\nWhile Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.\n\n\n\nToday, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.\n\nAll the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political business. No American campaigns or \u201csuper PACs\u201d have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age \u2014 a \u201cMath Man,\u201d he puts it.

Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre,\u201d and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.\n\nBut those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,\u201d Gary J.

On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.\n\nThe president followed up with a pair of tweets singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.\n\n\u201cWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the former officials\u2019 criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump\u2019s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.\n\nIn one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)\n\n\u201cSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\u201d\n\nJeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were alarmed to see a president so intent on eroding the public\u2019s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump\u2019s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a very short distance between the president\u2019s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. Bash said. \u201cI think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.\u201d\n\nSome experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.\n\nHe said the former officials\u2019 willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.\n\n\u201cI would imagine from Bob Mueller\u2019s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,\u201d Mr. German said. \u201cThe credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.\u201d\n\nVicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, including Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.\n\n\u201cComey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,\u201d Ms. Divoll said, \u201cwho do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways.

The Bush administration declared the methods legal, and the view within the C.I.A. was that those who used the techniques were doing their jobs.\n\nAt the same time, many at the agency have little eagerness to see torture return. Where Ms. Haspel falls on the issue is not clear \u2014 as an undercover C.I.A. official, she was not offering public opinions on government policy \u2014 and neither she nor Mr. Pompeo could order agency personnel to resume the practice, because it is now against the law.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s decision to elevate Ms. Haspel is also likely to be seen by the C.I.A.\u2019s rank-and-file as a vote of confidence in their work from their new director, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the intelligence community throughout his campaign and in the months between his election and inauguration.\n\nThe open disdain with which Mr. Trump mocked the C.I.A., especially after intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia had tried to swing the election in his favor, had raised concerns at the agency of a repeat of the unhappy tenure of a former director, Porter J. Goss.\n\nMr. Goss took over the C.I.A. in 2004, when the agency was widely viewed as being at odds with the Bush administration over the Iraq war, and his marching orders were to end what the White House viewed as a campaign of leaks by insiders who opposed administration policies. He lasted only 13 months after his attempt to crack down on leaks drove many veterans out of the C.I.A.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Julie Turkewitz", "body": "Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state house this year.

A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.\n\nShe entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country\u2019s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.\n\nOn the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities \u2014 the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women \u2014 afflict other groups as well.\n\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,\u201d she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying \u201cHealthcare Not Warfare\u201d and \u201c\u00a1Ob\u00e1manos Nuevo M\u00e9xico!\u201d\n\nHer priority in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.\n\nShe faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.\n\nThe main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. \u201cThat as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,\u201d said Mr. Monahan.\n\nThe United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.\n\nThat began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.\n\nFacing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians launched a voting project that continues today.\n\nTo be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the U.S. population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.\n\nBut that is changing in some corners, and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.\n\nToday there are two native men in the U.S. House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma.\n\nAmong the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country\u2019s many missing and murdered native women.\n\nBut Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: \u2018I\u2019m qualified,\u2019 and everybody looks at you like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to prove it.

A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been. In May, Congress more than doubled the center\u2019s budget, providing an additional $19 million over its earlier budget of $14 million.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n        March 18, 2018\n    \n    \n\nMr. Trump, who admitted last week that he made up a claim in a meeting with Canada\u2019s prime minister and is considered honest by only a third of the American people in polls, stayed this weekend at the White House, where he evidently is spending time watching Fox News and stewing about the investigation.\nThe Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee has concluded that there was no systematic collusion between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and shut down its investigation, a decision that the Democrats on the panel objected to. The Senate Intelligence Committee is still actively investigating even as Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is.\nMr. Mueller has established that Russia tried to interfere in the election to benefit Mr. Trump and indicted three Russian organizations and 13 Russian individuals in the effort, although the indictment included no allegation that the president\u2019s campaign was involved. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration last week sanctioned those organizations and individuals.\nMr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. director\u2019s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision. Mr. McCabe, who backed Mr. Comey, was fired on Friday after being accused of not being candid with an inspector general about whether he authorized department officials to talk with reporters about the Clinton inquiry in 2016.\nThe president has repeatedly argued that Mr. McCabe was tainted because his wife ran for the Virginia State Senate as a Democrat in 2015 and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from an organization controlled by Terry McAuliffe, then the governor and a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jill McCabe lost the race, and Mr. Trump reportedly told Mr. McCabe that she was a \u201closer.\u201d\nMr. McCabe has characterized his firing as an attempt to impede Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, which beyond collusion is also focused on whether the president has attempted to obstruct justice by firing Mr. Comey. \u201cThis is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness,\u201d Mr. McCabe said on Friday.\n\n    \n                        Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt\n\n\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n        Continue reading the main story", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Landler", "body": "The White House said Tuesday it was not the place of the United States to question how other countries conduct their elections \u2014 a contention that runs counter to years of critical statements by presidents and other officials about elections in Russia and many other countries.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get to dictate how other countries operate,\u201d the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said. \u201cWe can only focus on the freeness and fairness of our elections.\u201d\n\nShe later railed against the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which could have affected the results in 2016.\n\nMr. Putin won with more than 76 percent of the vote. International observers said Russian electoral authorities counted the votes efficiently, but that several other factors prevented the contest from being fair.\n\n\u201cRestrictions on the fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression, as well as on candidate registration, have limited the space for political engagement and resulted in a lack of genuine competition,\u201d observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a report.\n\nSen. John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was quick to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s call to Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cAn American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement issued by his office. \u201cAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country\u2019s future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d\n\nThe White House pointed out that in March 2012, former President Barack Obama had a telephone conversation with Mr. Putin and congratulated him on his election victory at that time.\n\nOfficials in the Obama administration said there was lively debate about whether, and when, Mr. Obama should make that call. Mr. Obama waited several days before calling, prompting questions about whether he was going to snub Mr. Putin.\n\nAfter the 2012 election, the State Department issued a separate statement in which it said, \u201cThe United States congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the Presidential elections, and looks forward to working with the President-elect after the results are certified and he is sworn in.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Trump noted that Mr. Putin has expressed concern about the escalating arms race between the United States and Russia.\n\nHe noted that his administration was spending $700 billion to upgrade the American military, and said he would never allow Russia, or any other country, to approach its military might.\n\n\u201cWe will never allow anybody to have anything even close to what we have,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president said he and Mr. Putin would also discuss tensions in Ukraine, Syria and North Korea, among other issues.\n\nThe Trump administration issued a new nuclear policy last month that experts say will touch off a new kind of nuclear arms race \u2014 one based less on numbers of weapons and more on new tactics and technologies.\n\nThe White House vows to counter a rush by the Russians to modernize their forces even while staying within the limits imposed by an arms control treaty negotiated by Mr. Obama.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Frank Bruni", "body": "Shouldn\u2019t experience count in politics, too? And doesn\u2019t excitement about Winfrey for president or Nixon for governor have some relationship to disdain for professors who peddle inconvenient truths? Both responses elevate what\u2019s ideologically and emotionally pleasing over what makes the most sense. Both degrade the importance of experience.\n\nI know that politics isn\u2019t brain surgery (though Ben Carson clearly knows that even better). I also know that much of what\u2019s going on with Winfrey and Nixon \u2014 and what went on with Trump \u2014 is about the lazy deference to celebrities in these fame-mad times.\n\nWhen I asked Thomas Nichols, the author of \u201cThe Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters,\u201d to explain the acceptance of entertainers as political sages, he noted their treatment as all-purpose oracles, asking, \u201cWhy do people think they should take advice from Gwyneth Paltrow about steaming their vaginas?\u201d He was referring to an actual lifestyle tip that Paltrow dished out on her website Goop.\n\nMuch of what\u2019s going on also reflects cynicism about the status quo. \u201cIt is appalling that we are a country that has descended into a complete disregard for expertise,\u201d said Michael Specter, the author of \u201cDenialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives.\u201d \u201cBut is this a rejection of reality or a rejection of politics? To argue that actual politicians are useless, so let\u2019s try something else, is not completely insane.\u201d\n\nIndeed it\u2019s not. On top of which, many experiences other than lower-level government work can be useful, as Michael Bloomberg\u2019s New York mayoralty and Ronald Reagan\u2019s California governorship show. I\u2019d argue that Winfrey now has a sturdier claim on office than Reagan did when he ran for governor. But she would be aiming straight for the presidency. That\u2019s a bit much, as Trump has amply demonstrated.\n\nPlenty of Democrats accused Nixon of similar overreach. Christine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council, was among them. In a bizarrely worded comment to The New York Post, she called Nixon an \u201cunqualified lesbian\u201d who had failed to support her, a \u201cqualified lesbian,\u201d when she ran for mayor in 2013. Quinn later apologized for bringing sexual orientation into the discussion, but she isn\u2019t backing down from her assessment that Nixon\u2019s accomplishments as an actress and dedication as an activist aren\u2019t adequate credentials. Nor should she.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if I decided I wanted to be an actor,\u201d Quinn told me. \u201cI speak in public. I get my picture taken. I need to lose a little weight, but aside from that, why can\u2019t I do this? Because I can\u2019t. The years I might have spent developing skills in that area, I spent developing other skills.\u201d\n\nNichols, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, said that the downgrading of experience and devaluing of expertise can be explained partly by the internet, which allows people to assemble their own preferred information and affords them the delusion of omniscience.\n\nThe narcissism of our era also comes into play, he said. Feelings have been accorded as much currency as facts. No one can claim more or better feelings than anybody else. And so Nixon\u2019s empathy as a mother and frustration as a subway rider, to name two themes in her video, carry as much weight as a political veteran\u2019s legislative wrangling and budget balancing.\n\n\u201cAmericans have a tendency to look around and think, \u2018We are all peers now,\u2019\u201d Nichols told me. \u201cIt sounds lovely. Except that when you\u2019re up to your hips in water in the basement and you\u2019ve got a plumber standing there, you hand the wrench to him and say, \u2018O.K., maybe we\u2019re not peers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe mess of the Trump administration suggests where an insufficient respect for germane experience can lead. The president put Carson in charge of federal housing, Rex Tillerson in charge of diplomacy and Jared Kushner in charge of civilization itself. None of this panned out, but all of it was true to how Trump campaigned.\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018Oh, Trump doesn\u2019t have experts,\u2019\u201d he said at one rally. \u201cThe experts are terrible!\u201d He noted that critics wanted him to get an experienced foreign policy adviser. \u201cBut supposing I didn\u2019t have one, would it be worse than what we\u2019re doing now?\u201d Many voters thought not. He soon moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where he began the practice of hiring people based on their looks, their television profile and their quickness to flatter him. Credentials were a second or even fifth thought.\n\nIn the context of that cavalier attitude, it\u2019s reckless to embrace Nixon\u2019s candidacy as an intriguing experiment or colorful sidebar. While the political arena needs some fresh faces and demands many fresh ideas, there are entry points more appropriate than the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 the House of Representatives, for example, where the number of players and the availability of mentorship argue for a mix of newbies and old-timers and for a gallery of backgrounds both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAnd while Cuomo deserves fierce opposition, it would ideally come from someone who doesn\u2019t reinforce the notion that preparation is overrated. That\u2019s what Nixon\u2019s ambition does, and that\u2019s why I had the same reservations when Alec Baldwin was supposedly eyeing the New York City mayoralty. Genius in one arena doesn\u2019t guarantee competence in another.\n\nNor does experience, but it\u2019s the safer bet.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Marche", "body": "Mr. Ford, while much less addled than his brother was, has also been connected to Toronto\u2019s underbelly, where Rob Ford spent so much of his time as mayor. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported in 2013 that Mr. Ford sold drugs throughout the better part of the 1980s. (He has never been charged and denies the allegations.) Thirty years later, if elected his government would be responsible for implementing Ontario\u2019s new, legal recreational cannabis stores.\n\nOvernight, the election of Mr. Ford crushed the smugness Canadians have been feeling since their prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appointed a cabinet of 50 percent women and became the envy of enlightened progressives the world over. The deep-seated cultural and political alienation at the root of Trump and Brexit is in full force in Canada as well.\n\nMr. Ford is already a front-runner. One poll has the Progressive Conservatives at 47 percent support and the incumbent Ontario Liberal Party at 26 percent. The latter, having ruled since 2003, has nearly 15 years\u2019 worth of scandal to show for it. Rising inequality across the province, distaste for progressive rhetoric and the sense of a generalized corruption of politics as a whole is fueling, as elsewhere, a populism as inchoate as it is powerful.\n\nAnd from Italy to the Philippines to Canada, this cannibalizing populism is swallowing traditional Conservatism whole. Mr. Ford snuck through to the leadership on a voting system that ranked ballots. He won neither the popular vote nor the greatest number of constituencies. But the Progressive Conservative machine is behind him already. It operates on inherited loyalties, antipathy against scandal-plagued opponents, time-for-a-change sentiments and basic self-interest.\n\nIdeas were probably always somewhat irrelevant, so it hardly matters that the so-called Conservative parties aren\u2019t conservative anymore. Or rather, Conservatism itself has changed. The Conservatism of law and order, of common decency and of fiscal responsibility has been rendered null and void. After the last provincial election, which the Liberals won handily, Mr. Ford, then a Toronto city councilor, prescribed \u201can enema from top to bottom\u201d for the caucus he just inherited. The effluent is now lapping at his feet.\n\nThey may hope to change him. They won\u2019t. Already, Mr. Ford, who has never held a seat in the Legislature, is boasting about a historically large victory in the offing. His bragging has an all-too familiar ring stateside. To stand with Mr. Ford is to express rage \u2014 and this rage will take its customary atavistic forms.\n\nThe current premier, Kathleen Wynne, the first lesbian elected to the post, introduced a modernized sex-education curriculum to the province\u2019s public school systems. Just days after his election, Mr. Ford pledged to remove it, a policy that has support among some new immigrant communities, who tend to be more socially conservative.\n\nHe\u2019s also running the standard Ford playbook. Elites are people who sip \u201cChampagne with their pinkies in the air.\u201d (His family\u2019s label and packaging company is said to make tens of millions in annual sales.)\n\nHis infamous brother, when you get right down to it, was only the mayor of Toronto, which is not a very powerful position. Toronto\u2019s \u201cweak mayor\u201d system ensures that its leader only gets one vote on the city council. In Canada, it\u2019s actually the premier of a province who matters. His or her government regulates the schools and the public health care system. Do the people of Ontario really want a tin-pot northern Trump in charge of things that affect their daily lives? Canada\u2019s Constitution calls for \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d; it is hard to imagine anyone who could fulfill that mandate less.\n\nMr. Ford\u2019s sweep in as quiet and stable a place as Ontario points to a broader global crisis from which apparently there is no escape. Conservatism is no longer a political ideology in the recognized sense, but a repository of loathing and despair. It\u2019s where people thrust their hatred of modernity \u2014 of globalism and multiculturalism and technocratic expertise, but also of the democracy that fostered those systems in the first place. By giving high office to buffoons, by choosing thugs as their representatives and by reveling in nastiness for its own sake, the Conservative brand now is principally a marker of contempt for political order itself.\n\nConservatism has meant many things to many people around the world.

In a fit of rage, Mr. Bolton tried to have both reassigned.\n\nMr. Bolton also was accused of attempting to inflate the dangers of Syria\u2019s biological and nuclear weapons programs, by trying to sneak exaggerated assertions into speeches and congressional testimony before being called on it by intelligence officials. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage reportedly issued an extraordinary decree that required Mr. Bolton to clear all of his public utterances with Mr. Armitage himself.\n\nThen in 2002, during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Bolton helped orchestrate the removal of the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (which would win the Nobel Peace Prize more than decade later). His crime? Trying to send chemical weapons inspectors to Iraq. (Mr. Bolton said he was fired for \u201cincompetence.\u201d) Those inspectors might have debunked claims that Saddam Hussein retained a stockpile of chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear arsenal \u2014 the justification for the following year\u2019s invasion.\n\nMr. Bolton also accused a State Department subordinate of not sharing with him a cable about weapons inspections in Iraq. The same official had managed to delete some of the more extreme claims about Iraq\u2019s weapons programs from Mr. Powell\u2019s infamous presentation to the United Nations. Mr. Bolton ordered him removed from his duties, which State Department officials reportedly saw as an another instance of Mr. Bolton trying to marginalize dissent.\n\nMr. Bolton made it something of a habit to request the identity of American officials whose names had been blacked out of sensitive intelligence intercepts.

A recent study shows that firearms are now the third-leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 17 and, according to C.D.C. data, the leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. Numerous scientific studies indicate that keeping guns in a home endangers its residents. Studies have also shown that guns in the home are far more likely to be used in criminal assaults, homicides, suicides and accidental shootings than in self-defense.\n\nYet the law enables the gun industry to advertise its products as safety devices that consumers need to protect themselves and their families without fear of legal liability.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were massacred and hundreds more injured, lawsuits were filed against the companies that organized the concert, own the hotel and made and sold the bump stock device the killer used to increase the firing rate of his weapons \u2014 everyone but the companies that made and sold his guns. That is because the gun manufacturers and sellers have a weapon that is not available to the concert organizers and hotel owner \u2014 statutory immunity.\n\nThe N.R.A. claims that the act is necessary to protect gun manufacturers and sellers against unfounded lawsuits. Unlike cars, hammers, tobacco and alcohol, its argument goes, guns are intended to kill. But our legal system has multiple checks to filter out lawsuits that lack merit. There is no reason for the gun industry to have special protections that are unavailable to other businesses that sell products that pose far less risk of harm.\n\nOne element of the N.R.A.\u2019s argument is true: Guns are inherently dangerous. But there are proven ways to make them safer. One study found that more than 40 percent of accidental gun deaths could have been avoided if the gun was equipped with at least one safety feature. Because of the act, gun manufacturers have no incentive to include such features.\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, American Outdoor Brands, Smith & Wesson\u2019s parent company and the manufacturer of the weapon used in the Parkland shooting, announced that it would not \u201cmanufacture and market\u201d products with additional safety features (including trigger-locking technology) and that it does not \u201cinvest in R. & D. in this area\u201d because doing so would be \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Perhaps the repeal of the law would change this cynical narrative.\n\nGun sellers likewise enjoy broad immunity. They can sell dozens of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition to a single buyer who could resell them on the black market or plan a mass shooting without fear of legal accountability. Federal law requires only a perfunctory background check, and the employee handling the background form may be an untrained clerk. Without the threat of civil liability, gun sellers have no incentive to adopt more rigorous procedures or to provide training to their employees, which could stop a violent tragedy at the point of sale.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have introduced a bill to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases, or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n\nThe spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.\n\nOrganizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress.

Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets of the city.\n\nSecurity was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.\n\nIn towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,\u201d Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.\n\nAround the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.\n\nProtesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants \u2014 \u201cHey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,\u201d and waving signs with messages like \u201cA gun is not fun\u201d and \u201cAm I next?\u201d many made by high school students at an international school.\n\nAbout 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy.

I\u2019m here for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn this moment into a movement,\u201d Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. \u201cThey think we\u2019re all talk and no action.\u201d\n\nBut the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol \u2014 the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day.\n\nOne protester carried a sign that said \u201cIf the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.\u201d\n\nMost Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cWe applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.\u201d\n\nCity officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women walked through the streets on the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies.\n\nOn Saturday, officials with Metro, the region\u2019s subway system, said that more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the women\u2019s march.\n\nEven so, the streets of Washington were packed. Teenagers climbed on each other\u2019s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.\n\nEdna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: \u201cHe was in high school when he passed away.

The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.\n\nNaomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft \u201chi\u201d and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence.\n\n\u201cPeople have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It\u2019s not true.

Important witnesses have not been interviewed, and records have not been subpoenaed, including bank documents and certain communications that Democrats say are paramount to understanding the case.\n\nThe committee\u2019s final interview took place on Thursday with Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign manager.\n\nSeveral witnesses thought to be central to the investigation never came before the panel, including Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his deputy, Rick Gates, Mr. Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, and his campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, all of whom are under indictment by the special counsel.\n\nOthers, including George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates with ties to current and former Trump aides, only recently came to the committee\u2019s attention.\n\nMr. Conaway said he hoped to work expeditiously with American intelligence agencies to declassify the report and make it public. He also said the committee would consider any significant new evidence that may emerge in the case in the future.\n\nThe investigation comes to a close almost exactly year after it began.

Republicans have countered that Democrats on the panel have turned private proceedings into a television spectacle to earn political points.\n\nThe investigation had made little forward progress since December, committee members said. Only three witnesses have been brought in for questioning this year \u2014 a dramatic reduction in pace compared to earlier months.\n\nInstead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee spent a month locked in an extraordinary dispute over a secret Republican memorandum that accused top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials of abusing their powers to spy on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign advisers.\n\nRepublicans released the document over the objections of the Justice Department and the F.B.I., which warned in a rare public statement that it was dangerously misleading, and many used the document to argue that the entire Russia inquiry had been tainted by anti-Trump bias from the start.\n\nDemocrats eventually wrote and released their own counter-memo, drawn from the same underlying material, to rebut the Republican document.

The phone call reinforced that approach.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump didn\u2019t say to Mr. Putin was as significant as what he did say. He did not demand that Mr. Putin stop meddling in American elections or others, he did not even raise Moscow\u2019s role in the poisoning.\n\nHe made no mention of the unfair political system that deprives Russians of a real say in their government. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, later reinforced Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of interest, telling reporters it was not America\u2019s place to question how other countries conduct their elections.\n\nThe disparity between Mr. Trump and his advisers, who seem to take threats from Russia more seriously, is becoming more pronounced.\n\nA senior administration official told The Times that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t want to antagonize Mr. Putin because fostering rapport is the only way to improve relations between the two countries.

Nearly all insist they have no desire to wade into partisan politics, but are genuinely alarmed by what they see as Mr. Trump\u2019s fundamental disregard for the rule of the law and his impetuous approach to nation\u2019s security.\n\nSo Mr. Brennan\u2019s latest accusations on Wednesday quickly became fodder for news articles, social media conspiracy theories and hours of speculation on cable news channels.

He has been involved in nearly every key decision Mr. Trump has made \u2014 like the firing of the former F.B.I. director \u2014 that is being scrutinized by Mr. Mueller.\n\nAround the time Mr. Trump wanted to fire Mr. Mueller, the president\u2019s legal team, led then by his longtime personal lawyer in New York, Marc E. Kasowitz, was taking an adversarial approach to the Russia investigation. The president\u2019s lawyers were digging into potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mr. Mueller and his team, according to current and former White House officials, and news media reports revealed that several of Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors had donated to Democrats.\n\nMr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions. But for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, it reinforced the idea that, although Mr. Mueller is a Republican, he had assembled a team of Democrats to take down the president.\n\nAnother option that Mr. Trump considered in discussions with his advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and elevating the department\u2019s No. 3 official, Rachel Brand, to oversee Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since March, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.\n\nMr. Trump has significantly ratcheted back his criticisms of Mr. Mueller since he hired Mr. Cobb in July. A veteran of several high-profile Washington controversies, Mr. Cobb has known Mr. Mueller for decades, dating to their early careers in the Justice Department.\n\nHe advised Mr. Trump that he had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller, a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb\u2019s arrival, the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, not to fight him.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Trump has wavered for months about whether he wants to fire Mr. Mueller, whose job security is an omnipresent concern among the president\u2019s legal team and close aides. The president\u2019s lawyers, including Mr. Cobb, have tried to keep Mr. Trump calm by assuring him for months, amid new revelations about the inquiry, that it is close to ending.\n\nMr. Trump has long demonstrated a preoccupation with those who have overseen the Russia investigation. In March, after Mr. McGahn failed to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the inquiry, Mr. Trump complained that he needed someone loyal to oversee the Justice Department.\n\nThe former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Mr. Trump asked him for loyalty and encouraged him to drop an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Comey said he sidestepped those requests. He was soon fired.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times in the Oval Office in July, the president pointedly kept open the option of firing Mr. Mueller, saying that the special counsel would be passing a \u201cred line\u201d if his investigation expanded to look at Mr. Trump\u2019s finances.

Many more hope to organize networks and lay groundwork to vent their frustration \u2014 about pervasive school violence, and an unjust political system they view as enabling it \u2014 in the next vote for president in 2020.\n\nWhether the students of the post-Parkland movement become a disruptive force depends, in large part, on if they stay organized and register to vote. There is a big practical difference between tuning into politics and actually voting, political strategists and organizers say, and young people often vote at lower rates than older ones, especially in midterm elections.\n\nPage Gardner, president of Women\u2019s Voices Women Vote Action Fund, a Democratic-aligned group that focuses on mobilizing young people, minorities and single women, said the big question was whether teenagers\u2019 activism would translate into votes.

Having already reignited the political debate around guns, they believe they have the potential to bend the ideological and partisan lines of American politics more decisively as they join the electorate.\n\nLane Murdock, 15, a high school student in Connecticut who is organizing a wave of school-walkout protests on April 20, said the combination of the gun massacres and Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise win had jarred her out of political complacency.\n\n\u201cWe were raised to let the adults do the work,\u201d said Ms. Murdock, who is traveling to Washington to join the march there. \u201cWhen I was growing up and Obama was president, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to politics.\u201d\n\nShe called Mr. Trump\u2019s election a turning point: \u201cI think kids are frustrated that they really couldn\u2019t have a say.\u201d\n\nA number of the most prominent young activists from Parkland have already become familiar faces in Washington, and several arrived in the city early on Thursday to meet with students at Thurgood Marshall Academy, a school in Anacostia, a predominantly African-American neighborhood, to discuss gun violence.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who has been meeting regularly with high school-age activists, said they stood out from other groups in their scorn for the political status quo. Mr. Murphy, who became a fierce advocate for gun control after the murder of 20 children in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, said he had urged the students to dig in for a long fight, on a historic scale \u2014 \u201clike the Civil Rights movement or the anti-Vietnam War movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese kids are impatient,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, who at 44 is one of the Senate\u2019s youngest members. \u201cThis is a generation that is used to demanding immediate gratification, and they want it politically, too.\u201d\n\nThe March for Our Lives is likely to echo other mass demonstrations that have sprung up since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Like the Women\u2019s March, it is to be anchored in Washington with speeches from students from around the country, and complemented by satellite rallies in cities and towns as large as Los Angeles and as small as Pinedale, Wyo.\n\nThe National Park Service has approved a permit for the Washington march that estimates 500,000 people could attend, which would make it one of the most impressive displays of collective political will since the last presidential election \u2014 and the only one in which many or most of the participants have never been able to vote.\n\nMarchers like Madison Leal, however, are aching to start.\n\nMs. Leal, 16, a student from Stoneman Douglas, said she would hold a sign at the march bearing 17 blood-red hands and the message: \u201cHow many more?\u201d If elected officials do not act, Ms. Leal said, \u201cI\u2019m going to vote them out of office.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so is my entire generation,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be sorry then.\u201d\n\nAmong some participants, the determination to defy an indifferent political system mingles with a persistent fear of disappointment, and a cynicism not typically associated with youth. Dantrell Blake, 21, who was shot as a teenager in Chicago and plans to march in Washington, said he hopes to draw attention to gun violence in his hometown but knows that politicians could ignore the message. The mostly black victims of gun violence in Chicago, he said, had not drawn the attention of politicians the way the Parkland shooting did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still rigged and they\u2019re still going to do what they want,\u201d Mr. Blake said of elected officials.\n\nThose competing impulses \u2014 the drive toward political confrontation, entwined with skepticism that government will accommodate them \u2014 may come to define these students as voters. As a group, they combine liberal social beliefs with an intensely wary view of the existing political and economic order, opinion polls have found. While young people are not uniformly Democratic-leaning or supportive of gun regulation, they are well to the left of the middle in their views.

Over the following days, he released a barrage of vehement denials about the allegations from Ms. Zervos and nine other women, calling them fabrications, lies and hoaxes.\n\nMs. Zervos filed suit two months after the election, asserting she had been \u201cdebased and denigrated\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. She is represented by Ms. Wang and Gloria Allred, who has represented several women who have accused high-profile men of sexual wrongdoing.\n\nFrom the start, Ms. Allred made it plain that the goal of the suit, beyond economic damages, was to compel Mr. Trump to admit that he lied when he said Ms. Zervos fabricated her allegation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, led by Mr. Kasowitz, mounted a full-court defense, arguing the suit should be dismissed as meritless, or should be halted until Mr. Trump leaves office. Mr. Kasowitz argued that the courts have repeatedly interpreted the supremacy clause of the Constitution to mean a state court cannot exert control over a president while he is in office.\n\nJustice Schecter, however, said the United States Supreme Court ruling that allowed Ms. Jones to bring a sexual harassment suit against Mr. Clinton while he was in office made it clear that the president could be sued for unofficial conduct, though Ms. Jones\u2019s civil rights claim was in federal court.\n\nThe judge reasoned that \u201cthe rule is no different for suits commenced in state court\u201d as long as the suit concerns the president\u2019s unofficial conduct.

The official said that no one in the White House thought they were signing away their First Amendment rights.\n\nAnother said when aides sought to clarify whether they would be able to speak in specific instances \u2014 to fulfill a request from a congressional oversight committee, for example, or to field a question from a lawmaker \u2014 Mr. McGahn would reassure them they had wide latitude. Current and former officials said the agreement contained sweeping caveats stating that it was consistent with whistle-blower protections and other oversight and disclosure laws that apply to federal workers.\n\nAt the same time, lawyers in Mr. McGahn\u2019s office went out of their way to ensure that anyone who had access to particularly sensitive information at the White House signed a copy.\n\nOne official who had not been present for Mr. Priebus\u2019 initial request was later told by a White House lawyer that since he had been involved in many potentially controversial matters, he should probably sign the nondisclosure document, which he said he promptly did.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s White House has also broken with convention in trying to impose written nondisclosure agreements in other instances.

Mr. Broidy, 60, a longtime Republican donor and a vice chairman of the inaugural fund-raising committee, got his start in business as an accountant and then investment manager for Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell.\n\nMr. Nader, 58, a United States citizen born in Lebanon, had previously run a Washington-based journal called Middle East Insight, acted as an informal emissary to Syria under the Clinton administration, and, according to short biography in the emails, later worked for Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nThe two became fast friends, and by February, they were exchanging emails about potential contracts for Circinus with both the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, and also about Saudi and Emirati objectives in Washington, such as persuading the United States government to take action against the Muslim Brotherhood or put pressure on its regional ally, Qatar.\n\nEarly in the Trump administration, the two men also noted with approval a successful effort to block a top Pentagon position for Anne Patterson, a former ambassador to Cairo whom the Emiratis and Saudis have long criticized as too sympathetic to the deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood during his one year in office.\n\nIn one message to Mr. Nader in March 2017, Mr. Broidy referred to Secure America Now, an advocacy organization that he suggested had campaigned against Ms. Patterson, as \u201cone of the groups I am working with.\u201d The two people close to Mr. Broidy said he had not raised money for the group or campaigned against Ms. Patterson.\n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis have had particularly warm relations with the Trump administration. Mr. Trump at times has appeared to side with the Arab monarchies against his own cabinet secretaries \u2014 including in the bitter regional dispute against neighboring Qatar. Also in concert with the Saudis and Emiratis, Mr. Trump has taken a far more hawkish stance toward Iran than either his cabinet or his predecessor, threatening to \u201crip up\u201d the Iran nuclear deal brokered by President Barack Obama.\n\nOn March 25, Mr. Broidy emailed Mr. Nader a spreadsheet outlining a proposed Washington lobbying and public relations campaign against both Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. The proposed campaign\u2019s total cost was $12.7 million.\n\nThe two people close to Mr. Broidy said the plan was drafted by a third party for circulation to like-minded American donors, and that only some of its provisions were carried out.\n\nMr. Nader did, however, provide a $2.7 million payment to Mr. Broidy for \u201cconsulting, marketing and other advisory services rendered,\u201d apparently to help pay for the cost of conferences at two Washington think tanks, the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, that featured heavy criticism of Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nHudson Institute policies prohibit donations from foreign governments that are not democracies, and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies bars donations from all foreign governments, so Mr. Nader\u2019s role as an adviser to the U.A.E. may have raised concerns had he donated directly.\n\nDocuments show Mr. Nader\u2019s payment was made by an Emirati-based company he controlled, GS Investments, to an obscure firm based in Vancouver, British Columbia, controlled by Mr. Broidy, Xieman International. A person close to Mr. Broidy said the money was passed through the Canadian company at Mr. Nader\u2019s request and the reason for its circuitous path could not be determined.\n\nDocuments also appear to show that lawyers for Mr. Broidy discussed with him a possible agreement to share with Mr. Nader a portion of the profits from the first round of business his company did with the Saudis and Emiratis \u2014 an apparent reflection of his integral role in helping the company, Circinus, negotiate for the lucrative security contracts.\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Broidy said Mr. Nader \u201cis not a shareholder, officer, director or employee of any of my companies. He has not been paid any origination fee or any other fees in connection with these matters.\u201d\n\nMonths later, as Mr. Broidy was preparing for an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nader pressed him to try to line up a private meeting outside the White House between Mr. Trump and the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, whom he referred to as \u201cFriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him that Friend would like to come ASAP to meet you SOONEST out of official site, in New Jersey\u201d or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, Mr. Nader wrote to Mr. Broidy on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cAgain, Again and Again, please try to be the ONE to fix a date for Friend while you are there if at all possible,\u201d he added.\n\nSix days later, Mr. Broidy did just that, repeatedly pressing Mr. Trump to meet with the crown prince in a \u201cquiet\u201d setting outside of the White House \u2014 perhaps in New York or New Jersey \u2014 according to a detailed report on the meeting that Mr. Broidy sent to Mr. Nader shortly afterward. Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, blocked the request, Mr. Broidy reported.\n\nIn a memorandum to Mr. Nader about the Oval Office meeting on Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy reported that he personally urged Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Tillerson, whom the Saudis and Emiratis saw as insufficiently tough on Iran and Qatar.\n\nLater that fall, Mr. Nader complained that the Secret Service had stopped him from getting his picture taken with Mr. Trump at a fund-raiser. Although the reasons he was kept at bay from the president are unclear, Mr. Nader pleaded guilty in 1991 to a federal child pornography charge and served six months at a halfway house after videotapes were found in his luggage when he arrived at Dulles Airport outside Washington from a trip to Germany, according to court records released last week. In 2003, he received a one-year prison sentence in the Czech Republic after he was convicted there of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors, The Associated Press reported, citing a court spokeswoman.\n\nMr. Broidy was puzzled by the Secret Service\u2019s objections. Mr. Nader, in his capacity as an adviser to the ruler of United Arab Emirates, had met several times with senior administration officials in the White House during Mr. Trump\u2019s first weeks in office.\n\nMr. Broidy was apparently able to deliver: On Dec. 14, he emailed Mr. Nader his photograph grinning next to Mr. Trump.\n\nDespite the close relations between the White House and the two gulf nations, there have been occasional hiccups, and in January, Mr. Nader twice emailed his friend with another delicate request: The leader of the U.A.E. asked that Mr. Trump call the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to try to smooth over potential bad feelings created by the book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d by Michael Wolff. It portrayed the president\u2019s views of the Saudi prince in an unflattering light, Mr. Nader wrote.\n\n\u201cSee what you can trigger and do and we can discuss more in person,\u201d Mr. Nader wrote, reiterating once again the \u201cgenuine desire\u201d of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates to meet alone with Mr. Trump.\n\nDays later, Mr. Nader wrote to his friend that he was looking forward to an upcoming trip to the United States. Mr. Broidy was arranging for him to attend a gala dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Florida estate, to celebrate the anniversary of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the two men were considering a trip Saudi Arabia to try to sell the kingdom\u2019s young and powerful crown prince on a $650 million contract with Mr. Broidy\u2019s security company.\n\nBut those grand plans were interrupted. It was on that trip to the United States that, as he touched down at Washington Dulles International Airport, Mr. Nader was greeted by F.B.I. agents working for Mr. Mueller.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard Fausset", "body": "In Pennsylvania, distressed rust-belt cities like McKeesport and New Castle, once known for what they made, now find themselves turning to what they can grow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about bringing in anywhere from 100 to 150 jobs \u2014 for us, that\u2019s important,\u201d said Anthony Mastrangelo, the mayor of New Castle, a city of 22,000 near the Ohio border where a company called Holistic Farms has filled a vast warehouse with cannabis seedlings and grow lights.

On Wednesday, however, the licensing process was declared \u201cnull and void\u201d by a Little Rock circuit judge, who noted, among other things, that two commissioners had professional ties to owners of two other companies that had been picked. The Arkansas attorney general has appealed the ruling to the State Supreme Court.\n\nSuch challenges are common in state medical marijuana rollouts. The Bold Team owners declined to comment for this article, but Mr. Ryland said he was confident they would eventually be setting up shop. In its application, company officials said their facility would initially have 25 employees, some of them locally hired unskilled labor. The company also pledged to contribute 1 percent of its gross sales to the city budget.\n\nMr. Ryland, who moved back to Cotton Plant in 2010 after retiring from the United States Department of Agriculture, said that God had called him to fix Cotton Plant.

Toomey of Pennsylvania, a Republican. That bill died months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., after intense Republican opposition.\n\nMr. Trump repeatedly suggested that the dynamics had changed, in part because of his leadership in the White House, a sentiment that the Democrats in the room readily agreed with as they saw the president supporting their ideas.\n\n\u201cIt would be so beautiful to have one bill that everyone could support,\u201d Mr. Trump said as Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, sat smiling to his left. \u201cIt\u2019s time that a president stepped up.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Peter Baker", "body": "Mr. Lamb, 33, defied political geography and appeared on the verge of capturing the state\u2019s 18th District despite a torrent of Republican money and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal intervention.

Trump voters abandoned Mr. Trump\u2019s candidate in droves as Democratic enthusiasm appeared to overwhelm a part of the state that has long been a Republican stronghold. For the president, the vote is an ominous echo of Democratic victories in Virginia and Alabama, where his political efforts were shrugged off or counterproductive.\n\nThe tally was also a blunt rejection of the president\u2019s political calculation that tax cuts and steel tariffs would persuade voters in a region once dominated by the steel industry to embrace the Trump agenda on behalf of Mr. Saccone. \u201cSteel is back,\u201d he repeatedly said at the rally, apparently to little effect.\n\nA Republican victory in Pennsylvania might have helped deflect attention from the continuing collapse of the president\u2019s inner circle, which Tuesday included Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the forced resignation of Johnny McEntee, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest personal aides, who is under investigation for financial crimes and was marched out of the White House.\n\nInstead, Mr. Saccone\u2019s lackluster performance was a grim bookend for a day in which the president\u2019s trip to the Mexico-California border to view wall prototypes was completely overshadowed by the churning turnovers in his national security team.\n\nMr. Trump and Republican Party leaders had desperately sought to head off an outcome that was once thought of as politically impossible. Conservative groups spent more than $10 million in the hopes of defeating Mr. Lamb, who received similar help from Democratic politicians like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nA barrage of Republican advertisements condemned Mr. Lamb as a \u201cRubber Stamp for Nancy Pelosi,\u201d the Democratic leader in the House. One flier sent to voters showed Mr. Lamb firing an assault weapon, an attempt to weaken the Democrat\u2019s support among liberal voters. A deceptive video purported to show Mr. Lamb in a fight with labor unions.\n\nBut in recent weeks, polls in Pennsylvania consistently showed Mr. Saccone\u2019s popularity slipping, and Mr. Lamb gaining traction. Visits by Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials did little to buck up the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump arrived in Moon Township, Pa., for the rally, the race had tightened significantly, and many White House and Republican Party officials were already worried that he was lending his support to a lost cause.\n\nAs it turned out, they may have been right. During the rally, Mr. Trump called Mr. Saccone \u201can extraordinary person\u201d and dismissed Mr. Lamb as someone who should not be trusted by voters in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThe people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb, because he\u2019s not going to vote for us,\u201d Mr. Trump said.

In two cases, the bombs detonated when the victims picked them up; in the third, the package exploded after it had been carried inside and opened.\n\nMore than 500 federal agents are assisting the investigation from agencies including the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Many of the attacks have been solved by the authorities; they often stemmed from domestic disputes, and sometimes involved pipe bombs in packages wrapped like holiday presents.\n\nThe bombings in Austin have alarmed black leaders because the two people killed were African-American and the seriously wounded victim was a 75-year-old Hispanic woman. Law enforcement officials said that they did not have conclusive evidence that race played a role in the bombings, but that they were continuing to explore the possibility.\n\nInvestigators are examining connections between the two black victims, who both belonged to prominent African-American families. Officials said investigators were also looking into the possibility that the bomb that wounded the Hispanic woman may have been intended for someone else, but that nothing definitive had been established.\n\nChief Manley said on Sunday that the combined rewards offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case had been increased to $115,000 from $65,000.\n\nA concert featuring the Roots that was part of the South by Southwest festival in Austin was canceled on Saturday after the concert venue received a bomb threat in an email, the authorities said.

Green", "body": "Among the proposals outlined in the 56-page plan, obtained by The Times, was the consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Department of Labor.\n\nDepartment officials said they have since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most controversial part of the plan. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with President Trump\u2019s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency.\n\nLiz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that \u201cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that \u2014 a deliberative document not in final form,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization.\u201d\n\nThough the plan presents a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were presented in a 14-page presentation to employees in February shortly after the department\u2019s budget requests were released. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward disbanding the budget office. The decision was made over the opposition of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico.

She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff through attrition and buyouts.\n\nFor the most part, Ms. DeVos\u2019s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create a new Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees.\n\nThe proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Department of Labor. The department proposed to take over adult and unemployed worker programs run by the Labor Department, and to redirect the funding for those programs to federal Pell grants so that unemployed workers can enroll in higher education and vocational programs. The department would acquire an \u201cout-of-school youth\u201d program from the Labor Department, as well as a program that helps reintegrate ex-prisoners.\n\nDetails of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted all protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department\u2019s overhaul.\n\nMost notably, the contract cuts down the use of \u201cofficial time,\u201d which employees could use to do union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors.\n\nThe goal of the collective bargaining agreement, Ms. Hill said, \u201cis to treat all employees and the American taxpayers fairly.\u201d\n\nUnion officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as a grievance and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one.\n\n\u201cThis agency contends that their mission is so very important, but how can it be when they\u2019re creating a hostile work environment, where employees are coming and going and worried about what\u2019s going to happen to them on a daily basis?\u201d said Sharon Harris, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 252, which represents Education Department employees.\n\nThe union said the agreement came \u201cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,\u201d which concluded with the department\u2019s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started.\n\nThe department said the union failed to negotiate in good faith, ignoring multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blowing multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers.

Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who pledged to raise New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour, the impasse at the Port Authority dissolved. Even the agency\u2019s chairman, Kevin O\u2019Toole, a former Republican state legislator appointed by Mr. Christie, supports the mandated increase.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. O\u2019Toole said, \u201cThis board has heard the voices of airport employees who\u2019ve shared their stories with us over the years. We know that higher wages won\u2019t only make a difference to them personally, but will have a significant impact in workplace morale and productivity that will directly enhance the experience of the traveling public visiting our airports.\u201d\n\nMr. Murphy praised Mr. O\u2019Toole and the other commissioners for \u201cgetting to the right place.\u201d He said he considered the raises a matter of \u201ceconomic fairness and justice,\u201d particularly for eliminating the uneven pay scales in the two states.\n\nPaul K. Sonn, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project, said $19 an hour would be the highest targeted minimum wage in the country. He said airports on the West Coast had set a trend of higher pay to reduce instability and improve security that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would be catching up to.\n\n\u201cThe Port Authority has really been lagging, in part because Chris Christie was blocking action on this,\u201d Mr. Sonn said.\n\nUnder the proposal, the annual increases would begin Sept. 1. The first one would raise the minimum for workers at Newark Liberty to $12.45 an hour, from the Port Authority\u2019s current minimum wage of $10.45. Workers at the New York airports already are earning at least $13 an hour, which is the state-mandated minimum wage for large employers in the city.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s statewide minimum wage is only $8.60, which has left some workers at Newark earning $2.55 an hour less than their counterparts at La Guardia and Kennedy. By Sept. 1, 2019, that imbalance would end with the minimum wage at all three airports increasing to $15.60 an hour. After that, it would rise in three more steps, to $19 an hour on Sept. 1, 2023.\n\nThe targeted minimum of $19 an hour would be one of the highest in the nation. Since fast-food workers in New York City began a campaign a few years ago for a $15 minimum wage, that number has become a rallying cry for workers around the country.\n\nBut Hector Figueroa, the president of 32BJ Service Employees International, the influential union that represents several thousand of the airport workers, has set his sights higher. Last year, frustrated by the Port Authority\u2019s slow response to its demands, 32BJ and Unite Here, a union representing other airport workers, lobbied for legislation in Albany and Trenton that would have set an $18-an-hour minimum at the airports.\n\nThat effort failed, but once Mr. Murphy was elected, the unions returned to the Port Authority\u2019s monthly board meetings to press their demands.

And examples like the Tribute contract are causing lawmakers to raise questions about FEMA\u2019s handling of the disaster and whether the agency was adequately prepared to respond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating the contract, asked Representative Trey Gowdy, the committee chairman, to subpoena FEMA for all documents relating to the agreement. Lawmakers fear the agency is not lining up potential contractors in advance of natural disasters, leading it to scramble to award multimillion-dollar agreements in the middle of a crisis.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a bipartisan congressional investigation found that a failure to secure advance contracts led to chaos and potential for waste and fraud. Democrats asserted that FEMA was similarly inept preparing for this storm.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the Trump Administration\u2019s response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico in 2017 suffered from the same flaws as the Bush Administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005,\u201d wrote Representatives Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Stacey E. Plaskett, the nonvoting delegate from the United States Virgin Islands.\n\nIn November, The Associated Press found that after Hurricane Maria, FEMA awarded more than $30 million in contracts for emergency tarps and plastic sheeting to a company that never delivered the needed supplies.\n\nFEMA insists no Puerto Ricans missed a meal as a result of the failed agreement with Tribute. FEMA relied on other suppliers that provided \u201cample\u201d food and water for distribution, said William Booher, an agency spokesman.\n\nBut there is little doubt that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans struggled with access to food. The storm shut down ports on an island that imports about 85 percent of its food supply. Farms were flattened. Supermarkets lost electricity and could not find diesel to run their generators. The stores that opened using generator power could not offer much from their understocked shelves.\n\nPuerto Ricans depended heavily on emergency aid dispatched by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security has doled out more than $1 billion in contracts related to Hurricane Maria, which made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20.\n\nOn Oct. 3, FEMA awarded one of its largest food contracts to Tribute. For $5.10 each, the company agreed to provide 30 million ready-to-eat meals by Oct. 23.\n\nMs. Brown described herself in an interview as a government contractor \u2014 \u201calmost like a broker,\u201d she said \u2014 who does not keep employees or specialize in any field but is able to procure subcontracted work as needed, and get a cut of the money along the way. She claims a fashion line and has several self-published books, and describes herself on Twitter as \u201cA Diva, Mogul, Author, Idealist with scars to prove it.\u201d\n\nAfter Tribute\u2019s failure to provide the meals became clear, FEMA formally terminated the contract for cause, citing Tribute\u2019s late delivery of approved meals. Ms. Brown is disputing the termination. On Dec. 22, she filed an appeal, arguing that the real reason FEMA canceled her contract was because the meals were packed separately from the heating pouches, not because of their late delivery. Ms. Brown claims the agency did not specify that the meals and heaters had to be together.\n\nShe is seeking a settlement of at least $70 million. Her subcontractors, Cooking With A Star LLC, and Breedlove Foods Inc., have threatened to sue her for breach of contract, Ms. Brown said. Kendra Robinson, the caterer who runs Cooking With A Star, said she has about 75,000 meals her company prepared for FEMA sitting in an Atlanta warehouse.\n\nIn a statement, FEMA said it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment on a contract pending an appeal. But the agency noted it continues to provide meals to Puerto Ricans, despite an error by an agency spokesman last week that suggested the emergency aid would stop.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the contract termination there were ample commodity supplies in the pipeline, and distribution was not affected,\u201d said Mr. Booher, the agency spokesman. \u201cDuring the 2017 hurricane season FEMA sourced over 200 million meals through multiple vendors in order to support disaster response activities across multiple disasters.\u201d\n\nTribute has been awarded dozens of government contracts since 2013, including one in 2015 for $1.2 million in mattresses for the Defense Logistics Agency, which supports military combat troops, federal spending databases show. Tribute delivered the mattresses, according to the agency. The databases offer only a fragmented picture of federal contracts.\n\nThe government has also canceled Tribute contracts on at least five occasions.\n\nFour cancellations involved the Federal Prison System, which found that Tribute failed to deliver meat, bakery, cereal and other food products to various correctional institutions. A fifth termination involved the Government Publishing Office, which terminated a contract for 3,000 tote bags after Tribute failed to print the Marine Corps logo on both sides of the bags.\n\nAn investigation by the office\u2019s inspector general found that Tribute \u201caltered and submitted a false shipping document and subcontracted the predominant production function on two contracts without proper authorization,\u201d according to a 2015 report submitted to Congress.\n\nThe report did not name Tribute, but a Government Publishing Office spokesman confirmed that it was the Georgia company mentioned in the document. The office awarded Tribute 14 contracts totaling more than $80,000 from 2014-15, and the company \u201croutinely delivered late,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs a result of the botched tote-bag job, the Government Publishing Office prohibited the award of any contracts over $35,000 to Tribute until January 2019. But that exclusion applied only to that office, not to any other federal agency.\n\nTribute has had three indefinite contracts with FEMA for hygiene kits since 2013, but none of them have been activated.\n\nAsked about the cancellations, Ms. Brown offered explanations for each case, including that she had supplier trouble with the prison meals. She could have fought the Government Publishing Office on the tote bags contract, she said, but could not afford to at the time.\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee say Tribute\u2019s contract history should have given FEMA serious pause about awarding the company a huge food contract.\n\n\u201cClearly, Tribute did not have sufficient financial resources of its own to support this contract,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBased on Tribute\u2019s lack of experience in large-scale disaster relief and its limited financial capacity, FEMA should have raised serious questions about whether the company could meet the contract terms \u2014 especially since the contract concerned such a critical need.\u201d\n\nMs. Brown said she had no doubt she could have provided the 30 million meals, though she estimated she would have needed until at least Nov. 7 \u2014 two weeks past FEMA\u2019s deadline, and still an unlikely completion date, given Tribute\u2019s pace of delivery by the time the contract was canceled.\n\n\u201cThey probably should have gone with someone else, but I\u2019m assuming they did not because this was the third hurricane\u201d after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Ms. Brown said. \u201cThey were trying to fill the orders the best they could.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Peter Baker", "body": "Ms. Clifford filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday asserting that the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment was void because Mr. Trump never signed it.\n\nMs. Sanders said that the president had denied having an affair with Ms. Clifford or making the payment himself.

It also gives him the right to obtain an injunction barring her from speaking while disputes are considered in arbitration or open court. Those terms prompted Ms. Clifford to change her plans about going public, according to two people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to speak about it.\n\nMs. Clifford had suggested she was free to speak out after Mr. Cohen disclosed last month that he had arranged the payment, prompting her to claim that the contract had been breached.\n\nThe restraining order took her by surprise.

But Mr. Avenatti said he questioned its validity because it was brought on behalf of Mr. Cohen, not Mr. Trump.\n\nAsked if Ms. Clifford would drop her court case if Mr. Cohen provided her with more money, he said she would not. \u201cAt this point, we are well beyond that \u2014 this is a search for the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawsuit by Ms. Clifford adds weight to allegations in a separate legal complaint brought by Common Cause, a public interest group that has asked the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department to investigate the $130,000 payment by Mr. Cohen. Common Cause argues that the payment amounted to an undeclared in-kind contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFederal election law requires contributions and expenditures for a campaign to be promptly disclosed, and prohibits a candidate from dipping into campaign funds to cover personal expenses. There is no evidence that campaign money was used to make the payment.\n\nCommon Cause filed a similar complaint about a $150,000 payment made shortly before the election by American Media Inc., owner of The National Enquirer, to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy Playmate who has said she had an affair with a married Mr. Trump about a decade ago. The company dismissed the complaint as meritless.\n\nThe Enquirer never published a story about the alleged affair, and Common Cause asserts that if the payment was intended to keep Ms. McDougal quiet, it would be an illegal coordinated expenditure by a company on behalf of the Trump campaign.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael S.

They argue that the policies flout federal laws and help criminals evade deportation.\n\nAnd the Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country this year to provide documentation that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities, or receive a subpoena for the information. It is also exploring possible criminal charges for local politicians who enact sanctuary policies.\n\nThe lawsuit expected to be filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento is the first against a local or state government over its immigration policies filed by the Justice Department under Mr. Sessions. Department officials said that they would not rule out the possibility of other lawsuits against local governments whose policies interfere with the federal government\u2019s authority on immigration. Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont have state sanctuary laws, as do cities and counties in more than a dozen states, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe federal government says that three California laws, enacted over the past year, make it impossible for federal immigration officials to do their jobs and deport criminals who were born outside of the United States. The suit called the laws unconstitutional.\n\nOne, the California Values Act, strictly limits state and local agencies from sharing information with federal agents about criminals or suspects unless they have been convicted of a serious crimes. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, was the centerpiece of the state legislature\u2019s effort to thwart the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nSoon after the law was enacted, Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that the state should expect to see \u201c a lot more deportation officers\u201d and that elected officials who support the policy should be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThese politicians can\u2019t make these decisions and be held unaccountable for people dying. I mean, we need to hold these politicians accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers also passed the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, which prohibits local business from allowing immigration to access employee records without a court order or subpoena. Mr. Becerra warned that anyone who violates the new law would face a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nIn the state budget bill, California lawmakers prohibited new contracts for immigration detention in the state and gave the state attorney general the power to monitor all state immigration detention centers.\n\nThe state and several local governments including the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento have also set up legal defense funds to help defend immigrants during deportation proceedings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the Dreamers, hardworking immigrant families and law-abiding people who are just trying to make their way like the rest of us,\u201d Darrell Steinberg, the mayor of Sacramento, said earlier this year when asked about the state\u2019s sanctuary legislation. \u201cCivil disobedience is a respectful way to show your love for country.\u201d\n\nTensions between local and federal officials reached yet another crescendo as last week, when Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland publicly warned of coming large-scale immigration arrest operations. Mr. Homan compared the mayor to a \u201cgang lookout yelling, \u201cPolice!\u201d and said she gave people living in the United States illegally a chance to flee.

SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.\n\nA second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie\u2019s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.\n\nThough Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.\n\nMr. Nix, for his part, has long been adamant. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have business in Russia,\u201d he told TechCrunch last year. \u201cWe have no involvement in Russia, never have done.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Thomas L. Friedman", "body": "They each started by \u2014 metaphorically speaking \u2014 stealing a turkey. And when we didn\u2019t respond, they kept ratcheting up their wretched behavior to the point where Trump thinks he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and Putin thinks he could poison a wayward spy in London, and get away with it.\n\nTrump\u2019s turkey was his tax returns. During the campaign he promised to release them after the I.R.S. finished auditing him. Then, after he was elected, Trump said, sorry, not going to release them ever. And nothing happened. Trump, I am reliably told, has actually said to people close to him, \u201cCan you believe I got away with that?\u201d\n\nOnce Trump saw that he could get away with not disclosing his tax returns, he knew he could get away with anything. He knew that once he compromised the G.O.P., even its evangelical wing, into giving him a pass on his taxes, they\u2019d roll over for anything \u2014 sex with porn stars, endless lying, trashing the F.B.I., coddling Putin. Once you erase a big red line, it\u2019s hard to start enforcing others.\n\nAny Bedouin chief who watched the steady acceleration in the breadth and pace of Trump\u2019s lying \u2014 like his recent boast that he had fabricated a trade deficit with Canada in talks with Canada\u2019s prime minister or his dishonest statements to discredit Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 would tell you: Get me Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nBecause there must be something very important in them that he wants to keep hidden. Maybe it\u2019s just the embarrassment that he is not as rich as he claims, or, maybe, it\u2019s something more fundamental \u2014 like how dependent he is on Russian oligarchs for financing, so much so that Putin has leverage on him. Whatever the reason, though, when Trump saw he could get away with hiding them, he knew he could break any rule, tell any lie and violate any presidential norm \u2014 and he\u2019s done just that.\n\nPutin\u2019s turkey was even more serious. It was the shooting down of that Malaysian civilian airliner, Flight MH17, over Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people onboard.\n\nRemember the story? A Dutch-led international investigation \u2014 relying on, among other things, 150,000 intercepted phone calls \u2014 found that Putin\u2019s proxies in eastern Ukraine had requested that Russia send them an SA-11 surface-to-air missile launcher. And it was trucked over the Russian border into Ukraine, where it shot down that Malaysian airliner (probably mistaking it for a Ukrainian military plane) and then was trucked back to Russia hours later.\n\nPutin\u2019s military was up to its neck in this. Putin did not push the button on that missile, but he created the conditions for it to shoot down that plane \u2014 and he walked away from it as if the plane were brought down by lightning, making up one implausible story after another. He got slapped on the wrist with a few sanctions, but his complicity faded away into a mist of baldfaced lies.\n\nWho wanted to confront Russia, with all its gas exports to Europe and all its oligarchs throwing money around London or buying condos in places like \u2026 Trump Tower in New York? Putin surely also said to himself, \u201cCan you believe I got away with that? Why not poison a former Russian spy in London with a banned military nerve agent or perpetrate genocide in Syria? Who\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d\n\nTrump and Putin are cut from the same cloth. Their strategy is: keep pushing, keep grabbing, keep lying, keep denying, no matter how implausible the denials \u2014 and never apologize. Because when you lie on an industrial scale, it overwhelms everyone else. Normal people just don\u2019t behave that way, and the sheer shamelessness eventually exhausts them.\n\nThe lesson that the Bedouin chief was trying to teach his sons is that he could live his life without that turkey \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t live his life with what the stealing of his turkey with impunity implied: that when people keep eroding the norms of society, stealing \u2014 turkeys or the truth \u2014 eventually becomes the norm.\n\nThat steady erosion of norms is what Trump is doing to America and Putin is doing to the world. And if we let them get away with it, your kids won\u2019t just grow up in a different America, they\u2019ll grow up in a different world.\n\nI don\u2019t know what is sufficient to stop them, but I know what is necessary. American voters have to go to the polls and deal a resounding electoral defeat to this Republican Party, which Trump has taken over like an invasive species. America needs a healthy conservative party in our two-party system. But this G.O.P. is not a conservative party and it is not healthy.\n\nIt\u2019s an intellectually and morally corrupt coalition that sells its soul to whoever will energize its base and get G.O.P. candidates elected \u2014 deficit hawks one year, deficit doves the next; free traders one year, protectionists the next \u2014 whoever pays the most in votes or money gets to choose. Only a resounding defeat might get this G.O.P. to look itself in the mirror and ask, How did we lose our soul?\n\nAs for Putin, the only way to brush him back is with economic sanctions that truly hurt him and his corrupt clique of oligarchs, and an offensive cyber campaign that exposes just how much money they have all stolen from the Russian people.\n\nBullies like Trump and Putin are relentless. They will keep driving through red lights, smirking all the way, as long as we let them. But American voters can stop Trump, and America and its allies can stop Putin \u2014 if they act together. Then you won\u2019t see Putin or Trump smiling so much anymore.

But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles.\n\nPrecisely how Mr. Cruz came to possess the gun is not clear. But the authorities said the AR-15 rifle that Mr. Cruz used in the attack was purchased legally. \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\u201d said Peter J.

That would partly vindicate the adults\u2019 claims that things would be even messier without them. But it would also mean that, by protecting the country from the consequences of an unhinged president, they helped Trump consolidate his power while he learned how to transcend restraints.\n\nWhatever their accomplishments, if from their privileged perches these people saw the president as a dangerous fool in need of babysitting, it\u2019s now time for some of them to say so publicly.\n\nThis month, Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, published a scathing open letter to Powell. During her time in the administration, he wrote, she assured appalled onlookers that the adults were playing a stabilizing role: \u201cYou reached out to tell those of us on the outside you were saving us from a lot. You don\u2019t understand, friends of yours conveyed to all of us, how bad it is.\u201d Lovett wrote that he was skeptical of this argument but unable to dismiss it. The real test, he thought, would come when she and Cohn and others like them were no longer in the White House: \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t speak out because you had to stay, when you left, you had to speak out.\u201d\n\nOf course, unlike Omarosa Manigault Newman, who confessed horror at her former boss\u2019s presidency on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother,\u201d they haven\u2019t. Their defenders among anti-Trump Republicans say it\u2019s because some of them still have a role to play in staving off potential disaster. One Republican in regular contact with people in the White House told me that Powell and Cohn \u201cneed to protect their capacity to reach in and help manage in the event of any national crisis.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t find this entirely convincing. If these people see the administration as unequipped to handle an emergency, they owe the country a firsthand account of our vulnerability. But there is, at least, a certain logic to the argument made in their defense. That logic, however, only holds for those who remain on decent terms with Trump. Which means that if there\u2019s one person who has no excuse for not speaking out, it\u2019s Tillerson, once one of the most powerful private citizens in America, now humbled and defiled by his time in Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Tillerson holds Trump in contempt and disagrees with large parts of his agenda. After Charlottesville, Tillerson refused to say that the president\u2019s words represented American values. (\u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d he told Fox News.) In office, he struggled to save the Iran nuclear deal and opposed Trump\u2019s \u2014 and Jared Kushner\u2019s \u2014 support for a blockade of Qatar by other Arab states. After his ignominious firing, he gave a live address in which he didn\u2019t even mention the president\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cRex is never going to be back in a position where he can have any degree of influence or respect from this president,\u201d my Republican source said. Because of that, the source continued, \u201cRex is under a moral mandate to do his best to burn it down.\u201d That would mean telling the truth \u201cabout how concerned he is about the leadership in the Oval Office, and what underpins those concerns and what he\u2019s seen.\u201d\n\nIn this case, patriotism and self-interest point in the same direction. Before entering this administration, Tillerson was a vastly more respected businessman than Trump; as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, he presided over what The Times described as a \u201cstate within a state.\u201d Now the first line of his obituary will be about a year of abject failure as the country\u2019s lead diplomat, culminating in a humiliation fit for reality TV.\n\nThe only way he will ever change that is by joining those who would bring this despicable presidency down. If Tillerson came out and said that the president is unfit, and perhaps even that venal concerns for private gain have influenced his foreign policy, impeachment wouldn\u2019t begin tomorrow, but Trump\u2019s already narrow public support would shrink further. Republican members of Congress like Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, might be induced to rediscover their spines and perform proper oversight.\n\nLast year, Axios\u2019s Allen and Jim VandeHei half-jokingly called the insiders trying to circumscribe Trump the \u201cCommittee to Save America.\u201d Now the committee, having failed, is disbanding.

His friends and allies have said that he denies any wrongdoing in his dealings with journalists or the inspector general. He stepped down in January and took a leave of absence under pressure over the looming inspector general\u2019s report.\nMr. McCabe is a career agent, not a political appointee, so Mr. Trump has no direct say in his fate. The decision nonetheless comes at a moment of turnover in Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team. On Tuesday, the president fired the secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and named the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, to replace him. He tapped a veteran clandestine officer, Gina Haspel, to lead the C.I.A.\nFiring Mr. McCabe, even on the recommendation of the disciplinary office, would be controversial. Among Mr. McCabe\u2019s allies, the decision would raise the specter that Mr. Sessions was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent derisive comments. No deputy director in the history of the F.B.I. has been fired.\nBut Mr. Sessions would be able to point to a critical inspector general\u2019s report and say he followed Justice Department protocol. The details of why the inspector general viewed Mr. McCabe as not forthcoming are not clear. Though F.B.I. disciplinary records show that drunken driving, domestic violence and assaults have been punished by suspension, when agents are found to have shown a lack of candor under oath, they are commonly fired.\nThe inspector general, Michael Horowitz, announced last year that he would investigate several contentious decisions made at the F.B.I. and Justice Department during the 2016 presidential campaign. In November, Mr. Horowitz indicated that he planned to issue a single report this spring encompassing his entire review, on matters including the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\n\n\nThere are no indications that Mr. Horowitz is prepared to release a broad report this week. It is not clear why he opted to handle Mr. McCabe separately and refer him for discipline before the release of the full report. A spokesman for Mr. Horowitz has declined to comment.\nMr. Trump has attacked members of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for much of his first year in office. But few have been the target of presidential ire like Mr. McCabe. Mr. Trump has repeatedly remarked on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia. Her campaign received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor at the time and a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost the race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\n        \n        \n            Problem is that the acting head of the FBI  the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!        \n \u2014\n        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n        July 25, 2017\n    \n    \n\nIn meetings with Mr. McCabe, the president questioned how he had voted and needled him about his wife, calling her a \u201closer,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversations.\nThe precise allegations against Mr. McCabe will not be clear until the full report is released. But what is publicly known does not fit neatly into Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of Mr. McCabe as a Democratic operator. Mr. McCabe has described himself to friends as a lifelong Republican voter.\nThe allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which revealed in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation. The article said that the Justice Department would not authorize subpoenas in the case. Some F.B.I. agents, the article said, believed that Mr. McCabe had put the brakes on the investigation. Others rejected that notion.\nThe inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article. The public affairs office arranged a phone call to discuss the case, a common practice in the federal government when officials believe that a journalist has only part of the story.\nIn the Journal story, a person described as close to Mr. McCabe pushed back on the notion that he had tried to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the person described a tense conversation with the Justice Department in which Mr. McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to keep investigating.\nThe article was a negative one for the Clinton campaign \u2014 not Mr. Trump. It was published just days before the election, after the F.B.I. reopened its investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The article, including the F.B.I. disclosures, made it clear that some agents saw evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation that was worth investigating.\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Under the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, he ascended through several senior leadership jobs, and it was clear that he was being groomed for the bureau\u2019s No. 2 position. His rise angered some rank-and-file agents. But supporters viewed him as a sophisticated, intellectual choice for a job that has become an integral part of the nation\u2019s intelligence community.\nThe deputy director is the chief operations officer at the F.B.I., a job that requires managing relationships with the White House and Congress. That task became unusually difficult as agents investigated the Trump campaign, straining relationships with Mr. Trump. Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, criticized the F.B.I. for failing to do enough in that inquiry, while Republicans accused agents of drumming up an investigation based on shoddy evidence.\n        Continue reading the main story", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Mazzetti", "body": "It was unclear exactly what Mr. Gates might have to offer the special counsel\u2019s team, whether about Mr. Manafort or about other members of the Trump campaign.

Working inside the White House, Mr. Cobb oversaw the production of thousands of pages of documents and emails that were turned over to Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and said that the president should not assert executive privilege over the records to keep from slowing the process. The lawyers told the president they hoped to get Mr. Mueller to acknowledge by the end of the year that Mr. Trump was not a target of the investigation.\n\nAs it goes forward, Mr. Trump has questioned his lawyers\u2019 approach and clashed with them about whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller. The president believes he is his best spokesman and can explain to Mr. Mueller that he did nothing wrong. The lawyers see little upside.\n\nMr. Dowd and Mr. Sekulow became concerned about their standing with the president in the past two weeks after they learned Mr. Trump had met with another veteran lawyer, Emmet Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings, about joining the team.\n\nBoth publicly and privately, Mr. Trump tried to reassure his lawyers that they had not fallen out of favor with him. \u201cI am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter, assailing a New York Times article about his discussions with Mr. Flood. \u201cThey are doing a great job.\u201d\n\nMr. Dowd, in turn, called on the Justice Department over the weekend to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked. But according to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president\u2019s urging.\n\nMr. Dowd\u2019s statement set off a stream of negative coverage of Mr. Trump on cable television, to which he is closely attuned. His lawyers were criticized for being undisciplined, and Mr. Dowd\u2019s remarks prompted concern that the president was going to order that Mr. Mueller be fired. Mr. Cobb tried to douse that speculation on Sunday, saying that the president was not considering dismissing the special counsel.\n\nThe president\u2019s newest lawyer, Mr. diGenova, has worked in Washington legal circles for decades, including as a United States attorney for the District of Columbia appointed by President Ronald Reagan.

When the president makes a decision, he said, part of his job will be \u201cmaking sure the bureaucracies get the decision and implement it.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton criticized the frequent leaks out of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team, saying that a president cannot conduct diplomacy \u201cif some munchkin in the White House\u201d is leaking information to the press. \u201cLeaking of that sort is simply unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s appointment elicited mixed reviews. \u201cSelecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America\u2019s allies and bad news for America\u2019s enemies,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cHe has a firm understanding of the threats we face from North Korea, Iran and radical Islam.\u201d\n\nSenator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, however, said Mr. Bolton could lead the country to war. \u201cBolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Mr. Bolton toyed with running for president himself, only to back off. Instead, he created an organization to support like-minded candidates. His \u201csuper PAC\u201d was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which has found itself confronting a deepening crisis after reports this past weekend that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.\n\nThe firm was founded with a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor who has backed both Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC and Mr. Trump. Cambridge\u2019s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm\u2019s methods. The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC.\n\nUsing the psychographic models, the company designed advertisements from candidates supported by Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina. One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at fearful and neurotic voters \u2014 it emphasized security and the idea that Mr. Tillis could keep America safe.\n\nMr. Bolton also recorded a video used by a Russian gun rights group in 2013 to encourage Moscow to loosen gun laws, according to a report by NPR. The report said the video was part of an effort by Russian and American gun rights groups to collaborate in the years leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nA native of Baltimore, Mr. Bolton, 69, received undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University. In between stints in private practice, he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government, starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general.\n\nAfter the 2000 election, Mr. Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. After the Supreme Court halted the recount, resulting in Mr. Bush\u2019s victory, Dick Cheney, the new vice president, persuaded the incoming secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, to make Mr. Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control.\n\nMr. Bush later nominated Mr. Bolton for the United Nations post, but his confirmation was blocked in the Senate after key Republicans opposed him. Mr. Bush then gave him a recess appointment instead. He clashed regularly with Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Powell\u2019s successor as secretary of state, and eventually broke with Mr. Bush over what he saw as weak-kneed policies on North Korea and Iran.\n\nHe titled his memoir \u201cSurrender Is Not an Option,\u201d and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department\u2019s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the \u201cEAPeasers.\u201d He even went after Mr. Bush. \u201cNothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse,\u201d he wrote in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMr. Bush bristled and, in a private meeting with a group of conservatives, said, \u201cLet me just say from the outset that I don\u2019t consider Bolton credible.\u201d Other former colleagues fought back more publicly. Christopher Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for Mr. Bush, dismissed Mr. Bolton as \u201cPhyllis Schlafly with a mustache.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016, Ms. Rice and other Bush administration veterans like former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Stephen J. Hadley, the former national security adviser, privately warned against an appointment for Mr. Bolton.\n\nMr. Trump considered Mr. Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time. In the interim, Mr. Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr. Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagree.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter earlier this month that sanctions on Mr. Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher. \u201cIf you want to punish a country for behavior you don\u2019t accept, you need punishing sanctions that are broad, not targeted, and they need to be enforced,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a Journal column, he made the case for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea. \u201cGiven the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nHe likewise went on Fox News to disdain South Korea\u2019s willingness to negotiate with North Korea. \u201cThey\u2019re like putty in North Korea\u2019s hands,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the great international relations theorist P.T. Barnum put it, there\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201d Two days later, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea\u2019s Mr. Kim.\n\nAs he prepared to take on his new assignment, however, Mr. Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr. Trump. Asked on Fox on Thursday evening about the president\u2019s decision to congratulate Mr. Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham, Mr. Bolton said, \u201cI don\u2019t consider it a significant point one way or the other,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s a matter of being polite.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "The Editorial Board", "body": "Parents throughout the country live with the dread that the next lockdown at their child\u2019s school won\u2019t be a drill and that screams like those we heard on cellphones from classrooms at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School will come from their own child\u2019s classroom.\n\nThe terror that has gripped their elected officials, however, is fear of the wealthy gun lobby, to which they have let themselves be held hostage for decades.\n\nBut standing up to gun rights extremists and industry lobbyists can no longer be seen as an act of heroism that could lead to political suicide.

If a young black man grabs a white woman by the crotch, he\u2019s a thug and deserves to be roughed up by police officers. But if Donald Trump grabs a white woman by the crotch in a nightclub (as he\u2019s accused of doing, and denies), it\u2019s locker-room high jinks.\n\nThis view is also expressed by many of the president\u2019s staff members, supporters and prominent allies. During the same week that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, repeatedly vouched for Rob Porter\u2019s integrity, Mr. Kelly also mused that hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants who did not fill out the paperwork for DACA protections had refused to \u201cget off their asses.\u201d\n\nA political movement that rails against \u201cimmigrant crime\u201d while defending alleged abusers and child molesters is one that has stopped pretending to have any universalist aspirations.

James Hodgkinson, who opened fire last year on Republicans during their practice for an annual bipartisan congressional baseball game, had written anti-Trump and anti-Republican remarks on social media ahead of the attack.

Under the current map, Republicans hold 12 seats while Democrats hold five and are expected to pick up another when the result of a special election last week is certified.\n\nThe latest application was denied by the full Supreme Court without comment or noted dissents.\n\nIn a terse ruling in January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s congressional map, saying that it \u201cclearly, plainly and palpably\u201d violated the state\u2019s Constitution.

The advisers have also argued that on other matters \u2014 like the allegations that the president asked the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to end the investigation into the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn \u2014 the president acted within his constitutional authority and cannot be questioned about acts that were legal.\n\nOne of the few voices arguing for cooperating with Mr. Mueller is Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer whom Mr. Trump also brought on to deal with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Since Mr. Cobb was hired in July, he has argued that the White House should do everything possible to cooperate with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut Mr. Dowd has taken the lead on dealing with the special counsel about an interview and has been discussing the matter with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office since December.\n\nOthers close to Mr. Trump have also cautioned him against a freewheeling interview. Marc E. Kasowitz, the president\u2019s longtime personal lawyer from New York who initially dealt with the special counsel after Mr. Mueller took over the Russia investigation last May, has also consistently said that the president should not agree to the interview.\n\nChris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who led the presidential transition until just after the election, bluntly said last week that Mr. Trump should reject a request to be questioned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president of the United States, unless there are credible allegations \u2014 which I don\u2019t believe there are \u2014 should be sitting across from a special counsel,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nNewt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, echoed that advice.\n\n\u201cThe idea of putting Trump in a room with five or six hardened, very clever lawyers, all of whom are trying to trick him and trap him, would be a very, very bad idea,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said last month on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\n\nPresidents have often agreed to speak with federal prosecutors who are investigating their actions or those close to them. But Richard M. Nixon refused to turn over to the special prosecutor investigating him tapes of incriminating conversations with aides. The matter eventually went before the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1974 that the president, like every American, was not above the law and had to comply with the special prosecutor\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cThe upshot of the Nixon tapes case was that any president is going to have an extremely hard time resisting a request from a law enforcement officer,\u201d said Neal K. Katyal, an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration and a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells.\n\n\u201cIn general,\u201d he added, \u201cpresidents do sit for interviews or respond to requests from prosecutors because they take their constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws seriously, and running away from a prosecutor isn\u2019t consistent with faithfully executing the laws.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s penchant for bravado has been a factor that his lawyers must contend with. The president has bragged to some aides that he would be able to clear himself if he talked to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it, actually,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House last month, though he added, almost as an afterthought, that an interview would be \u201csubject to my lawyers, and all of that.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed, he also said he would be willing to be questioned under oath. Questioning by Mr. Mueller would not be under oath, though lying to federal investigators is a crime.\n\nDespite his penchant for exaggerations and falsehoods in public remarks, Mr. Trump has appeared far more aware of the legal risk of making false statements when he has been deposed in civil cases related to his businesses.\n\nIn one deposition related to a libel case that Mr. Trump brought against the journalist Tim O\u2019Brien, Mr. Trump admitted more than two dozen times under oath that he had lied in the past about a range of subjects. Mr. Trump ultimately lost the case.\n\nSince last summer, the White House has been in what Mr. Cobb has called \u201ctotal cooperation mode.\u201d He has issued few, if any, objections as Mr. Mueller\u2019s team interviewed senior White House officials and reviewed reams of emails and other internal documents. The White House was operating on a strategy that, since Mr. Trump had nothing to hide, full cooperation was the best chance to bring the investigation to a quick, decisive end.\n\nMr. Cobb had told the president and the public that the Mueller inquiry would be over by the end of 2017, or soon after. But a month into 2018, it remains unclear when Mr. Mueller will wrap up the bulk of his work.\n\nPrivately, people close to the president have conceded that assuring Mr. Trump that the investigation would end by a certain date was primarily aimed at keeping him from antagonizing Mr. Mueller on his Twitter feed or in interviews.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Buckley", "body": "BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s Communist Party cleared the way for President Xi Jinping to stay in power, perhaps indefinitely, by proposing that the nation\u2019s Constitution be changed to abolish a two-term limit on the presidency.\n\nThe Communist Party Central Committee, a council of senior officials from the ruling party, \u201cproposed to remove the expression that the President and Vice-President of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2018shall serve no more than two consecutive terms\u2019 from the country\u2019s Constitution,\u201d the Xinhua News Agency said on its English-language website.\n\nSince each term is five years in length, the Constitution had limited Mr. Xi, who became president in 2013, to 10 years in office.\n\nThe announcement was not immediately reported by Xinhua\u2019s Chinese-language service or other Chinese-language news media in China, a development that was all the more puzzling because the Central Committee is not due to meet until Monday.\n\nEven if prematurely announced, the move appears to be the most dramatic sign that Mr. Xi harbors ambitions to stay in power longer than his two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, both of whom stepped down after two terms.\n\nIt also confirmed that Mr. Xi has amassed enough power to rewrite the rules that constrained recent Chinese leaders, and that were aimed at preventing the reappearance of the cult of personality that had surrounded the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s founding father, Mao Zedong.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ben Hubbard", "body": "He has pushed to expand entertainment options and promised to let women drive in June.\n\nWhen asked if women were equal to men, Prince Mohammed said: \u201cAbsolutely.

The moves risk further isolating the United States at a delicate geopolitical moment by inflaming key allies, as well as China.\n\nThe effect of the China tariffs would be larger and more concentrated than the steel and aluminum measures and would have a bigger impact on United States consumers, who are heavy purchasers of electronics, clothing and other Chinese imports. The steel and aluminum tariffs would affect imports of roughly $33 billion, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures, said Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution. The China moves would affect at least $50 billion a year in imports, officials said.\n\nYet unlike the metal tariffs, which caused bitter divisions within the Trump administration and were opposed by many Republican lawmakers and business people, the technology moves against China are likely to be politically popular on Capitol Hill and throughout some industries.\n\nThe business community, which long defended China against accusations of theft of intellectual property, has grown more dissatisfied with adverse treatment in the Chinese economy. With the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises playing an ever-larger role in the market, the environment for American companies has steadily deteriorated.\n\n\u201cTheir theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better,\u201d said Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, referring to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration.\n\nThe country, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, has sought to build up businesses it considers critical for defending its national security interests and meeting its economic goals.\n\nBeijing has been enlisting American companies in its effort. As it looks to create its own national champions, China has been forcing American stalwarts like Qualcomm, Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to create joint ventures, hand over their technology or develop local expertise. If they do not, companies risk losing access to China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nBut China\u2019s national security interests are colliding with those of the United States. A worry is that companies are handing over critical technology that the United States needs for its military, defense or infrastructure. By transferring technology, they may also be giving an edge to Chinese rivals that one day may prove dominant.\n\nThis month, the United States government blocked Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for Qualcomm, a chip maker, citing national security concerns. The fear was that the acquisition would weaken Qualcomm, allowing China an advantage in the race to build the next generation of wireless technology.\n\nLast August, Mr. Trump ordered an investigation into four types of Chinese trade practices, including requiring companies to share trade secrets to gain access to the Chinese market, forcing them to license their technology in China at below-market rates and cyberintrusions to steal technology. China also uses state funds to buy American high-tech companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior official at the United States trade representative\u2019s office said the investigation, which is now complete, found ample evidence of abuses in all these areas. The official said China had not changed its behavior, despite years of negotiations in the World Trade Organization and economic dialogues with the last three administrations.\n\nIf anything, the administration said, its failure to honor the obligations it made when it joined the World Trade Organization has gotten worse. China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, officials said, contributed to its trade surplus of $375.2 billion with the United States last year. China has also introduced a plan to gain global leadership in advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace, among other industries.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to ask the United States trade representative to come up with a full list of products to retaliate against within 15 days, according to an official briefed on the plans.\n\nExperts worry that the United States\u2019 actions could ignite a trade war, noting that Chinese economic officials have a keen understanding of the American system and are good at designing targeted retaliatory measures against American agricultural products and other exports.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s moves will also test the personal relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Xi, the Chinese president. Last year, Mr. Trump held off imposing tough trade measures against China because, he said, Mr. Xi was cooperating in his campaign to pressure the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, over his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Mr. Trump agreed to meet Mr. Kim for talks, surprising Mr. Xi, whom he did not consult before making the decision. Now, Mr. Trump will be seeking the Chinese president\u2019s support for his diplomacy at the same time that trade tensions between are on the rise.\n\nStill, given their deep frustration, business executives may greet Mr. Trump\u2019s move with quiet satisfaction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s now palpable frustration across a number of sectors of the American business community feeling increasingly squeezed by an ever-more-emboldened China,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cWhile some are eager to continue seeking as much engagement with China as possible, others are openly using terms and invoking options they hadn\u2019t previously considered.\u201d\n\nThe United States\u2019 chief trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China.\n\n\u201cThere are certain technology products that are under assault,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cYou have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products.\u201d\n\nBut he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. \u201cYou would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lighthizer\u2019s testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. \u201cNobody wins from a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want a trade war.

Finding his life lacking in direction or purpose, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1953 and enrolled at the University of Georgia three years later, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s in history.\n\nIn 1954, he married Shirley Carver, who survives him, as do two sons, Murphy and Matthew; four grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nHe taught history and political science at Young Harris College and was elected mayor of Young Harris, serving in 1959 and 1960. He was then elected to two two-year terms in the State Senate. Next, he was executive secretary for Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia from 1968 to 1971. He was credited with exerting a moderating influence on Mr. Maddox, a segregationist, and spurring him to appoint blacks to his administration.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Mr. Miller spent 16 years as lieutenant governor under George Busbee and Joe Frank Harris, serving in that post longer than anyone else in Georgia history. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate seat in 1980, was elected governor in 1990 and re-elected in 1994.\n\nAs governor, Mr. Miller fought to have the Confederate battle emblem removed from the state flag, supported tough sentences for repeat criminal offenders and pushed legislation providing more money for public schools and scholarships for high school students. By the time he stepped down, after his second term, he was one of the most popular politicians in Georgia history.\n\nWhile in the Senate, Mr. Miller campaigned on behalf of Senator Max Cleland, a fellow Georgia Democrat, in Mr. Cleland\u2019s unsuccessful bid for re-election in 2002.\n\nYet as a former senator in 2008, Mr. Miller supported Senator Saxby Chambliss, the Republican who had unseated Mr. Cleland, asserting that Mr. Chambliss \u201ccould well be the last man standing between a far, far left liberal agenda sailing through the Senate.\u201d Mr. Chambliss won re-election.\n\nMr. Miller acquired the nickname \u201cZigzag Zell\u201d among some Democratic Party leaders.

Despite what many may think, the process is not simple nor is it quick, which led to my procrastinating for several years.\n\nOver the Republican primary season, I was an outspoken conservative critic of then-candidate Donald Trump, and a torrent of hate rolled my way. I would later learn just how much: The Anti-Defamation League named me one of the top 10 Jewish journalists to be attacked by the alt-right during the election season. After years of receiving death threats for my conservative views, months of being attacked by the alt-right and then having our address published online by the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, I pushed myself to finally go through the process of asking friends for letters attesting to my character, obtaining fingerprints and submitting to background checks.\n\nI was given a reason to feel that I needed to defend myself and my family. And I acted on it.\n\nIn the wake of every mass shooting, there are renewed calls for gun control, and a demonization of the National Rifle Association (of which I was but am no longer a member). We are told that it\u2019s not our guns \u2014 the guns of legal and responsible gun owners \u2014 that would be taken away, but those of the bad guys. But when those advocating bans don\u2019t even understand the mechanics and basic terminology of guns, it doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\n\nAll Americans should expect law enforcement agencies, which missed opportunities to stop not just the Parkland shooter, but also the shooters in the Charleston and Sutherland Springs churches and the Orlando nightclub, to be able to protect us. You can forgive conservatives if we don\u2019t believe that giving federal law enforcement officials more authority is the solution to shootings they bear some responsibility for.\n\nThat\u2019s, in part, why many gun owners insist the answer isn\u2019t a ban, but rather evaluating who can obtain these weapons. President Trump is now reportedly considering the idea of gun restraining orders, which have the ability to quickly take firearms away from those considered dangerous, like the shooter in Parkland. A variation of this law is already on the books in California. In 2016, 86 of these restraining orders were issued, and 10 were extended past the initial 21-day period they were granted for. Our side insists that people are the problem, not guns, and to make good on that we need to come to the table with ideas on how to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous individuals who have no business holding them.\n\nThis idea, popularized in a piece by National Review\u2019s David French after the Parkland shooting, isn\u2019t a panacea. But it is a middle ground for gun-rights supporters and gun-control activists to meet. Many supporters of the Second Amendment know something is broken, just as its opponents do, and ideas like Mr. French\u2019s can bring many more to the negotiating table than calling for outright bans on guns or the notion that there are no legislative solutions to the gun violence issue.\n\nBut such a compromise will require gun-control activists to confront the lie of one of their favorite talking points: that gun-rights supporters care more about guns than children.

For part 1, on the importance of voting, go here.\n\nThe modern American crusade against voter fraud has always been propelled by faith. That is, an insistent belief in things unseen \u2014 things like voters who show up at the polls pretending to be someone else, or noncitizens who try to register and vote illegally.\n\nFraud like this is so rare as to be almost unmeasurable, and yet its specter has led to dozens of strict new laws around the country. Passed in the name of electoral integrity, the laws, which usually require voters to present photo IDs at the polls or provide proof of citizenship to register, make voting harder, if not impossible, for tens of thousands of people \u2014 disproportionately minorities and others who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nThe high priest of this faith-based movement is Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate who has been preaching his gospel of deception to Republican lawmakers for years. He has won plenty of converts, even though he has failed to identify more than a tiny handful of possible cases of fraud. In his eight years as secretary of state, he has secured a total of nine convictions, only one of which was for illegal voting by a noncitizen; most were for double-voting by older Republican men.\n\nFor the past two weeks, however, Mr. Kobach has been forced to make his case in a far more rigorous setting \u2014 the fact-finding process of a federal trial. In a Kansas City courtroom, Mr. Kobach and his fellow true believers have struggled to defend a 2013 state law that requires prospective voters to prove their citizenship before they can register.\n\nIt has not gone well for Mr. Kobach. The lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Kansas residents who were blocked from voting under the new law, contends that the legislation violates federal law, which requires only that prospective voters attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. Meanwhile, it disenfranchised tens of thousands of Kansans, who were disproportionately younger voters or voters with no party affiliation.\n\nAnd how many noncitizens did the law stop from voting? Squint really hard. One would think that after all these years, Mr. Kobach would have something to show for his dogged efforts. Yet according to his own witnesses, Kansas, which has 1.8 million registered voters, has identified 129 noncitizens it says registered or tried to register since 2000. Of those 129 people, 11 actually voted, and it\u2019s not clear how many of these cases represent intentional fraud, as opposed to honest mistakes or clerical errors. But Mr. Kobach is convinced, calling these findings \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d If so, the iceberg is melting fast.\n\nMr. Kobach\u2019s game may work with partisan lawmakers, but not with federal judges. At the beginning of the trial, Mr. Kobach, who is representing himself, tried to introduce what he said were new data on the number of Kansans whose voter registrations were suspended for lacking proof of citizenship. Judge Julie Robinson of Federal District Court said no, reminding him that the deadline for introducing pretrial evidence had passed the night before. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a trial by ambush here,\u201d the judge said when Mr. Kobach tried again a few days later.\n\nHow does it feel to have your papers out of order, Mr. Kobach?\n\nOf course, restrictive voting laws like these have never been about protecting electoral integrity. They\u2019re about keeping certain people away from the ballot box, often based on who they are \u2014 or are assumed to be. On Tuesday, one of Mr. Kobach\u2019s witnesses, a political scientist, Jesse Richman, testified that up to 18,000 noncitizens have registered or tried to register in Kansas. When the A.C.L.U.\u2019s lawyer asked him about his methods for analyzing the state\u2019s list of suspended voters, Mr. Richman said that, among other things, he flagged foreign-sounding names. What about a name like \u201cCarlos Murguia,\u201d the lawyer asked. Would he flag that one? Yes, Mr. Richman said. He was then informed that Carlos Murguia is a federal district judge who sits in the courthouse where the trial is being held.\n\nIt all seems like a big joke until you remember that laws like these have already had their intended effect. In Kansas, more than 22,000 people who tried to register had their applications suspended or canceled for not having proof of citizenship. And in Wisconsin, which President Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes, a strict voter-ID law kept at least 17,000 voters from the polls in 2016.\n\nRemember also that just days after the 2016 election, Mr. Kobach scored a meeting with President-elect Trump in which he urged the passage of a nationwide proof-of-citizenship requirement. A few months later, Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Kobach to lead his so-called election integrity commission. In January, after months of futility and infighting, the commission folded, having made no findings and issued no recommendations. No surprise there \u2014 there\u2019s virtually nothing to find. There has been no epidemic of noncitizens voting, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless claim (endorsed by Mr. Kobach) that he lost the popular vote only because of millions of illegal voters. And there are hardly any examples of in-person voter fraud, the only kind that could conceivably be stopped by voter-ID laws. A federal judge once compared such laws to using \u201ca sledgehammer to hit either a real or imaginary fly on a glass coffee table.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the courts have not always brought the appropriate degree of skepticism to these laws. The Supreme Court upheld the first voter-ID law it considered, in 2008, even though the Indiana lawmakers who passed it had not identified a single case of fraud that the law would have prevented. Former Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote the opinion in that case, later called it a \u201cfairly unfortunate decision.\u201d Richard Posner, a former federal appeals court judge who also upheld the Indiana law, later said that voter-ID laws are \u201cnow widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.\u201d\n\nMore recently, courts have gotten better about questioning the evidence and rationale for these laws, striking down some of the strictest ones, in Texas and North Carolina, for deliberately discriminating against minority voters. That\u2019s the right approach. These laws masquerade as common-sense measures, but they are in truth anti-democratic shams, and it is gratifying to see them unravel in the harsh light of a federal courtroom.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard P\u00c9rez-pe\u00d1a", "body": "A package exploded early Tuesday at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, and local and federal law enforcement agencies were trying to determine whether the incident was linked to four recent bombings in Austin, Tex.\n\nThe latest explosion, in Schertz, Tex., occurred at about 12:30 a.m. local time, and injured one employee, who was not seriously hurt, local law enforcement officials said.

In 2016 Trump portrayed himself as a different kind of Republican, an economic populist who would stand up for the little guy. In practice, he has been utterly orthodox except for one thing, his willingness to break with free trade. And it\u2019s possible that he announced steel tariffs partly in an effort to swing a district in what used to be steel country. Or he may have been trying to steal Stormy Daniels\u2019s thunder. With Trump, you never know.\n\nAnyway, it didn\u2019t work, perhaps because many Pennsylvania voters realize that steel country isn\u2019t what it used to be, and the old days aren\u2019t coming back. These days there are about 10 times as many hospital workers as steel workers in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area \u2014 and surely at least some voters realize that G.O.P. efforts to slash health care threaten their jobs as well as their coverage.\n\nFinally, Republicans pulled out their old standby: trying to distract voters from their economic agenda by appealing to racial, cultural and religious enmity. That\u2019s what Ed Gillespie tried in the Virginia gubernatorial race, and in this latest campaign Saccone proclaimed that Democrats are motivated by \u201chatred for our country\u201d and \u201chatred of God.\u201d But it didn\u2019t work either time.\n\nWhy not? One answer may be that despite the eruptions of racism and anti-Semitism under Trump, America is on the whole a far more tolerant country than it used to be.\n\nBut there are also Trump-specific issues. It\u2019s hard for Republicans to pose as the party of patriotism while slavishly defending a man who holds office in part thanks to Russian intervention, and seems almost eager to demonstrate that he really is Vladimir Putin\u2019s puppet.\n\nAnd despite receiving overwhelming support from white evangelicals \u2014 which tells you something about the state of conservative Christianity \u2014 Trump is surely the least godly man ever to occupy the White House.\n\nSo the upset in Pennsylvania wasn\u2019t just a harbinger of likely Democratic gains to come.

History says that Republicans won\u2019t change course, because they never do.

In particular, regimes in trouble \u2014 like, say, the Argentine junta in the 1980s \u2014 often try to rally the public with dangerous foreign policy adventurism.

President Trump\u2019s tariffs and other trade actions mark the abandonment of a 70-year American effort to lead the world to a more open trade system.\n\n\u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win,\u201d Trump tweeted this month \u2014 an inane echo of Cheney\u2019s hubris about the Iraq war.\n\nThe second conflict that Trump is hurtling toward is with Iran. Unless he chooses some face-saving compromise, it looks as if Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal by May 12.\n\nThe risk is that Iran responds by restarting its nuclear program. This would lead to soaring tensions, the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran, a risk of Saudi-Iranian conflict and a danger of war between the United States and Iran.\n\nMike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of state, is very smart \u2014 and very hawkish on Iran. Moreover, Trump is considering replacing his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, with John Bolton, who is not a mere hawk so much as a pterosaur.\n\nThe final risk, of course, is a war with North Korea. We may have a reprieve for a couple of months if Trump\u2019s face-to-face with Kim Jong-un goes ahead, but I think Americans are too reassured by the prospect of a summit meeting.\n\nThe basic problem: There\u2019s almost no chance that North Korea will agree to the kind of verifiable denuclearization that Trump talks about. Then the danger is that if a summit collapses, there\u2019s no room to restart the process with lower-level diplomats. At that point, the risk of military conflict soars because all alternatives seem exhausted.\n\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s snap decision to accept Kim\u2019s invitation to meet underscores the risk of a mercurial president leaping into actions \u2014 which is one of the reasons we got into the mess in Iraq. The temptation to fire missiles at North Korea or Iran may also be particularly great for a president seeking to distract from a Russia investigation or an outspoken porn actress.\n\nThese fears of conflict aren\u2019t found just among Democrats but are broadly shared by many foreign policy analysts across the spectrum. Kori Schake, who worked in the Bush White House during the Iraq war, notes that Trump sometimes has spoken about North Korea the way Bush administration officials did about Iraq, and she adds: \u201cI worry that President Trump could lead to war on the Korean Peninsula or against Iran, or by miscalculation in a number of other places where adversaries misread his intent. The president considers his unpredictability advantageous, when it is more likely to have explosive consequences.\u201d\n\nLooking back, the biggest problem 15 years ago was that the administration was stuck in an echo chamber and far too optimistic, and Democrats and the news media alike mostly rolled over. Journalists too often acted as lap dogs, not watchdogs \u2014 and today I fear that we may be so busy chasing the latest shiny object that we miss an abyss ahead.\n\nI also frankly doubt that we as a nation have learned the lesson from Iraq.

In the case of Qatar, which is the host to a major United States military base, Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of an Emirati- and Saudi-led blockade against that country has put him openly at odds with his secretary of state \u2014 as well as with years of American policy.\n\nMr. Nader, 58, made frequent trips to the White House during the early months of the Trump administration, meeting with Stephen K. Bannon and Jared Kushner to discuss American policy toward the Persian Gulf states in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, according to people familiar with the meetings. By some accounts, it was Mr. Bannon who pushed for him to gain access to White House policymakers. Others said Mr. Kushner backed him.\n\nReached by phone last month, Mr. Nader said he had dinner guests and would call back. He did not, and attempts to reach him over several weeks were unsuccessful. Mr. Nader\u2019s lawyer did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Broidy said his memorandum had been stolen through sophisticated hacking.\n\n\u201cWe have reason to believe this hack was sponsored and carried out by registered and unregistered agents of Qatar seeking to punish Mr. Broidy for his strong opposition to state-sponsored terrorism,\u201d said the spokesman, Ron Bonjean, adding that Mr. Broidy had also made the accusation in a letter to the Qatari ambassador in Washington.\n\nYousef al-Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador to the United States, declined to comment. Axios first reported Mr. Mueller\u2019s questioning of Mr. Nader.\n\nMr. Nader has long been a mysterious figure. In the 1990s, he presided over an unusual Washington magazine, Middle East Insight, which sometimes provided a platform for Arab, Israeli and Iranian officials to express their views to a Washington audience.\n\nOn the magazine\u2019s 15th anniversary, in 1996, a West Virginia congressman praised Mr. Nader on the floor of the House, calling him a \u201crecognized expert on the region\u201d and pointing out that the magazine had been a showcase for prominent figures such as President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, and Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n\n\u201cHe always struck me as a person who really thought he should be in the eye of the storm trying to make things happen,\u201d said Frederic Hof, a former top American diplomat who knew Mr. Nader in the 1990s.\n\nLate in that decade, Mr. Nader convinced the Clinton administration that he had valuable contacts in the Syrian government and took on a secretive role trying to broker a peace deal between Israel and Syria. Working with Ronald S. Lauder, the American cosmetics magnate and prominent donor to Jewish causes, Mr. Nader shuttled between Damascus and Jerusalem, using his contacts in both capitals to try to negotiate a truce.\n\n\u201cIn the 1990s, George was a very effective under-the-radar operator in the peace process,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel and a member of a team put together by President Bill Clinton to negotiate peace deals between Israel and its neighbors.\n\nIndeed, a man with a once very public profile in Washington effectively vanished from the capital\u2019s policy scene, and his magazine ceased publication in 2002.\n\nDuring the middle part of the last decade, Mr. Nader appears to have spent most of his time in the Middle East, especially in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. He developed close ties to national security officials in the Bush White House.\n\nErik Prince, the founder of Blackwater USA, the private security company now known as Academi, at one point hired Mr. Nader to help the company generate business deals in Iraq. In a 2010 deposition that Mr. Prince gave as part of a lawsuit against the company, Mr. Prince described Mr. Nader as a \u201cbusiness development consultant that we retained in Iraq\u201d because the company was looking for contracts with the Iraqi government.\n\nMr. Prince said that Mr. Nader was unsuccessful in getting contracts, and that senior Blackwater officials did not work directly with him.\n\n\u201cGeorge pretty much worked on his own,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the beginning of the Obama era, Mr. Nader tried to parlay his ties to the Syrian government into access to senior members of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy team, while also seeking to advance business deals with former advisers to President George W. Bush.\n\nBy the time of the 2016 election, he had become an adviser to Prince Mohammed of the U.A.E. According to people familiar with the relationship, it was around Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration that Mr. Nader first met Mr. Broidy, the Republican fund-raiser, who is a California-based investor with a strong interest in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Broidy\u2019s security company, Circinus, that provides services to both United States agencies and foreign governments. Run by former American military officers, Circinus promises on its website that it \u201ccan employ personnel worldwide to provide physical force protection to individuals, groups or facilities within austere, hostile environments\u201d as well as conducting \u201cspecialized operations, infrastructure protection, and training.\u201d\n\nMr. Broidy, 60, had once stumbled into legal trouble over payments to a political figure. In 2009, he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for providing $1 million in illegal gifts to New York State pension authorities, including trips, payouts and a secret investment in a film called \u201cChooch\u201d that was produced by an official\u2019s brother. In exchange for the gifts, the state pension fund invested $250 million with an Israeli-based investment management firm that Mr. Broidy had founded. He reimbursed the pension fund for $18 million in fees.\n\nAfter the inauguration, Mr. Nader became friendly with Mr. Broidy and introduced him to Prince Mohammed. Circinus then signed contracts with the United Arab Emirates worth several hundred million dollars, according to people familiar with the arrangement.\n\nBy Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy had evidently become close enough to both the prince and Mr. Nader to send a detailed memorandum to an encrypted email address used by Mr. Nader recounting his advocacy on the U.A.E.\u2019s behalf during the meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office amid an afternoon of stops throughout the White House.\n\nAn ally of the White House involved in one of the initiatives discussed \u2014 a counterterrorism task force \u2014 said Mr. Broidy sent the memorandum because he had been asked by the crown prince to seek the president\u2019s views on the idea. Mr. Broidy believed that the creation of the task force would aid American security, this person said.\n\nAccording to the memo, Mr. Broidy repeatedly pressed Mr. Trump to meet privately with Prince Mohammed, preferably in an informal setting outside the White House.\n\n\u201cI offered that M.B.Z. is available to come to the U.S. very soon and preferred a quiet meeting in New York or New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Nader, using the crown prince\u2019s initials. \u201cPresident Trump agreed that a meeting with M.B.Z. was a good idea.\u201d\n\nMr. Broidy wrote that he had twice told Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that the crown prince \u201cpreferred an informal setting to meet one on one with President Trump.\u201d But General McMaster resisted. \u201cLTG McMaster smiled and replied that heads of state usually meet in the White House,\u201d as \u201cprotocol dictates.\u201d\n\nIn his memorandum, Mr. Broidy recounted that he had told Mr. Trump that he recently returned from meeting with the crown prince about Circinus work for the U.A.E. Mr. Broidy had explained \u201cthe exciting and transformational plan being constructed by M.B.Z. to develop a counterterrorism task force,\u201d which Mr. Broidy told the president was \u201cinspired\u201d by his speech at a conference in Riyadh.\n\nMr. Broidy was harshly critical of the crown prince\u2019s neighbor and nemesis, Qatar. The U.A.E. has accused Qatar, an American ally, of using its satellite network Al Jazeera to promote political Islam, among other allegations.\n\nMr. Broidy reported to Mr. Nader that he had told the president that Qatar was \u201ca television station with a country\u201d and that \u201cthe axis of evil was North Korea, Iran and Qatar.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also asked about the job performance of Mr. Tillerson \u2014 who had deviated from the president by publicly criticizing the isolation of Qatar \u2014 and Mr. Broidy said that the secretary of state should be fired.\n\nIn between the discussions of diplomacy, business and statecraft, Mr. Broidy wrote, he and the president \u201cspoke for several minutes about politics and the fund-raising efforts for the midterm elections as well as the state of affairs at the R.N.C.,\u201d or the Republican National Committee.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael S.

They had differed on policy, with General McMaster cautioning against ripping up the nuclear deal with Iran without a strategy for what would come next, and tangling with Mr. Trump over the strategy for American forces in Afghanistan.\n\nTheir tensions seeped into public view in February, when General McMaster said at a security conference in Munich that the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was beyond dispute. The statement drew a swift rebuke from the president, who vented his anger on Twitter.\n\n\u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, using his campaign nickname for Hillary Clinton. \u201cRemember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump selected General McMaster last February after pushing out Michael T.

He campaigned extensively with Mr. Trump and members of his administration and relied heavily on campaign spending from outside Republican groups that attempted to make Ms. Pelosi a central voting issue. Conservative outside groups also sought to promote the tax cuts recently enacted by the party, but found that message had little effect.\n\nYet at midday on Wednesday, Mr. Saccone trailed by just over 600 votes with only a handful of ballots yet to be counted. He has not conceded and could conceivably challenge the results through litigation. In a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the party\u2019s campaign committee, described the race as \u201ctoo close to call,\u201d according to a person who heard his presentation.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan and Mr. Stivers also called the election a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Republican lawmakers, telling them that they could not afford to fall behind on fund-raising, as Mr. Saccone did.\n\nMr. Lamb raised $3.9 million and spent $3 million, compared to Mr. Saccone\u2019s $900,000 raised and $600,000 spent as of February 21. But Republican outside groups swamped the district. Between conservative \u201csuperPACs\u201d and the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mr. Saccone had more than $14 million spent on his behalf.\n\nMr. Lamb got just over $2 million.\n\nAs Republican lawmakers spilled out of their morning conference meeting, few seemed willing to come to grips with how much Mr. Trump is energizing Democrats and turning off independent voters. Some of them even argued that Mr. Saccone only made the race close thanks to the president\u2019s rally in the district on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,\u201d said Mr. Ryan.\n\nOthers in the conference, however, talked more openly about the political difficulties of breaking with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is no benefit from running away from the president,\u201d said Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, a member of his party\u2019s leadership, noting that Republican candidates need core conservative voters to show up and this constituency still backs the president.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get them the same thing as Lamb opposing Pelosi,\u201d said Mr. McHenry.\n\nBut Mr. Lamb\u2019s margin and the turnout levels in the district\u2019s suburban precincts proved crucial, and a handful of Republican House veterans conceded this broader vulnerability.\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s probably where the president\u2019s appeal is the weakest,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime party strategist, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern we\u2019ve seen throughout.\u201d\n\nBut he argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity in high-income areas would not as adversely impact incumbents who have their own identity and are steeled for difficult races.\n\nYet even as most of the Republicans pinned the blame on Mr. Saccone\u2019s fund-raising weakness or held up Mr. Lamb\u2019s willingness to oppose Ms. Pelosi, refusing to fault Mr. Trump, one retiring lawmaker was more blunt.\n\n\u201cDenial isn\u2019t just a river in Egypt,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a frequent critic of the president. \u201cI\u2019ve been through wave elections before.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were buoyant as Mr. Lamb declared victory, viewing his upset as both a harbinger of a November wave and perhaps a sign that the party had overcome some of the most stinging Republican attack lines of the Obama years. Polling in both parties found Ms. Pelosi widely disliked among voters in the district, but the Republican ads featuring her failed to disqualify Mr. Lamb.\n\nPittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, said Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign showed that the Republicans\u2019 anti-Pelosi playbook had real limitations. The race, he said, should embolden Democrats to contest difficult districts in the Midwest with an economic message that appeals to elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cConor Lamb was talking about redevelopment and economic growth, and the Republicans were talking about Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t help themselves.\u201d\n\nMr. Peduto urged the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the electioneering vehicle for House Democrats, to expand its target list in the Trump-aligned Midwest.\n\n\u201cLook through the Rust Belt, in areas that used to be blue,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a congressional district that\u2019s 8, 10 or 12 points carried by Trump, I would hope that the D.C.C.C. is now putting that in the target.\u201d\n\nTo the extent that Democrats attempt further incursions into Trump country, it may test their party\u2019s willingness to tolerate Lamb-like deviation on matters like gun control, and perhaps more widespread rejection of Ms. Pelosi.\n\nDemocrats in Washington have already faced criticism from liberal activists for intervening in primary elections, in states like Texas and California, to promote candidates that they view as more electable. Putting forward a slate of moderates in Republican areas could prove more controversial than boosting just one in a special election.\n\nUp to this point, however, Democratic leaders and their campaign tacticians have taken a just-win approach \u2014 a far more permissive attitude than their Republican counterparts when it comes to Mr. Trump.\n\nClarke Tucker, a Democratic state legislator in Arkansas who is challenging Representative French Hill, a Republican, said on Wednesday that he took Mr. Lamb\u2019s victory as a validation of a throw-the-bums-out message he planned to deliver in his own race. Campaigning in a seat that comprises Little Rock and its suburbs, Mr. Tucker said he seldom spoke about Mr. Trump and announced up front that he would not back Ms. Pelosi.\n\nMr. Tucker, who was aggressively recruited by the D.C.C.C., said he had told Democrats in Washington that he was \u201cvery frustrated with the leadership of the House in both parties\u201d and no one attempted to dissuade him from delivering that message.\n\n\u201cThat district is a lot like the one I\u2019m running in,\u201d Mr. Tucker said of Mr. Lamb\u2019s seat. \u201cI think voters are interested in changing the leadership in Washington.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Liam Stack", "body": "A spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said those dollars would be used to support an independent candidate in the November general election.

At the time, Mr. Bolton said Iraqis would welcome American troops and the United States\u2019 military role would be over quickly as Iraqis exercised their new freedom from Saddam Hussein and established a democracy. It was the sort of simplistic and wrongheaded position he takes on most policies.\n\nMr. Bolton will replace H.R. McMaster, the three-star general who had cautioned against jettisoning the Iran nuclear deal without a plan for what came next, among other policy differences with the president. Mr. Bolton would be the third national security adviser in Mr. Trump\u2019s 14 chaotic months in office.\n\nWhile General McMaster never had a smooth time in the White House, Mr. Bolton already has a relationship of sorts with Mr. Trump since he has met with the president a number of times and is a commentator on Fox News, which the president spends much of his time watching.\n\nHe campaigned hard for the job, even after Mr. Trump previously rejected him for both that position and secretary of state, in part because the president didn\u2019t like his bushy mustache \u2014 seriously.\n\nThe national security adviser is the person who makes sure the president hears the views of all the national security agencies, including the State Department and Defense Department, and drives policy toward a decision. It is hard to see Mr. Bolton playing the honest broker. Mr. Bolton is known to play a ruthless inside game as he maneuvered to win bureaucratic battles and freeze out people he thinks crossed him. He has been such a lightening rod that he couldn\u2019t get confirmed as United Nations ambassador in 2005 so President George W. Bush gave him a recess appointment, and he stayed in the job about a year. It was considered unlikely that the Senate could have confirmed him as secretary of state, but the national security adviser job doesn\u2019t require confirmation.\n\nBringing on the fiery Mr. Bolton now, at a delicate moment with North Korea, is a terrible decision. While Mr. Trump has often threatened North Korea with military action, he accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to a summit, brokered by South Korea\u2019s president, who is eager for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis.\n\nMr. Bolton, by contrast, told Fox News earlier this month that talks would be worthless and has called South Korean leaders \u201cputty in North Korea\u2019s hands.\u201d On February 28, he insisted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that \u201cit is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nLast summer he wrote in the Journal, \u201cThe U.S. should obviously seek South Korea\u2019s agreement (and Japan\u2019s) before using force, but no foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nOn Iran, Mr. Bolton and the president are in sync, with both arguing that the United States should withdraw from the nuclear agreement by a May deadline. In March 2015, he argued in a New York Times op-ed that only military action like Israel\u2019s 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor \u201ccan accomplish what is required.\u201d\n\nGoing to war in either of these cases would not only create unnecessary bloodshed, it would be disastrous for the United States and its allies, South Korea and Japan. The Iran deal has substantially halted the nuclear program and needs to be maintained. Negotiations between the United States and North Korea, given a new impetus by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, needs to be tested.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s position on Russia, that NATO must have a strong response to the Kremlin-linked poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, is somewhat better than Mr. Trump\u2019s. But his rejection of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and endorsement of a book by the anti-Muslim activist Pam Geller are unacceptable positions for a top American official.\n\nMr. Bolton is certain to accelerate American alienation from its allies and the rest of the world.

Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters\u2019 behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.\n\nThe group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.\n\nThen a chance meeting bought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.\n\nMr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America\u2019s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Bannon declined to comment.\n\nMr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.\n\nThe Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.\n\nWhen Mr. Wylie\u2019s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.\n\n\u201cITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Wylie\u2019s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.\n\nBut those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.\n\nMr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from the their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew \u2014 a claim that has been disputed.\n\nWhen the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs \u2014 more than $800,000 \u2014 and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.\n\nAll he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \u201ca very standard vanilla Facebook app.\u201d\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users \u2014 those who participated in the survey \u2014 had consented to having their data harvested.\n\nMr. Wylie said the Facebook data was \u201cthe saving grace\u201d that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted as much as we could get,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhere it came from, who said we could have it \u2014 we weren\u2019t really asking.\u201d\n\nMr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan\u2019s contributions as \u201cfruitless.\u201d\n\nJust as Dr. Kogan\u2019s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL\u2019s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie\u2019s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.\n\nBut in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.\n\nIn a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself \u201cfrom substantive management\u201d of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, \u201cto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.\u201d\n\nIn summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \u201cpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\u201d Mr. Nix \u201cnever had any strategic or operational role\u201d in an American election campaign, the company said.\n\nWhether the company\u2019s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees\u2019 roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.\n\nCambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.\n\nUnder the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.\n\nCambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm\u2019s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u2014 statements disputed by other campaign officials \u2014 but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.\n\nIn a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on \u201clegacy psychographics\u201d built for the Cruz campaign.\n\nBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former \u201ccontractors\u201d as engaging in \u201cwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\u201d\n\nNear the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \u201ccarefully investigating this situation\u201d and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.\n\nFacebook verified the leak and \u2014 without publicly acknowledging it \u2014 sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \u201cThis data was obtained and used without permission,\u201d said a letter that was obtained by the Times. \u201cIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and \u201cSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201d\n\nBut copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook\u2019s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.\n\nWhile Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.\n\n\n\nToday, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.\n\nAll the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political business. No American campaigns or \u201csuper PACs\u201d have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age \u2014 a \u201cMath Man,\u201d he puts it.

Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a race to the bottom.\u201d\n\nThe president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.\n\nThe president followed up with a pair of tweets singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.\n\n\u201cWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the former officials\u2019 criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump\u2019s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.\n\nIn one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)\n\n\u201cSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\u201d\n\nJeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were alarmed to see a president so intent on eroding the public\u2019s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump\u2019s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a very short distance between the president\u2019s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. Bash said. \u201cI think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.\u201d\n\nSome experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.\n\nHe said the former officials\u2019 willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.\n\n\u201cI would imagine from Bob Mueller\u2019s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,\u201d Mr. German said. \u201cThe credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.\u201d\n\nVicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, including Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.\n\n\u201cComey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,\u201d Ms. Divoll said, \u201cwho do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways.

This messaging effort is separate from other potential government actions like cyberattacks.\n\nMr. Tillerson spent seven months trying to decide whether to spend any of the money. The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money.\n\nWith another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.\n\nAfter The New York Times, following a report on the issue by Politico in August, began asking about the delayed money, the State Department announced on Monday that the Pentagon had agreed to transfer $40 million for the effort, just a third of what was originally intended.\n\nState Department officials say they expect to receive the money in April.

But that money was largely obligated during the Obama administration, and the Trump administration has proposed slashing that assistance by more than half for the coming year, to $527 million, and to $491 million for the next year.\n\nWhile it waits for the funding transfer from the Pentagon, the center, which has a staff of around 60 people, including 23 contract analysts, will continue working on its original mission: countering jihadist and extremist propaganda.\n\nMost of the center\u2019s leaders are working in temporary assignments, a product of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s halt in promotions. The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services, the World War II predecessor to the C.I.A.\n\nThe analysts are divided into five teams that largely work in four languages: Arabic, Urdu, French and Somali. The analysts said in interviews that they had notched some significant victories, including a video montage proving that the Islamic State had itself destroyed Al Nuri Grand Mosque in Mosul, Iraq, and a widely seen cartoon in French depicting the miserable life of an Islamic State fighter.\n\nStill, these efforts are a small fraction of what Congress envisioned. A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been. In May, Congress more than doubled the center\u2019s budget, providing an additional $19 million over its earlier budget of $14 million. But by Jan. 1, the department had spent just $3.6 million of the additional $19 million, Mr. Goldstein said.\n\nJames K. Glassman, the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W.

Together, the comments raised the question once again about whether the president might be seeking to lay the ground to try to fire Mr. Mueller.\nThe shift in tone comes just days after The New York Times reported that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers met with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation, including the scope of his interest in the Trump Organization specifically.\nA president cannot directly fire a special counsel but instead can order his attorney general to do so, and even then has to give a cause like conflict of interest. Since Mr. Sessions, a former campaign adviser, has recused himself from the Russia investigation, to Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing aggravation, the job would then fall to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.\nBut Mr. Rosenstein has said as recently as last week that he sees no justification for firing Mr. Mueller, meaning that he would either have to change his mind or be removed himself. The third-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, decided last month to step down. The next official in line would be the solicitor general, Noel Francisco, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Mr. Bush.\nMr. Trump sought to have Mr. Mueller fired last June but backed down after his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit. The president told The Times a month later that Mr. Mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The White House made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the Trump Organization crossed that red line, but Mr. Trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful and deferential to the special counsel.\nJohn Dowd, the president\u2019s private lawyer, signaled the shift in approach in a statement given to The Daily Beast. \u201cI pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the F.B.I. Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier,\u201d Mr. Dowd said.\n\n\nWhen Mr. Mueller assembled his team, he surrounded himself with subject-matter experts and trusted former colleagues.

In particular, Republicans have seized on donations by Andrew Weissmann, who served as F.B.I. general counsel under Mr. Mueller, as an example of bias. Mr. Weissmann is a career prosecutor but, while in private law practice, he donated thousands of dollars toward President Barack Obama\u2019s election effort.\nIn his Sunday morning Twitter blasts, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe, who like Mr. Mueller are also longtime Republicans.\n\n\u201cWow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked \u2018have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cHe said strongly \u201cnever, no.\u201d He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.\u201d\nHe went on to dismiss reports that Mr. McCabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy F.B.I. director under Mr. Trump, just as Mr. Comey did.

The Senate Intelligence Committee is still actively investigating even as Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is.\nMr. Mueller has established that Russia tried to interfere in the election to benefit Mr. Trump and indicted three Russian organizations and 13 Russian individuals in the effort, although the indictment included no allegation that the president\u2019s campaign was involved. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration last week sanctioned those organizations and individuals.\nMr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. director\u2019s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision. Mr. McCabe, who backed Mr. Comey, was fired on Friday after being accused of not being candid with an inspector general about whether he authorized department officials to talk with reporters about the Clinton inquiry in 2016.\nThe president has repeatedly argued that Mr. McCabe was tainted because his wife ran for the Virginia State Senate as a Democrat in 2015 and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from an organization controlled by Terry McAuliffe, then the governor and a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jill McCabe lost the race, and Mr. Trump reportedly told Mr. McCabe that she was a \u201closer.\u201d\nMr. McCabe has characterized his firing as an attempt to impede Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, which beyond collusion is also focused on whether the president has attempted to obstruct justice by firing Mr. Comey. \u201cThis is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness,\u201d Mr. McCabe said on Friday.\n\n    \n                        Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt\n\n\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n        Continue reading the main story", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Landler", "body": "The White House said Tuesday it was not the place of the United States to question how other countries conduct their elections \u2014 a contention that runs counter to years of critical statements by presidents and other officials about elections in Russia and many other countries.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get to dictate how other countries operate,\u201d the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said. \u201cWe can only focus on the freeness and fairness of our elections.\u201d\n\nShe later railed against the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S.

I also know that much of what\u2019s going on with Winfrey and Nixon \u2014 and what went on with Trump \u2014 is about the lazy deference to celebrities in these fame-mad times.\n\nWhen I asked Thomas Nichols, the author of \u201cThe Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters,\u201d to explain the acceptance of entertainers as political sages, he noted their treatment as all-purpose oracles, asking, \u201cWhy do people think they should take advice from Gwyneth Paltrow about steaming their vaginas?\u201d He was referring to an actual lifestyle tip that Paltrow dished out on her website Goop.\n\nMuch of what\u2019s going on also reflects cynicism about the status quo. \u201cIt is appalling that we are a country that has descended into a complete disregard for expertise,\u201d said Michael Specter, the author of \u201cDenialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives.\u201d \u201cBut is this a rejection of reality or a rejection of politics? To argue that actual politicians are useless, so let\u2019s try something else, is not completely insane.\u201d\n\nIndeed it\u2019s not. On top of which, many experiences other than lower-level government work can be useful, as Michael Bloomberg\u2019s New York mayoralty and Ronald Reagan\u2019s California governorship show. I\u2019d argue that Winfrey now has a sturdier claim on office than Reagan did when he ran for governor. But she would be aiming straight for the presidency. That\u2019s a bit much, as Trump has amply demonstrated.\n\nPlenty of Democrats accused Nixon of similar overreach. Christine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council, was among them. In a bizarrely worded comment to The New York Post, she called Nixon an \u201cunqualified lesbian\u201d who had failed to support her, a \u201cqualified lesbian,\u201d when she ran for mayor in 2013. Quinn later apologized for bringing sexual orientation into the discussion, but she isn\u2019t backing down from her assessment that Nixon\u2019s accomplishments as an actress and dedication as an activist aren\u2019t adequate credentials. Nor should she.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if I decided I wanted to be an actor,\u201d Quinn told me. \u201cI speak in public. I get my picture taken. I need to lose a little weight, but aside from that, why can\u2019t I do this? Because I can\u2019t. The years I might have spent developing skills in that area, I spent developing other skills.\u201d\n\nNichols, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, said that the downgrading of experience and devaluing of expertise can be explained partly by the internet, which allows people to assemble their own preferred information and affords them the delusion of omniscience.\n\nThe narcissism of our era also comes into play, he said. Feelings have been accorded as much currency as facts. No one can claim more or better feelings than anybody else. And so Nixon\u2019s empathy as a mother and frustration as a subway rider, to name two themes in her video, carry as much weight as a political veteran\u2019s legislative wrangling and budget balancing.\n\n\u201cAmericans have a tendency to look around and think, \u2018We are all peers now,\u2019\u201d Nichols told me. \u201cIt sounds lovely. Except that when you\u2019re up to your hips in water in the basement and you\u2019ve got a plumber standing there, you hand the wrench to him and say, \u2018O.K., maybe we\u2019re not peers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe mess of the Trump administration suggests where an insufficient respect for germane experience can lead. The president put Carson in charge of federal housing, Rex Tillerson in charge of diplomacy and Jared Kushner in charge of civilization itself. None of this panned out, but all of it was true to how Trump campaigned.\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018Oh, Trump doesn\u2019t have experts,\u2019\u201d he said at one rally. \u201cThe experts are terrible!\u201d He noted that critics wanted him to get an experienced foreign policy adviser. \u201cBut supposing I didn\u2019t have one, would it be worse than what we\u2019re doing now?\u201d Many voters thought not. He soon moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where he began the practice of hiring people based on their looks, their television profile and their quickness to flatter him. Credentials were a second or even fifth thought.\n\nIn the context of that cavalier attitude, it\u2019s reckless to embrace Nixon\u2019s candidacy as an intriguing experiment or colorful sidebar. While the political arena needs some fresh faces and demands many fresh ideas, there are entry points more appropriate than the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 the House of Representatives, for example, where the number of players and the availability of mentorship argue for a mix of newbies and old-timers and for a gallery of backgrounds both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAnd while Cuomo deserves fierce opposition, it would ideally come from someone who doesn\u2019t reinforce the notion that preparation is overrated. That\u2019s what Nixon\u2019s ambition does, and that\u2019s why I had the same reservations when Alec Baldwin was supposedly eyeing the New York City mayoralty. Genius in one arena doesn\u2019t guarantee competence in another.\n\nNor does experience, but it\u2019s the safer bet.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Marche", "body": "Mr. Ford, while much less addled than his brother was, has also been connected to Toronto\u2019s underbelly, where Rob Ford spent so much of his time as mayor. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported in 2013 that Mr. Ford sold drugs throughout the better part of the 1980s. (He has never been charged and denies the allegations.) Thirty years later, if elected his government would be responsible for implementing Ontario\u2019s new, legal recreational cannabis stores.\n\nOvernight, the election of Mr. Ford crushed the smugness Canadians have been feeling since their prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appointed a cabinet of 50 percent women and became the envy of enlightened progressives the world over. The deep-seated cultural and political alienation at the root of Trump and Brexit is in full force in Canada as well.\n\nMr. Ford is already a front-runner. One poll has the Progressive Conservatives at 47 percent support and the incumbent Ontario Liberal Party at 26 percent. The latter, having ruled since 2003, has nearly 15 years\u2019 worth of scandal to show for it. Rising inequality across the province, distaste for progressive rhetoric and the sense of a generalized corruption of politics as a whole is fueling, as elsewhere, a populism as inchoate as it is powerful.\n\nAnd from Italy to the Philippines to Canada, this cannibalizing populism is swallowing traditional Conservatism whole. Mr. Ford snuck through to the leadership on a voting system that ranked ballots. He won neither the popular vote nor the greatest number of constituencies. But the Progressive Conservative machine is behind him already. It operates on inherited loyalties, antipathy against scandal-plagued opponents, time-for-a-change sentiments and basic self-interest.\n\nIdeas were probably always somewhat irrelevant, so it hardly matters that the so-called Conservative parties aren\u2019t conservative anymore. Or rather, Conservatism itself has changed. The Conservatism of law and order, of common decency and of fiscal responsibility has been rendered null and void. After the last provincial election, which the Liberals won handily, Mr. Ford, then a Toronto city councilor, prescribed \u201can enema from top to bottom\u201d for the caucus he just inherited. The effluent is now lapping at his feet.\n\nThey may hope to change him. They won\u2019t. Already, Mr. Ford, who has never held a seat in the Legislature, is boasting about a historically large victory in the offing. His bragging has an all-too familiar ring stateside. To stand with Mr. Ford is to express rage \u2014 and this rage will take its customary atavistic forms.\n\nThe current premier, Kathleen Wynne, the first lesbian elected to the post, introduced a modernized sex-education curriculum to the province\u2019s public school systems. Just days after his election, Mr. Ford pledged to remove it, a policy that has support among some new immigrant communities, who tend to be more socially conservative.\n\nHe\u2019s also running the standard Ford playbook. Elites are people who sip \u201cChampagne with their pinkies in the air.\u201d (His family\u2019s label and packaging company is said to make tens of millions in annual sales.)\n\nHis infamous brother, when you get right down to it, was only the mayor of Toronto, which is not a very powerful position. Toronto\u2019s \u201cweak mayor\u201d system ensures that its leader only gets one vote on the city council. In Canada, it\u2019s actually the premier of a province who matters. His or her government regulates the schools and the public health care system. Do the people of Ontario really want a tin-pot northern Trump in charge of things that affect their daily lives? Canada\u2019s Constitution calls for \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d; it is hard to imagine anyone who could fulfill that mandate less.\n\nMr. Ford\u2019s sweep in as quiet and stable a place as Ontario points to a broader global crisis from which apparently there is no escape. Conservatism is no longer a political ideology in the recognized sense, but a repository of loathing and despair. It\u2019s where people thrust their hatred of modernity \u2014 of globalism and multiculturalism and technocratic expertise, but also of the democracy that fostered those systems in the first place. By giving high office to buffoons, by choosing thugs as their representatives and by reveling in nastiness for its own sake, the Conservative brand now is principally a marker of contempt for political order itself.\n\nConservatism has meant many things to many people around the world.

In a fit of rage, Mr. Bolton tried to have both reassigned.\n\nMr. Bolton also was accused of attempting to inflate the dangers of Syria\u2019s biological and nuclear weapons programs, by trying to sneak exaggerated assertions into speeches and congressional testimony before being called on it by intelligence officials. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage reportedly issued an extraordinary decree that required Mr. Bolton to clear all of his public utterances with Mr. Armitage himself.\n\nThen in 2002, during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Bolton helped orchestrate the removal of the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (which would win the Nobel Peace Prize more than decade later). His crime? Trying to send chemical weapons inspectors to Iraq. (Mr. Bolton said he was fired for \u201cincompetence.\u201d) Those inspectors might have debunked claims that Saddam Hussein retained a stockpile of chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear arsenal \u2014 the justification for the following year\u2019s invasion.\n\nMr. Bolton also accused a State Department subordinate of not sharing with him a cable about weapons inspections in Iraq. The same official had managed to delete some of the more extreme claims about Iraq\u2019s weapons programs from Mr. Powell\u2019s infamous presentation to the United Nations. Mr. Bolton ordered him removed from his duties, which State Department officials reportedly saw as an another instance of Mr. Bolton trying to marginalize dissent.\n\nMr. Bolton made it something of a habit to request the identity of American officials whose names had been blacked out of sensitive intelligence intercepts.

He continues to denounce diplomacy and advocate military action when it comes to Iran and North Korea. Though he has advocated tough policies on Russia, he has also reportedly suggested that Vladimir Putin\u2019s effort to undermine the 2016 election was a false-flag operation orchestrated by the Obama administration.

A recent study shows that firearms are now the third-leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 17 and, according to C.D.C. data, the leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. Numerous scientific studies indicate that keeping guns in a home endangers its residents. Studies have also shown that guns in the home are far more likely to be used in criminal assaults, homicides, suicides and accidental shootings than in self-defense.\n\nYet the law enables the gun industry to advertise its products as safety devices that consumers need to protect themselves and their families without fear of legal liability.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were massacred and hundreds more injured, lawsuits were filed against the companies that organized the concert, own the hotel and made and sold the bump stock device the killer used to increase the firing rate of his weapons \u2014 everyone but the companies that made and sold his guns. That is because the gun manufacturers and sellers have a weapon that is not available to the concert organizers and hotel owner \u2014 statutory immunity.\n\nThe N.R.A. claims that the act is necessary to protect gun manufacturers and sellers against unfounded lawsuits. Unlike cars, hammers, tobacco and alcohol, its argument goes, guns are intended to kill. But our legal system has multiple checks to filter out lawsuits that lack merit. There is no reason for the gun industry to have special protections that are unavailable to other businesses that sell products that pose far less risk of harm.\n\nOne element of the N.R.A.\u2019s argument is true: Guns are inherently dangerous. But there are proven ways to make them safer. One study found that more than 40 percent of accidental gun deaths could have been avoided if the gun was equipped with at least one safety feature. Because of the act, gun manufacturers have no incentive to include such features.\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, American Outdoor Brands, Smith & Wesson\u2019s parent company and the manufacturer of the weapon used in the Parkland shooting, announced that it would not \u201cmanufacture and market\u201d products with additional safety features (including trigger-locking technology) and that it does not \u201cinvest in R. & D. in this area\u201d because doing so would be \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Perhaps the repeal of the law would change this cynical narrative.\n\nGun sellers likewise enjoy broad immunity. They can sell dozens of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition to a single buyer who could resell them on the black market or plan a mass shooting without fear of legal accountability. Federal law requires only a perfunctory background check, and the employee handling the background form may be an untrained clerk. Without the threat of civil liability, gun sellers have no incentive to adopt more rigorous procedures or to provide training to their employees, which could stop a violent tragedy at the point of sale.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have introduced a bill to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases, or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n\nThe spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.\n\nOrganizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the country\u2019s 435 congressional districts.\n\n\u201cThe mass shooting generation is nearing voting age,\u201d said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. \u201cThey know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.\u201d\n\nGun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment.\n\nOn the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that \u201cno one would know your names\u201d if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school.\n\n\u201cThese kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,\u201d he said in the video, adding: \u201cThe only reason we\u2019ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d\n\nSmall counterprotests took place in a few cities.

In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters gathered in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match. \n\n\n\nThe pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets of the city.\n\nSecurity was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.\n\nIn towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,\u201d Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.\n\nAround the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.\n\nProtesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants \u2014 \u201cHey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,\u201d and waving signs with messages like \u201cA gun is not fun\u201d and \u201cAm I next?\u201d many made by high school students at an international school.\n\nAbout 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: \u201cArms should be for hugging,\u201d \u201cBullets aren\u2019t school supplies\u201d and \u201cWaffeln statt Waffen\u201d (Waffles instead of weapons).\n\nOne of the largest rallies outside Washington took place at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed.\n\nAnthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, solemnly held a sign that said: \u201cMy sister could not make it here today. I\u2019m here for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn this moment into a movement,\u201d Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers.

Teenagers climbed on each other\u2019s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.\n\nEdna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: \u201cHe was in high school when he passed away.

Important witnesses have not been interviewed, and records have not been subpoenaed, including bank documents and certain communications that Democrats say are paramount to understanding the case.\n\nThe committee\u2019s final interview took place on Thursday with Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign manager.\n\nSeveral witnesses thought to be central to the investigation never came before the panel, including Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his deputy, Rick Gates, Mr. Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, and his campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, all of whom are under indictment by the special counsel.\n\nOthers, including George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates with ties to current and former Trump aides, only recently came to the committee\u2019s attention.\n\nMr. Conaway said he hoped to work expeditiously with American intelligence agencies to declassify the report and make it public. He also said the committee would consider any significant new evidence that may emerge in the case in the future.\n\nThe investigation comes to a close almost exactly year after it began. Then, Democrats and Republicans on the panel agreed on a four-part framework for the investigation and pledged to work \u201con a bipartisan basis\u201d to \u201cfully investigate all the evidence we collect and follow that evidence wherever it leads.\u201d\n\nBut the day-to-day reality of running a closely watched investigation potentially implicating a sitting president left the committee badly frayed. Democrats have accused Republicans of essentially blocking their path to the truth to protect Mr. Trump. Republicans have countered that Democrats on the panel have turned private proceedings into a television spectacle to earn political points.\n\nThe investigation had made little forward progress since December, committee members said. Only three witnesses have been brought in for questioning this year \u2014 a dramatic reduction in pace compared to earlier months.\n\nInstead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee spent a month locked in an extraordinary dispute over a secret Republican memorandum that accused top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials of abusing their powers to spy on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign advisers.\n\nRepublicans released the document over the objections of the Justice Department and the F.B.I., which warned in a rare public statement that it was dangerously misleading, and many used the document to argue that the entire Russia inquiry had been tainted by anti-Trump bias from the start.\n\nDemocrats eventually wrote and released their own counter-memo, drawn from the same underlying material, to rebut the Republican document.

The phone call reinforced that approach.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump didn\u2019t say to Mr. Putin was as significant as what he did say. He did not demand that Mr. Putin stop meddling in American elections or others, he did not even raise Moscow\u2019s role in the poisoning.\n\nHe made no mention of the unfair political system that deprives Russians of a real say in their government. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, later reinforced Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of interest, telling reporters it was not America\u2019s place to question how other countries conduct their elections.\n\nThe disparity between Mr. Trump and his advisers, who seem to take threats from Russia more seriously, is becoming more pronounced.\n\nA senior administration official told The Times that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t want to antagonize Mr. Putin because fostering rapport is the only way to improve relations between the two countries. On Tuesday, the president said he hoped to meet Mr. Putin soon and discuss preventing an arms race \u2014 an arms race both leaders have encouraged with loose talk and investment in new weapons.\n\nEngaging Russia and preventing an arms race are undeniably important.

That\u2019s not the approach Mr. Trump has taken with adversaries like North Korea or Iran, or, for that matter, even with some allies.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump panders to Mr. Putin, his criticism of Mr. Mueller, is becoming harsher, as the investigation raises increasingly serious concerns about a web of ties connecting Mr. Trump\u2019s associates to Russia.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with Russia. A former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with Russians. A former deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, who had his own Russian connections along with a now-indicted former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has pleaded guilty to lying about Russian-related matters.\n\nMr. Mueller has subpoenaed Mr. Trump\u2019s company for any documents involving Russia.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, slammed Mr. Trump, saying \u201can American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.\u201d Even the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who rarely crosses Mr. Trump, said calling Mr. Putin \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been high on my list.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Trump isn\u2019t Mr. Putin\u2019s lackey, it\u2019s past time for him to prove it.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Patricia Mazzei", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 Florida\u2019s nickname has been the \u201cGunshine State\u201d because of its decades-long efforts to loosen gun restrictions.\n\nBut on Friday, Gov.

Bush. Nearly all insist they have no desire to wade into partisan politics, but are genuinely alarmed by what they see as Mr. Trump\u2019s fundamental disregard for the rule of the law and his impetuous approach to nation\u2019s security.\n\nSo Mr. Brennan\u2019s latest accusations on Wednesday quickly became fodder for news articles, social media conspiracy theories and hours of speculation on cable news channels. And his remarks seemed to go beyond what he had said publicly in January 2017, five days before he stepped down as C.I.A. director, when he had said the dossier was \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and his criticism of Mr. Trump was relatively mild.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia\u2019s intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world,\u201d Mr. Brennan said then in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nBut later in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Brennan explained that his comments were speculation based on Mr. Trump\u2019s words and deeds, as well as how Mr. Putin\u2019s government has operated at home and abroad \u2014 but not on any inside knowledge.\n\n\u201cI do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail,\u201d he said in a written response to questions from The New York Times.\n\n\u201cWhen asked the question, I have pointed out the perplexing submissiveness of Mr. Trump toward Mr. Putin \u2014 despite continued evidence of malign Russian activities,\u201d Mr. Brennan added. \u201cI do not know why he refuses to call out Russia; that is a question that can only be answered by Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nAlong with Mr. Brennan, who is a paid contributor to NBC and MSNBC, other retired officials with contributor deals included James Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; Steven L.

He has been involved in nearly every key decision Mr. Trump has made \u2014 like the firing of the former F.B.I. director \u2014 that is being scrutinized by Mr. Mueller.\n\nAround the time Mr. Trump wanted to fire Mr. Mueller, the president\u2019s legal team, led then by his longtime personal lawyer in New York, Marc E. Kasowitz, was taking an adversarial approach to the Russia investigation. The president\u2019s lawyers were digging into potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mr. Mueller and his team, according to current and former White House officials, and news media reports revealed that several of Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors had donated to Democrats.\n\nMr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions. But for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, it reinforced the idea that, although Mr. Mueller is a Republican, he had assembled a team of Democrats to take down the president.\n\nAnother option that Mr. Trump considered in discussions with his advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and elevating the department\u2019s No. 3 official, Rachel Brand, to oversee Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since March, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.\n\nMr. Trump has significantly ratcheted back his criticisms of Mr. Mueller since he hired Mr. Cobb in July. A veteran of several high-profile Washington controversies, Mr. Cobb has known Mr. Mueller for decades, dating to their early careers in the Justice Department.\n\nHe advised Mr. Trump that he had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller, a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb\u2019s arrival, the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, not to fight him.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Trump has wavered for months about whether he wants to fire Mr. Mueller, whose job security is an omnipresent concern among the president\u2019s legal team and close aides. The president\u2019s lawyers, including Mr. Cobb, have tried to keep Mr. Trump calm by assuring him for months, amid new revelations about the inquiry, that it is close to ending.\n\nMr. Trump has long demonstrated a preoccupation with those who have overseen the Russia investigation. In March, after Mr. McGahn failed to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the inquiry, Mr. Trump complained that he needed someone loyal to oversee the Justice Department.\n\nThe former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Mr. Trump asked him for loyalty and encouraged him to drop an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Comey said he sidestepped those requests. He was soon fired.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times in the Oval Office in July, the president pointedly kept open the option of firing Mr. Mueller, saying that the special counsel would be passing a \u201cred line\u201d if his investigation expanded to look at Mr. Trump\u2019s finances. Mr. Trump said he never would have made Mr. Sessions the attorney general if he knew he was going to recuse himself from the investigation.\n\nLast month, as Republicans were increasing their attacks on the special counsel, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times that he believed Mr. Mueller was going to treat him fairly.\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me because I hope that he\u2019s going to be fair,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response to a question about whether it bothered him that Mr. Mueller had not yet ended his investigation. \u201cI think that he\u2019s going to be fair.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump added: \u201cThere\u2019s been no collusion.

Having already reignited the political debate around guns, they believe they have the potential to bend the ideological and partisan lines of American politics more decisively as they join the electorate.\n\nLane Murdock, 15, a high school student in Connecticut who is organizing a wave of school-walkout protests on April 20, said the combination of the gun massacres and Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise win had jarred her out of political complacency.\n\n\u201cWe were raised to let the adults do the work,\u201d said Ms. Murdock, who is traveling to Washington to join the march there. \u201cWhen I was growing up and Obama was president, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to politics.\u201d\n\nShe called Mr. Trump\u2019s election a turning point: \u201cI think kids are frustrated that they really couldn\u2019t have a say.\u201d\n\nA number of the most prominent young activists from Parkland have already become familiar faces in Washington, and several arrived in the city early on Thursday to meet with students at Thurgood Marshall Academy, a school in Anacostia, a predominantly African-American neighborhood, to discuss gun violence.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who has been meeting regularly with high school-age activists, said they stood out from other groups in their scorn for the political status quo. Mr. Murphy, who became a fierce advocate for gun control after the murder of 20 children in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, said he had urged the students to dig in for a long fight, on a historic scale \u2014 \u201clike the Civil Rights movement or the anti-Vietnam War movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese kids are impatient,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, who at 44 is one of the Senate\u2019s youngest members. \u201cThis is a generation that is used to demanding immediate gratification, and they want it politically, too.\u201d\n\nThe March for Our Lives is likely to echo other mass demonstrations that have sprung up since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Like the Women\u2019s March, it is to be anchored in Washington with speeches from students from around the country, and complemented by satellite rallies in cities and towns as large as Los Angeles and as small as Pinedale, Wyo.\n\nThe National Park Service has approved a permit for the Washington march that estimates 500,000 people could attend, which would make it one of the most impressive displays of collective political will since the last presidential election \u2014 and the only one in which many or most of the participants have never been able to vote.\n\nMarchers like Madison Leal, however, are aching to start.\n\nMs. Leal, 16, a student from Stoneman Douglas, said she would hold a sign at the march bearing 17 blood-red hands and the message: \u201cHow many more?\u201d If elected officials do not act, Ms. Leal said, \u201cI\u2019m going to vote them out of office.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so is my entire generation,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be sorry then.\u201d\n\nAmong some participants, the determination to defy an indifferent political system mingles with a persistent fear of disappointment, and a cynicism not typically associated with youth. Dantrell Blake, 21, who was shot as a teenager in Chicago and plans to march in Washington, said he hopes to draw attention to gun violence in his hometown but knows that politicians could ignore the message. The mostly black victims of gun violence in Chicago, he said, had not drawn the attention of politicians the way the Parkland shooting did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still rigged and they\u2019re still going to do what they want,\u201d Mr. Blake said of elected officials.\n\nThose competing impulses \u2014 the drive toward political confrontation, entwined with skepticism that government will accommodate them \u2014 may come to define these students as voters. As a group, they combine liberal social beliefs with an intensely wary view of the existing political and economic order, opinion polls have found. While young people are not uniformly Democratic-leaning or supportive of gun regulation, they are well to the left of the middle in their views. They have moved further toward Democrats since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\n\nNearly three-fifths of millennial voters \u2014 a group slightly older than the high school-age marchers \u2014 identify as Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center study. That figure is much higher among women and minorities.\n\nConservative supporters of gun rights have watched the teenagers\u2019 mounting activism with concern and skepticism. They have organized competing rallies this weekend in places that include Salt Lake City and Helena, Mont., but Bryan Melchior, 45, a Utah gun-rights activist, said he sees the \u201cgun community becoming more of a minority.\u201d\n\nMr. Melchior, who has been organizing a march in Salt Lake City, questioned the staying power of the Parkland movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change anything about our laws,\u201d Mr. Melchior said of the march on Washington. \u201cWhat I see is children that are just plain confused.\u201d\n\nJohn Della Volpe, a pollster who studies young people\u2019s political views for the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, said the gun issue was part of a larger array of social views that define the next wave of voters. While young people are largely liberal, Mr. Della Volpe said they were united chiefly by their dissatisfaction with the existing political system.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in this movement, in a raw form,\u201d said Mr. Della Volpe, who met this week with some of the Stoneman Douglas activists.\n\nAnd at least some of the students marching this weekend have already taken steps toward becoming voters.\n\nIn Colorado, Rachel Hill, 16, a junior at Columbine High School, the site of a deadly 1999 attack, said she came from a politically mixed family but when she recently signed up to vote \u2014 under a Colorado law allowing teenagers to register early \u2014 she had identified herself as a Democrat. Ms. Hill said guns were part of the reason, but so were issues like immigration, abortion and gay and transgender rights.\n\nMs. Hill, who led a walkout at her school to protest gun violence this month, said she plans to march at a rally at the Colorado capitol this weekend. And her aspirations have swerved toward politics for the long term, too: while she once dreamed of becoming an author or an archaeologist, Ms. Hill now hopes to be a member of Congress or an ambassador.\n\n\u201cI thought, well, Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he can get into politics and if he can get elected, why can\u2019t I?\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sopan Deb", "body": "Arts organizations around the country can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nOnce again, Congress has rebuffed President Trump\u2019s call to gut the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

What is more basic than protecting American democracy?\n\nIt is so obvious what Trump is up to: Again, he is either a total sucker for Putin or, more likely, he is hiding something that he knows the Russians have on him, and he knows that the longer Mueller\u2019s investigation goes on, the more likely he will be to find and expose it.\n\nDonald, if you are so innocent, why do you go to such extraordinary lengths to try to shut Mueller down? And if you are really the president \u2014 not still head of the Trump Organization, who moonlights as president, which is how you so often behave \u2014 why don\u2019t you actually lead \u2014 lead not only a proper cyberdefense of our elections, but also an offense against Putin.\n\nPutin used cyberwarfare to poison American politics, to spread fake news, to help elect a chaos candidate, all in order to weaken our democracy. We should be using our cyber-capabilities to spread the truth about Putin \u2014 just how much money he has stolen, just how many lies he has spread, just how many rivals he has jailed or made disappear \u2014 all to weaken his autocracy. That is what a real president would be doing right now.\n\nMy guess is what Trump is hiding has to do with money. It\u2019s something about his financial ties to business elites tied to the Kremlin. They may own a big stake in him. Who can forget that quote from his son Donald Trump, Jr. from back in 2008: \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets.\u201d They may own our president.\n\nBut whatever it is, Trump is either trying so hard to hide it or is so na\u00efve about Russia that he is ready to not only resist mounting a proper defense of our democracy, he\u2019s actually ready to undermine some of our most important institutions, the F.B.I. and Justice Department, to keep his compromised status hidden.\n\nThat must not be tolerated.

Most of those arrested, including Ms. Vashukevich, 21, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, are accused of working without a permit. Some are also accused of not having a valid Thai visa.\n\nMs. Vashukevich and Alexander Kirillov, the organizer of the sex seminar, spoke to three reporters while standing behind bars and a mesh screen during visiting hours at the Immigration Detention Center in Bangkok. Immigration officials stopped the interviews midway and told the reporters to leave the facility.\n\nMs. Vashukevich, wearing a bright green T-shirt with the word \u201cdetainee\u201d in Thai, is a long way from the days she spent sailing on a yacht with Mr. Deripaska and his friends, including Sergei E. Prikhodko, a deputy prime minister.\n\nAccording to her version of events, she was working for a modeling agency when she and several other models were sent to spend time on Mr. Deripaska\u2019s yacht. She later posted photographs and videos on social media showing Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko together on the yacht.\n\nFinancial records show that companies controlled by Mr. Manafort owed millions of dollars to Mr. Deripaska. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Manafort offered to give Mr. Deripaska private briefings on the campaign.\n\nMr. Navalny charged in his video that Mr. Deripaska\u2019s yacht trip was an attempt to bribe Mr. Prikhodko, and that Ms. Vashukevich was one of \u201cseveral\u201d prostitutes aboard the vessel. In the video, the tycoon and Mr. Prikhodko, the deputy prime minister, can be heard discussing Russian-American relations. The video also highlights a book she wrote titled \u201cWho Wants to Seduce a Billionaire.\u201d\n\nRussia has tried to block Mr. Navalny\u2019s video, which had nearly 6.4 million views on YouTube as of Monday. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska has said the allegations of bribery and prostitutes on the yacht were a \u201chot story that appears far from being the truth.\u201d\n\nIn the interview at the immigration center on Monday, Ms. Vashukevich said that she had often recorded conversations between Mr. Deripaska and his associates, and that she had 16 to 18 hours of recordings, including conversations about the United States presidential election.\n\n\u201cThey were discussing elections,\u201d she said. \u201cDeripaska had a plan about elections.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you everything.\u201d\n\nSome of the conversations were with three people who spoke English fluently and who she thought were Americans, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is not only about me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt concerns a lot of people in America and other countries.\u201d\n\nMs. Vashukevich and Mr. Kirillov, who also goes by the name Alex Lesley, are prominent on social media and are considered by some to be publicity seekers.\n\nMs. Vashukevich took part in a small protest in Moscow last year defending Harvey Weinstein after he faced numerous accusations of sexual abuse. Standing mostly naked near the American Embassy, she and four other women held signs with slogans such as \u201cHands Off Harvey\u201d and \u201cHarvey Weinstein Welcome to Russia.\u201d\n\nMs. Vashukevich said she arrived in Thailand on Feb. 16, and that she was only an observer at the sex seminar but did not work at the event.\n\nSeveral attendees said that no sex had been involved, and that the multiday training had focused on improving communication and on perfecting the art of seduction.\n\nThose who are taken to the immigration detention center are often on the verge of being deported. But an immigration official said that Ms. Vashukevich and five others taken to the center still face criminal charges for their part in the seminar. They will be sent back to Pattaya for court proceedings.\n\nMs. Vashukevich described being held in a crowded cell with more than 100 women and only three toilets. She said a Thai official had asked her to sign a paper saying that she believed she would be safe in Russia, but that she had refused.\n\nIn general, people seeking asylum must apply in the country where they hope to take refuge.\n\nA spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Bangkok said she was aware of the arrests but declined to discuss the case or any asylum request.\n\nMr. Kirillov said that he believed publicity would help protect them. \u201cI think the press makes us a little bit safer because if they killed us in the prison, everyone would know,\u201d he said.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jim Rutenberg", "body": "When Mr. Cohen brought a temporary restraining order seeking to silence Ms. Clifford in late February, he did so on behalf of a shell company he used to pay her through, not on behalf of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s name surfaced in one of two motions his legal team filed Friday in Los Angeles. One, in the name of the shell company, Essential Consultants, sought to move the suit to federal court from Los Angeles Superior Court, where Ms. Clifford filed the suit.\n\nThe second motion, filed on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, states that he joins Essential Consultants in seeking the change of venue and ends with the statement, \u201cMr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by the law.\u201d\n\nRepresenting Mr. Trump in his case was a new lawyer, Charles Harder, who is best known for bringing the Hulk Hogan sex tape case that effectively put the gossip news site Gawker out of business roughly two years ago. (Mr. Harder previously represented Melania Trump in a case against The Daily Mail.)\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s team filed the motions one day after news broke that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was planning to run a segment featuring Ms. Clifford and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, on March 25. Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives have denied the allegations that he had an affair with Ms. Clifford.\n\nMr. Avenatti responded late Friday that the president was engaging in \u201cbullying tactics\u201d aimed at moving the case \u201cbehind closed doors, outside of public view and scrutiny.\u201d\n\nHe seized on the monetary damages the president\u2019s team indicated it was seeking. \u201cThe fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20 million in bogus \u2018damages\u2019 against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is truly remarkable \u2014 likely unprecedented in our history,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said. He added, \u201cWe are not going away and we will not be intimidated by these threats.\u201d\n\nMs. Daniels and her lawyer have drawn a steady stream of intense news coverage since she filed her suit. Mr. Avenatti has appeared regularly on television to reveal new details about the effort to keep Ms. Clifford quiet during the presidential campaign, which culminated in the deal for her silence in October 2016.\n\nOn Friday, for instance, Mr. Avenatti said on the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe\u2019\u2019 that Ms. Clifford had been threatened with physical harm to stay silent about her story, though he did not say by whom or when. Speaking on \u201cNew Day\u201d on CNN, he said she would provide details on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d saying, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be able to provide very specific details about what happened here.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, Mr. Avenatti said that other women alleging involvement with Mr. Trump had approached his office, later adding that two of those women said they had signed nondisclosure agreements to maintain their silence. He said, however, that he had not vetted their claims.\n\nAsked about Mr. Avenatti\u2019s allegation relating to threats on Friday, the president\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said she had \u201cno knowledge\u201d about it, but \u201cobviously we take the safety and security of any person seriously.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week Mr. Avenatti revealed that Mr. Cohen had received help from a Trump Organization lawyer in initially seeking the restraining order against Ms. Clifford. That lawyer said she was working in a personal capacity and not on the company\u2019s behalf.\n\nMs. Clifford had told inTouch that her affair with Mr. Trump started in 2006 and lasted for several months. But her case came back into public view in October 2016, as she became concerned that the $130,000 she was promised would not come through.\n\nMr. Cohen told The New York Times earlier this year that he paid Ms. Clifford out of his own pocket, after The Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid through the shell company he created, in Delaware.\n\nThat payment is the subject of complaints that the watchdog group Common Cause filed with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice alleging it violated campaign finance rules.\n\nMs. Clifford\u2019s initial deal has struck legal experts for its onerous terms, including its provision that she would be responsible for \u201cliquidated damages\u201d of $1 million for each breach of the agreement.\n\nIn its motion, Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team indicates that it considers her liable for $20 million, for 20 breaches it did not detail.\n\nIn bringing Mr. Trump directly into the suit, his lawyer Mr. Harder appeared to be seeking to answer a key challenge from Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Avenatti, that in failing to sign the original deal, Mr. Trump was not bound by it.

He also had argued that Ms. Zervos was not held up to the level of ridicule or contempt necessary to prove defamation.\n\nJustice Schecter disagreed. She said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Ms. Zervos telling \u201cphony stories\u201d could be construed as defamatory, suggesting she \u201cis contemptible because she \u2018fabricated\u2019 events for personal gain.\u201d\n\nMs. Zervos\u2019s suit was being closely watched by other women who came forward during the presidential race with accusations against Mr. Trump. Some have said they would be willing to give depositions in the case.\n\nDuring the campaign, more than 10 women made allegations against Mr. Trump ranging from unwanted touching to sexual assault. Most of them spoke out after the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording on which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent.\n\n\u201cThe rule of law and sound reason have prevailed today,\u201d one of Ms. Zervos\u2019s lawyers, Mariann Wang, said. \u201cWe are grateful for the opportunity to prove that that defendant falsely branded Ms. Zervos a phony for telling the truth about his unwanted sexual groping.\u201d\n\nIt remained unclear if Mr. Trump would appeal the ruling. Mr. Kasowitz did not respond on Tuesday to email and voice mail messages.\n\nMs. Zervos first came forward with her story in October 2016. She said Mr. Trump had kissed and groped her without her consent on two occasions in 2007, once during a job interview at his New York office and again during a later business meeting at Los Angeles hotel.\n\nThat day, Mr. Trump denied he had greeted her inappropriately. Over the following days, he released a barrage of vehement denials about the allegations from Ms. Zervos and nine other women, calling them fabrications, lies and hoaxes.\n\nMs. Zervos filed suit two months after the election, asserting she had been \u201cdebased and denigrated\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. She is represented by Ms. Wang and Gloria Allred, who has represented several women who have accused high-profile men of sexual wrongdoing.\n\nFrom the start, Ms. Allred made it plain that the goal of the suit, beyond economic damages, was to compel Mr. Trump to admit that he lied when he said Ms. Zervos fabricated her allegation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, led by Mr. Kasowitz, mounted a full-court defense, arguing the suit should be dismissed as meritless, or should be halted until Mr. Trump leaves office. Mr. Kasowitz argued that the courts have repeatedly interpreted the supremacy clause of the Constitution to mean a state court cannot exert control over a president while he is in office.\n\nJustice Schecter, however, said the United States Supreme Court ruling that allowed Ms. Jones to bring a sexual harassment suit against Mr. Clinton while he was in office made it clear that the president could be sued for unofficial conduct, though Ms. Jones\u2019s civil rights claim was in federal court.\n\nThe judge reasoned that \u201cthe rule is no different for suits commenced in state court\u201d as long as the suit concerns the president\u2019s unofficial conduct. Nothing in the supremacy clause, she wrote, says a president cannot be called to account in state court for conduct not related to his federal responsibilities.\n\nShe also rejected the assertion the lawsuit should be postponed because it would interfere with Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to do his job. She noted the state court could not compel the president to take any official action. She also said putting off the suit until Mr. Trump leaves office could not be justified on the ground the president might have to deal with an international crisis. \u201cIf and when he does, of course, important federal responsibilities will take precedent,\u201d she said.\n\nRegarding the merits of the case, Justice Schecter said Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated claims that his female accusers were liars could be construed as defamation under New York law.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "body": "The White House declined to provide a copy of the two- to three-page document, which was described by a senior White House official, or to say whether senior officials were required to sign such a document.\n\nBut former White House lawyers and government ethics experts said the agreement raised serious legal questions and reflected Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to submit to the norms of public disclosure or respect the basic right of free speech.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blanket wipe out speech, and you have to show there\u2019s a compelling government purpose for doing so,\u201d said Norm Eisen, the top ethics lawyer in former President Barack Obama\u2019s White House Counsel\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cIf they have taken even baby steps \u2014 much less what appear to be giant strides \u2014 into the area of muzzling the normal, permitted recollections about the nonclassified and nonconfidential aspects of White House service, then that\u2019s going to trigger the First Amendment protection,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is routine for White House officials to be required to sign confidentiality documents acknowledging that they may not publicly disclose classified information to people who do not have the proper clearance.\n\nBeyond classified information, however, several senior officials who worked for Mr. Obama said they were never asked to sign a broader confidentiality agreement during their time in the White House.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s demand that his aides sign a confidentiality agreement was first reported this week by The Washington Post, but White House officials who have signed one disputed part of that report, which said an early draft of the nondisclosure agreement would have subjected staff members to fines of $10 million for each time they violated it.\n\nTwo officials said in interviews that a document with similar terms had been circulated during the transition between Mr. Trump\u2019s election and his inauguration, but it was widely ridiculed by aides as a misguided tactic by the president-elect\u2019s personal lawyers, and was never used.\n\nNondisclosure agreements had been a preoccupation of Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign, and after the election the president-elect had asked for agreements fashioned after the ones he used at the Trump Organization, his real estate company, for everyone coming into the Trump White House.\n\nAmong the supporters of the move were his daughter, Ivanka, and Jason Greenblatt, his longtime lawyer who would join the White House staff as the president\u2019s chief international negotiator.\n\nWhen Mr. McGahn told Mr. Trump it would be difficult to bind federal employees to such an agreement, Mr. Trump pushed back, believing that its existence could act as a deterrent to would-be leakers, a person with direct knowledge of the discussions said.\n\nStill, Mr. Priebus and Mr. McGahn repeatedly delayed responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s request. By April, amid a rash of embarrassing leaks, they could hold him off no longer.\n\nBut if Mr. Trump thought that the use of a tactic commonly used in the tabloid-fueled business and entertainment circles in which Mr. Trump has existed for decades could plug leaks in the White House, he was mistaken.\n\nSecrets from inside his administration have continued to gush out in the months that followed, in part, officials said, because few people around the president believed the confidentiality agreement could ever be enforced.\n\nIn fact, that message was quietly reinforced by the counsel\u2019s office even as aides signed the agreements last year, several officials said.\n\nOne former official said that he recalled being told that the document was merely meant to reassure the president. The official said that no one in the White House thought they were signing away their First Amendment rights.\n\nAnother said when aides sought to clarify whether they would be able to speak in specific instances \u2014 to fulfill a request from a congressional oversight committee, for example, or to field a question from a lawmaker \u2014 Mr. McGahn would reassure them they had wide latitude. Current and former officials said the agreement contained sweeping caveats stating that it was consistent with whistle-blower protections and other oversight and disclosure laws that apply to federal workers.\n\nAt the same time, lawyers in Mr. McGahn\u2019s office went out of their way to ensure that anyone who had access to particularly sensitive information at the White House signed a copy.\n\nOne official who had not been present for Mr. Priebus\u2019 initial request was later told by a White House lawyer that since he had been involved in many potentially controversial matters, he should probably sign the nondisclosure document, which he said he promptly did.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s White House has also broken with convention in trying to impose written nondisclosure agreements in other instances. A small group of journalists scheduled to travel on a trip to Afghanistan with Vice President Mike Pence were instructed in December to sign a confidentiality agreement before they would be given the details of the trip, for security reasons.\n\nReporters regularly agree to embargo logistical details of trips to war zones, but are not typically asked to sign a document binding them to do so.\n\nJarrod Agen, the vice president\u2019s communications director, said the military liaison for the trip had asked for the document to be signed. When editors at various news organizations balked, White House officials backed down, agreeing to nullify it.\n\n\u201cAll the reporters with knowledge of the trip decided to travel and agreed to embargo the details, making the document unnecessary,\u201d Mr. Agen said.\n\nBut the limits of the Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-leak effort was best illustrated by the publication last month in Vanity Fair of an excerpt from a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,\u201d that gave an extensive and revealing inside accounting of the first six tumultuous six months of the Trump White House.\n\nThe account was based on a series of interviews with Mr. Priebus.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David D.

Mr. Nader has been granted immunity in a deal for his cooperation with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to people familiar with the matter, and his relationship with Mr. Broidy may also offer clues to the direction of that inquiry.\n\nMr. Nader has now been called back from abroad to provide additional testimony, one person familiar with the matter said this week. Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have already asked witnesses about Mr. Nader\u2019s contacts with top Trump administration officials and about his possible role in funneling Emirati money to Mr. Trump\u2019s political efforts, a sign that the investigation has broadened to examine the role of foreign money in the Trump administration.\n\nThe documents contain evidence not previously reported that Mr. Nader also held himself out as intermediary for Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who met with Mr. Trump on Tuesday in the Oval Office at the beginning of a tour of the United States to meet with political and business leaders.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Nader declined to comment. Two people close to Mr. Broidy said he has not been contacted by the special counsel\u2019s investigators. In a statement, Mr. Broidy said that his efforts \u201caimed to strengthen the national security of the United States, in full coordination with the U.S. government.\u201d He added, \u201cI have always believed strongly in countering both Iran and Islamic extremism, and in working closely with our friends in the Arab world in order to do so.\u201d\n\nThe documents, which included emails, business proposals and contracts, were provided by an anonymous group critical of Mr. Broidy\u2019s advocacy of American foreign policies in the Middle East. The Times showed Mr. Broidy\u2019s representatives copies of all of the emails it intended to cite in an article. In his statement, Mr. Broidy said he could not confirm the authenticity of all of them, noting that The Times was able to show him only printouts and not the original emails.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Broidy has said he believes the documents were stolen by hackers working for Qatar in retaliation for his work critical of the country \u2014 a regional nemesis of the Saudis and Emiratis.\n\n\u201cWe now possess irrefutable evidence tying Qatar to this unlawful attack on, and espionage directed against, a prominent United States citizen within the territory of the United States,\u201d Lee S. Wolosky, a lawyer for Mr. Broidy, wrote this week in a letter to the Qatari ambassador in Washington. If Qatar was not responsible, \u201cwe expect your government to hold accountable the rogue actors in Qatar who have caused Mr. Broidy substantial damages.\u201d\n\nThe two men first met during the crush of parties and other events surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Mr. Broidy, 60, a longtime Republican donor and a vice chairman of the inaugural fund-raising committee, got his start in business as an accountant and then investment manager for Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell.\n\nMr. Nader, 58, a United States citizen born in Lebanon, had previously run a Washington-based journal called Middle East Insight, acted as an informal emissary to Syria under the Clinton administration, and, according to short biography in the emails, later worked for Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nThe two became fast friends, and by February, they were exchanging emails about potential contracts for Circinus with both the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, and also about Saudi and Emirati objectives in Washington, such as persuading the United States government to take action against the Muslim Brotherhood or put pressure on its regional ally, Qatar.\n\nEarly in the Trump administration, the two men also noted with approval a successful effort to block a top Pentagon position for Anne Patterson, a former ambassador to Cairo whom the Emiratis and Saudis have long criticized as too sympathetic to the deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood during his one year in office.\n\nIn one message to Mr. Nader in March 2017, Mr. Broidy referred to Secure America Now, an advocacy organization that he suggested had campaigned against Ms. Patterson, as \u201cone of the groups I am working with.\u201d The two people close to Mr. Broidy said he had not raised money for the group or campaigned against Ms. Patterson.\n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis have had particularly warm relations with the Trump administration. Mr. Trump at times has appeared to side with the Arab monarchies against his own cabinet secretaries \u2014 including in the bitter regional dispute against neighboring Qatar. Also in concert with the Saudis and Emiratis, Mr. Trump has taken a far more hawkish stance toward Iran than either his cabinet or his predecessor, threatening to \u201crip up\u201d the Iran nuclear deal brokered by President Barack Obama.\n\nOn March 25, Mr. Broidy emailed Mr. Nader a spreadsheet outlining a proposed Washington lobbying and public relations campaign against both Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. The proposed campaign\u2019s total cost was $12.7 million.\n\nThe two people close to Mr. Broidy said the plan was drafted by a third party for circulation to like-minded American donors, and that only some of its provisions were carried out.\n\nMr. Nader did, however, provide a $2.7 million payment to Mr. Broidy for \u201cconsulting, marketing and other advisory services rendered,\u201d apparently to help pay for the cost of conferences at two Washington think tanks, the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, that featured heavy criticism of Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nHudson Institute policies prohibit donations from foreign governments that are not democracies, and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies bars donations from all foreign governments, so Mr. Nader\u2019s role as an adviser to the U.A.E. may have raised concerns had he donated directly.\n\nDocuments show Mr. Nader\u2019s payment was made by an Emirati-based company he controlled, GS Investments, to an obscure firm based in Vancouver, British Columbia, controlled by Mr. Broidy, Xieman International. A person close to Mr. Broidy said the money was passed through the Canadian company at Mr. Nader\u2019s request and the reason for its circuitous path could not be determined.\n\nDocuments also appear to show that lawyers for Mr. Broidy discussed with him a possible agreement to share with Mr. Nader a portion of the profits from the first round of business his company did with the Saudis and Emiratis \u2014 an apparent reflection of his integral role in helping the company, Circinus, negotiate for the lucrative security contracts.\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Broidy said Mr. Nader \u201cis not a shareholder, officer, director or employee of any of my companies. He has not been paid any origination fee or any other fees in connection with these matters.\u201d\n\nMonths later, as Mr. Broidy was preparing for an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nader pressed him to try to line up a private meeting outside the White House between Mr. Trump and the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, whom he referred to as \u201cFriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him that Friend would like to come ASAP to meet you SOONEST out of official site, in New Jersey\u201d or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, Mr. Nader wrote to Mr. Broidy on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cAgain, Again and Again, please try to be the ONE to fix a date for Friend while you are there if at all possible,\u201d he added.\n\nSix days later, Mr. Broidy did just that, repeatedly pressing Mr. Trump to meet with the crown prince in a \u201cquiet\u201d setting outside of the White House \u2014 perhaps in New York or New Jersey \u2014 according to a detailed report on the meeting that Mr. Broidy sent to Mr. Nader shortly afterward. Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, blocked the request, Mr. Broidy reported.\n\nIn a memorandum to Mr. Nader about the Oval Office meeting on Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy reported that he personally urged Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Tillerson, whom the Saudis and Emiratis saw as insufficiently tough on Iran and Qatar.\n\nLater that fall, Mr. Nader complained that the Secret Service had stopped him from getting his picture taken with Mr. Trump at a fund-raiser. Although the reasons he was kept at bay from the president are unclear, Mr. Nader pleaded guilty in 1991 to a federal child pornography charge and served six months at a halfway house after videotapes were found in his luggage when he arrived at Dulles Airport outside Washington from a trip to Germany, according to court records released last week. In 2003, he received a one-year prison sentence in the Czech Republic after he was convicted there of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors, The Associated Press reported, citing a court spokeswoman.\n\nMr. Broidy was puzzled by the Secret Service\u2019s objections. Mr. Nader, in his capacity as an adviser to the ruler of United Arab Emirates, had met several times with senior administration officials in the White House during Mr. Trump\u2019s first weeks in office.\n\nMr. Broidy was apparently able to deliver: On Dec. 14, he emailed Mr. Nader his photograph grinning next to Mr. Trump.\n\nDespite the close relations between the White House and the two gulf nations, there have been occasional hiccups, and in January, Mr. Nader twice emailed his friend with another delicate request: The leader of the U.A.E. asked that Mr. Trump call the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to try to smooth over potential bad feelings created by the book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d by Michael Wolff. It portrayed the president\u2019s views of the Saudi prince in an unflattering light, Mr. Nader wrote.\n\n\u201cSee what you can trigger and do and we can discuss more in person,\u201d Mr. Nader wrote, reiterating once again the \u201cgenuine desire\u201d of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates to meet alone with Mr. Trump.\n\nDays later, Mr. Nader wrote to his friend that he was looking forward to an upcoming trip to the United States. Mr. Broidy was arranging for him to attend a gala dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Florida estate, to celebrate the anniversary of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the two men were considering a trip Saudi Arabia to try to sell the kingdom\u2019s young and powerful crown prince on a $650 million contract with Mr. Broidy\u2019s security company.\n\nBut those grand plans were interrupted.

Law enforcement officials said that they did not have conclusive evidence that race played a role in the bombings, but that they were continuing to explore the possibility.\n\nInvestigators are examining connections between the two black victims, who both belonged to prominent African-American families.

They said the plan remained in flux.

The decision was made over the opposition of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico.

The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create a new Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees.\n\nThe proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Department of Labor. The department proposed to take over adult and unemployed worker programs run by the Labor Department, and to redirect the funding for those programs to federal Pell grants so that unemployed workers can enroll in higher education and vocational programs. The department would acquire an \u201cout-of-school youth\u201d program from the Labor Department, as well as a program that helps reintegrate ex-prisoners.\n\nDetails of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted all protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department\u2019s overhaul.\n\nMost notably, the contract cuts down the use of \u201cofficial time,\u201d which employees could use to do union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors.\n\nThe goal of the collective bargaining agreement, Ms. Hill said, \u201cis to treat all employees and the American taxpayers fairly.\u201d\n\nUnion officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime.

Since fast-food workers in New York City began a campaign a few years ago for a $15 minimum wage, that number has become a rallying cry for workers around the country.\n\nBut Hector Figueroa, the president of 32BJ Service Employees International, the influential union that represents several thousand of the airport workers, has set his sights higher. Last year, frustrated by the Port Authority\u2019s slow response to its demands, 32BJ and Unite Here, a union representing other airport workers, lobbied for legislation in Albany and Trenton that would have set an $18-an-hour minimum at the airports.\n\nThat effort failed, but once Mr. Murphy was elected, the unions returned to the Port Authority\u2019s monthly board meetings to press their demands. This time, Mr. Figueroa said, their efforts appear to be bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase but it\u2019s the kind of money that you need to live in this market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase because the workers were earning so little for so long.\u201d\n\nSaluting the workers for their relentless campaign over several years, Mr. Figueroa said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good lesson to other workers out there to never give up.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Patricia Mazzei", "body": "Four months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, a picture is emerging of the contracts awarded in the earliest days of the crisis. And examples like the Tribute contract are causing lawmakers to raise questions about FEMA\u2019s handling of the disaster and whether the agency was adequately prepared to respond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating the contract, asked Representative Trey Gowdy, the committee chairman, to subpoena FEMA for all documents relating to the agreement. Lawmakers fear the agency is not lining up potential contractors in advance of natural disasters, leading it to scramble to award multimillion-dollar agreements in the middle of a crisis.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a bipartisan congressional investigation found that a failure to secure advance contracts led to chaos and potential for waste and fraud. Democrats asserted that FEMA was similarly inept preparing for this storm.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the Trump Administration\u2019s response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico in 2017 suffered from the same flaws as the Bush Administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005,\u201d wrote Representatives Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Stacey E. Plaskett, the nonvoting delegate from the United States Virgin Islands.\n\nIn November, The Associated Press found that after Hurricane Maria, FEMA awarded more than $30 million in contracts for emergency tarps and plastic sheeting to a company that never delivered the needed supplies.\n\nFEMA insists no Puerto Ricans missed a meal as a result of the failed agreement with Tribute. FEMA relied on other suppliers that provided \u201cample\u201d food and water for distribution, said William Booher, an agency spokesman.\n\nBut there is little doubt that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans struggled with access to food. The storm shut down ports on an island that imports about 85 percent of its food supply. Farms were flattened. Supermarkets lost electricity and could not find diesel to run their generators. The stores that opened using generator power could not offer much from their understocked shelves.\n\nPuerto Ricans depended heavily on emergency aid dispatched by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security has doled out more than $1 billion in contracts related to Hurricane Maria, which made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20.\n\nOn Oct. 3, FEMA awarded one of its largest food contracts to Tribute. For $5.10 each, the company agreed to provide 30 million ready-to-eat meals by Oct. 23.\n\nMs. Brown described herself in an interview as a government contractor \u2014 \u201calmost like a broker,\u201d she said \u2014 who does not keep employees or specialize in any field but is able to procure subcontracted work as needed, and get a cut of the money along the way. She claims a fashion line and has several self-published books, and describes herself on Twitter as \u201cA Diva, Mogul, Author, Idealist with scars to prove it.\u201d\n\nAfter Tribute\u2019s failure to provide the meals became clear, FEMA formally terminated the contract for cause, citing Tribute\u2019s late delivery of approved meals. Ms. Brown is disputing the termination. On Dec. 22, she filed an appeal, arguing that the real reason FEMA canceled her contract was because the meals were packed separately from the heating pouches, not because of their late delivery. Ms. Brown claims the agency did not specify that the meals and heaters had to be together.\n\nShe is seeking a settlement of at least $70 million. Her subcontractors, Cooking With A Star LLC, and Breedlove Foods Inc., have threatened to sue her for breach of contract, Ms. Brown said. Kendra Robinson, the caterer who runs Cooking With A Star, said she has about 75,000 meals her company prepared for FEMA sitting in an Atlanta warehouse.\n\nIn a statement, FEMA said it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment on a contract pending an appeal. But the agency noted it continues to provide meals to Puerto Ricans, despite an error by an agency spokesman last week that suggested the emergency aid would stop.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the contract termination there were ample commodity supplies in the pipeline, and distribution was not affected,\u201d said Mr. Booher, the agency spokesman. \u201cDuring the 2017 hurricane season FEMA sourced over 200 million meals through multiple vendors in order to support disaster response activities across multiple disasters.\u201d\n\nTribute has been awarded dozens of government contracts since 2013, including one in 2015 for $1.2 million in mattresses for the Defense Logistics Agency, which supports military combat troops, federal spending databases show. Tribute delivered the mattresses, according to the agency. The databases offer only a fragmented picture of federal contracts.\n\nThe government has also canceled Tribute contracts on at least five occasions.\n\nFour cancellations involved the Federal Prison System, which found that Tribute failed to deliver meat, bakery, cereal and other food products to various correctional institutions. A fifth termination involved the Government Publishing Office, which terminated a contract for 3,000 tote bags after Tribute failed to print the Marine Corps logo on both sides of the bags.\n\nAn investigation by the office\u2019s inspector general found that Tribute \u201caltered and submitted a false shipping document and subcontracted the predominant production function on two contracts without proper authorization,\u201d according to a 2015 report submitted to Congress.\n\nThe report did not name Tribute, but a Government Publishing Office spokesman confirmed that it was the Georgia company mentioned in the document. The office awarded Tribute 14 contracts totaling more than $80,000 from 2014-15, and the company \u201croutinely delivered late,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs a result of the botched tote-bag job, the Government Publishing Office prohibited the award of any contracts over $35,000 to Tribute until January 2019. But that exclusion applied only to that office, not to any other federal agency.\n\nTribute has had three indefinite contracts with FEMA for hygiene kits since 2013, but none of them have been activated.\n\nAsked about the cancellations, Ms. Brown offered explanations for each case, including that she had supplier trouble with the prison meals. She could have fought the Government Publishing Office on the tote bags contract, she said, but could not afford to at the time.\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee say Tribute\u2019s contract history should have given FEMA serious pause about awarding the company a huge food contract.\n\n\u201cClearly, Tribute did not have sufficient financial resources of its own to support this contract,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBased on Tribute\u2019s lack of experience in large-scale disaster relief and its limited financial capacity, FEMA should have raised serious questions about whether the company could meet the contract terms \u2014 especially since the contract concerned such a critical need.\u201d\n\nMs. Brown said she had no doubt she could have provided the 30 million meals, though she estimated she would have needed until at least Nov. 7 \u2014 two weeks past FEMA\u2019s deadline, and still an unlikely completion date, given Tribute\u2019s pace of delivery by the time the contract was canceled.\n\n\u201cThey probably should have gone with someone else, but I\u2019m assuming they did not because this was the third hurricane\u201d after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Ms. Brown said. \u201cThey were trying to fill the orders the best they could.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Peter Baker", "body": "Ms. Clifford filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday asserting that the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment was void because Mr. Trump never signed it.\n\nMs. Sanders said that the president had denied having an affair with Ms. Clifford or making the payment himself.

The lawsuit was filed a week after Mr. Cohen initiated arbitration proceedings, but the court papers did not say what was at issue or refer to the restraining order.\n\nThe contract gives Mr. Trump the right to seek financial penalties of more than $1 million in arbitration should Ms. Clifford break or threaten to break her agreement to stay silent. It also gives him the right to obtain an injunction barring her from speaking while disputes are considered in arbitration or open court. Those terms prompted Ms. Clifford to change her plans about going public, according to two people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to speak about it.\n\nMs. Clifford had suggested she was free to speak out after Mr. Cohen disclosed last month that he had arranged the payment, prompting her to claim that the contract had been breached.\n\nThe restraining order took her by surprise. A close friend of Ms. Clifford\u2019s, J. D. Barrale, said in an interview that she learned Mr. Cohen initiated arbitration proceedings when she landed on a flight from Los Angeles to Texas. \u201cShe was shocked,\u201d Mr. Barrale said.\n\nMr. Avenatti said Ms. Clifford had \u201cnever even been provided an opportunity to respond\u201d to Mr. Cohen\u2019s action in arbitration.\n\nA copy of the restraining order, obtained by The Times and first reported by NBC News, left open the possibility that it could be modified in the future. But Mr. Avenatti said he questioned its validity because it was brought on behalf of Mr. Cohen, not Mr. Trump.\n\nAsked if Ms. Clifford would drop her court case if Mr. Cohen provided her with more money, he said she would not. \u201cAt this point, we are well beyond that \u2014 this is a search for the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawsuit by Ms. Clifford adds weight to allegations in a separate legal complaint brought by Common Cause, a public interest group that has asked the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department to investigate the $130,000 payment by Mr. Cohen. Common Cause argues that the payment amounted to an undeclared in-kind contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFederal election law requires contributions and expenditures for a campaign to be promptly disclosed, and prohibits a candidate from dipping into campaign funds to cover personal expenses. There is no evidence that campaign money was used to make the payment.\n\nCommon Cause filed a similar complaint about a $150,000 payment made shortly before the election by American Media Inc., owner of The National Enquirer, to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy Playmate who has said she had an affair with a married Mr. Trump about a decade ago. The company dismissed the complaint as meritless.\n\nThe Enquirer never published a story about the alleged affair, and Common Cause asserts that if the payment was intended to keep Ms. McDougal quiet, it would be an illegal coordinated expenditure by a company on behalf of the Trump campaign.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael S.

But immigration has proved to be the most contentious fight with local officials assuring undocumented immigrants that they would do all they could to protect them.\n\nLast year, California enacted the sanctuary laws, which place restrictions on when and how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents.\n\nBoth Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump have threatened to pull federal grant money from cities and states that have sanctuary laws to protect undocumented immigrants. They argue that the policies flout federal laws and help criminals evade deportation.\n\nAnd the Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country this year to provide documentation that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities, or receive a subpoena for the information. It is also exploring possible criminal charges for local politicians who enact sanctuary policies.\n\nThe lawsuit expected to be filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento is the first against a local or state government over its immigration policies filed by the Justice Department under Mr. Sessions. Department officials said that they would not rule out the possibility of other lawsuits against local governments whose policies interfere with the federal government\u2019s authority on immigration. Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont have state sanctuary laws, as do cities and counties in more than a dozen states, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe federal government says that three California laws, enacted over the past year, make it impossible for federal immigration officials to do their jobs and deport criminals who were born outside of the United States. The suit called the laws unconstitutional.\n\nOne, the California Values Act, strictly limits state and local agencies from sharing information with federal agents about criminals or suspects unless they have been convicted of a serious crimes. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, was the centerpiece of the state legislature\u2019s effort to thwart the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nSoon after the law was enacted, Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that the state should expect to see \u201c a lot more deportation officers\u201d and that elected officials who support the policy should be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThese politicians can\u2019t make these decisions and be held unaccountable for people dying. I mean, we need to hold these politicians accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers also passed the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, which prohibits local business from allowing immigration to access employee records without a court order or subpoena. Mr. Becerra warned that anyone who violates the new law would face a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nIn the state budget bill, California lawmakers prohibited new contracts for immigration detention in the state and gave the state attorney general the power to monitor all state immigration detention centers.\n\nThe state and several local governments including the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento have also set up legal defense funds to help defend immigrants during deportation proceedings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the Dreamers, hardworking immigrant families and law-abiding people who are just trying to make their way like the rest of us,\u201d Darrell Steinberg, the mayor of Sacramento, said earlier this year when asked about the state\u2019s sanctuary legislation. \u201cCivil disobedience is a respectful way to show your love for country.\u201d\n\nTensions between local and federal officials reached yet another crescendo as last week, when Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland publicly warned of coming large-scale immigration arrest operations. Mr. Homan compared the mayor to a \u201cgang lookout yelling, \u201cPolice!\u201d and said she gave people living in the United States illegally a chance to flee. He said her warning meant that the federal immigration authorities arrested roughly 200 people rather than the 1,000 they had anticipated rounding up.\n\nAlthough Mr. Homan and other federal officials have warned about targeting California as it steps up immigration enforcement efforts, the number of people arrested has not dramatically increased so far. In December, the most recent month for which data is available, 1,715 unauthorized immigrants in California were arrested by ICE, compared with 1,379 in December 2016.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Justice Department has sued a state.

During the campaign he promised to release them after the I.R.S. finished auditing him. Then, after he was elected, Trump said, sorry, not going to release them ever. And nothing happened. Trump, I am reliably told, has actually said to people close to him, \u201cCan you believe I got away with that?\u201d\n\nOnce Trump saw that he could get away with not disclosing his tax returns, he knew he could get away with anything. He knew that once he compromised the G.O.P., even its evangelical wing, into giving him a pass on his taxes, they\u2019d roll over for anything \u2014 sex with porn stars, endless lying, trashing the F.B.I., coddling Putin.

Maybe it\u2019s just the embarrassment that he is not as rich as he claims, or, maybe, it\u2019s something more fundamental \u2014 like how dependent he is on Russian oligarchs for financing, so much so that Putin has leverage on him. Whatever the reason, though, when Trump saw he could get away with hiding them, he knew he could break any rule, tell any lie and violate any presidential norm \u2014 and he\u2019s done just that.\n\nPutin\u2019s turkey was even more serious. It was the shooting down of that Malaysian civilian airliner, Flight MH17, over Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people onboard.\n\nRemember the story? A Dutch-led international investigation \u2014 relying on, among other things, 150,000 intercepted phone calls \u2014 found that Putin\u2019s proxies in eastern Ukraine had requested that Russia send them an SA-11 surface-to-air missile launcher. And it was trucked over the Russian border into Ukraine, where it shot down that Malaysian airliner (probably mistaking it for a Ukrainian military plane) and then was trucked back to Russia hours later.\n\nPutin\u2019s military was up to its neck in this. Putin did not push the button on that missile, but he created the conditions for it to shoot down that plane \u2014 and he walked away from it as if the plane were brought down by lightning, making up one implausible story after another. He got slapped on the wrist with a few sanctions, but his complicity faded away into a mist of baldfaced lies.\n\nWho wanted to confront Russia, with all its gas exports to Europe and all its oligarchs throwing money around London or buying condos in places like \u2026 Trump Tower in New York? Putin surely also said to himself, \u201cCan you believe I got away with that? Why not poison a former Russian spy in London with a banned military nerve agent or perpetrate genocide in Syria? Who\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d\n\nTrump and Putin are cut from the same cloth. Their strategy is: keep pushing, keep grabbing, keep lying, keep denying, no matter how implausible the denials \u2014 and never apologize. Because when you lie on an industrial scale, it overwhelms everyone else. Normal people just don\u2019t behave that way, and the sheer shamelessness eventually exhausts them.\n\nThe lesson that the Bedouin chief was trying to teach his sons is that he could live his life without that turkey \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t live his life with what the stealing of his turkey with impunity implied: that when people keep eroding the norms of society, stealing \u2014 turkeys or the truth \u2014 eventually becomes the norm.\n\nThat steady erosion of norms is what Trump is doing to America and Putin is doing to the world. And if we let them get away with it, your kids won\u2019t just grow up in a different America, they\u2019ll grow up in a different world.\n\nI don\u2019t know what is sufficient to stop them, but I know what is necessary. American voters have to go to the polls and deal a resounding electoral defeat to this Republican Party, which Trump has taken over like an invasive species. America needs a healthy conservative party in our two-party system.

But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles.\n\nPrecisely how Mr. Cruz came to possess the gun is not clear.

That would partly vindicate the adults\u2019 claims that things would be even messier without them. But it would also mean that, by protecting the country from the consequences of an unhinged president, they helped Trump consolidate his power while he learned how to transcend restraints.\n\nWhatever their accomplishments, if from their privileged perches these people saw the president as a dangerous fool in need of babysitting, it\u2019s now time for some of them to say so publicly.\n\nThis month, Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, published a scathing open letter to Powell. During her time in the administration, he wrote, she assured appalled onlookers that the adults were playing a stabilizing role: \u201cYou reached out to tell those of us on the outside you were saving us from a lot. You don\u2019t understand, friends of yours conveyed to all of us, how bad it is.\u201d Lovett wrote that he was skeptical of this argument but unable to dismiss it. The real test, he thought, would come when she and Cohn and others like them were no longer in the White House: \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t speak out because you had to stay, when you left, you had to speak out.\u201d\n\nOf course, unlike Omarosa Manigault Newman, who confessed horror at her former boss\u2019s presidency on \u201cCelebrity Big Brother,\u201d they haven\u2019t. Their defenders among anti-Trump Republicans say it\u2019s because some of them still have a role to play in staving off potential disaster. One Republican in regular contact with people in the White House told me that Powell and Cohn \u201cneed to protect their capacity to reach in and help manage in the event of any national crisis.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t find this entirely convincing. If these people see the administration as unequipped to handle an emergency, they owe the country a firsthand account of our vulnerability. But there is, at least, a certain logic to the argument made in their defense. That logic, however, only holds for those who remain on decent terms with Trump. Which means that if there\u2019s one person who has no excuse for not speaking out, it\u2019s Tillerson, once one of the most powerful private citizens in America, now humbled and defiled by his time in Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Tillerson holds Trump in contempt and disagrees with large parts of his agenda. After Charlottesville, Tillerson refused to say that the president\u2019s words represented American values. (\u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d he told Fox News.) In office, he struggled to save the Iran nuclear deal and opposed Trump\u2019s \u2014 and Jared Kushner\u2019s \u2014 support for a blockade of Qatar by other Arab states. After his ignominious firing, he gave a live address in which he didn\u2019t even mention the president\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cRex is never going to be back in a position where he can have any degree of influence or respect from this president,\u201d my Republican source said. Because of that, the source continued, \u201cRex is under a moral mandate to do his best to burn it down.\u201d That would mean telling the truth \u201cabout how concerned he is about the leadership in the Oval Office, and what underpins those concerns and what he\u2019s seen.\u201d\n\nIn this case, patriotism and self-interest point in the same direction. Before entering this administration, Tillerson was a vastly more respected businessman than Trump; as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, he presided over what The Times described as a \u201cstate within a state.\u201d Now the first line of his obituary will be about a year of abject failure as the country\u2019s lead diplomat, culminating in a humiliation fit for reality TV.\n\nThe only way he will ever change that is by joining those who would bring this despicable presidency down. If Tillerson came out and said that the president is unfit, and perhaps even that venal concerns for private gain have influenced his foreign policy, impeachment wouldn\u2019t begin tomorrow, but Trump\u2019s already narrow public support would shrink further. Republican members of Congress like Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, might be induced to rediscover their spines and perform proper oversight.\n\nLast year, Axios\u2019s Allen and Jim VandeHei half-jokingly called the insiders trying to circumscribe Trump the \u201cCommittee to Save America.\u201d Now the committee, having failed, is disbanding.

His friends and allies have said that he denies any wrongdoing in his dealings with journalists or the inspector general. He stepped down in January and took a leave of absence under pressure over the looming inspector general\u2019s report.\nMr. McCabe is a career agent, not a political appointee, so Mr. Trump has no direct say in his fate. The decision nonetheless comes at a moment of turnover in Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team. On Tuesday, the president fired the secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and named the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, to replace him. He tapped a veteran clandestine officer, Gina Haspel, to lead the C.I.A.\nFiring Mr. McCabe, even on the recommendation of the disciplinary office, would be controversial. Among Mr. McCabe\u2019s allies, the decision would raise the specter that Mr. Sessions was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent derisive comments. No deputy director in the history of the F.B.I. has been fired.\nBut Mr. Sessions would be able to point to a critical inspector general\u2019s report and say he followed Justice Department protocol. The details of why the inspector general viewed Mr. McCabe as not forthcoming are not clear. Though F.B.I. disciplinary records show that drunken driving, domestic violence and assaults have been punished by suspension, when agents are found to have shown a lack of candor under oath, they are commonly fired.\nThe inspector general, Michael Horowitz, announced last year that he would investigate several contentious decisions made at the F.B.I. and Justice Department during the 2016 presidential campaign. In November, Mr. Horowitz indicated that he planned to issue a single report this spring encompassing his entire review, on matters including the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\n\n\nThere are no indications that Mr. Horowitz is prepared to release a broad report this week. It is not clear why he opted to handle Mr. McCabe separately and refer him for discipline before the release of the full report. A spokesman for Mr. Horowitz has declined to comment.\nMr. Trump has attacked members of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for much of his first year in office. But few have been the target of presidential ire like Mr. McCabe. Mr. Trump has repeatedly remarked on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia. Her campaign received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor at the time and a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost the race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\n        \n        \n            Problem is that the acting head of the FBI  the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!        \n \u2014\n        Donald J.

But what is publicly known does not fit neatly into Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of Mr. McCabe as a Democratic operator. Mr. McCabe has described himself to friends as a lifelong Republican voter.\nThe allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which revealed in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation. The article said that the Justice Department would not authorize subpoenas in the case. Some F.B.I. agents, the article said, believed that Mr. McCabe had put the brakes on the investigation. Others rejected that notion.\nThe inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article. The public affairs office arranged a phone call to discuss the case, a common practice in the federal government when officials believe that a journalist has only part of the story.\nIn the Journal story, a person described as close to Mr. McCabe pushed back on the notion that he had tried to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the person described a tense conversation with the Justice Department in which Mr. McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to keep investigating.\nThe article was a negative one for the Clinton campaign \u2014 not Mr. Trump. It was published just days before the election, after the F.B.I. reopened its investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The article, including the F.B.I. disclosures, made it clear that some agents saw evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation that was worth investigating.\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Under the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, he ascended through several senior leadership jobs, and it was clear that he was being groomed for the bureau\u2019s No. 2 position. His rise angered some rank-and-file agents. But supporters viewed him as a sophisticated, intellectual choice for a job that has become an integral part of the nation\u2019s intelligence community.\nThe deputy director is the chief operations officer at the F.B.I., a job that requires managing relationships with the White House and Congress. That task became unusually difficult as agents investigated the Trump campaign, straining relationships with Mr. Trump. Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, criticized the F.B.I. for failing to do enough in that inquiry, while Republicans accused agents of drumming up an investigation based on shoddy evidence.\n        Continue reading the main story", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Mazzetti", "body": "It was unclear exactly what Mr. Gates might have to offer the special counsel\u2019s team, whether about Mr. Manafort or about other members of the Trump campaign.

In between stints in private practice, he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government, starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general.\n\nAfter the 2000 election, Mr. Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. After the Supreme Court halted the recount, resulting in Mr. Bush\u2019s victory, Dick Cheney, the new vice president, persuaded the incoming secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, to make Mr. Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control.\n\nMr. Bush later nominated Mr. Bolton for the United Nations post, but his confirmation was blocked in the Senate after key Republicans opposed him. Mr. Bush then gave him a recess appointment instead. He clashed regularly with Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Powell\u2019s successor as secretary of state, and eventually broke with Mr. Bush over what he saw as weak-kneed policies on North Korea and Iran.\n\nHe titled his memoir \u201cSurrender Is Not an Option,\u201d and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department\u2019s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the \u201cEAPeasers.\u201d He even went after Mr. Bush. \u201cNothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse,\u201d he wrote in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMr. Bush bristled and, in a private meeting with a group of conservatives, said, \u201cLet me just say from the outset that I don\u2019t consider Bolton credible.\u201d Other former colleagues fought back more publicly. Christopher Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for Mr. Bush, dismissed Mr. Bolton as \u201cPhyllis Schlafly with a mustache.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016, Ms. Rice and other Bush administration veterans like former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Stephen J. Hadley, the former national security adviser, privately warned against an appointment for Mr. Bolton.\n\nMr. Trump considered Mr. Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time. In the interim, Mr. Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr. Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagree.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter earlier this month that sanctions on Mr. Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher. \u201cIf you want to punish a country for behavior you don\u2019t accept, you need punishing sanctions that are broad, not targeted, and they need to be enforced,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a Journal column, he made the case for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea. \u201cGiven the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nHe likewise went on Fox News to disdain South Korea\u2019s willingness to negotiate with North Korea. \u201cThey\u2019re like putty in North Korea\u2019s hands,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the great international relations theorist P.T. Barnum put it, there\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201d Two days later, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea\u2019s Mr. Kim.\n\nAs he prepared to take on his new assignment, however, Mr. Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr. Trump. Asked on Fox on Thursday evening about the president\u2019s decision to congratulate Mr. Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham, Mr. Bolton said, \u201cI don\u2019t consider it a significant point one way or the other,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s a matter of being polite.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "The Editorial Board", "body": "Parents throughout the country live with the dread that the next lockdown at their child\u2019s school won\u2019t be a drill and that screams like those we heard on cellphones from classrooms at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School will come from their own child\u2019s classroom.\n\nThe terror that has gripped their elected officials, however, is fear of the wealthy gun lobby, to which they have let themselves be held hostage for decades.\n\nBut standing up to gun rights extremists and industry lobbyists can no longer be seen as an act of heroism that could lead to political suicide.

If a young black man grabs a white woman by the crotch, he\u2019s a thug and deserves to be roughed up by police officers. But if Donald Trump grabs a white woman by the crotch in a nightclub (as he\u2019s accused of doing, and denies), it\u2019s locker-room high jinks.\n\nThis view is also expressed by many of the president\u2019s staff members, supporters and prominent allies. During the same week that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, repeatedly vouched for Rob Porter\u2019s integrity, Mr. Kelly also mused that hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants who did not fill out the paperwork for DACA protections had refused to \u201cget off their asses.\u201d\n\nA political movement that rails against \u201cimmigrant crime\u201d while defending alleged abusers and child molesters is one that has stopped pretending to have any universalist aspirations.

The moves risk further isolating the United States at a delicate geopolitical moment by inflaming key allies, as well as China.\n\nThe effect of the China tariffs would be larger and more concentrated than the steel and aluminum measures and would have a bigger impact on United States consumers, who are heavy purchasers of electronics, clothing and other Chinese imports. The steel and aluminum tariffs would affect imports of roughly $33 billion, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures, said Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution. The China moves would affect at least $50 billion a year in imports, officials said.\n\nYet unlike the metal tariffs, which caused bitter divisions within the Trump administration and were opposed by many Republican lawmakers and business people, the technology moves against China are likely to be politically popular on Capitol Hill and throughout some industries.\n\nThe business community, which long defended China against accusations of theft of intellectual property, has grown more dissatisfied with adverse treatment in the Chinese economy. With the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises playing an ever-larger role in the market, the environment for American companies has steadily deteriorated.\n\n\u201cTheir theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better,\u201d said Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, referring to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration.\n\nThe country, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, has sought to build up businesses it considers critical for defending its national security interests and meeting its economic goals.\n\nBeijing has been enlisting American companies in its effort. As it looks to create its own national champions, China has been forcing American stalwarts like Qualcomm, Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to create joint ventures, hand over their technology or develop local expertise. If they do not, companies risk losing access to China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nBut China\u2019s national security interests are colliding with those of the United States. A worry is that companies are handing over critical technology that the United States needs for its military, defense or infrastructure. By transferring technology, they may also be giving an edge to Chinese rivals that one day may prove dominant.\n\nThis month, the United States government blocked Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for Qualcomm, a chip maker, citing national security concerns. The fear was that the acquisition would weaken Qualcomm, allowing China an advantage in the race to build the next generation of wireless technology.\n\nLast August, Mr. Trump ordered an investigation into four types of Chinese trade practices, including requiring companies to share trade secrets to gain access to the Chinese market, forcing them to license their technology in China at below-market rates and cyberintrusions to steal technology. China also uses state funds to buy American high-tech companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior official at the United States trade representative\u2019s office said the investigation, which is now complete, found ample evidence of abuses in all these areas. The official said China had not changed its behavior, despite years of negotiations in the World Trade Organization and economic dialogues with the last three administrations.\n\nIf anything, the administration said, its failure to honor the obligations it made when it joined the World Trade Organization has gotten worse. China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, officials said, contributed to its trade surplus of $375.2 billion with the United States last year. China has also introduced a plan to gain global leadership in advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace, among other industries.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to ask the United States trade representative to come up with a full list of products to retaliate against within 15 days, according to an official briefed on the plans.\n\nExperts worry that the United States\u2019 actions could ignite a trade war, noting that Chinese economic officials have a keen understanding of the American system and are good at designing targeted retaliatory measures against American agricultural products and other exports.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s moves will also test the personal relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Xi, the Chinese president. Last year, Mr. Trump held off imposing tough trade measures against China because, he said, Mr. Xi was cooperating in his campaign to pressure the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, over his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Mr. Trump agreed to meet Mr. Kim for talks, surprising Mr. Xi, whom he did not consult before making the decision. Now, Mr. Trump will be seeking the Chinese president\u2019s support for his diplomacy at the same time that trade tensions between are on the rise.\n\nStill, given their deep frustration, business executives may greet Mr. Trump\u2019s move with quiet satisfaction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s now palpable frustration across a number of sectors of the American business community feeling increasingly squeezed by an ever-more-emboldened China,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cWhile some are eager to continue seeking as much engagement with China as possible, others are openly using terms and invoking options they hadn\u2019t previously considered.\u201d\n\nThe United States\u2019 chief trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China.\n\n\u201cThere are certain technology products that are under assault,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cYou have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products.\u201d\n\nBut he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. \u201cYou would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lighthizer\u2019s testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. \u201cNobody wins from a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want a trade war.

W. Bush and praised the party\u2019s nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who would go on to defeat Mr. Bush. Mr. Miller attributed his own rise to the achievements of the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI made it because Franklin Delano Roosevelt energized this nation,\u201d Mr. Miller told the convention, which was also being held at Madison Square Garden. \u201cI made it because Harry Truman fought for working families like mine.

I made it because Lyndon Johnson showed America that people who were born poor didn\u2019t have to die poor.\u201d\n\nZell Bryan Miller was born in Young Harris on Feb. 24, 1932. His father, Stephen Grady Miller, a teacher, died 17 days later. The widowed mother, Birdie, built a home with rocks that she had hauled from a nearby stream, Zell Miller recounted later, and raised the boy and his sister, Jane.\n\nMr. Miller attended Young Harris College before transferring to Emory University in Atlanta. Finding his life lacking in direction or purpose, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1953 and enrolled at the University of Georgia three years later, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s in history.\n\nIn 1954, he married Shirley Carver, who survives him, as do two sons, Murphy and Matthew; four grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nHe taught history and political science at Young Harris College and was elected mayor of Young Harris, serving in 1959 and 1960. He was then elected to two two-year terms in the State Senate. Next, he was executive secretary for Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia from 1968 to 1971. He was credited with exerting a moderating influence on Mr. Maddox, a segregationist, and spurring him to appoint blacks to his administration.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Mr. Miller spent 16 years as lieutenant governor under George Busbee and Joe Frank Harris, serving in that post longer than anyone else in Georgia history. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate seat in 1980, was elected governor in 1990 and re-elected in 1994.\n\nAs governor, Mr. Miller fought to have the Confederate battle emblem removed from the state flag, supported tough sentences for repeat criminal offenders and pushed legislation providing more money for public schools and scholarships for high school students. By the time he stepped down, after his second term, he was one of the most popular politicians in Georgia history.\n\nWhile in the Senate, Mr. Miller campaigned on behalf of Senator Max Cleland, a fellow Georgia Democrat, in Mr. Cleland\u2019s unsuccessful bid for re-election in 2002.\n\nYet as a former senator in 2008, Mr. Miller supported Senator Saxby Chambliss, the Republican who had unseated Mr. Cleland, asserting that Mr. Chambliss \u201ccould well be the last man standing between a far, far left liberal agenda sailing through the Senate.\u201d Mr. Chambliss won re-election.\n\nMr. Miller acquired the nickname \u201cZigzag Zell\u201d among some Democratic Party leaders. As he crossed into his senior years, he often endorsed Republicans in Georgia races. Yet he always insisted that he would be a Democrat \u201cuntil I die,\u201d and that the party had abandoned him on some issues, not the other way around.\n\nSo why did he remain in the Democratic Party?\n\n\u201cI compare it to being in an old house,\u201d he said just before he left the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s a house that I\u2019ve lived in for years that\u2019s getting kind of drafty and hard to heat. The plumbing won\u2019t work, and some strangers have moved into the basement, and I don\u2019t know who they are, and there\u2019s no doubt I would be more comfortable in another house.

That decision turned a story with a potentially tragic ending into one about a heroic single mother and her young daughter. Our incident won\u2019t show up in the statistics about gun use in self-defense scenarios. I doubt my mother ever reported it to the police.\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive to those who didn\u2019t grow up around guns, in our house we saw them as tools of protection and empowerment for two women living alone.\n\nAfter my first child, a daughter, was born I must have printed the paperwork required to obtain a gun permit in New Jersey a dozen times. Despite what many may think, the process is not simple nor is it quick, which led to my procrastinating for several years.\n\nOver the Republican primary season, I was an outspoken conservative critic of then-candidate Donald Trump, and a torrent of hate rolled my way. I would later learn just how much: The Anti-Defamation League named me one of the top 10 Jewish journalists to be attacked by the alt-right during the election season. After years of receiving death threats for my conservative views, months of being attacked by the alt-right and then having our address published online by the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, I pushed myself to finally go through the process of asking friends for letters attesting to my character, obtaining fingerprints and submitting to background checks.\n\nI was given a reason to feel that I needed to defend myself and my family. And I acted on it.\n\nIn the wake of every mass shooting, there are renewed calls for gun control, and a demonization of the National Rifle Association (of which I was but am no longer a member). We are told that it\u2019s not our guns \u2014 the guns of legal and responsible gun owners \u2014 that would be taken away, but those of the bad guys. But when those advocating bans don\u2019t even understand the mechanics and basic terminology of guns, it doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\n\nAll Americans should expect law enforcement agencies, which missed opportunities to stop not just the Parkland shooter, but also the shooters in the Charleston and Sutherland Springs churches and the Orlando nightclub, to be able to protect us. You can forgive conservatives if we don\u2019t believe that giving federal law enforcement officials more authority is the solution to shootings they bear some responsibility for.\n\nThat\u2019s, in part, why many gun owners insist the answer isn\u2019t a ban, but rather evaluating who can obtain these weapons. President Trump is now reportedly considering the idea of gun restraining orders, which have the ability to quickly take firearms away from those considered dangerous, like the shooter in Parkland. A variation of this law is already on the books in California. In 2016, 86 of these restraining orders were issued, and 10 were extended past the initial 21-day period they were granted for. Our side insists that people are the problem, not guns, and to make good on that we need to come to the table with ideas on how to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous individuals who have no business holding them.\n\nThis idea, popularized in a piece by National Review\u2019s David French after the Parkland shooting, isn\u2019t a panacea. But it is a middle ground for gun-rights supporters and gun-control activists to meet. Many supporters of the Second Amendment know something is broken, just as its opponents do, and ideas like Mr. French\u2019s can bring many more to the negotiating table than calling for outright bans on guns or the notion that there are no legislative solutions to the gun violence issue.\n\nBut such a compromise will require gun-control activists to confront the lie of one of their favorite talking points: that gun-rights supporters care more about guns than children.

For part 1, on the importance of voting, go here.\n\nThe modern American crusade against voter fraud has always been propelled by faith. That is, an insistent belief in things unseen \u2014 things like voters who show up at the polls pretending to be someone else, or noncitizens who try to register and vote illegally.\n\nFraud like this is so rare as to be almost unmeasurable, and yet its specter has led to dozens of strict new laws around the country. Passed in the name of electoral integrity, the laws, which usually require voters to present photo IDs at the polls or provide proof of citizenship to register, make voting harder, if not impossible, for tens of thousands of people \u2014 disproportionately minorities and others who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nThe high priest of this faith-based movement is Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate who has been preaching his gospel of deception to Republican lawmakers for years. He has won plenty of converts, even though he has failed to identify more than a tiny handful of possible cases of fraud. In his eight years as secretary of state, he has secured a total of nine convictions, only one of which was for illegal voting by a noncitizen; most were for double-voting by older Republican men.\n\nFor the past two weeks, however, Mr. Kobach has been forced to make his case in a far more rigorous setting \u2014 the fact-finding process of a federal trial. In a Kansas City courtroom, Mr. Kobach and his fellow true believers have struggled to defend a 2013 state law that requires prospective voters to prove their citizenship before they can register.\n\nIt has not gone well for Mr. Kobach. The lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Kansas residents who were blocked from voting under the new law, contends that the legislation violates federal law, which requires only that prospective voters attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. Meanwhile, it disenfranchised tens of thousands of Kansans, who were disproportionately younger voters or voters with no party affiliation.\n\nAnd how many noncitizens did the law stop from voting? Squint really hard. One would think that after all these years, Mr. Kobach would have something to show for his dogged efforts. Yet according to his own witnesses, Kansas, which has 1.8 million registered voters, has identified 129 noncitizens it says registered or tried to register since 2000. Of those 129 people, 11 actually voted, and it\u2019s not clear how many of these cases represent intentional fraud, as opposed to honest mistakes or clerical errors. But Mr. Kobach is convinced, calling these findings \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d If so, the iceberg is melting fast.\n\nMr. Kobach\u2019s game may work with partisan lawmakers, but not with federal judges. At the beginning of the trial, Mr. Kobach, who is representing himself, tried to introduce what he said were new data on the number of Kansans whose voter registrations were suspended for lacking proof of citizenship. Judge Julie Robinson of Federal District Court said no, reminding him that the deadline for introducing pretrial evidence had passed the night before. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a trial by ambush here,\u201d the judge said when Mr. Kobach tried again a few days later.\n\nHow does it feel to have your papers out of order, Mr. Kobach?\n\nOf course, restrictive voting laws like these have never been about protecting electoral integrity. They\u2019re about keeping certain people away from the ballot box, often based on who they are \u2014 or are assumed to be. On Tuesday, one of Mr. Kobach\u2019s witnesses, a political scientist, Jesse Richman, testified that up to 18,000 noncitizens have registered or tried to register in Kansas. When the A.C.L.U.\u2019s lawyer asked him about his methods for analyzing the state\u2019s list of suspended voters, Mr. Richman said that, among other things, he flagged foreign-sounding names. What about a name like \u201cCarlos Murguia,\u201d the lawyer asked. Would he flag that one? Yes, Mr. Richman said. He was then informed that Carlos Murguia is a federal district judge who sits in the courthouse where the trial is being held.\n\nIt all seems like a big joke until you remember that laws like these have already had their intended effect. In Kansas, more than 22,000 people who tried to register had their applications suspended or canceled for not having proof of citizenship. And in Wisconsin, which President Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes, a strict voter-ID law kept at least 17,000 voters from the polls in 2016.\n\nRemember also that just days after the 2016 election, Mr. Kobach scored a meeting with President-elect Trump in which he urged the passage of a nationwide proof-of-citizenship requirement. A few months later, Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Kobach to lead his so-called election integrity commission. In January, after months of futility and infighting, the commission folded, having made no findings and issued no recommendations. No surprise there \u2014 there\u2019s virtually nothing to find. There has been no epidemic of noncitizens voting, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless claim (endorsed by Mr. Kobach) that he lost the popular vote only because of millions of illegal voters. And there are hardly any examples of in-person voter fraud, the only kind that could conceivably be stopped by voter-ID laws. A federal judge once compared such laws to using \u201ca sledgehammer to hit either a real or imaginary fly on a glass coffee table.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the courts have not always brought the appropriate degree of skepticism to these laws. The Supreme Court upheld the first voter-ID law it considered, in 2008, even though the Indiana lawmakers who passed it had not identified a single case of fraud that the law would have prevented. Former Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote the opinion in that case, later called it a \u201cfairly unfortunate decision.\u201d Richard Posner, a former federal appeals court judge who also upheld the Indiana law, later said that voter-ID laws are \u201cnow widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.\u201d\n\nMore recently, courts have gotten better about questioning the evidence and rationale for these laws, striking down some of the strictest ones, in Texas and North Carolina, for deliberately discriminating against minority voters. That\u2019s the right approach. These laws masquerade as common-sense measures, but they are in truth anti-democratic shams, and it is gratifying to see them unravel in the harsh light of a federal courtroom.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard P\u00c9rez-pe\u00d1a", "body": "A package exploded early Tuesday at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, and local and federal law enforcement agencies were trying to determine whether the incident was linked to four recent bombings in Austin, Tex.\n\nThe latest explosion, in Schertz, Tex., occurred at about 12:30 a.m. local time, and injured one employee, who was not seriously hurt, local law enforcement officials said.

In 2016 Trump portrayed himself as a different kind of Republican, an economic populist who would stand up for the little guy. In practice, he has been utterly orthodox except for one thing, his willingness to break with free trade. And it\u2019s possible that he announced steel tariffs partly in an effort to swing a district in what used to be steel country. Or he may have been trying to steal Stormy Daniels\u2019s thunder.

These days there are about 10 times as many hospital workers as steel workers in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area \u2014 and surely at least some voters realize that G.O.P. efforts to slash health care threaten their jobs as well as their coverage.\n\nFinally, Republicans pulled out their old standby: trying to distract voters from their economic agenda by appealing to racial, cultural and religious enmity. That\u2019s what Ed Gillespie tried in the Virginia gubernatorial race, and in this latest campaign Saccone proclaimed that Democrats are motivated by \u201chatred for our country\u201d and \u201chatred of God.\u201d But it didn\u2019t work either time.\n\nWhy not?

President Trump\u2019s tariffs and other trade actions mark the abandonment of a 70-year American effort to lead the world to a more open trade system.\n\n\u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win,\u201d Trump tweeted this month \u2014 an inane echo of Cheney\u2019s hubris about the Iraq war.\n\nThe second conflict that Trump is hurtling toward is with Iran. Unless he chooses some face-saving compromise, it looks as if Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal by May 12.\n\nThe risk is that Iran responds by restarting its nuclear program. This would lead to soaring tensions, the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran, a risk of Saudi-Iranian conflict and a danger of war between the United States and Iran.\n\nMike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of state, is very smart \u2014 and very hawkish on Iran. Moreover, Trump is considering replacing his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, with John Bolton, who is not a mere hawk so much as a pterosaur.\n\nThe final risk, of course, is a war with North Korea. We may have a reprieve for a couple of months if Trump\u2019s face-to-face with Kim Jong-un goes ahead, but I think Americans are too reassured by the prospect of a summit meeting.\n\nThe basic problem: There\u2019s almost no chance that North Korea will agree to the kind of verifiable denuclearization that Trump talks about. Then the danger is that if a summit collapses, there\u2019s no room to restart the process with lower-level diplomats. At that point, the risk of military conflict soars because all alternatives seem exhausted.\n\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s snap decision to accept Kim\u2019s invitation to meet underscores the risk of a mercurial president leaping into actions \u2014 which is one of the reasons we got into the mess in Iraq.

Kori Schake, who worked in the Bush White House during the Iraq war, notes that Trump sometimes has spoken about North Korea the way Bush administration officials did about Iraq, and she adds: \u201cI worry that President Trump could lead to war on the Korean Peninsula or against Iran, or by miscalculation in a number of other places where adversaries misread his intent. The president considers his unpredictability advantageous, when it is more likely to have explosive consequences.\u201d\n\nLooking back, the biggest problem 15 years ago was that the administration was stuck in an echo chamber and far too optimistic, and Democrats and the news media alike mostly rolled over. Journalists too often acted as lap dogs, not watchdogs \u2014 and today I fear that we may be so busy chasing the latest shiny object that we miss an abyss ahead.\n\nI also frankly doubt that we as a nation have learned the lesson from Iraq. A recent Pew survey found that 43 percent of Americans still believe that invading Iraq was the correct decision.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Nicholas Fandos", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats released a heavily redacted memorandum on Saturday that was drafted to counter Republican claims that top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials had abused their powers in spying on a former Trump campaign aide.\n\nPresident Trump blocked the memo\u2019s outright release two weeks ago, with the White House counsel warning that the document \u201ccontains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages.\u201d Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee had since been haggling with the F.B.I. over redactions.\n\nDemocrats have insisted that Mr. Trump\u2019s deference to national security concerns in the case was hypocritical and politically motivated. Just a week before blocking their memo\u2019s release, the president had ignored similar objections from the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to declassify the contents of a rival Republican memo, which was based on the same underlying documents. Mr. Trump asserted, incorrectly, that the Republican document vindicated him in the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nThe release of the Democratic rebuttal was expected to be the final volley, at least for now, in a bitter partisan fight over surveillance that has driven deep fissures through the once-bipartisan Intelligence Committee and at times pitted Mr. Trump against his own Justice Department and F.B.I.\n\nThe dispute and the dueling memos center on applications by the F.B.I. in October 2016 to secure a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to spy on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser suspected of being a Russian agent.\n\nRepublicans, in their three-and-a-half-page memo, claim that top law enforcement officials seriously misled the court by failing to disclose that they were relying in part on research financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Mazzetti", "body": "In one example of Mr. Nader\u2019s influential connections, which has not been previously reported, last fall he received a detailed report from a top Trump fund-raiser, Elliott Broidy, about a private meeting with the president in the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Broidy owns a private security company with hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with the United Arab Emirates, and he extolled to Mr. Trump a paramilitary force that his company was developing for the country. He also lobbied the president to meet privately \u201cin an informal setting\u201d with the Emirates\u2019 military commander and de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan; to back the U.A.E.\u2019s hawkish policies in the region; and to fire Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.\n\nA copy of Mr. Broidy\u2019s memorandum about the meeting was provided to The New York Times by someone critical of the Emirati influence in Washington.\n\nMr. Trump has closely allied himself with the Emiratis, embracing their strong support for the new heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia, as well as their confrontational approaches toward Iran and their neighbor Qatar. In the case of Qatar, which is the host to a major United States military base, Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of an Emirati- and Saudi-led blockade against that country has put him openly at odds with his secretary of state \u2014 as well as with years of American policy.\n\nMr. Nader, 58, made frequent trips to the White House during the early months of the Trump administration, meeting with Stephen K. Bannon and Jared Kushner to discuss American policy toward the Persian Gulf states in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, according to people familiar with the meetings. By some accounts, it was Mr. Bannon who pushed for him to gain access to White House policymakers. Others said Mr. Kushner backed him.\n\nReached by phone last month, Mr. Nader said he had dinner guests and would call back. He did not, and attempts to reach him over several weeks were unsuccessful. Mr. Nader\u2019s lawyer did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Broidy said his memorandum had been stolen through sophisticated hacking.\n\n\u201cWe have reason to believe this hack was sponsored and carried out by registered and unregistered agents of Qatar seeking to punish Mr. Broidy for his strong opposition to state-sponsored terrorism,\u201d said the spokesman, Ron Bonjean, adding that Mr. Broidy had also made the accusation in a letter to the Qatari ambassador in Washington.\n\nYousef al-Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador to the United States, declined to comment. Axios first reported Mr. Mueller\u2019s questioning of Mr. Nader.\n\nMr. Nader has long been a mysterious figure. In the 1990s, he presided over an unusual Washington magazine, Middle East Insight, which sometimes provided a platform for Arab, Israeli and Iranian officials to express their views to a Washington audience.\n\nOn the magazine\u2019s 15th anniversary, in 1996, a West Virginia congressman praised Mr. Nader on the floor of the House, calling him a \u201crecognized expert on the region\u201d and pointing out that the magazine had been a showcase for prominent figures such as President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, and Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n\n\u201cHe always struck me as a person who really thought he should be in the eye of the storm trying to make things happen,\u201d said Frederic Hof, a former top American diplomat who knew Mr. Nader in the 1990s.\n\nLate in that decade, Mr. Nader convinced the Clinton administration that he had valuable contacts in the Syrian government and took on a secretive role trying to broker a peace deal between Israel and Syria. Working with Ronald S. Lauder, the American cosmetics magnate and prominent donor to Jewish causes, Mr. Nader shuttled between Damascus and Jerusalem, using his contacts in both capitals to try to negotiate a truce.\n\n\u201cIn the 1990s, George was a very effective under-the-radar operator in the peace process,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel and a member of a team put together by President Bill Clinton to negotiate peace deals between Israel and its neighbors.\n\nIndeed, a man with a once very public profile in Washington effectively vanished from the capital\u2019s policy scene, and his magazine ceased publication in 2002.\n\nDuring the middle part of the last decade, Mr. Nader appears to have spent most of his time in the Middle East, especially in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. He developed close ties to national security officials in the Bush White House.\n\nErik Prince, the founder of Blackwater USA, the private security company now known as Academi, at one point hired Mr. Nader to help the company generate business deals in Iraq. In a 2010 deposition that Mr. Prince gave as part of a lawsuit against the company, Mr. Prince described Mr. Nader as a \u201cbusiness development consultant that we retained in Iraq\u201d because the company was looking for contracts with the Iraqi government.\n\nMr. Prince said that Mr. Nader was unsuccessful in getting contracts, and that senior Blackwater officials did not work directly with him.\n\n\u201cGeorge pretty much worked on his own,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the beginning of the Obama era, Mr. Nader tried to parlay his ties to the Syrian government into access to senior members of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy team, while also seeking to advance business deals with former advisers to President George W. Bush.\n\nBy the time of the 2016 election, he had become an adviser to Prince Mohammed of the U.A.E. According to people familiar with the relationship, it was around Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration that Mr. Nader first met Mr. Broidy, the Republican fund-raiser, who is a California-based investor with a strong interest in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Broidy\u2019s security company, Circinus, that provides services to both United States agencies and foreign governments. Run by former American military officers, Circinus promises on its website that it \u201ccan employ personnel worldwide to provide physical force protection to individuals, groups or facilities within austere, hostile environments\u201d as well as conducting \u201cspecialized operations, infrastructure protection, and training.\u201d\n\nMr. Broidy, 60, had once stumbled into legal trouble over payments to a political figure. In 2009, he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for providing $1 million in illegal gifts to New York State pension authorities, including trips, payouts and a secret investment in a film called \u201cChooch\u201d that was produced by an official\u2019s brother. In exchange for the gifts, the state pension fund invested $250 million with an Israeli-based investment management firm that Mr. Broidy had founded. He reimbursed the pension fund for $18 million in fees.\n\nAfter the inauguration, Mr. Nader became friendly with Mr. Broidy and introduced him to Prince Mohammed. Circinus then signed contracts with the United Arab Emirates worth several hundred million dollars, according to people familiar with the arrangement.\n\nBy Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy had evidently become close enough to both the prince and Mr. Nader to send a detailed memorandum to an encrypted email address used by Mr. Nader recounting his advocacy on the U.A.E.\u2019s behalf during the meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office amid an afternoon of stops throughout the White House.\n\nAn ally of the White House involved in one of the initiatives discussed \u2014 a counterterrorism task force \u2014 said Mr. Broidy sent the memorandum because he had been asked by the crown prince to seek the president\u2019s views on the idea. Mr. Broidy believed that the creation of the task force would aid American security, this person said.\n\nAccording to the memo, Mr. Broidy repeatedly pressed Mr. Trump to meet privately with Prince Mohammed, preferably in an informal setting outside the White House.\n\n\u201cI offered that M.B.Z. is available to come to the U.S. very soon and preferred a quiet meeting in New York or New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Nader, using the crown prince\u2019s initials. \u201cPresident Trump agreed that a meeting with M.B.Z. was a good idea.\u201d\n\nMr. Broidy wrote that he had twice told Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that the crown prince \u201cpreferred an informal setting to meet one on one with President Trump.\u201d But General McMaster resisted. \u201cLTG McMaster smiled and replied that heads of state usually meet in the White House,\u201d as \u201cprotocol dictates.\u201d\n\nIn his memorandum, Mr. Broidy recounted that he had told Mr. Trump that he recently returned from meeting with the crown prince about Circinus work for the U.A.E. Mr. Broidy had explained \u201cthe exciting and transformational plan being constructed by M.B.Z. to develop a counterterrorism task force,\u201d which Mr. Broidy told the president was \u201cinspired\u201d by his speech at a conference in Riyadh.\n\nMr. Broidy was harshly critical of the crown prince\u2019s neighbor and nemesis, Qatar. The U.A.E. has accused Qatar, an American ally, of using its satellite network Al Jazeera to promote political Islam, among other allegations.\n\nMr. Broidy reported to Mr. Nader that he had told the president that Qatar was \u201ca television station with a country\u201d and that \u201cthe axis of evil was North Korea, Iran and Qatar.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also asked about the job performance of Mr. Tillerson \u2014 who had deviated from the president by publicly criticizing the isolation of Qatar \u2014 and Mr. Broidy said that the secretary of state should be fired.\n\nIn between the discussions of diplomacy, business and statecraft, Mr. Broidy wrote, he and the president \u201cspoke for several minutes about politics and the fund-raising efforts for the midterm elections as well as the state of affairs at the R.N.C.,\u201d or the Republican National Committee.", "link": null, "source": "The New York Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
