[{"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "After the tragic school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14, which left 17 people dead, the calls for new gun laws have reached a fever pitch again. Of course, Congress will pass no new laws on the subject. There\u2019s no need, as it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that enforcement of the current laws that could have prevented shooter Nikolas Cruz from obtaining firearms was egregiously absent. Federal, state, and local authorities failed miserably to act upon the many red flags presented by this disturbed man. Yet, at the state-level, it\u2019s a different ballgame.\u00a0\nIn Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott signed into law an age limit increase on long guns. You now have to be 21 to purchase such firearms, which is an unconstitutional infringement on law-abiding Americans\u2019 Second Amendment rights. The National Rifle Association has rightfully filed a lawsuit over this provision. In Oregon, a new initiative from a religious group is taking it a step forward. They want to ban any semiautomatic rifle with a detachable magazine, and that can hold more than ten rounds. They also want current owners of these firearms, law-abiding Americans, to take them out of the state, register them, sell it to a FFL dealer, destroy it, or turn them over. That\u2019s right, folks\u2014full-blown gun confiscation. Right now, the anti-gun church group is collecting signatures. The hope is that they fall short (via KGW8):\n\n\nFiled by an interfaith religious group in Portland, Initiative Petition 42 would also require legal gun owners to surrender or register their assault weapons or face felony charges, according to language released Tuesday.\nThe group said it aims to get enough signatures to put the measure before voters in the November general election. They would need 88,000 signatures by July 6 to get the measure on the ballot.\nThe proposal defines an assault weapon as any semiautomatic rifle that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine, and any feature like folding or telescoping stock, or that can accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition.\n[\u2026]\nThe proposal would require any person in legal possession of an assault weapon to sell, surrender or remove the weapon from the state, or render it inoperable, within 120 days of passage, according to the language.\nText of Oregon Initiative 42 by Statesman Journal on Scribd\nOh, and of course, the police and military are exempt. Even Oregon Democrats aren\u2019t going near this because they know the political consequences, said state Rep. Bill Post. It captures what everyone on the conservative, gun rights-supporting side has always known about the gun control movement: their agenda is confiscation and the abolition of the Second Amendment. It\u2019s why we can\u2019t trust them\u2014and never should. There are no good people of faith on this subject. Do I wish we could have a debate on gun politics? Yes\u2014but not with insane people. Also, to the people in the video who support the \u201cassault rifle\u201d ban, they\u2019re already banned. No new sales of automatic rifles post-1986 are permitted. Those who obtain an ATF tax stamp for weapons under the 1934 National Firearms Act, which includes automatic firearms, must go through a background check, have their weapon registered with the ATF, and pay the fee. The process could take up to a year or more, but, again, these transfers are only for weapons pre-1986.\nAssault rifles are fully-automatic guns and new sales of them to civilians has been banned since 1986.\n\nAssault weapons are semi-automatic guns and there are likely tens of millions of them in civilian hands.\n\nSemi-automatic firearms likely make up a large majority of all guns.\n\u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) February 23, 2018Fully-automatic firearms that were registered under the National Firearms Act before 1986 were grandfathered in  are still legal.\n\u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) October 2, 2017However, in order to obtain a legal fully-automatic firearm you must apply to the ATF, pay a $200 tax,  register with the ATF.\n\u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) October 2, 2017Fingerprints and photographs are required to be submitted along with your registration application.\n\u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) October 2, 2017", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Timothy Meads", "body": "Jake Tapper interviewed Sen.

Drucker (@DavidMDrucker) March 23, 2018\nUnlike the numbers I showcased a few days ago, this trend has been heading in the opposite direction. \u00a0In other words, while gun control advocates have made strides in favor of certain reforms at the relative margins, they're losing the fundamental debate about guns (especially regarding the most common category of firearm owned by Americans). \u00a0Also note the partisan split:\nThese findings represent a reversal from 1999, when a majority \u2014 52 percent \u2014 said gun ownership reduces safety. And they come at a time when 47 percent of American adults say they have a firearm in the household, which is up from 44 percent in 1999. The numbers also highlight a stark divide by party, with 89 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of independents saying gun ownership increases safety, versus\u00a0just 28 percent of Democrats who agree.\nNearly six-in-ten Americans currently say that owning a gun for self-defense increases one's safety. \u00a0Heading into the 21st century, a majority of Americans believed the opposite. \u00a0That's a big swing. \u00a0And tens of millions of people have put this believe into practice, with nearly half of all US adults reporting that \"they have a firearm in [their] household.\" \u00a0By the way, this is not a GOP-friendly polling series or individual survey either. \u00a0Less than one-third of Democrats agree with the new American consensus on this issue, placing the country's left political flank far out of step with everyone else. \u00a0Close to 90 percent of Republicans take the opposite view, as do roughly two-thirds of independents. Meanwhile, it's also important to maintain data-based perspective on patterns and potential \"solutions\" as we engage in emotionally-fraught discussions over controversial policy changes. \u00a0No one can blame the thousands of students who will attend a gun control march in Washington this weekend for harboring an appalled sense of urgency to disrupt what feels like a frightening and unacceptable status quo. \u00a0Their feelings are valid and their voices are important (especially when they're not slandering others). \u00a0But so are the rights of law-abiding gun owners -- and so are facts like these:\nOver the last 25 years, the U.S. gun homicide rate has fallen by over half while the gun violence victimization rate has fallen by about 70%.

That\u2019s why there is so much pent-up passion for Beto, who is emblematic of the Democratic new wave, unabashedly liberal and well-financed.\nThe El Paso Democrat is 45 and has a background every bit as interesting as his name. Beto is a nickname for Roberto (his first and middle names are Robert Francis) and his surname is Irish. He\u2019s fluent in Spanish and represents a Texas district that is 75% Hispanic (Texas is 28% Hispanic). He is dead set against Trump\u2019s border wall.\nRoy Moore was a tainted candidate. Virginia was a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. I\u2019m not seeing how this is evidence of a wave. Any candidate, but Roy Moore, would have beaten Doug Jones\u2014and Jones will be defeated when he\u2019s up in 2020 if a solid Republican candidate arises. That shouldn\u2019t be hard.

Bush\u2019s presidency in 2008, according to data obtained from the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Guy Benson", "body": "This isn't the first time this liberal Harvard Law fixture has crossed his own party on Trump and alleged collusion (he's been increasingly vocal on other issues, too), and it probably won't be the last. \u00a0In an op/ed for The Hill, Alan Dershowitz argues that Robert Mueller's special counsel probe is doing a disservice to what ought to be the overarching national goal of thoroughly investigating the extent of Russia's meddling in the 2016 US elections -- and taking the requisite steps to ensure it doesn't happen again in the future. \u00a0A taste of his argument, which can be read in full here:\nPresident Trump is right in saying that a special counsel should never have been appointed to investigate the so-called Russian connection. There was no evidence of any crime committed by the Trump administration. But there was plenty of evidence that Russian operatives had tried to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, and perhaps other elections, in the hope of destabilizing democracy. Yet, appointing a special counsel to look for crimes, behind the closed doors of a grand jury, was precisely the wrong way to address this ongoing challenge to our democracy. The right way would have been (and still is) to appoint a nonpartisan investigative commission, such as the one appointed following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, to conduct a broad and open investigation of the Russian involvement in our elections.\nThe vice of a special counsel is that he is supposed to find crimes, and if he comes up empty-handed, after spending lots of taxpayer money, then he is deemed a failure. If he can\u2019t charge the designated target \u2014 in this case, the president \u2014 he must at least charge some of those close to the target, even if it is for crimes unrelated to the special counsel\u2019s core mandate. By indicting these low-hanging fruits, he shows that he is trying. Maybe those lesser defendants will flip and sing against higher-ups, but the problem is that the pressure to sing may cause certain defendants to \u201ccompose,\u201d meaning make up or enhance evidence in order to get a better deal for themselves. In this case, the appointment of a special counsel has done more harm than good.\u00a0It has politicized our justice system beyond repair.\nHis concluding suggestion is for Mueller to voluntarily suspend his investigation and for Congress to appoint a bipartisan blue panel commission to dig into the Russia question. This idea will surely appeal to many Trump supporters, and has obviously pleased the president himself:\n\u201cSpecial Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2018\nReality check: The special counsel investigation isn't going anywhere until it's over. \u00a0There is a zero percent chance Congress will recommend that Mueller stop his work or initiate yet another investigation designed to supersede whatever Mueller and his team may be up to. \u00a0Regardless of one's thoughts on the efficacy of the special counsel model (many in the GOP are presently calling for another special counsel, mind you) Mueller is a top-flight professional whose integrity is renowned. \u00a0He's been on the job for many months, and any effort to derail his process or prevent his conclusions from coming to light will be widely viewed as a crisis-level development. \u00a0As I've written many times, once Mueller was put on the job, it became essential that he be allowed to finish that job. \u00a0Plus, the Senate Intelligence Committee is acting as the very sort of fact-finding, solutions-oriented bipartisan panel envisioned by Dershowitz. \u00a0Even if it's not a full-blown national commission, the partnership of Richard Burr and Mark Warner has been constructive -- to the point that even Donald Trump, Jr. has praised the committee's professionalism and focus. \u00a0As for the current (quasi-regular) wave of panic sweeping DC about Trump potentially firing Mueller, it sounds like Speaker Ryan has been hearing the same things Sean Hannity has:\n\"I\u2019ve received assurances that his firing is not even under consideration,\" says @SpeakerRyan, asked about Pres Trump's attacks on Special Counsel Mueller.

The time is now. \u00a0My personal manifesto is that government should never get involved in an issue unless an ongoing clear and present danger exists to large numbers of people, and that any regulation or legislation has a sunset provision.Here we are.In 1974, Israel endured the Ma\u2019alot Massacre in which \u201cPalestinian\u201d terrorists took 115 people hostage at Netiv Meir Elementary School. \u00a0Twenty-two children and three others were killed and 68 injured. \u00a0Israel now requires schools with 100 or more students to have a guard posted. The civilian police force handles the entire security system of all schools from kindergarten through college. \u00a0The Ministry of Education funds shelters and fences, reinforces school buses, and hires and trains guards.Guards don\u2019t just stand around. \u00a0They check everyone entering, and engage threats.And yeah, they\u2019ve got guns.The lawful purposes for carrying guns are very clear: protect school personnel and students, create a sense of security, deter the ill-intentioned, and provide self-defense.\u00a0Common sense. \u00a0 Except to the illogical dullards who claim that \u201cadding guns to schools won\u2019t fix anything\u201d and are fixated on the NRA and the ridiculous notions that gun laws magically stop criminals and crazy people from obtaining one of the 300 million guns in our country.But more to the point, Israel\u2019s Police Community  Civil Guard Department have a preventative care program that encourages safe behavior and offers violence protection strategies in normal situations. \u00a0Yet students are also trained in how to respond to an active shooter situation.Ben Goldstein, an American who made aliyah to Israel, and now serves as volunteer security and supporter of IDF soldiers, says America is behind the curve. \u00a0Nevertheless, he says, it doesn\u2019t take much for students and teachers to protect themselves.\u201cBarricade, barricade. Are desks movable? \u00a0Is the teacher\u2019s desk movable? \u00a0Can they barricade inside of 20 seconds? If the shooter gets in, the kids should take whatever they\u2019ve got and attack. \u00a0They can\u2019t just sit there frozen or they will die. \u00a0America does earthquake drills, why not active shooter drills? \u00a0 More kids have been killed by shooters than earthquakes.\u201dBarricading works, says Goldstein.In an active shooter situation, where a gunman is roaming a campus, five minutes is a lifetime, enough time for law enforcement to get to the scene. \u00a0\u201cIn those five minutes, the shooter will have to move from class to class, reload, clear malfunctions, all that stuff takes time. \u00a0And during gunfire lulls, kids must be taught to do something. \u00a0Don\u2019t freeze.Moving once gets you out of that deer-in-headlights space. \u00a0Take command of the classroom.\u201dThere is no other way, says Goldstein, and \u201csometimes children must take matters into their own hands.If the school has no proper security \u2013 two guards in case one gets shot, and no active shooter protocol, and no doors to withstand an attack \u2013 then the child needs to run as fast as they can AWAY from the shooter.\u201dBecause right now, America is the deer-in-headlights. \u00a0Gun control debates are a distraction and impractical, and criminals ignore laws anyway.Crazy people are obviously not being dealt with properly \u2013 students at Parkland even predicted this would happen.The only solution is for America to toughen up. \u00a0We have a pugilist for a president, and that is long overdue. \u00a0Now its time for President Trump to fight for our children by wielding government power in the proper manner, to do something that any reasoned American would agree with. \u00a0Instead of handing out participation trophies, let\u2019s make our kids into the self-reliant, pro-active defenders of themselves and others.Mr. President, the time is now.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Reeves", "body": "Political rebellion is brewing in Southern California over the state\u2019s official sanctuary policies.

After all, every left-wing activist group had, one day after the shooting, \u00a0started sweeping into town to organize what they and their fellow travelers in the media all claimed was an \u201corganic, grassroots\u201d response to the tragedy. If they couldn\u2019t wait 24 hours before attaching the marionette strings to those kids, the fact that they waited 2 weeks before attempting to use them to line their own pockets is as close to decency as they\u2019re going to get.\nWith that in mind, and as liberals line up behind a shield made of children to march on the Second Amendment, it\u2019s important to remember what happens when you attempt to compromise with people whose ultimate goal is your obliteration and why no amount of compromise will ever be enough.\nThere is an example from our recent past that shows how compromise works when it comes to big government liberals. It may not be perfect, and it isn\u2019t pretty, but it is what happens when you accept the concept of diminishing the rights of innocent people over the actions of the guilty.\nYou have to dig in your heels and make clear you will never, ever acquiesce to their demands. This has been the tactic of the National Rifle Association when it comes to the Second Amendment, and it is the correct choice. But it hasn\u2019t been the choice made by others in the past.\u00a0\nOne particular group that has seen \u201ccompromise\u201d used as a way to strip them of their rights is smokers. Now smokers aren\u2019t exactly a group of people who are going to elicit a lot of sympathy or concern from people (junkies, sure, but people who use a legal product are fair game when it comes to attack, which is weird). But what happened to smokers is a useful tool for illustrating why the American people should not compromise with liberals when it comes to one of our fundamental freedoms.\u00a0\nComedian and podcaster Adam Carolla has made this point many times on his show, so I can\u2019t take credit for it. But it certainly exemplifies how a slope quickly becomes slippery and, if your interest is simply compromise, you can compromise your rights away.\nTo paraphrase Carolla, there was a time when you could smoke in restaurants. They are private property, and if the owner wanted to allow smoking, smoking was allowed. Then the government (liberals) decided smokers should be herded into their own area of a restaurant, the \u201csmoking section.\u201d So they went so smokers in the main dining room and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need you to sit over here, in this side room You can smoke all you want, we just don\u2019t want other people to smell it while they\u2019re eating. You understand, right?\u201d\nSmokers, not wanting to cause a scene and knowing some non-smokers could be annoyed, happily complied.\u00a0\nThen the government comes back and says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need you to move to the bar area when you smoke. People are drinking there, and eating here, so it\u2019d just be better if you moved over there.\u201d\nSmokers picked up their ashtrays, \u201cSure thing,\u201d they said, and moved to the bar.\nThe government comes back and says they need smokers to step out front. \u201cIf you could just stand out front and smoke, that would be much better for everyone, OK? Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s an awning and a heater, so you\u2019ll be protected from the weather.\u201d\nSmokers picked up and moved outside.\n\u201cIf you could move 50 feet from the door, that would be very helpful,\u201d the government said next. \u201cPeople smell smoke as they walk in the door and we don\u2019t want that. Thanks.\u201d\nAnd now smokers are stuck down the block, wet and wondering how this happened. If someone had come up to them at first and said, \u201cHey, get down the street if you want to smoke,\u201d it never would have happened, they wouldn\u2019t have stood for it. But little by little, inch by inch, they moved because each move was small and seemed like a compromise.\u00a0\nNow smokers are never getting back inside, even if the owners of a bar or restaurant want them to. Their rights are gone, the private property rights of the owners are gone, and it was all done in the name of compromise.\nThere is no compromise with someone who doesn\u2019t want you to exist, there is only incrementally losing ground until you no longer exist. A right diminished will never return, government does not cede back power once seized.\u00a0\nThe NRA is right to hold its ground, it\u2019s why the organization exists in the first place. Liberals are not honest brokers when it comes to the issue of guns, and neither is the media. Trying to appease leftists never works because nothing short of everything they want is ever enough for them.\nIf people who support the Second Amendment start to compromise with liberals whose ultimate goal is to strip everyone of their right to defend themselves, it won\u2019t be too long before they\u2019re out on the street in the rain with the smokers.

I'll return to the former in a moment, but on the latter, it looks like Democrats -- who've already rejected the White House's broadly-supported 'four pillars' DACA compromise proposal -- are also uninterested in a narrower swap. \u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reports:\nTrump also pushed Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in recent days to close a narrow deal that would protect immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for three years in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funding, according to two Republican officials familiar with the discussions...Democrats were pushing for protections for a larger pool of immigrants, but a Democratic aide said the White House was rejecting that approach. The aide said Tuesday that there are continued musings about a deal but that chances for an agreement were remote.\nRepublicans offered a three-year extension of DACA for all current recipients (the original Trump plan turned down by Democrats would have covered hundreds of thousands of additional eligible 'DREAMers' who never enrolled in DACA) in exchange for $25 billion in wall and border security funding. Other (again, popular) elements of the original plan were off the table, including chain migration and the 'diversity visa' lottery. Democrats have apparently once again said no, leaving prospects for a DACA resolution at a standstill [see update]. \u00a0DACA technically expired earlier this month, but Democrats seem to be comfortable allowing the issue to languish in the courts until they have more power and leverage to fashion legislation that's more to their liking. \u00a0\n\nAs an aside, it's infuriating to conservatives that an executive action conjured into existence by the stroke of a president's pen cannot simply and quickly be undone with another presidential signature. \u00a0It remains unlikely that the judiciary can permanently block Trump on this, but they can gum up the works for awhile. For their part, Democrats are risking angering an element of their base by again declining to play shutdown politics with DACA, but their lone previous attempt to do so ended badly for the party. \u00a0The only \"concession\" they \"won\" as they retreated from that misadventure was an agreement from Mitch McConnell to allow a series of immigration votes in the future. And when that future arrived, the Senate agreed to...nothing. \u00a0Speaking of which, let's turn to gun policy:\nFix NICS is still up in the air for omnibus Fox is told Ryan and McConnell want to include it. But Democrats are reluctant to include it because they feel that\u2019s all which would ever be addressed on guns.\n\u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) March 21, 2018\nWaPo has more: \"The White House and Republicans also pushed for inclusion of a measure known as the Fix NICS bill that would compel federal agencies to more correctly and accurately report information to the national criminal background check system. Democrats were seeking to couple that provision with a gun measure of their own.\" \u00a0In the past, Democrats criticized Republicans for insisting that concealed carry reciprocity be linked to 'Fix NICS,' which was a fair point. \u00a0But now the roles have apparently reversed, with Republicans offering the bipartisan background check bill as a standalone element within the larger package -- and it's Democrats threatening to axe it if it's not coupled with more gun control.\n\n\u00a0We'll see if this cynical approach is rewarded in the final legislation. \u00a0Making consensus progress on background checks and school safety should be no-brainers, but agenda-driven poison pills are capable of derailing almost anything, it seems. \u00a0That's how gun votes have gone in recent years. \u00a0Finally, Obamacare funding is a flashpoint in this debate. \u00a0Will Congress agree to provide funding for the failing law (this is an interesting development on that topic, incidentally), or not? \u00a0And while we're on the subject, shouldn't the GOP use this opportunity to further dismantle President Obama's signature, unsuccessful domestic policy achievement?\nWhy not use the omnibus spending bill to repeal/dramatically curtail Obamacare's employer mandate -- implementation of which Obama unilaterally/illegally delayed several times  drastic changes to which have been supported by multiple Senate Democrats? https://t.co/Rlvt0bldIP\n\u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) March 21, 2018", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Katie Pavlich", "body": "President Donald Trump is expected to fire VA Secretary David Shulkin and is strongly considering replacing him with U.S. Army Veteran Pete Hegseth, according to three sources who spoke to Townhall under the condition of anonymity.

Well, there\u2019s a DOJ report that\u2019s about to be released that details how the top FBI official misled investigators and signed off on a media disclosure that detailed the warring state of affairs between the bureau and the Department of Justice concerning the investigation into the Clinton Foundation (via WaPo):\nThe Justice Department inspector general is preparing a damaging report on former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, alleging he was responsible for approving an improper media disclosure, two people familiar with the matter said. One of the people said McCabe will also be accused of misleading investigators about his actions.\nThe report is a part of Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s broad review of the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\nDuring that work, inspector general\u2019s investigators found that McCabe had authorized the disclosure of information to the Wall Street Journal for an October 2016 story that examined feuding inside the FBI and Justice Department around the handling of a separate investigation into Clinton\u2019s family foundation, two people familiar with the case said.\nThose probing the matter believe that McCabe, who stepped down in January, misled them when they initially inquired about the subject, though one person familiar with the forthcoming report said McCabe disputes that he intentionally misled investigators.\nIt is unclear how McCabe is said to have misled investigators.\u00a0\nGuy wrote previously about what caused McCabe to leave prior to his pre-determined retirement in March. It was the DOJ inspector general, who found something disconcerting, which prompted FBI Director Chris Wray to order McCabe into another office. It would have been a demotion, so McCabe decided to exit early.\u00a0\nMcCabe has been a controversial figure at the bureau. He\u2019s directly mentioned in the text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and bureau attorney Lisa Page. The number of messages are in the tens of thousands, but they\u2019re pro-Hillary and explicitly anti-Trump. This is not something you can tolerate during a counterintelligence investigation into Russia-Trump collusion, which Strzok signed off on in July of 2016. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s tolerable when you\u2019re investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, which Strzok was also apart of\u2014and there\u2019s even a text from Page wondering if the FBI was going too hard on the former first lady. The allegation of the fix being in is palpable. When Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who now heads the FBI\u2019s collusion probe, found out about the texts last summer, he removed Strzok and transferred him to human resources in August of 2017. Strzok was a top counterintelligence agent.\u00a0\nThe other eyebrow raising text was one sent by Strzok to Page on August 15, 2016, where the former mentions meeting with \u201cAndy,\u201d McCabe, and mentions an \u201cinsurance policy.\u201d That insurance is alleged to be the Trump dossier, compiled by a British ex-spook who was contracted by Fusion GPS after their services were retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign. It was opposition research that looks like was used to secure a FISA warrant to spy on former Trump adviser Carter Page. \u00a0The two also discussed ways to skirt federal records regulations, so why are they still at the FBI?

Actually, in a word, it was \u201cforeign.\u201d The Democrat Party is now a foreign party in their own country. They no longer have any understanding of what people born in America think or feel.\u00a0It's perfectly fine to be respectfully opposed to the politics of one party or president. That's acceptable. That\u2019s as American as apple pie. But that\u2019s not what happened on Tuesday night.\u00a0Democrats were outed as the party that is rooting for America's failure. Rooting against a booming economy. Rooting for misery, instead of prosperity. Rooting against job creation. Rooting against a booming stock market. Rooting against employee bonuses. Angry about the lowest black unemployment ever. Angry about the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever. Angry at the lowest female unemployment in 18 years.\u00a0They openly frowned, grimaced, groaned and looked sick to their stomachs when President Trump celebrated the American flag\u2026the national anthem\u2026\u00a0American freedom\u2026\u00a0and American opportunity. Bizarre. Self-destructive behavior.But wait it gets worse. Democrats appeared to be on the side of murderous MS-13 gangs. When Trump touted legislation to help stop gang violence, drug dealing and murder by vicious MS-13 gangs\u2026and when Trump introduced the parents of two young girls murdered by MS-13 killers\u2026Democrats booed and groaned.\u00a0Democrats clearly believe discussing murders by illegal aliens is \u201cracist.\u201d Democrats clearly believe Trump has to be Hitler or KKK to publicly admit there are people of color (gasp) murdering innocent Americans. This was the second worst moment of disconnect in American political history.Now to the single worst disconnect ever. Amnesty-loving Democrat Congressman Luis Gutierrez WALKED OUT upon hearing chants of\u00a0\u201cUSA, USA!\u201d\u00a0It was too much for him. He appeared to be on the verge of tears. Democrats consoled him. To Democrats, it\u2019s now\u00a0\u201cracist\u201d\u00a0to love your country.The Democrats\u2019 performance at the SOTU was shocking. Because if they had an ounce of common sense they could at least act like they love America, act like patriots, act\u00a0respectful to parents of kids murdered by illegal alien gangs. Any sane politician would have acted civil - just to fool enough voters to win elections. Not these Democrats. They suffer from TID -\u00a0\u201cTrump Insanity Disorder.\u201d They are on tilt. Trump triggers them to acts of self-destruction. They\u2019ve lost their minds.Turn out the lights. There is no one left to support the Democrat Party we saw on Tuesday night, except for illegal aliens, radicals, Marxists, felons and welfare addicts.\u00a0A booming economy is a step backwards to this group. The American flag is something to be ashamed of. God is a curse. And job creation is a sin. It's clear they are the party that wants to\u00a0\u201cMAKE AMERICA MISERABLE AGAIN.\u201dThis was the night the Democrat Party committed political suicide.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Reeves", "body": "On Monday, the city government of Los Alamitos rose up in defiance of California\u2019s sanctuary state law by voting in favor of an ordinance that exempts local authorities from obeying potentially unconstitutional state limits on federal immigration enforcement.\nKnown euphemistically as the \u201cCalifornia Values Act,\u201d California Senate Bill 54 (SB 54), which went into effect at the start of this year, established the state as the premier destination for illegal immigrants who want to circumvent federal law. The law places a whole slew of limits on state and local police designed to prevent them from cooperating with federal law enforcement to deport illegals from the country, including but not limited to:\n1) Restricting police from detaining illegal aliens in response to requests from federal immigration authorities\n2) Prohibiting them from asking anyone they interact with about whether or not they are in the U.S. illegally\n3) Preventing them from using their money and law enforcement personnel to \u201cinvestigate, interrogate, detain, detect, or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes\u201d\nUnhappy with SB 54\u2019s blatant attempt to subvert the U.S. Constitution and undermine the rule of law, Los Alamitos City Council member Warren Kusumoto introduced an ordinance to nullify the bill and direct municipal police to cooperate with federal law enforcement. (Read the ordinance here by searching for \"ORDINANCE NO. 2018-03.\")\nOn Monday evening, hundreds of locals gathered both inside and outside the city\u2019s council chambers to attend a hearing about the ordinance. Given the small population of the municipality (roughly 11,600), community turnout was quite impressive. From the large crowd present at the meeting, 53 separate speakers were allowed to approach the main dais and address the council directly. According to the Orange County Register, both the testimony from these speakers and the informal debates happening among attendees got quite heated at times [emphasis mine]:\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a real shift to a national, xenophobic acceptability in our society that is heartbreaking,\u201d\u00a0said Rabbi Jonathan Klein, executive director of the Clergy  Laity United for Economic Justice group. \u201cWe\u2019re in an era of open bigotry.\u201d\n(\u2026)\n\u201cI believe in the law. I live here and I couldn\u2019t be prouder,\u201d said Chris Cornell, 57, one of the residents waiting outside quietly while a screaming match ensued nearby.\nRev. Melinda Dodge, of Los Altos United Methodist Church in neighboring Long Beach, said the proposal goes against everything the community believes in and values.\n(\u2026)\nOne woman hailed the council members as \u201cpioneers\u201d and urged them to pass the ordinance. Two young children pleaded they vote against it. \u00a0Others protested the proposal and said it doesn\u2019t represent the values of the community. Some, including a representative from the ACLU, warned the council that if approved, the new local law would lead to a lawsuit.\n\u201cIf you could build a big, beautiful wall along the 605 (Freeway,) even though that would inconvenience me tremendously, I would give you a thumbs up,\u201d Long Beach resident Janet Wess told the council.\nSamantha Reed, 19, a UC Irvine freshman who graduated from Los Alamitos High, told the council that she won\u2019t forget election-time if members vote for the proposed ordinance.\n\u201cYou do not represent me by passing this ordinance,\u201d Reed said.\nOne long-time resident, Javier Mejia, choked up as he described that he\u2019s proud of his Mexican heritage but is \u201c100 percent American.\u201d He urged the council to vote for the proposed ordinance.\nAccording to video taken at the event, one of the speakers who spoke in opposition to the ordinance compared ICE agents to Nazis when she argued that: \u201cAs I read about ICE rounding up the suspected illegal immigrants with common surnames, many are law-abiding citizens, and it reminds me of Nazi Germany.\u201d\u00a0\nAnother speaker who addressed the council in support of the ordinance made the more cogent argument that: \u201cWe have the law of the land, and that constitution says that the federal government is in charge of immigration law, not the state of California.\u201d\nA self-identified legal immigrant also spoke in favor of Kusumoto\u2019s proposal:\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping and praying that this is the first city, and I\u2019m hoping and praying that other cities will wake up and put the American people first. We need to put the American agenda first. It has nothing to do with color. I\u2019m brown. I\u2019m from El Salvador. It has nothing to do with immigration \u2014 it has to do with legal and illegal.\u201d\nUltimately, the council voted 4-1 in support of the ordinance and amended it to include a directive to the Los Alamitos city attorney to write an amicus brief supporting Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s federal lawsuit against California for its sanctuary state policies.\nCouncilman Mark Chirco, who was the sole dissenting voice in Monday\u2019s vote, took to his official Facebook account afterwards to express his fear that the State of California will now target the small city for a legal challenge:\n\u201cWhen I joined the city council, I vowed that every single vote I would make would be to protect and further the interests of the citizens and businesses of Los Alamitos. I often have disagreements with the laws that are passed in Sacramento. However, after carefully weighing both sides of a very complicated and emotional issue, I could not see how the ordinance proposed tonight would benefit our city. Rather, the ordinance will place our city in danger of a costly and uphill battle with the State of California. For these reasons, I cast the lone vote against the ordinance. I believe our small city is not the appropriate venue nor does it have the resources to fight this battle.\u201d\nAlthough Chirco did not mention them by name, he is also likely worried about the ACLU\u2019s threat to take legal action against the city.\nThe council will have to vote again on April 16th to formally adopt the ordinance into law.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, pro-illegal alien activist groups like the ACLU have already called on their supporters to increase pressure on city authorities to back down:\nCORRECTION: While the ordinance was approvingly introduced, it will not be officially voted on until April 16.\n\nKeep the pressure up  urge the Los Alamitos City Council to do the right thing. Call, email, attend meetings, rally \u2014 your activism is need now more than ever. https://t.co/IQIafCWpwU\n\u2014 ACLU SoCal (@ACLU_SoCal) March 20, 2018", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Leah Barkoukis", "body": "The House Intelligence Committee on Thursday voted to release the GOP-authored report on its Russia investigation, which found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\nThe report will now be sent to the intelligence community to be declassified.\n\u201cLast January, we set out to investigate Russian active measures during the 2016 election.

And the report said Trump associates had \"ill-advised\" contacts with WikiLeaks, the online platform that intelligence agencies say aided Russia's attempt to disseminate hacked Democratic Party and Clinton campaign emails.\nBut in each case, the report's Republican authors concluded that the evidence failed to amount to active cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

The early voting for Texas Democrats is sky high. The enthusiasm is high. Texas could turn blue in the Trump era. Well, almost all of that was false. This is a mythical unicorn the Democrats keep chasing, turning Texas Blue and once again they were met with disappointment. Now, for Republicans, they\u2019ve been trying to nab Pennsylvania since 1988, which was finally done under Donald J. Trump.\nRepublicans broke their own record for midterm turnout, with over 1.5 million casting ballots in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Why? Well, while the Democrats dominate the cities (shocker!), their strength in rural America remains absolute trash.\u00a0\nVIDEO\n\n\u201cYet even as Democrats in the state\u2019s biggest cities came out in large numbers, Republicans still cast more ballots over all thanks to their rural strength,\u201d reported The New York Times. The only thing Democrats have going for them in the Lone Star State is enthusiasm, but that\u2019s no guarantee of victory (via Politico):\nThe 2018 midterms kicked off in eye-opening fashion in Texas on Tuesday, as a series of surprises in Democratic House primaries jolted the landscape while the party\u2019s large turnout sent a warning to Republicans nationwide.\nBut the GOP remained in the driver\u2019s seat in statewide races throughout Texas by night\u2019s end, leaving most of the shocks to down-ballot races.\nWashington Democrats saw some of their runoff plans go down the drain. Well-funded candidates fell in contest after contest. George P. Bush unexpectedly cruised to victory. And women kept on winning.\nThe Democratic civil war that erupted in the Texas primaries will continue as Laura Moser, a progressive insurgent, claimed the number two spot in the race for the Texas 7th congressional district, triggering a runoff and keeping that wound between establishment and progressives open. Here\u2019s some background on that race prior to Election Day (via CNN):\nA crowded Democratic House primary in the Houston area has become a stand-in for the broader battle within the party between progressives who backed Bernie Sanders and members of the establishment.\nThe controversy erupted more than a week ago, when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s political arm for House races, unleashed a scathing attack against journalist and activist Laura Moser, one of seven candidates in the Texas 7th District Democratic primary to take on Republican Rep. John Culberson this fall.\n[\u2026]\nCentral to the DCCC's case against Moser is a 2014 Washingtonian article in which she wrote that she'd \"sooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\" than live in Paris, Texas. The committee feared the article was ready-made for scathing attack ads casting Moser as a DC-loving, Texas-loathing carpetbagger -- the kind that her campaign might never be able to overcome. Attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, nonprofit executive Alex Triantaphyllis and oncologist Jason Westin are others seen as leading candidates.\n\"Democratic voters need to hear that Laura Moser is not going to change Washington. She is a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress,\" the DCCC said on its website as it posted a bundle of research critical of Moser.\u00a0\nBut progressive activists were incensed to see the DCCC -- which has long been accused of recruiting too many moderate, milquetoast candidates and weighing fundraising potential too heavily in deciding who to back -- weigh in with such a heavy hand less than three weeks from the March 6 contest.\nWell, even as liberal publications are noting, Moser survived, with some, like Mother Jones, saying this DCCC attempt to wipe her out \u201cblew up\u201d in their face:\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee waded into the seven-way primary for Texas\u2019 seventh congressional district last month with a specific goal in mind: delivering a knockout blow to Laura Moser, a freelance writer and Resistance activist with a large national following, who it feared would crater the party\u2019s chances in the closely watched swing district.\nBut the DCCC\u2019s attacks on Moser 10 days before the primary\u2014a broadside so clumsy and transparent it drew criticism from DNC chair Tom Perez and members of Congress\u2014didn\u2019t work as intended. Moser raised $87,000 in the days after the DCCC nuclear barrage and basked in the free publicity during the homestretch of the campaign. And on Tuesday, she secured a spot in the May 22nd runoff against Lizzie Fletcher, a Houston lawyer backed by EMILY\u2019s List who led the field in the first round of voting.\nNow Democrats in the seventh district, a longtime Republican stronghold that swung harder to Hillary Clinton than any other district in the country in 2016, will be faced with an unusual choice: a progressive candidate denounced by the official campaign organ of the House Democratic caucus, or a more moderate candidate rejected by the AFL-CIO.\nThis infighting among Democrats in competitive races is what very well could derail their 2018 plans. With TX-7, it\u2019s a total split among the base concerning the Democratic candidates and the organizations that have endorsed them.\u00a0\nVIDEO\n\nCongrats to Beto O\u2019Rourke for winning the right to get steamrolled by Ted Cruz in November!\n\u2014 Sean Spicier (@sean_spicier) March 7, 2018Dems accounted for ~40% of all TX primary votes cast this year. That's up from 29% in 2014  31% in 2010, but it's a bit lower than some Dems were hoping (they were 44% in 2006). Despite Trump's mediocre standing in TX, it's still a pretty Republican state.\n\u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 7, 2018Does this mean a blue wave is about to wash over TX? Most likely not.

Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Ted Cruz? Yeah, he won his primary\u2014but he\u2019s not going to win if he barely gets above 30 percent in the rural areas. Once again, Democrats are given a reminder that the cities can\u2019t carry you to victory (via WSJ):\nTexans also voted in primaries for state races, including governor and the state legislature. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is also up for re-election and won the GOP nomination with no serious primary opposition. Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke won his party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Cruz in what is shaping up as an unusually competitive race.\nAlthough Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s victory was solid, early returns showed his support was weak in the rural areas where he has campaigned aggressively in his effort to appear in every one of the state\u2019s 254 counties. While Mr. Cruz won his party\u2019s nomination by a resounding margin, Mr. O\u2019Rourke lost almost 40% of the Democratic primary vote to two little-known, poorly funded opponents.\nSo, there you have it. Maybe the early voting number isn\u2019t the best gauge for measuring real, actual turnout. There is no doubt that the shifting demographics could make Texas a more competitive state, which should keep Republicans up at night, but for this cycle\u2014the Democratic wave hopes in Texas is all hype.\u00a0\nFolks, it came as a great surprise to me that the early vote in a few Texas counties turned out not to be predictive of actual overall turnout.

The American Mirror captured the possible nasty spill, but it\u2019s also a great image that says so much about her campaign and the nonsense she doled out at an event in Mumbai. India Today\u2019s Aroon Purie interviewed her. He asked if America deserved a Trump presidency. Lauretta covered this yesterday, where the former secretary of state said of course not. Oh, and she decided to reload her deplorables attack on the people who voted for him:\nVIDEO\n\n\"His whole campaign: 'Make America Great Again' was looking backwards. You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women, you know, getting jobs, you don't want to you know see that Indian American succeeding more than you are, whatever your problem is, I'm going to solve it.' So it was a symptom.\" \u00a0 \u00a0\nOh, but she had more before this slice of nonsense (via NTK Network):\nIf you look at the map of the United States, there\u2019s all that red in the middle where Trump won. I win the coasts, I win Illinois, I win Minnesota, places like that,\u201d Clinton said.\n\u201cWhat the map doesn\u2019t show you is that I won the places that represent two-thirds of America\u2019s gross domestic product,\u201d Clinton explained. \u201cSo I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was looking backwards.\u201d\nAlas, folks\u2014why her almost falling down some stairs is emblematic. The first trip up was her pretty much calling half the country deplorable for supporting Trump. Also, totally avoiding the Rust Belt and rural America, as if the former was already locked up and the latter totally lost to the GOP. It\u2019s about margins. If Hillary had lost white working class voters by a two-to-one margin, instead of her three-to-one with Trump, she would have won the race. It\u2019s not hard. Obama did this twice. He knew he probably wasn\u2019t going to win rural America, but losing by 25 points instead of 50, plus winning the areas that she so eloquently described as the only places that matter in the U.S., is how Obama was able to defeat the GOP in both presidential contests. Oh, and he also had an economic message, had political skill, and drove an appealing message to voters; Clinton had none of that because she has no political talent, she had no message, and she wonders why she lost. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I forgot; she takes responsibility for her shocking loss to Trump, but the FBI, Russia, James Comey, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, the Democratic National Committee, and Wikileaks are to blame too. Did the Kremlin tell her to avoid Michigan? No, she was getting dirt from them on Trump through the services of Fusion GPS, who hired a former British spook to collect the data. That sort of sounds like collusion, right? Or at least according to liberal Democrat standards set forth by members of said party and the media. Lady, own it\u2014and move on.\u00a0\nIf we were to apply something to go with her second almost trip up down the stairs, it would be her explicitly anti-rural bias. I won the coasts, the cities, and a few states in between\u2014you know the real places that matter in America. Northeastern elitism reeks with these remarks. I know\u2014I grew up in the Northeast and let me tell you, these people still don\u2019t know that some folks in this country still need to hunt in order to survive, especially during the winter. No, hunting didn\u2019t just stop after the colonial era and the days of Daniel Boone.\nVIDEO\u00a0\nAlso, it\u2019s another deplorables swipe without saying the word. The rural areas are full of country bumpkins and racists, who aren\u2019t educated like us highly educated, morally superior, and insufferably snobby people. I may have lost, but I won the real Americans in November 2016. No\u2014you didn\u2019t, lady. You just lost. Is there some solace in how close it was in some states? Maybe\u2014but you still lost. That\u2019s like saying, well, we lost the football game but we scored four touchdowns\u2014the ones that really mattered. It embodies how the professional left has taken over the Democratic Party, who are anti-rural, hate rural voters, yet totally unaware that rural voters are the folks they desperately need to win back. Take a look at Texas. Democrats cast a lot of ballots in the primaries last Tuesday. Why were there over 500,000 more Republican votes cast? Rural Texas is a GOP stronghold. Rural voters are movable. They will vote Democratic if you give them a reason, have an agenda that isn\u2019t something out of far left social justice warrior\u2019s diary, and have quality candidate who can a) win; and b) doesn\u2019t bash them for being less than those coastal elites. So, take notes rural and Trump voters.

It\u2019s pathetic. Hillary almost falling down those steps captures her rather ugly descent since leaving public life.

Debbie Dingell (D-MI) warned fellow Democrats that Trump could win. She was ignored. She laments about how identity politics has hijacked the Democratic Party. She also strongly dislikes when people call Trump supporters racist because it is so easy and wrong. The Michigan Democrat added that her party could learn something from Trump: show you care, have a message, that you get these peoples\u2019 concerns (the economic issues), and have some empathy. Trump did that in his Rust Belt excursions.

Without California, we\u2019d easily win the popular vote. And we'd win the electoral vote by a landslide.\nNext think of Congress. California has 53 House seats. Democrats lead 39-14, for a net gain of 25 seats. Send California packing and the GOP gains a 25 House seat lead. We would dominate the House for decades to come.\u00a0\nAnd of course, the GOP would gain an automatic two seats in the Senate through the subtraction of California.

With scenic beauty, the Pacific Ocean coastline, the major cities of San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, California recruited entrepreneurs looking for economic growth. As the home of Hollywood and multitudes of celebrities, California presented an enticing potential to enjoy\u201clifestyles of the rich and famous.\u201d\nToday, California has become an economic and cultural disaster. The state is home to over 114,000 homeless people, one quarter of the total in the nation. In San Francisco, a health crisis has developed as the homeless have created a mess in the downtown area, littering it with fecal matter, spent needles and piles of trash.\nThe droughts have led to misguided water regulations imposed by environmentalists and liberal government bureaucrats. These officials also love to burden state residents and corporations with higher taxes. As a result, people and businesses are fleeing a state beset with too many regulations, tax rates that are not competitive with neighboring states and an array of other insufferable liberal policies. Even a sizable portion of the film industry has moved from Hollywood to other states offering tax incentives and a better business climate.\nCalifornia officials have implemented high tax rates to fund an array of expensive services for an ever-growing population of illegal aliens. Their statewide elected politicians, such as Governor Jerry Brown, support open borders and sanctuary status for illegal aliens. In fact, the entire state has become a sanctuary for those who break our immigration laws.\nAmericans should never forget\u00a0Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal alien who had been deported five times to Mexico, who shot 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier and ran away from the scene as she died in the arms of her father. Several months before the July 1, 2015 incident, Lopez-Sanchez was in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after serving a federal prison sentence. However, San Francisco Police wanted him on a drug related warrant, so he was transferred to their control. Unfortunately, the San Francisco Police subsequently released him and did not bother to notify federal authorities. This is due to their refusal to honor \u201cimmigration detainers\u201d that San Francisco officials believe is a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nAs a result of their desire to protect the rights of non-citizens, San Francisco officials allowed an illegal alien back onto the streets. Sadly, that decision ultimately cost one young woman her life. The tragic death produced a national outcry, but it did not lead to any changes in California policies. The Steinle killing was not an isolated incident as throughout California, local and state officials refuse to work with federal authorities to combat the out-of-control problem of illegal immigration. These misguided policies prevent the Trump administration from taking effective action.\nOver the last week, California was in the news again for the wrong reasons. The liberal Democrat Mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, issued a warning to illegal aliens that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were conducting raids in the city. She asked residents to \u201cprotect\u201d these illegal aliens, who she called the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d residents of Oakland.\nAs a result, 800 illegal aliens evaded capture and the ICE agents were only able to apprehend 232 lawbreakers. These individuals were not Boy Scouts, in fact, 180 of them had criminal records and 115 of them had convictions for serious offenses such as child sex crimes, weapons charges or assault.\nICE was doing the community a favor by removing criminal threats and protecting innocent citizens. Regrettably, the Oakland Mayor decided to give support to illegal aliens and violent criminals instead of law abiding taxpayers.\nAt a press availabilityon Thursday, President Trump denounced her actions and called it \u201ca disgrace\u201d that she undercut the ability of ICE agents to conduct raids.The acting Director of ICE, Tom Homan, labeled her comments \u201ca whole new low, to intentionally warn criminals that law enforcement is coming.\u201d\nFortunately, the Trump administration acted in federal court against the rogue state of California. On Tuesday night, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit which claimed that three state laws are illegal and are pre-empted by federal law. The laws prevent employers and state officials from cooperating with federal officials on cases involving illegal immigrants.\nIn his speech announcing the lawsuit, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the California laws \u201cunjust, unfair and unconstitutional.\u201d He also condemned the actions of the Mayor of Oakland by asking \u201cHow dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical open borders agenda?\u201d\nThese are good first steps by the Department of Justice, but they are not enough.

Other Democrats running include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state Treasurer John Chiang, and former Hillary Clinton staffer Amanda Renteria.\nThe primary for that contest will be held on June 5.\u00a0\nYet, Newsom might be playing on both sides of this issue. When he was mayor of San Francisco, he reported illegal aliens who were arrested crimes to ICE. All were minors and the Board of Supervisors voted in 2009 stating these undocumented youths could only be reffered to ICE if they had been convicted of a crime. Newsom disregarded the board and continued to report illegal aliens who were minors to ICE (via Mercury News):\nDuring his run for governor, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he\u2019s proud to represent a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d sparred publicly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions over immigration, and vowed he\u2019d go to jail to protect undocumented immigrants.\nBut a fight over sanctuary policy a decade ago when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco suggests that he wasn\u2019t always as strident a defender of immigrant rights.\nIn July 2008, Newsom imposed a city policy that reported undocumented youth arrested for felonies to federal immigration authorities. That decision \u2014 made the week after a father and his two sons were killed by an undocumented immigrant \u2014 meant that some kids were put at risk of deportation even if charges against them were later dropped.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to overturn Newsom\u2019s policy in 2009, mandating that minors could only be referred to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement if they were convicted of a felony. But Newsom\u2019s administration simply ignored the board, continuing to turn juvenile arrestees over to ICE for the rest of his term.\nMeanwhile, according to emails obtained by the Bay Area News Group, Newsom\u2019s administration also conducted a review of people in the city\u2019s probation system and referred more than 350 suspected undocumented immigrants to ICE.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "Whether there was collusion between FBI agent Peter Strzok, bureau lawyer Lisa Page, and a FISA judge remains to be seen, but the optics certainly are not good.

The judge, Rudolph Contreras, was recused from handling the case just days after accepting the guilty plea of President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who was charged with making false statements to federal investigators.\n[\u2026]\n\u201cRudy is on the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]!\u201d Page excitedly texted Strzok on July 25, 2016. \u201cDid you know that? Just appointed two months ago.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Strzok responded. \u201cI need to get together with him.\u201d\n\u201c[He] said he\u2019d gotten on a month or two ago at a graduation party we were both at.\u201d\nContreras was appointed to the top surveillance court on May 19, 2016, federal records show.\nThe pair even schemed about how to set up a cocktail or dinner party just so Contreras, Strzok, and Page could speak without arousing suspicion that they were colluding. Strzok expressed concern that a one-on-one meeting between the two men might require Contreras\u2019 recusal from matters in which Strzok was involved.\n\u201c[REDACTED] suggested a social setting with others would probably be better than a one on one meeting,\u201d Strzok told Page. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just going to have to invite you to that cocktail party.\u201d\n\u201cHave to come up with some other work people cover for action,\u201d Strzok added.\n\u201cWhy more?\u201d Page responded. \u201cSix is a perfectly fine dinner party.\u201d\nIt is not known whether the proposed party happened as planned.\nIt\u2019s all part of a long saga of impropriety and unethical behavior concerning top officials at the FBI. Strzok was a top counterintelligence agent at the bureau, being involved in two highly sensitive investigations in 2016. One involving whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information sent through her unauthorized and unsecure email server, the other signing off on the counterintelligence probe into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians; the latter of which is now being headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\u00a0\nStrzok was also having an extramarital affair with Lisa Page, with the two exchanging tens of thousands of texts, all of them anti-Trump and pro-Clinton\u2014highly unseemly for a man in a key position in the nation\u2019s preeminent domestic law enforcement and intelligence agency. It was bad enough for Mueller to remove Strzok from the Russia investigation in August of 2017 when he became aware of the texts. In August of 2016, Strzok and Page texted about their meeting with ex-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was forced out after an inspector general report cited him for an improver media disclosure concerning disagreement between the DOJ and the FBI over their investigation into the Clinton Foundation. McCabe also reportedly misled investigators about his actions.\u00a0\nIn that exchange with \u201cAndy,\u201d Strzok makes a reference to an insurance policy, which many have speculated is the Trump dossier, a piece of partisan opposition research subsidized by the Clinton campaign. The Hillary Team contacted Fusion GPS, who then hired former British spook Christopher Steele to find dirt on Donald Trump. This file was used to secure a FISA warrant against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. There have also been allegations that FISA powers were abused, citing the Carter warrant, which is another issue entirely. Yet, the notion that opposition research from a political campaign can be used to secure a spy warrant on members of an opposing presidential campaign is deeply troubling. Of course, Democrats say this is overblown.\nOn top of this, there were other texts that show Page and Strzok were concerned that the bureau was going too hard on Hillary during the email probe Strzok was also made aware that analyst had found a possible breach in the server. There was no follow up.\u00a0\nAnd there were other communications reportedly showing the two discussing how to \u00a0skirt federal records protocols. So, you could see why the FBI was sort of dragging their feet on disclosing what Congress was asking of them for months: there\u2019s a lot of embarrassing details here. So, the FBI has a huge mess to clean up, though some are rightfully asking what the heck are Strzok and Page still doing at the FBI?

You know, you didn't like black people getting rights; you don't like women, you know, getting jobs; you don't want to, you know, see that Indian American succeeding more than you are \u2014 you know, whatever your problem is, I'm gonna solve it.\u201d\nThis portion of her comments essentially stated, pretty openly, that Clinton views her voters as more valuable and better human beings than Trump's more, well, deplorable supporters. Her meaning was not lost on the Washington Post: \"It's difficult not to read Clinton's comments as an argument that her votes were more valuable \u2014 or at least more productive \u2014 than were Trump's. Why bring up gross domestic product? Some have suggested Clinton was saying wealthy people's votes should have counted for more. Whether you see it that way or not, she does seem to suggest Trump subsisted on voters who were simply...less sophisticated or advanced.\" \u00a0And also racist, sexist xenophobes. \u00a0This is a grotesque smear of 63 million Americans. \u00a0Yes, some Trump supporters were motivated by ugly prejudice (just as some number of Clinton backers certainly cast their ballots for 'problematic' reasons). \u00a0But the vast, vast majority of US voters, across the ideological spectrum, simply selected the person whom they thought would be better for the country, in good faith. \u00a0I've said and written many times that I believe Donald Trump is unfit for the office he holds, but Mrs. Clinton's nasty, embittered slanders further confirm that she was always unworthy of the job she coveted for her entire adult life. \u00a0Her broad-brush, ham-fisted impugning of motives is revealing: She's precisely the sneering, entitled, elitist, out-of-touch, dishonest hack that many people have long believed her to be.\nBut she wasn't finished. \u00a0Up next came some obnoxious shaming of women who opposed her candidacy. \u00a0Tens of millions of female voters decided to reject her, and Hillary thinks they did so because the boys instructed them to. \u00a0Just as she struggles to fathom why someone might have voted for Trump for reasons other than bigotry, she can't comprehend why an independent, enlightened woman may have come to her own conclusion not to vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton:\nHRC says white women voted for Trump because their husbands, bosses, sons told them to. @ the India Today Conclave this weekend.\n\u2014 Martha MacCallum (@marthamaccallum) March 12, 2018'Democrats going back to my husband and even before but just in recent times going back to bill and our candidates and then President Obama, have been losing the white vote including white women.

It\u2019s going to be terrible you can\u2019t vote for that.\u201d It stopped my momentum and it decreased my vote enough.

More importantly, every single setback Clinton experienced because of her emails is 100 percent her fault and responsibility. The Democratic Party chose to nominate someone who was under active FBI investigation and who incessantly lied about her actions. Choices have consequences. There's evidence that the Comey letter impacted the election. But the conclusion she draws -- that women were on the brink of \"standing up to the men in their lives\" until the FBI Director swindled them -- is fantastical, arrogant fiction.

Scores of students from across the country walked out to demand their elected representatives do more to secure schools, specifically by pushing new gun control legislation. This spike in activism is due to the recent and tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Seventeen people were shot and killed by Nikolas Cruz. The Sunshine State has already passed a law allowing school districts to permit school employees carry concealed firearms, establish a tip line to report possible threats, more programs for mental health, and raised the age limit to buy long guns to 21. The latter part of the law is grossly unconstitutional and the National Rifle Association has rightfully filed a lawsuit against it. Regardless, legislation has been passed as a direct result of student activism, though a lot of it is funded and coordinated by the professional Left. In D.C., a school safety bill overwhelmingly passed.\u00a0\nThese walkout were supposed to be a peaceful event, meant to put more pressure of the political class to do more on gun control.

The vast majority of the student walkouts yesterday were peaceful. Still, it seems that Parkland\u2019s tragedy could have been avoided not because of lax gun laws, but because the local, state, and federal officials totally dropped the ball on acting on the red flags presented to them by Cruz. The state kicked the can down the road on what to do with him, not even acting on reports that he was cutting himself in 2016. That alone could have warranted commitment at a state facility for a mental evaluation via the Baker Act. That would have shown up on a background check, preventing him from buying firearms, specifically the AR-15 he used in the shooting. He bought that rifle days after he was expelled from Stoneman Douglas in February of 2017. The FBI received a tip about Cruz on January 5. They did nothing, not even forwarding this information to their Miami office. Local law enforcement also had to have known this kid was trouble, being called to his home over 30 times.

Our only model that we have for anyone who runs America, who is the head of the United States, is a man. So, I had a moment where I realized in October during the campaign, I thought \"Wow, what we have done is made Hillary a female facsimile of the qualities that we look for in a male president.\" And ... it was a gut punch ... realizing there was a fundamental design \u2014 in October! \u2014 and you can't go back and fix it ... And I think that people's distrust of her isn't that everybody is sexist or misogynist; she vexes people and they don't know what to make of her... because I think they don't know what a woman in charge looks like.\nWe were trying to present her with these qualities that you're used to seeing in a male president: That she's strong enough, that she can handle national security, that she's tough enough that Donald Trump can come after her and try to humiliate her and she's never going to let it show. And I think she had to do that. I do think that the first woman nominee had to prove that she could do the job the way a man would, but that robbed her of a lot of her own authenticity.\n[\u2026]\nThe one time I thought that we were going to lose was actually in early September of 2016. We had had a bad August ... and then Hillary came down with pneumonia herself. Trump had just kind of hit his stride. Bannon had been named CEO, he [Trump] was being more disciplined. This was before the debates started. And I thought, \"Why do we think that we're going to be the ones that can stop this guy?\" He just rolled over 16, 17 candidates on the Republican side. It seemed to me, we're going to look back in 2016 and say the only possible outcome with Trump wins.\nOn the latter part, very true, but this whole notion of not knowing what a women in charge looks like is a bit tiring.

There\u2019s also Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook, Nikki Haley at the United Nations, Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom, and Boudica in the revolt against the Romans. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that the electorate doesn\u2019t know what a women in charge looks like, it was more of they didn\u2019t want that woman in charge because she was seen as inauthentic, dishonest, and ultimately unlikable.\u00a0\n\u00a0The authenticity problem was established well before the general election. The email scandal entrapped her as dishonest way before the Democratic primaries had concluded. She was for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge free trade agreement, while working for Obama, and then decided to run away from it. She said that female victims of sexual abuse and assault ought to be believed, though that was not her opinion when scores of women accused her husband of sexual misconduct, one of which included rape.\nIt was a throwback to the 1990s\u2014where she was still not all that popular with the voters. She saw an uptick when Republicans overreached on the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Ironically, when she wasn\u2019t the one making the headlines, her approval went up. The more she remained the limelight, like when you run for president, it dropped like a rock. She remains below 40 percent in the approval ratings. While her majesty might want to vent and whine about 2016, the best path for her rehabilitation might be taking a page from George W. Bush, which is to just go away.\nAt the same time, please don\u2019t, Mrs. Clinton. You\u2019re the GOP\u2019s Red Bull.

Yet, this is destined to fail. There\u2019s not a single Republican who will support this in the House, or at least not nearly enough to ensure passage. Moreover, the votes are not there in the Senate. Red state Democrats would be put in a bind. There is nothing as vivid to their constituents as their guns being taken away. That\u2019s a tangible thing. Something that\u2019s in their home being confiscated due to hyper regulatory leftist hysteria over our Second Amendment rights.

Chris Murphy (D-CT), who is a key player in the gun control pushes on the Hill, said he\u2019s not pushing for a total ban on semiautomatics. In some ways, I think even he, a die-hard gun control advocate, knows a semiautomatic ban is a bridge too far.\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s the same old game. Democrats say let\u2019s have a discussion, only to spring a trap on the rest of us\u2014yelling, condemning, and denigrating those with whom they disagree on gun policy.

It\u2019s an attribution that resulted from a fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft...Guccifer 2.0 sprang into existence on June 15, 2016, hours after a report by a computer security firm forensically tied Russia to an intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. In a series of blog posts and tweets over the following seven months\u2014conspicuously ending right as Trump took office and not resuming\u2014the Guccifer persona published a smattering of the DNC documents while gamely projecting an image as an independent Romanian hacktivist who\u2019d breached the DNC on a lark....Guccifer famously pretended to be a \u201clone hacker\u201d who perpetrated the digital DNC break-in. From the outset, few believed it. Motherboard conducted a devastating interview with Guccifer that exploded the account\u2019s claims of being a native Romanian speaker. Based on forensic clues in some of Guccifer\u2019s leaks, and other evidence, a consensus quickly formed among security experts that Guccifer was completely notional.\nEhmke led an investigation at ThreatConnect that tried to track down Guccifer from the metadata in his emails. But the trail always ended at the same data center in France. Ehmke eventually uncovered that Guccifer was connecting through an anonymizing service called Elite VPN, a virtual private networking service that had an exit point in France but was headquartered in Russia. But on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government\u2019s Guccifer investigation. Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency\u2019s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow.\nIt wasn't some random hacker. \u00a0It wasn't a fat slob in a basement somewhere. \u00a0It wasn't a murdered DNC staffer. \u00a0It was the Russians' foreign military intelligence agency, which engaged in a series of actions to disrupt Americans' faith in our electoral process -- just as our intelligence community has assessed for more than a year. \u00a0Some people will never be convinced of this fact, including a cohort of Americans who would rather believe Putin's propaganda over their own country's unified intelligence assessment. \u00a0But for most people, this is just another powerful piece of hard evidence detailing Moscow's treacherous meddling. \u00a0The Daily Beast's\u00a0story tries to introduce a strong Trump angle, but Ed Morrissey isn't particularly impressed: \"Spencer Ackerman and Kevin Poulson argue that the news also \u201cmove[s] the investigation closer to Trump himself.\u201d Er, not really, although it clearly rebuts Trump\u2019s earlier claims that the DNC hack might not have been conducted by Russia. We already knew that Roger Stone had been in contact with Guccifer 2.0 because Stone publicly declared it a years ago. That contact came after the hack, Stone insisted, and whether or not it\u2019s true, Stone\u2019s contact with Guccifer 2.0 has been well known for a long time. There\u2019s nothing in the rest of this story to suggest that the revelation provides any more connection to Trump and his campaign than the data points already known.\" \u00a0In any case, this is good news:\nBipartisan bill to strengthen our elections infrastructure  prevent hacking from bad actors  Albert Eisenberg (@Albydelphia) March 22, 2018For the first time since the 2016 election, Congress is poised to move legislation to combat hackers and online trolls targeting American democracy. \u00a0Senior Republicans and Democrats will come together on Thursday to stump for a revised version of a stalled election security proposal that has gained new momentum in recent days. The measure has now gathered enough backing from high-level lawmakers that it could prove the first concrete action taken in response to repeated calls from cybersecurity experts, election integrity advocates and state officials for Congress to help cash-strapped states upgrade their aging voting technology in the wake of the Russian hacks and disinformation campaigns that roiled the 2016 presidential race. When the updated bill is reintroduced Thursday afternoon, it will include sponsorship from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, giving the legislation the leadership backing it previously lacked.\nThe number one objective of all of these Russia probes should be to get to the very bottom of the Kremlin's machinations and take active steps to thwarting future interference. \u00a0And Republicans should recognize that if Putin and his gang had decided that it was the GOP that they wanted to troll and harm (as they very well may in the future, as they partially did in 2016), the party would rightly be screaming bloody murder about foreign influence in the campaign. \u00a0The Democrats may not be entirely innocent victims here, as some of their fingerprints are on various pieces of this Russia puzzle, but every American should stand against a hostile power using subterfuge to impact our democracy.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Brent Bozell", "body": "NBC News star Chuck Todd recently made a lectern-pounding speech to attendees of a journalism awards dinner. He proclaimed: \"One thing we're not is the opposition. We've never tried to be a part of the political debate, but people want to drag us into it. We shouldn't take the bait. We're simply a voice of truth.\"\n\n\nSo, let's consider the case of Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI.\n\n\nThe FBI Office of Professional Responsibility recommended that McCabe be fired for lying, or, to be gentle, a \"lack of candor\" -- even under oath -- in the Justice Department inspector general's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email probe. The inspector general is a career department official. The head of the OPR was appointed in 2002 ... by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller.\nSo when Attorney General Jeff Sessions sacked McCabe, the \"voice of truth\" media were pleased, right? Well, actually, no. They were so upset by the president's victory-lap tweets that they fast-forwarded past the facts about McCabe's lies.\n\n\nThe ABC and NBC morning shows skipped the part about McCabe's \"lack of candor.\" They went straight to McCabe's self-defense about being a target of partisans (despite his wife having run for office as a Democrat), not to the honesty problem for career government officials. ABC's Cecilia Vega reported, \"McCabe says he was let go as '... part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation ...\"\n\n\nTodd, who claimed he didn't want to be dragged into the political debate, enthusiastically made a guess, saying, \"I think it signals this president is no longer cooperating with Mueller. It's time for war.\"\n\n\nThe timing of McCabe's sacking looked harsh, since we were routinely told that he had just a few days left to qualify for his FBI pension. So, Todd's NBC colleague Andrea Mitchell even went to Twitter to beg for McCabe to get a job with a Democrat on Capitol Hill, which is what nonpartisan reporters at NBC are supposed to do: \"One suggestion from a McCabe supporter: if a friendly member of Congress hired him for a week he could possibly qualify for pension benefits by extending his service the extra days.\" Former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer deliciously tweeted back: \"Pensions before Honesty. Great slogan.\"\n\n\nBut it turns out the \"pro-truth\" media missed the boat on that claim. McCabe was nearly eligible for pension benefits after 20 years of service, at the age of 50. Now he can't claim them until age 57. Good luck selling that as a terrible scenario to people who retire at the private sector-accepted age of 65, or whose meager pensions don't allow them to retire -- ever.\n\n\nNone of these not-the-opposition networks noted that McCabe was getting a sweeter treatment by the legal process than retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was forced to plead guilty to lying to the FBI, rather than lying within the FBI. Nobody at the networks protested about a \"war\" on government officials or tweeted out help-the-poor-public-servant messages for Flynn. He deserved every criticism liberals threw his way. CNN mocked Flynn by quoting a tweet about his 24 days as national security adviser: \"I once had a fungal infection that lasted longer than #flynn.\"\n\n\nThe networks' coverage of Andrew McCabe matches their coverage of everything else in the Trump era. It's not that they look like the Opposition Party. They are the opposition party. Who's telling the truth doesn't matter. Resisting and ruining President Trump is what matters.\n\n\nL.

But President Trump wisely fired him as secretary of state for having an outlook different from Trump\u2019s, and from the agenda Trump was elected on.\nWe have \u201cdifferent mindsets,\u201d Trump said about Tillerson, as a polite understatement. \u201cWe got along, actually, quite well, but we disagree on a lot of things.\u201d\nIndeed. Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. No one could hold that position without being a globalist and he did not convert quickly enough to make America great again.\nTillerson was never on the same page as President Trump in standing up against, not with, the many parts of the world that are hostile to our sovereign interests. A supporter of phony free trade, Tillerson seemed more like the appeasement-type of secretary of state that we would expect if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election.\nIt is not merely that Tillerson thought Obama\u2019s sweetheart deal with Iran was \u201cokay,\u201d as Trump complained in announcing his termination of Tillerson. It was also that Tillerson would say and do things out-of-sync with what the America-First stance needs to be.\nTillerson was mistakenly trying to use diplomacy with the North Korean communist dictator Kim Jong-un while Trump was pursuing tougher measures. When Trump finally got Tillerson to stop groveling, the situation improved.\nEven the media concedes that Tillerson\u2019s departure will not hinder Trump\u2019s highly effective handling of North Korea, which is all-Trump and contrary to Tillerson\u2019s approach. If anything, a successful outcome of the North Korean crisis is more likely with Tillerson gone.\nGiven how often Tillerson disagreed during his confirmation hearing with Trump\u2019s positions, it is surprising that Tillerson lasted as long as he did. In merely one day of testimony Tillerson disagreed with Trump about the harmful Trans-Pacific Partnership, Russian policies toward the Ukraine, so-called climate change, and the need for Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons.\nPresident Trump indicated that the upcoming renegotiation of trade deals was a reason for his timing in letting Tillerson go now. Trump recently stood up against China by blocking the foreign takeover of Qualcomm, thereby signaling that American technology secrets are not for sale to foreign countries hostile to us.\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has long been a much stronger Trump supporter than Tillerson ever was, will step in without the baggage of a globalist mindset. Pompeo brings a welcomed enthusiasm and focus that Tillerson unfortunately lacked.\n\u201cTremendous energy, tremendous intellect, we\u2019re always on the same wavelength,\u201d Trump said about Pompeo after picking him. \u201cThe relationship has been very good, and that\u2019s what I need as secretary of state.\u201d\nIn addition to his stellar record of being first in his class in West Point and then serving in the Army, Pompeo has a strongly conservative track record as a congressman from Kansas. His positions include being outspokenly pro-life and taking many stances that fit hand-in-glove with those of Trump and the conservative movement.\nPhyllis Schlafly praised the freshman congressman Pompeo in early 2011, for sponsoring a budget amendment that would have cut $8.5 million from the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Registry. She applauded how Pompeo observed that the registry would be \u201cthe very foundation of the EPA\u2019s effort to pursue its radical anti-jobs agenda.\u201d\nUnlike Tillerson, Pompeo has been a leader in cracking down on terrorists from Muslim countries. When confronted with an alleged hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp for terrorists, Pompeo took it upon himself to personally visit the camp and quipped afterwards that it looked to him \u201clike a lot of them have put on weight.\u201d\nFor months it has been perceived that Tillerson, who is younger than Trump but appears older, has been unhappy in his position. He failed to fill key vacancies in his department despite being on the job for more than a year, and at key moments seemed to be in his home state of Texas rather than in D.C.\nTrump was perceptive in his post-firing comments: \u201cI think Rex will be much happier now, but I really appreciate his service.\u201d With Mike Pompeo in charge at the State Department, Americans can be more confident that the interests of the United States will be foremost in any foreign policy decision-making.\nIt took a year, but we have finally arrived to the point of \u201clet Trump be Trump,\u201d reminiscent of the moment in 1984 when \u201clet Reagan be Reagan\u201d started to carry the day.

From the survey analysis:\nVoter enthusiasm grows ahead of 2018 midterms: In this week's poll, 79% of voters said they are motivated to vote in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections, compared to 11% who said they are not motivated. In late December, 72% said they were motivated, and 13% said they were not motivated.\nMotivation high across party lines: 89% of Republicans, 83% of Democrats, and 68% of Independents said they were motivated to vote in the upcoming midterms. In late December 80% of Republicans, 75% of Democrats, and 62% said the same.\nRepublicans attribute their advantage to the recently passed tax reform package that put more cash in their wallets. \nYet, the publication was apt to note that both parties should take into account, which is that enthusiasm is good, but hardly a crystal ball on who will win. The GOP enthusiasm was high in 2012, Romney lost. In Georgia\u2019s special election for the sixth congressional district formerly held by Tom Price, the Democratic enthusiasm was high, Republican Karen Handel beat Democrat Jon Ossoff.

You\u2019re not standing up for them until you say \u2018I want less weapons,\u2019\u201d Israel said to Loesch.\n\nIn other words, unless you\u2019re in favor of restricting Second Amendment rights, you don\u2019t give a damn about children.\n\nIt turns out, Sheriff Israel was simply projecting. \n\nBefore appearing on CNN Wednesday evening, Israel knew the deputy on duty at the school that day sat by and listened as children were slaughtered. He was armed, wearing a bulletproof vest and stood outside the school instead of going inside for at least four minutes. The shooting lasted for six. Football coach Aaron Feis lost his life after using his body to shield students from bullets.\n\nInstead of presenting that damning information to the live audience and those watching it at home, he placed the body count on the NRA and gun owning Americans. His deputy had quite literally failed to stand up for the children he was sworn and paid to protect.\n\n\u201cWhen did you find out that Deputy Peterson had not gone into the building?\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Sunday morning on State of the Union. \u201cYou spent much of the Wednesday night town hall on CNN, with the entire Stoneman Douglas community, students, teachers and parents, attacking the NRA, saying that police need more powers, more money to prevent future tragedies, you didn\u2019t disclose any of this to the crowd then, the Stoneman Douglas High School community, did you know it then? Did you know it Wednesday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was spoken about earlier during that day.

That protocol would have been handed down and approved by Sheriff Israel. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen Coral Springs police officers arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14 in the midst of the school shooting crisis, many officers were surprised to find not only that Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson, the armed school resource officer, had not entered the building, but that three other Broward County Sheriff's deputies were also outside the school and had not entered, Coral Springs sources tell CNN,\u201d CNN reported over the weekend. \u201cThe deputies had their pistols drawn and were behind their vehicles, the sources said, and not one of them had gone into the school.\u201d\n\nAfter Parkland, government officials are taking advantage of a crisis to push their anti-gun agenda. Worse, they\u2019re using the rights of citizens as a scapegoat for their massive and completely unacceptable failures.\n\nLike mass shootings in the past, there was a long list of warning signs and multiple reports to authorities about the threat.

The Broward County Sheriff\u2019s deputies visited his home and received calls 45 times (Sheriff Israel says it was only 23 times, which is a lie). He was expelled from school for violent behavior.

Next, he comes to an important point about self-defense: A prime anti-gun claim is that documented incidents of firearms being used to fend off crime are swamped by actual gun crime. \u00a0Essentially, we are told that the self-defense effect is overblown and overrated by Second Amendment supporters who rely on an emotionally-appealing argument that doesn't comport with statistics. \u00a0But as Freitas highlights, many of the studies on which that case rests only count examples in which would-be perpetrators are actually shot by innocent armed civilians. \u00a0The problem with that framing is that the large majority of self-defense comes through deterrence and the credible threat of a gun (untold numbers of which are never reported) -- not by bullets flying. \u00a0By narrowly tabulating the number of legally-justifiable shootings that are committed for self protection, it's easy for advocates to claim that \"good\" gunshots are vastly outnumbered by criminal ones.\u00a0\nA broader review is necessary for a more accurate picture. \u00a0One government study (the National Crime Victimization Survey) found that guns are used or brandished in self-defense approximately 100,000 times per year. \u00a0By comparison, in 2017, roughly 15,500 people were killed with guns in America, excluding suicides. \u00a0That ratio looks healthier. \u00a0A 2013 CDC study commissioned by the Obama administration confirmed that defensive gun uses outnumber gun crimes:\n\"Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals,\" says the report, which was completed in June and ignored in the mainstream press. The study, which was farmed out by the CDC to the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, also revealed that while there were \"about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008,\" the estimated number of defensive uses of guns ranges \"from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year.\"\nFreitas goes on to question some Democrats' ardent opposition to the idea of arming some -- not all -- teachers, especially those with law enforcement or military backgrounds. He quotes one colleague dismissing the proposal \"ridiculous,\" asking, \"why? Is it because the other side of this debate will only accept one 'solution' to this problem, and that is tearing apart or gutting the Second Amendment?\" After mentioning Democratic bills on background checks and bump stocks, Freitas speaks to a deeply-held suspicion (boosted by evidence like this and this) that many gun rights supporters harbor about the ultimate intentions of incrementalist gun control advocates: \"If you're wanting the other reason why we can't have an honest debate over this one, it's because quite frankly, I don't think any of us on this side of the aisle believe you when you say [small changes are] all you want to do.\" When politicians like Barack Obama positively cite Australia's confiscatory regime (the effectiveness of which is hotly disputed), that level of suspicion escalates.\nThe conservative lawmaker continues his remarks by expressing profound resentment over being compared to Nazis and segregationists (he goes after the Democratic Party's own history regarding the latter charge, hastening to add that he doesn't believe any of his present-day opponents share Democrats' previous stances on civil rights) during the course of heated gun debates. \u00a0He also seethes over being stuck at the wrong end of a \"false dilemma\" that posits he can only care about either guns or innocent lives. \u00a0\"If we want to have an open and honest debate, I am all for that. \u00a0Let's do that,\" he says. \u00a0\"But it does start with a certain degree of mutual respect. \u00a0It starts with a certain degree of not assuming that the only reason that we believe in the Second Amendment is that the NRA paid us off.\" \u00a0He argues that if the Left believes conservative politicians are 'bought off' by the NRA, they should look at their own donations from groups like Planned Parenthood. \u00a0\"When I get up here and talk about abortion, I don't assume you're all bought and paid for by Planned Parenthood. \u00a0I don't assume you're horrible people because I disagree with you on a policy position,\" he says, gesturing across the aisle. \u00a0\"I assume that you have deep convictions, and we can have an argument and debate about it.\"\n\nHe closes by warning that if Democrats are unwilling to \"reciprocate that respect,\" they shouldn't be surprised when constructive compromise becomes more difficult to achieve (especially when good-faith efforts are ignored). His final point: \"We are going to have a problem with so-called solutions which infringe on people's liberty under the promise the government will provide for their security,\" pointing out that in Parkland, the government failed over and over again to address the threat posed by the eventual shooter. \u00a0And Freitas advanced that point before he had a chance to see this video footage:\nFootage of the Parkland shooting shows Scot Peterson standing outside of the Florida high school as the gunman kills 17 people inside. https://t.co/BK9zyg46gp\n\u2014 The Federalist (@FDRLST) March 15, 2018\nAs I intimated at the onset, I don't agree with every single argument Delegate Freitas references or amplifies during those seven impactful minutes; some contentions were stronger and more persuasive than others. \u00a0But as a 'non-guns person' who nevertheless supports the Second Amendment and is consistently repulsed by the Left's ugly rhetoric and demonization during \"debates\" over gun policy, I completely understand why Freitas received an ovation when he put down the microphone and yielded the floor.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "Earlier today, a small group of Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. students staged a sit in outside of Sen.

What can pass Congress on gun control is the Fix NICS bill, which would strengthen our National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which any one purchasing a gun through a federally licensed firearm dealer has to go through in order to complete the transfer. The ironic twist is that Democrats might nix any chance this could pass since\u2026it could actually pass. It would give the Trump White House a win on a salient 2018 issue and give the GOP the opportunity to argue that they\u2019ve done all they could on new gun legislation. The Left wants a legislative assault on the Second Amendment. To make things more interesting, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), one of the most vocal advocates for gun control in Congress, backs the legislation.\u00a0\nSo, Congress could do something on guns, but they won\u2019t because Democrats want to use it for the 2018 election in the hopes of trying to get more of them elected. It\u2019s not about saving lives. On top of that, we have to look at the current system. It should have stopped Cruz from buying a firearm. In 2016, via the Baker Act, he should have been committed for self-mutilation. That would have been cited on a background check and could\u2019ve prevented him from buying an AR-15 rifle just days after he was expelled from the school in February of 2017. The FBI was warned on January 5 about him. Local law enforcement knew about Cruz\u2019s disturbing behavior, visiting his home over 20 times. This was a preventable shooting, but we had a total breakdown of the system at the federal, state, and local level. Maybe that\u2019s where we should look to reform. The system, by and large, should have protected these kids from this heinous event, but incompetent staffers at all levels of government failed them. The FBI didn\u2019t even forward the Cruz tip to their Miami office.\u00a0\nThere should be a call to action, I just don\u2019t think the issue here is AR-15 rifles or so-called high-capacity magazines, which contrary to the media and liberal pundits, have nothing to do with the rate of fire of a firearm.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Morefield", "body": "The recent gun control debate ignited by last month\u2019s tragedy in Parkland, Florida, has liberals trotting out what has become a favorite Leftist talking point - Australia\u2019s 1996 National Agreement on Firearms, an act which, among other things, severely restricted semi-automatic rifles after after a similarly horrific mass shooting.\nLiberals consider the cornerstone of the law, a massive forced gun buyback program, a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to what might otherwise be perceived by gun owners as an unwelcome curtailing of traditional American freedoms.

To choose Australia is to choose civil war.\u201d\nEven the more sane gun control proponents are wise to the political situation. University of Sydney professor Philip Alpers, who is also the founding director of GunPolicy.org, told the New York Times, \u201cWhat Australia did was a confiscation of private property under the threat of jail time, compensated or not. That wouldn\u2019t wash in the United States.\u201d\nFurther, when unduly oppressive laws are actually passed in the United States, such as recent laws in New York and Connecticut passed after the Sandy Hook massacre, they are often ignored by the majority of gun owners and sparsely enforced by the states themselves. \u201cNew York and Connecticut authorities so far have shown no inclination to enforce their laws by going door to door to round up unregistered guns and arrest their owners,\u201d Mehta wrote in the 2015 piece. \u201cBut that\u2019s what would be necessary to enforce the law. A federal law, therefore, would require sweeping, national police action involving thousands of lawmen and affecting tens of millions of people. If proponents of gun control are serious about getting guns out of Americans\u2019 hands, someone will have to take those guns out of Americans\u2019 hands.\u201d\nSure, it\u2019s hard to argue with Mehta\u2019s logic, at least on the surface. And it\u2019s a good thing for gun owners, right?\nNot necessarily, not if you look just beneath that surface.\u00a0\nConsider: If rational minds on the Left know all this, to what end are they still pushing for such laws, especially when it\u2019s obvious that they don\u2019t care whether ANY gun control laws are actually enforced. Not yet anyway. (Remember, it\u2019s always conservatives, not liberals, pushing for enforcement of existing law.)\nAnd yet, they do want more and more laws on the books, and the more draconian, obscure, and hard to keep track of, the better. But why?\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the answer, and it should scare every gun owner in the country:\nThey want to make de facto criminals out of the majority of the gun owning population.\u00a0\nThat way, they can essentially pick us off, one by one.\u00a0\nWithout necessarily meaning to, Mehta hits on this critical point in his piece: \u201cA national gun buyback law would turn a significant portion of the American people into criminals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cResidents of New York and Connecticut snubbed their new laws \u2026 Compliance with the registration requirement has been modest at best, as hundreds of thousands of gun owners in both states refused to register their weapons. So far, then, the laws have been most successful in creating hundreds of thousands of lawbreakers who feel obligated to break the law.\u201d\nIf liberals are able to pass any sort of \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban, buyback or no buyback, they know they will make criminals out of several million currently law-abiding gun owners. And even if the majority of those gun owners don\u2019t follow the law now, that won\u2019t make them any less a criminal. They just haven\u2019t been caught yet.\nBut when the \u2018right people\u2019 control the levers of power and the \u2018right laws\u2019 are all in place, make no mistake - they will be caught.\nHere\u2019s the rub. It\u2019s one thing to hold up your rifle and shout \u201ccome and take it,\u201d \u00e0 la Charleton Heston, before thousands of like-minded people. The Feds aren\u2019t going to come to a National Rifle Association convention and start arresting people, at least not yet. And they aren\u2019t going to conduct door-to-door house searches, arresting gun owners and confiscating their firearms, either. Not yet.\nBut believe me, under the right circumstances and with the right laws in place, the arrests will come. They\u2019ll come when you\u2019re going to work, or to the bank, or to the park with your kids, or a thousand other places. They\u2019ll come after you\u2019ve used your now-illegal AR-15 to defend yourself against a home invader, or if they spot it during a \u201croutine\u201d home search.\nNever, ever underestimate these people and the depth of their evil. Remember, the Cheka managed to fill the Soviet gulags to the brim, and yet they did it quietly, with little fuss and even less armed revolt.\nAnd they won\u2019t need to arrest everyone to make the majority obey. No, they only need a few, and word will spread quickly.\u00a0\nSo what will you do, dear AR-15 owner, when the \u2018Cheka\u2019 comes for your neighbor, and you know the laws are on the books to prosecute? Will a \u201cbuyback\u201d and \u201camnesty\u201d be enough to convince YOU to acquiesce? You\u2019ve got a job, a wife, kids to raise. When they \u201ccome and take it,\u201d is your family worth risking?\u00a0\nNo, when they take your guns there will be no civil war. There will be no large-scale revolution, because liberals are experts at pushing that Overton Window enough not to shock the system. Like frogs in water that\u2019s about to boil, people won\u2019t jump until it\u2019s too late.\nThat is why it\u2019s so important to not get complacent and believe a worse case scenario will never happen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to fight the gun controllers\u2019 efforts to change the law at EVERY turn, using EVERY legal means possible.\nLong before they \u201ccome and take\u201d our guns, and our freedoms.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Cortney O'brien", "body": "On Thursday, the House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017.

For years, we\u2019ve been subjected to Democrats voicing their support for hunters, while saying they want to get AR-15s and other so-called assault weapons, off the street. Hunting rifles are actually more powerful than the AR-15, but that\u2019s a different debate. Then, there\u2019s the anti-gun Left not knowing what they hell they\u2019re talking about, saying they don\u2019t want to take away people\u2019s guns, but draft legislation that bans semiautomatic firearms. Um, that\u2019s a gun ban. Most, if not all, of the firearms owned by civilians, with the exception of revolvers and hunting rifles, are semiautomatic. It\u2019s not scary. It merely means self-reloading after firing a round. It\u2019s one round per trigger pull. It\u2019s not the same as automatic or machine guns, the latter of which use belt-fed ammunition.\nRegardless, the whole crux of their argument is that banning so-called assault weapons, expanded background checks, waiting period etc. will save lives. It won\u2019t do that, and the anti-gun Left knows it. So, thanks to Vox for actually showing the end game of the Democratic agenda on firearms, which is that they really just want to ban guns. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have cited the Australian model on gun control. Clinton even went so far as to say the Supreme Court got the Second Amendment wrong in 2016. The level of violence in Europe, which is often cited by liberals to make the false argument that America is a shooting gallery, would require gun confiscation. Also, the Second Amendment\u2019s language in the Constitution might not prevent such an extreme piece of legislation from passing; it\u2019s the fact that there are not enough votes\u2014and there probably never will be. Hey, at least there are gold stars for honesty:\n\u2026let's be clear about precisely what kind of decision is letting events like this recur. Congress's decision not to pass background checks is not what's keeping the US from European gun violence levels. The expiration of the assault weapons ban is not behind the gap. What's behind the gap, plenty of research indicates, is that Americans have more guns. The statistics are mind-blowing: America has 4.4 percent of the world's population but almost half of its civilian-owned guns.\nRealistically, a gun control plan that has any hope of getting us down to European levels of violence is going to mean taking a huge number of guns away from a huge number of gun owners.\n[\u2026]\nThe legal scholars I talked to suggested that an Australia-style program would probably pass muster. If we went further than Australia and also banned handguns, that might cause problems; the Supreme Court struck down Washington, DC's handgun ban in 2008. But Australia's actual system is probably constitutional.\n\"Courts have consistently upheld bans on military-style semiautomatic rifles because other firearms are equally useful for self-defense,\" Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, says. \"Gun control isn't stalled because of the Second Amendment. It's stalled because elected officials won't pass effective new laws to reduce gun violence.\"\nSanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas Austin and author of the landmark article \"The Embarrassing Second Amendment,\" concurs: \"If such an extraordinary law actually got through Congress (meaning with necessary Republican support), then I find it impossible to imagine that there would be five votes on the Court to say no,\" he says. \"But the real problem, of course, is that there\u2019s not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of Congress actually passing any meaningful legislation re guns, let alone this kind of quite radical legislation.\"\nWell, I\u2019ll let you debate the Australia model being constitutional. The idea that people would a) turn over their AR-15s is laughable; and b) police going door-to-door to arrest and confiscate firearms to those who refuse would be political poison not to mention a tsunami of lawsuits that would clog the legal system. Also, not a single Republican would support this so Levinson is right about the political reality. Still, Vox showcased the anti-gun Left\u2019s ultimate goal, which is why the upcoming 2018 elections are key. In fact, every election in every state is key to protecting our Second Amendment rights.\u00a0\nWe left Europe for independence and to be free from tyranny, but thanks for your honesty.\n\u2014 Razor (@hale_razor) March 14, 2018", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "Well, it\u2019s finally here: a piece of gun control legislation that could actually pass.

The horrific shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas that left over 20 people dead, prompted the legislation.

It doesn\u2019t have the votes in the Senate and it would certainly meet a quick death in the House.

I [take] a more pragmatic approach to this, which is with Susan. I do think there\u2019s zero chance that this group of Republicans that now control the House will initiate an impeachment hearing,\u201d Press said. Press then discussed the Supreme Court decision regarding Congressional Districts in Pennsylvania, which Press called, \u201cextremely important,\u201d to the makeup of Congress...Press then said that states should put redistricting in the hands of retired judges, who he claims would draw nonpartisan lines. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely important, and that\u2019s sort of, I think, a first step and necessary step to getting too down the road impeachment. And Susan, it will be day one of the new Congress, I think, if Democrats take control,\u201d Press said.\nClick through for video of the MSNBC exchange. \u00a0Meanwhile, amid the latest round of buzz and conjecture about whether the president is considering firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, nationally-syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt asked two Senators whether such an action -- which we addressed here -- would constitute an impeachable offense. \u00a0South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, an emerging Trump ally, answered 'probably:'\nHewitt: Okay, now let me ask you, back in the day, a long time, ago, 1998, you were one of the 13 impeachment managers named by the House to press the case against Bill Clinton. So this is going way back. So I have a very simple question. If the President fired Robert Mueller, do you think that would be an impeachable offense?\n\nGraham: Probably so, if he did it without cause, yeah...I think what the President will have done is stopped an investigation in whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign. I can\u2019t see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\n\nHH: You see, I am in agreement with you that an impeachable offense is anything that the Congress says it is, regardless of what scholars might say. And I believe the Congress would say that if it were run by Democrats. Do you think a Republican-led House would impeach the President?\n\nLG: Well, that\u2019s a good point. Let\u2019s say that Obama fired somebody. I think we\u2019d all have a different view on the Republican side. A high crime and misdemeanor in the Constitution is a fairly vague term. But what is at the essence of impeachment is a check and balance on a President, right?\n\nHH: Yes.\n\nLG: \u2026who\u2019s gotten out of their lane, who changed the rule of law and basically turns it upside down. I can\u2019t think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president\u2019s campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government, what kind of crimes may have been committed. I\u2019ve seen no evidence of collusion, but to stop investigation without cause, I think, would be a Constitutional crisis.\n\nHH: Have you told him that specifically, Senator Graham, so that he hears it from Republicans, do not fire Bob Mueller?\n\nLG: I think I just, I think I just did.\nIntriguingly, when Hewitt put the same question to Maine Independent Angus King, a liberal who caucuses with the Democrats, his answer was similar in some respects -- but strikingly different on the core issue:\nHewitt: Let me talk to you now about the Special Counsel investigation. And I\u2019m going to ask this of Lindsey Graham next hour.\u00a0If Mr. Mueller was fired, would you consider that to be an impeachable offense?\n\nKing: No. I would consider it a crisis.\u00a0I would want to think about it in terms of all the other material that we\u2019ve seen. High crimes and misdemeanors is the standard for impeachment, and I have a high standard for impeachment. I don\u2019t think impeachment should be used to change a government you don\u2019t like. I think going back to Andrew Johnson in, you know, 1867, this is something we\u2019ve got to be really careful with. We don\u2019t want to change our form of government. But the problem is that if the President does this, I think it is a huge mistake. It adds weight to the argument that there\u2019s been an ongoing obstruction of justice of trying to basically quash in investigation. I think it\u2019s, I wouldn\u2019t say it rises to the level of an impeachable offense, but I certainly think it\u2019s going to create a real problem.\u00a0And I think, I went down the list yesterday. There are 8 or 9 senators, including people like Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley and John Cornyn who have said this would be a huge mistake. Newt Gingrich said it would be a disaster. Lindsey said he thought it would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. So I think everybody\u2019s concerned about this, and I think it would be a huge mistake from his point of view. If he\u2019s really, if he\u2019s innocent, which he keeps saying that he is, he ought to want this thing to go forward and be as thorough as possible so the American people can get the results, can be, have confidence and say yeah, look, this Mueller guy did a tough job and a thorough job, and there\u2019s no evidence.

Last Friday, they did a massive raid in Los Angeles, where they nabbed over 200 illegal aliens, most with criminal convictions. Over 100 businesses also have to prove that they aren\u2019t hiring illegal aliens (via Washington Times):Federal deportation officers staged one of the biggest enforcement actions in years against businesses in Los Angeles this week, arresting 212 people and serving audit notices to 122 businesses who will have to prove they aren\u2019t hiring illegal immigrants.Nearly all of those arrested were convicted criminals, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.ICE said it targeted Los Angeles because it\u2019s a sanctuary city, meaning it refuses to fully cooperate with federal authorities on deportations from within its jails.Pew Research noted that\u00a074 percent of illegal aliens arrested by ICE in 2017 had criminal records, most relating to drunk driving:Immigrants with past criminal convictions accounted for 74% of all arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in fiscal 2017, according to data from the agency. The remainder were classified as \u201cnon-criminal\u201d arrestees, including 16% with pending criminal charges and 11% with no known criminal convictions or charges.[\u2026]Among ICE arrestees in 2017 with prior convictions, the most common criminal conviction category was driving under the influence of alcohol (59,985 convictions, or 16% of the total), followed by possessing or selling \u201cdangerous drugs\u201d such as opioids (57,438, or 15%). Immigration offenses, which include illegal entry or false claim to U.S. citizenship, were the third-most common crime type (52,128 convictions, or 14%). Those arrested can have more than one type of conviction or pending charge so the total number of charges and convictions is greater than the total number of arrestees; ICE counts an immigrant with a prior criminal conviction and pending criminal charges only in the criminal conviction category.For ICE arrestees with pending criminal charges in 2017, general traffic offenses topped the list of most common charges (24,438, or 17% of all charges), followed by driving under the influence of alcohol (20,562, or 14%) and possession or selling of \u201cdangerous drugs\u201d (19,065, or 13%). Pending immigration violations were the fifth-most common charge (10,389, or 7%).Assault ranked among the five most common pending criminal charges and conviction categories for ICE arrestees in 2017, accounting for 11% and 8% respectively.There\u2019s a new sheriff in town on this issue with President Trump, who was catapulted to the top of the GOP field for his tough stance on immigration. At the same time, it\u2019s a stance that has Congress in a bind, as both sides failed to reach a deal on immigration last week. Yet, Trump\u2019s offer was generous: 1.8 million illegals to receive a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a border wall and other immigration enforcement provisions. That\u2019s all 800,000 Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals recipients, plus a million more; Democrats and some Republicans rejected it. \u00a0DACA is an Obama-era program that shielded children who were brought where illegally from being deported. \u00a0It\u2019s constitutionally questionable, as it raises separation of powers concerns. The Trump White House was faced with a dilemma: either face a lawsuit by a dozen GOP state attorneys general over the illegal Obama executive action or have a gradual wind down of the program, with a six-month enforcement delay to afford Congress time to pass a legal DACA fix. The latter option was chosen. \u00a0The alternative would have been a nationwide injunction that would have put all 800,000 recipients, who have their addresses along with proof that they were in the U.S. illegally, in the crosshairs of deportation. For DACA applicants, admitting that you\u2019re here illegally is part of the process.\u00a0So, that\u2019s why the Hill is taking up immigration and why Democrats decided to shut down the government for illegal aliens in January.

Never mind that members have had no time to read the 1,000-page bill and figure out what is actually in it. They just have to take Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's word. He said, \"It has some things no one likes, and it has a lot of things not everybody likes but most people like. It was a fair compromise.\"\nSchumer's uncharacteristic cheerfulness about the measure probably had much to do with the $900 million in funding for the Gateway tunnel project, a boondoggle supported by all New York-area lawmakers. It most likely won't be in the final bill, though, because President Donald Trump threatened to veto the bill if the project were to be included. Immigration is another sticky point, but we can all expect it to be resolved at some point by nudging the right people for their support.\nYou can also expect Republicans and President Trump to spin this as a \"yuge\" victory for their team. After all, isn't it a sign that they can govern? Sure, if you tolerate massive deficit spending, being irresponsible and pushing all that liability down the throat of future generations. I don't, because I actually care about the well-being of my kids and grandkids.\nTo be fair, this is no surprise. These are the same guys who agreed back in February to add $300 billion of spending over two years to the already monstrous federal tab. Showing yet again that bipartisanship isn't good news for those of us who care about the fiscal path our country is on, the agreement blew the budget caps that were meant to control excess spending by opportunistic politicians.\nDemocrats are, of course, loving it. Let's face it; they know that when Republicans are in power, they can act like a drunken teenager with Daddy's credit card, but they sober up when they have the gavel. What's worse, Republicans are terrible negotiators. For example, Democrats have once again managed to get most of their non-defense priorities funded by the Republican-controlled Congress and White House in exchange for allowing more defense spending. The result is a $143 billion boost to this year's spending above budget caps. Who cares about budget rules and deficits when you can throw more cash at the Department of Defense?\nThis will, of course, lead to much larger deficits than originally projected. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, red ink for 2018 will reach $800 billion. That's a solid $230 billion higher than what was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in its June 2017 10-year forecast. That's a whole $2 trillion in additional debt after just one year of Republican control of the legislative and executive branches.\nLarger deficits also mean larger interest payments. A CRFB analysis found that \"interest payments will quadruple, topping $1 trillion per year in as little as a decade. That's more than we will spend each year on the military or Medicaid, and as a share of the economy, it is the highest in history. ... Over the next decade, we'll spend around $7 trillion -- $55,000 per household -- just servicing our debt.\"\nThe economy is growing. The scale of the Afghanistan War is relatively small -- and even some defense hawks recognize that there's enough waste and unnecessary spending already in the military budget that could be cut to pay for whatever modernization is necessary.

Yes, there\u2019s room for agreement on strengthening background checks on mental health, but Democrats don\u2019t want just that. They need something else to satisfy their confiscatory ethos inherent in this issue. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. That\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s becoming more fact-based as the Democratic Party has lurched to the far left in recent years.\u00a0\nThe tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left seventeen people dead, has thrust gun control back into the limelight. CNN held a town hall on February 21 in Sunrise, Florida, where Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch descended into the lion\u2019s den, facing a rabid anti-gun crowd in what was essentially an Orwellian two minutes of hate exercise against gun owners, conservatives, Republicans, and anyone else who didn\u2019t agree with left wing gun politics. It was a kangaroo court\u2014and we were all found guilty.\u00a0\nNow, YouGov has a poll showing that 82 percent of Democrats want to ban semiautomatic firearms, while they\u2019re evenly split on a total handgun ban. This is where the party stands on gun rights, our civil right to own firearms. They want to shred the Second Amendment and the gauge of Democratic Party members offers a dark vision of what could come if enough of these people are elected to Congress. Allahpundit broke down the numbers:\nYouGov asked people whether they favor or oppose banning semiautomatic weapons. Note: Not semiautomatic rifles, which some might incorrectly but understandably treat as a question about AR-15s or \u201cassault weapons.\u201d YouGov asked about semiautomatic weapons. That means handguns too. Result:\nOverall Americans are at 55/33, with even Republicans at a surprisingly narrow 37/53 in opposition. YouGov should have followed up by asking people to define \u201csemiautomatic\u201d and presenting them with four possible definitions. I\u2019d be curious to see what percentage answered correctly. Instead they followed up by asking how people feel about banning all handguns (except those issued to officers of the state, of course!), which would include revolvers. Result:\nAmericans are strongly opposed overall but Democrats are on the fence at 44/46. Which way will those numbers tilt in coming years, do you suppose, as the party drifts left and gives up on working-class white voters to chase an Obama-style coalition of young adults, minorities, and the highly educated?\nDemocrats are also evenly split at 39/41 on, uh, whether to repeal the Second Amendment.\nHere\u2019s a possible silver lining: maybe the 55 percent figure would go down if people understood the terms. The media is terrible at basic gun knowledge. They think we can buy machine guns in the same fashion as we purchase milk at a grocery store. They think magazines impact the rate of fire; they don\u2019t. They use terms like \u201cassault weapon\u201d and \u201cfull semi automatic,\u201d which are meaningless. So, maybe once the media actually uses firearm lexicon properly, this support for a semiautomatic firearm ban could go down especially with a surge in independents now saying they\u2019re strongly opposed to it. I note the shoddy gun knowledge aspect because if 82 percent of Democrats think all semiautomatics should be banned, then why do only 46 percent support a handgun ban? Could it be that they think semiautomatic weapons specifically concerns the AR-15? Handguns are semiautomatic as well. So, in all, almost the entire party wants to nix firearms in America, with an appallingly high proportion of them saying they want to repeal the Second Amendment outright.\nNew @CNN poll suggests that 57% of respondents support banning\"rifles capable of semi-automatic fire, such as the AR-15.\"\n\nWhat percentage of respondents can accurately define what a \"rifle capable of semi-automatic fire\" is?

I mean it\u2019s nice that we explicitly see where this party stands on Second Amendment rights. But when it comes to issues where bipartisan support can be found, like strengthening mental health provisions for better background checks, will Democrats support it, or drag their feet because they know if it passes\u2014and most likely a bill like this will\u2014then the legislative assault on gun rights will be over. We\u2019ll have something on that later today. In short, the answer is yes\u2014they will drag their feet, even block legislation by their own members. And people wonder why this place is a swamp.\u00a0\nI do think that because of the media disinformation, a lot of answers to these polls can be skewed. Yet, the 82 percent figure with Democrats is different. These people saw \u201csupport,\u201d \u201cban,\u201d and \u201cgun\u201d in the same sentence and said they wanted to ban guns. Okay\u2014the word \u201csemiautomatic\u201d was used, but everyone knows in itself that\u2019s a firearm. It\u2019s hard to skew such a definitive statistic. The Democratic Party wants to impose Australian-style gun bans and execute confiscatory policies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to trust them.

We have federal immigration laws for a reason. The days of Ellis Island and Vito Corleone\u2019s story are over. This is about ensuring people who come here arrive legally. It\u2019s to make sure terrorists don\u2019t have an open door into America. There is nothing racist about enforcing exiting immigration laws, but this is problematic for Democrats. Part of it is the party\u2019s aversion to white people. Another aspect is that Democrats see millions in untapped voter potential with all the illegals that are here. They want open borders. They don\u2019t want enforcement, and they certainly don\u2019t care about the illegals that have killed American citizens either through cold-blooded murder or driving under the influence. Yes, there are bad immigrants, and they certainly shouldn\u2019t be here. They should be deported. The wall should be built. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with the Border Patrol, should have their ranks increased to improve efficiency in enforcement. Yet, to many on the Left, ICE is the modern day Gestapo (isn\u2019t that the IRS?), who are akin to a terrorist organization. A slate of Democrats running in 2018 are running on abolishing the federal law enforcement agency on the basis that it\u2019s pretty much too mean (via The Nation):\nGroups like Indivisible Project and the Center for Popular Democracy have also called for defunding ICE. Brand New Congress, a progressive PAC, has the proposal in its immigration platform.\n\u201cICE is terrorizing American communities right now,\u201d said Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project. \u201cThey\u2019re going into schools, entering hospitals, conducting massive raids, and separating children from parents every day. We are funding those activities, and we need to use all the leverage we have to stop it.\u201d\nThough ICE abolition is spreading on the left, it quickly meets extreme skepticism elsewhere. In part, this is because the mainstream political discourse has a huge blind spot for the agency\u2019s increasingly brutal policies.\n[\u2026]\nOthers tend to dismiss ICE abolition as more of a troll than a serious policy demand. Josh Barro, a senior editor at Business Insider, argued that progressives have not paired the proposal with \u201ca plan to do the function without the hated agency.\u201d\nBut the goal of abolishing the agency is to abolish the function. ICE has become a genuine threat to democracy, and it is destroying thousands of lives. Moreover, abolishing it would only take us back to 2003, when the agency was first formed.\n[\u2026]\nThe central assumption of ICE in 2018 is that any undocumented immigrant is inherently a threat. In that way, ICE\u2019s tactics are philosophically aligned with racist thinkers like Richard Spencer and the writers at the white-supremacist journal VDare.\n[\u2026]\nThe call to abolish ICE is, above all, a demand for the Democratic Party to begin seriously resisting an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state that it had a hand in creating.\nThis is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it https://t.co/GOuoLnBHWG\n\u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) March 9, 2018Yeah, Democrats think this is a winning issue. How far gone do you have to be to think that a healthy majority would want to abolish immigration enforcement and allow illegals to willingly cross the border, some of who will commit crimes and go unpunished? And people wonder why Trump was elected in 2016. Yeah, the Left says they want \u201ccommon sense\u201d reform on enforcement. That\u2019s political speak for doing nothing significant that ensures the protection of the integrity of our border or our citizens.\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s not just left wing publications, like The Nation, that are peddling this nonsense. The Philadelphia Inquirer is running op-eds on it as well:\nThe conduct of ICE and its first cousin, the Border Patrol, has been arguably the darkest moral stain on the sometimes comical but too often diabolical Trump era. And yet these one-off individual outrages \u2014 the Indonesian who led Superstorm Sandy rebuilding efforts who took refuge in a church to avoid ICE, or Philadelphia\u2019s Carmelo Apolonio Hernandez, the mother of four that ICE wants to send back to the Mexican town where her relatives were killed by drug lords \u2014 have a hard time breaking through the bubble, amid the mass chaos of our 45th president. But now we have actual numbers to tell the sorry state of our current Deportation Nation.\nIn the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, we now know, immigration arrests and detentions spiked by a whopping one-third over 2016 \u2014 proof that the president has kept has his campaign promise for a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d merely by \u201ctaking the shackles off\u201d the ready and willing team he already had in place, ICE. What\u2019s more, the biggest driver of this increase has been the seizure of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record, which has doubled under the Trump administration.\nThose are the grim numbers behind a human rights catastrophe of families ripped apart and entire communities in our country now infected by fear, afraid to drive their kids to school or testify against those who actually are criminals. We\u2019ve done a decent job in America teaching our kids about the inhumane nightmares of the recent past, to adopt a mantra, \u201cNever again.\u201d But the not-so-secret-police-force called ICE that operates with an almost mechanical heartlessness within our borders is what \u201cagain\u201d looks like, here in America, in 2018.\nIt\u2019s time to say, \u201cEnough!\u201d\nYet, first things first, you have to win elections to get this plan set in motion, so Republicans\u2014this awaits, along with higher taxes, single-payer health care, speech codes, and gun confiscation.

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is holding firm, though her base of support has been chipping away ever since her party has lost control of the House. The House Minority Leader has promised endlessly that her party would claim victory in 2012, 2014, and 2016. It\u2019s only ended with the GOP majority becoming more entrenched. Now, with Democratic energy at an all-time high, with their first congressional win in the post-2016 era in Pennsylvania, the party, along with their allies in the media, is promising a GOP wipeout. Take that with a grain of salt. We have roughly eight months until Election Day; anything can happen. Plus, this recent election in PA-18 won\u2019t exist soon. It\u2019s quite possible that despite losing the special election, Republican Rick Saccone could be serving with Democrat Conor Lamb; Lamb has already filed to run in PA-18, which will soon encompass more of Pittsburgh. Saccone has filed to run in the more Republican-leaning 14th district. In January, the Democrat-controlled PA Supreme Court tossed the current congressional map.\u00a0\nPA-18 was a +20 Trump district, so you can see why liberal pundits are harping on it. But the GOP turnout was probably depressed due to the resignation of pro-life GOP Rep. Tim Murphy, who resigned after it was revealed that he had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to have an abortion in the midst of a pregnancy scare. This crisis is solely the GOP\u2019s doing, but Lamb ran as a pro-gun, anti-Pelosi Democrat and won. Other Democrats are following suit. Even former Rep. Brad Ashford (D-NE), who is gearing up for a rematch with Republican Don Bacon who beat him in 2016, is running away from Pelosi. Actually, he admitted that Democratic strategists are telling him to flee from the House Minority Leader. Ashford had backed Pelosi while in Congress; I mean it's all there. You have Democratic hopefuls either saying \u201chello no, Nancy,\u201d or we\u2019re not committing just yet. On the Hill, top Democrats like Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Joseph Cawley (D-NY) have laid down the groundwork to launch their own speakership bids should Pelosi\u2019s base of support become smaller. The only downside is if there is a tsunami come November, Pelosi is probably going to become speaker with ease, but anything short of that \u00a0(i.e. Democrats with a slim single-digit majority), then there could be a huge move to clear out the older members of the leadership. The New York Times detailed the brewing revolt against Pelosi, while adding that the longtime Democratic leader had planned to retire if Hillary Clinton had won the election. That plan got shot to hell when Trump won the election. She opted to stay to show there was a powerful woman in politics and to prevent a \u201cmusical chairs\u201d game regarding the vacuum that would have been left with her departure (via NYT):\nA few hours after Conor Lamb, the Pennsylvania Democrat, claimed victory in a House race with a vow to oppose his party\u2019s leader, Nancy Pelosi, the once-and-perhaps-future speaker was explaining to a group of female congressional candidates why she did not retire after 2016.\nShe intended to do so after Hillary Clinton won, Ms. Pelosi recalled Wednesday at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception here. But she stayed to ensure Washington had at least one woman in power.\nTo some lawmakers in the room who described her remarks, the message was clear: Ms. Pelosi is not going anywhere \u2014 a point she underscored in an interview.\nYet her resolve is at odds with growing numbers of Democratic candidates who view her as politically toxic and are pledging to vote against her as their leader, as Mr. Lamb did without suffering consequences with voters and donors. These candidates and some current House Democrats \u2014 tired of years of attack ads invoking Ms. Pelosi as a \u201cSan Francisco liberal,\u201d and impatient to see a younger set of leaders take power \u2014 are now openly distancing themselves from Ms. Pelosi or declaring outright that it is time for her to go.\n[\u2026]\nAt least two other senior Democrats, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and Joseph Crowley of New York, are already actively laying the groundwork to seek the leader\u2019s job if Ms. Pelosi\u2019s position becomes untenable.\n[\u2026]\nAs Democratic House candidates descended on Washington last week for a round of training and fund-raising, the topic of how to confront the Pelosi question came up repeatedly, according to multiple officials.\n\u201cI was just in D.C. and that\u2019s the advice everybody gives: Don\u2019t say you\u2019re for Pelosi,\u201d recalled former Representative Brad Ashford, a Nebraska Democrat trying to reclaim his seat. (He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)\nMost ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.\n\u201cI would have to see who\u2019s running,\u201d said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker.\nFrankly, if chaos is a prelude to a new party that could win, I think a great many Democrats would prefer that, even if it means they fall short in 2018. With Pelosi, disappointment has permeated her time of the helm of the ship. Clear the rot in 2018, gain some ground, and hope a Pelosi-less party could reclaim the majority outright in 2020. Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA) pretty much said she wants the old folks home to be cleared out last October. Last June, there was a realization that the Democratic brand in some parts of the country was worse than Trump\u2019s, and that Pelosi was more toxic than the president. I mean what the hell have they got to lose. They\u2019ve been sucking for almost a decade now.\nRegardless, Pelosi is holding firm, at least for now\u2014saying the Left needs her to quarterback these elections:\nDemonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.\n\u201cI am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,\u201d she said.\nWhile she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.\n\u201cIf I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,\u201d she said.\nStill, from Kansas to Massachusetts, Democrats seem to have a growing impatience with the California Democrat, whom an increasing number are seeing her as an obstacle. In Oregon, the Times noted that Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader has liberal constituents who praise him for voting against Pelosi for leader. Also, for a woman who touts her shrewd political acumen, it was sheer idiocy to bash and denigrate American workers for getting $1,000 or more in bonuses thanks to Trump's tax bill. I don't think 'you're too stupid to understand that $1,000 is crumbs' is an exercise in master political messaging.

Among other proposals, Dick\u2019s called for completely banning \u201cassault-style firearms\u201d and \u201chigh-capacity magazines,\u201d closing the \u201cgun show loophole,\u201d and raising the minimum federal gun buying age to 21. At the same time, Dick\u2019s also announced that they would be complying with their gun control proposals in their own stores from then on.\nOn the same day, Walmart made a similar statement to Dick\u2019s announcing restrictions on its sales of both actual firearms and airsoft toy guns. Importantly for this case, Walmart followed Dick\u2019s lead in implementing a nationwide minimum gun purchasing age of 21 in its stores (Walmart has already had a self-imposed \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban since 2015).\nAccording to Watson\u2019s lawsuit, on February 24th, he walked into one of Dick\u2019s stores with the intention of buying a Ruger .22 caliber rifle, but was prevented from purchasing the gun because he was only 20 years old. On the same day, Watson went to a Walmart store to try purchasing a gun again, but they refused him service too.\nStrangely, Watson tried to make these purchases four days before Dick\u2019s public gun control push and Walmart\u2019s announcement, but the large chain stores\u2019 policies were already apparently in effect.\nWalmart told The Oregonian that it will defend its age limits on buying guns in court:\nWalmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Monday that the retailer will defend its new policy.\n\u201cIn light of recent events, we reviewed our policy on firearm sales,\u201d Hargrove said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs a result, we raised the age restriction for the purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age. We stand behind our decision and plan to defend it. While we haven\u2019t seen the complaint, we will respond as appropriate with the court.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John Stossel", "body": "Sunday, Hollywood sycophants give out Oscars.\nBut they will miss some of the better performances of the year because Academy Awards just go to movie actors.

Some of their performances deserve recognition.\nSo, I created the Stosscars to fill the gap. Here are this year's awards:\nBest Performance by a Rich Elitist goes to Nancy Pelosi. In her eagerness to trash Republican tax cuts, she said this about $1,000 bonuses: \"The crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic.\"\nThe award for Best Performance by a Democrat goes to San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon. After California legalized marijuana, the DA announced he would drop 3,000 misdemeanor marijuana convictions and reduce the penalties for thousands of felony convictions, and the poor guys sitting in jail would not have to petition to get the relief: \"People will not have to hire attorneys. They will never have to come to our courts. We believe it's the right thing to do.\"\nThe Stosscar for Best Performance by the President goes to the speech in which Donald Trump said, \"We have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every one new rule.\"\nIt's not clear that this is true, but the thought behind it is great. Any reduction in regulations will increase Americans' freedom and prosperity.\nOn the other hand, President Trump chose Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions wins the award for Worst Praise of Abusive Government. He said this about asset forfeiture: \"I love that program. We had so much fun doing that, taking drug dealers' money.\"\nFun? Police grabbed billions of dollars, mostly from people who never got trials. That's a crime, not good government, but both political parties supported it.\nStill, it wasn't even the Worst Result of Bipartisanship. Senators Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell win that Stosscar for their recent budget deal.\nSchumer called it, \"The first real sprout of bipartisanship.\" McConnell thanked \"my friend the Democratic leader\" and said he hoped \"we can build on this bipartisan momentum.\"\nPlease don't! That deal added billions of dollars to our unsustainable debt and cut almost nothing.\nDoes any politician ever say \"no\" to more government?\nOne did. Sen. Rand Paul wins the Stosscar for Best Defense of the Constitution. Paul demanded the NSA and FBI get warrants before they listen to Americans' phone calls picked up during surveillance of foreigners.\n\"Do we really want all of our phone calls recorded ... (I)f you are not perfectly accurate in recording your phone calls, you can go to prison? ... (F)or Americans, the Constitution should be in order.\"\nUnfortunately, the Constitution bores most Americans. So domestic spying continues.\nThis year's Stosscar for Best Democrat on Free Speech goes to Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Despite denouncing good people like Charles Murray, she said of them: \"It's dangerous to suppress speech. First, suppression can backfire. Instead of shutting up individuals with disgusting views, it becomes a launching pad to national attention. ... Suppression suggests weakness. It makes it sound like we're afraid that we can't defeat evil ideas with good ideas.\"\nGood point. The way to fight bad ideas is with good ideas. Unfortunately, Warren's ideas are usually not good ideas.\nFinally, the Stosscar for Worst Performance by a President. The winner is ... President Trump -- for bragging like a narcissistic child in tweet after tweet.\nDon't misunderstand. The Stosscar judges love his tweeting, but some bragging is so repulsive it deserves an award. Samples:\nTrump tweeted that he was: \"not smart, but genius ... and a very stable genius at that!\"\n\"Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news -- it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017.\"\nGive me a break. He still hasn't even done anything that affected aviation.\nMany presidential tweets deserve awards.

Despite him hammering Republican Gov. Rick Scott for not attending CNN\u2019s kangaroo court that indicted every law-abiding gun owner, NRA member, and Second Amendment supporter as murderers for merely supporting the Bill of Rights, it hasn\u2019t yielded any political dividends. A new poll showed Scott with a two-point lead over Nelson (via Tampa Bay Times):\nEmerging from his final legislative session, Republican Gov. Rick Scott holds a small lead over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson in a potential U.S. Senate race that could help determine control of the Senate, according to a poll released Monday.\nThe poll of likely voters, conducted this month by the Tallahassee-based firm Clearview Research, shows Scott receiving 43.3 percent of the support, while Nelson gets 41.3 percent. The difference is within the poll's margin of error of 3.58 percentage points.\nScott has not announced that he is running for the Senate but is widely expected to do so \u2014 and no other prominent Republicans are running against Nelson. After the annual legislative session ended Sunday afternoon, Scott indicated a decision on entering the high-profile race could be weeks away.\nThat CNN town hall was one of the biggest political shows of the year, exemplifying the gun control debate in this country and revealing what we all knew about anti-gun liberals\u2019 beliefs and antics. It was a total clown show. Yet, Nelson actually had a shot to gain some ground, but instead decided to politicize the event and turn it into a campaign event. He was criticized for doing so. On top of that, Nelson suffers from poor name recognition, despite being an incumbent U.S. Senator. This piece of data was released in October of 2017 (via Pensacola News Journal):\nDespite 17 years in Senate, Nelson not that well known\nWho the heck is Bill Nelson?\nA new poll suggests that about half of Florida\u2019s voters \u2013 49% \u2013 don\u2019t know enough about the man who has been their U.S. senator for 17 years to form an opinion about the job he\u2019s doing.\n\u201cI saw this number and I was flabbergasted,\u201d said Michael Binder, faculty director of the Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida\u2026\nSo, band name recognition, botching the CNN town hall event, and now he\u2019s dealing with new polling showing that almost half of Floridian voters think the economy has improved from last year.

Moreover, a majority of Florida voters approve of that GOP tax reform package that was signed into law in December of 201; a law that\u2019s incentivized companies to re-invest back into America. Over 250 companies have given bonuses to their employees. Over three million workers have benefitted from the Trump tax package. The overwhelming majority of those who benefit are the middle and working classes\u2014and Democrats decided to screw them over in order to win the 2018 elections. Also, Nelson has shown his hand on gun control, namely saying that the issue will help his party on the ballot. He also appears to be taking advantage of this community\u2019s grief to list-build, which will undoubtedly help his campaign. \u00a0\nPolitico reported last year that the ad campaign in Florida could cost $3 million to run a weeklong media blitz in the Sunshine State.

And yet he\u2019s human rights activist and former political prisoner who suffered tortures Nelson Mandela never even envisioned in his worst nightmares from his (relative) country club incarceration in apartheid South Africa.In fact, Dr. Biscet suffered this jailing and tortures just 90 miles from our shores, in a place absolutely lousy with Fake News Media \u201cnews\u201d bureaus and positively crawling with Fake News Media \u201creporters.\u201dGosh? What could possibly account for this grotesque disconnect between these dramatic, potentially blockbuster human-interest stories on our very doorstep, and the utter silence from all those \u201cGallant Crusades for the Truth!\u201d--as Columbia Journalism schools hails its graduates?Gosh? Might such stories have proven displeasing to the totalitarian apparatchiks who bestow the Fake News Media with their Cuba \u201cpress\u201d bureaus and their \u201cjournalist\u201d visas?It\u2019s a wild guess, but just maybe.Dr. Oscar Biscet is also a presidential Medal of Freedom Winner. More fascinatingly still, he\u2019s also black. Even more amazingly, he\u2019s a foreign \u201cLatino\u201d human rights-activist.With this profile, what odds would Vegas give that the mainstream media would be reporting his every utterance and deed if the medal had been awarded by Obama and his jailers had been an American ally in the Cold War (like South Africa or Pinochet\u2019s Chile?)Alas! Biscet\u2019s Medal of Freedom was awarded by a Republican President (Bush II) and his jailers and torturers were (are) the regime co-founded by the left\u2019s premier pin-up boys (Fidel Castro and Che Guevara.) Any more questions regarding the media black-out on this human rights hero?More specifically, the anti-communist dissident Biscet was jailed and tortured by the Castro regime for peacefully protesting the Stalinist regime\u2019s policy of forced late-term abortions via the drug Rivanol. \"The umbilical cord was cut,\u201d revealed the medical doctor Biscet back in 1998. \u201cAnd they (the babies) were allowed to bleed to death or they were wrapped in paper and asphyxiated.\"Not that most of you have ever heard of this abortion policy from the Castro-accredited U.S. media that \u201creports\u201d from Cuba.What most of you probably have heard from the Castro-accredited U.S. media--from CNN to NBC, from ABC to NPR, from the AP to CBS to The New York Times--is that \u201camazingly low!\u201d Cuban infant-mortality rate! That the Stalinist regime\u2019s abortion policy plays an enormous role in these (nonetheless bogus) low infant-mortality figures is not something the Castro-accredited U.S. media would dare venture to investigate. That Castro-accreditation, you see, would suddenly go POOF!\u201d\u2014and vanish.Castro\u2019s judicial system, lifted from Stalin\u2019s as it functioned during the Great Terror, sentenced Oscar Biscet to 25 years of prison, of which he suffered 11. He was also honored by Amnesty international as one of its official \u201cPrisoners of Conscience,\u201d not that this has much induced the Castro-accredited U.S. media to ever mention Dr. Oscar Biscet.Cuba\u2019s Oscar Biscet suffered longer in Castro\u2019s Gulag than Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalin\u2019s Gulag\u2014and for essentially the same \u201ccrime.\u201d Both Solzhenitsyn and Biscet refused to renounce truth. \u201cLive not by lies\u201d famously advised Solzhenitsyn.This \u201cinconsistency\u201d by the Fake News Media\u2019s reporting on black political prisoners (i.e. featuring Nelson Mandela, almost exclusively) needs further dramatization:According to anti-Apartheid activists, a grand total of 3,000 political prisoners passed through South Africa\u2019s Robben Island prison in roughly 30 years under the Apartheid regime. Usually about a thousand were held. These were out of a South African population of 40 million.According to Freedom House, a grand total of 500,000 political prisoners have passed through Castro\u2019s various prisons and forced labor camps. At one time in 1961, some 300,000 Cubans were jailed for political offenses. This is out of a Cuban population in 1960 of 6.4 million. A quick punch of a calculator will easily reveal the grotesque disparity in repression between the two regimes. A quick scan of the media will reveal the grotesque disparity of condemnation applied to the (relative) molehill instead of to the mountain.In 1964, the government of Apartheid South Africa sentenced Nelson Mandela to 30 years in prison. Mandela\u2019s trial was conducted by an independent judiciary and witnessed by scores of international observers. The charges against Mandela included: \"The preparation, manufacture and use of explosives, including 210,000 hand grenades, 48,000 anti-personnel mines, 1,500 time devices, 144 tons of ammonium nitrate, 21.6 tons of aluminum powder and a ton of black powder. 193 counts of terrorism committed between 1961 and 1963.\"\"The [Mandela] trial has been properly conducted,\" wrote correspondent for the London Observer Anthony Sampson (who later wrote Mandela's authorized biography). \"The judge, Mr Justice Quartus de Wet, has been scrupulously fair.\"Dr. Oscar Biscet and thousands of other Cubans were condemned by a judicial system founded by Felix Dzerzhinsky during Lenin\u2019s Red Terror, perfected by Andrei Vishinsky during Stalin\u2019s Great Terror and transplanted to Cuba in 1959 by their \u201cLatino\u201d disciples. \u201cJudicial evidence is an archaic Bourgeois detail,\u201d Che Guevara stressed to his prosecutors. \u201cWhen in doubt -- execute.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Guy Benson", "body": "To recap, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines last night to make public a classified memorandum, written by Republicans and drawn from US intelligence, pertaining to some element or elements of the overall Russia matter. \u00a0The specific subject matter of the document remains unclear, although the surveillance of former Trump aide Carter Page appears to be at least somewhat relevant. Democrats have objected vociferously to publishing the memo, claiming that it paints an inaccurate picture of reality, based on incomplete information. \u00a0They've drafted their own private memo, which the committee voted unanimously to make available to all House members -- but not the public -- last evening. \u00a0(For what it's worth, I've come to believe that given the volume and severity of the various charges and counter-charges, both memos should be released, along with as much supporting raw intelligence as possible, with a careful eye toward national security considerations). \u00a0Among the criticisms mounted by Democrats in recent days is the accusation that the GOP-authored document isn't factually accurate. \u00a0Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, who first revealed that FBI Director Christopher Wray viewed the memo on Sunday, is reporting today that several FBI/DOJ sources have now viewed the controversial missive and are not questioning its accuracy:Watch the latest video at foxnews.comTwo Senior FBI officials have now reviewed the Republican staff memo, alleging abuses of government surveillance programs during the 2016 election, a source familiar with the matter tells Fox News, adding that the officials \u201ccould not point to any factual inaccuracies.\u201d\u2014 Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) January 30, 2018One of the arguments against publishing the memo was that the FBI and DOJ should be given an opportunity to review its contents and raise concerns on factual or national security grounds. \u00a0According to Herridge's sources, a number of officials have now been afforded that courtesy, and they're not disputing the core facts presented in the memo. \u00a0That doesn't mean that the top brass is now unanimously vouching for its in-context accuracy, or endorsing its conclusions -- nor does it mean that they don't maintain serious qualms about the impact of releasing a document that contains sensitive intelligence. \u00a0Nevertheless, 'not inaccurate' is significant. \u00a0Here's something else to consider: Are Democrats riled up over the prospect of the Republican memo getting out because it contains objectively embarrassing information about their party's actions throughout this whole confusing saga? Here's Congressman Trey Gowdy, who was reportedly instrumental in pressing to allow the FBI access to the memo prior to the vote on its publication:VIDEOMy Democratic colleagues didn\u2019t want us to find this information. They did everything they could to keep us from finding this information. I think it will be embarrassing to Adam Schiff once people realize the extent to which he went to keep them from learning any of this. That would be the embarrassment.Hmm. Meanwhile, the sudden departure of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe remains a hot topic in town, and as we relayed last night, it appears as though McCabe was forced out after Wray was made aware of a \"concerning\" detail uncovered in the course of the nonpartisan Inspector General's investigation of how the FBI handled its probe of Hillary Clinton's national security-compromising email scandal. An MSNBC host tweeted that it was difficult to reconcile Wray's erstwhile passionate defenses of McCabe with his very recent decision to oust McCabe from his position:\u00a0Today:FBI Dir. Wray implies McCabe is out because of internal review of Clinton stuff.

I know which option seems much more likely, especially given the New York Times'\u00a0account of what happened.

When MacCallum asked him about his thoughts on David Hogg, who proudly said that he hung up on the Trump White House, he was visibly irritated.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to control my anger,\u201d he said, noting that it was hypocritical for Hogg to push for change on this issue, only to hang up on the White House who is trying to fin ways to do just that. On a side note, it shows that this isn\u2019t about bipartisanship. Hogg hung up on the White House because of Trump. If a Democrat had called, we all know he would have taken the call. This was about scoring points in left wing activism, and he\u2019s surely succeeded in doing that over the past couple of weeks. Kashuv finds the whole game counterproductive to finding real solutions. He later said he hasn\u2019t spoke to Hogg about this.\nThere were multiple times state, local, and federal authorities could have possibly stopped Cruz from committing this heinous crime. All red flags were not acted upon, which is another issue that should be looked at closely as well. It may not be that we need new gun laws (we don't), it could be that the system needs some reforms, along with competent people to administer the system the could have prevented this strategy.\nEarlier today, Kashuv agreed to meet with the National Rifle Association. At the same time, he appears to be making time to meet with Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX). He's already met with Florida state Sen. Lauren Book, a Democrat.\u00a0\nMore than happy to meet with you guys. Let's schedule a meeting.

Rick Scott [emphasis mine]:\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: David, are you, your family, the community, are you starting to hear a rising concern about how the Broward Sheriffs operated, staying outside while the shooting was going on?\nDAVID HOGG: So, I\u2019m glad you bring that up, and it definitely is raising concern that the fact that they didn\u2019t go in, but that also brings up two things. One\u2014how can we expect our teachers to step in and take action if trained security guards that are part of the sheriff\u2019s department wouldn\u2019t take action? And two\u2014why are these elected officials trying to blame this on the bureaucracy? They\u2019re in charge of them. This is their fault.

Sheriff Israel is not some lowly paper-pushing bureaucrat without any power or authority. He is the elected chief law enforcement officer in Broward County. He and his deputies, who reportedly failed to adequately respond to more than forty calls about Cruz and his violent behavior, were directly in a position to do something to stop him, not Rick Scott.

That\u2019s insane.\nPerhaps even more ridiculous was Hogg\u2019s first point questioning the courage of teachers to protect their students, even knowing about the example of football coach Aaron Feis, who died while shielding Stoneman Douglas students from Cruz\u2019s bullets. Scarborough did follow up Hogg\u2019s comments by bringing up the football coach and Hogg appeared to recall the story, but it was odd to see Feis\u2019s actions being so blithely discounted to make a cheap political point.\nScarborough also criticized the sheriff\u2019s deputies who stood outside the high school while the mass shooting was taking place. Hogg agreed with Joe's point, describing the sheriff\u2019s deputies as \u201ccowardly,\u201d but then he went right back to attacking Gov.

It pretty much was a capitulation to pro-gun control Democrats. While gun bans aren\u2019t on the table, though the latest bill from Democrats come pretty damn close to that\u2014gun confiscation with no due process is troubling.

Here\u2019s how they explained why they endorsed Trump in 2016:\u00a0\nWhen asked if the NRA was concerned about comments in favor of new gun control Trump had made in the years before his presidential run, Cox pointed to Trump's current positions and said the candidate no longer supports an assault weapons ban.\n\"His first position paper that he put out on the campaign was on immigration,\" he said. \"The second position paper was on the Second Amendment. I encourage people to go to his website and read his Second Amendment paper that outlines his opposition to gun bans, his opposition to magazine bans.\"\n\"He was asked about a past comment he had made 20 some odd years ago about supporting a semi-auto ban and he said he no longer supports that position. So, you look at the campaign he's running and the positions he's articulating versus the one hundred percent certainty that we know with Hillary Clinton and that decision becomes crystal clear.\"\u00a0\nDid the Parkland shooting happen because we have lax gun laws and a broken system or is it due to government incompetence? It\u2019s starting to look like the latter. The FBI was informed and did nothing. Local law enforcement was called to the shooter\u2019s home over 40 times, with some calls detailing how the shooter could be a threat to the public\u2014nothing happened. Concerning state officials, if the shooter\u2019s self-mutilation was taken seriously, he could have been committed via Baker Act. That would have shown up on a background check, which could have prevented him from buying an AR-15 in February of 2017, days after he was expelled from the school. It seems the system is not in a crisis mode, we just have incompetent people administering it. As for bump stocks, Trump vowed to ban them through executive order. President Trump has done a lot of good for the country, but I have to disagree vociferously with him on this one.\u00a0\nThe President seems to want a comprehensive piece of legislation that includes Fix NICS, universal background checks, something on mental health, and a ban on those under 21 owning firearms.\n\u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) February 28, 2018So, if I'm understanding this meeting right, Trump supports adding universal background checks to Fix NICS but not concealed carry reciprocity.

And they come at a time when 47 percent of American adults say they have a firearm in the household, which is up from 44 percent in 1999. The numbers also highlight a stark divide by party, with 89 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of independents saying gun ownership increases safety, versus\u00a0just 28 percent of Democrats who agree.\nNearly six-in-ten Americans currently say that owning a gun for self-defense increases one's safety. \u00a0Heading into the 21st century, a majority of Americans believed the opposite. \u00a0That's a big swing. \u00a0And tens of millions of people have put this believe into practice, with nearly half of all US adults reporting that \"they have a firearm in [their] household.\" \u00a0By the way, this is not a GOP-friendly polling series or individual survey either. \u00a0Less than one-third of Democrats agree with the new American consensus on this issue, placing the country's left political flank far out of step with everyone else. \u00a0Close to 90 percent of Republicans take the opposite view, as do roughly two-thirds of independents.

That\u2019s why there is so much pent-up passion for Beto, who is emblematic of the Democratic new wave, unabashedly liberal and well-financed.\nThe El Paso Democrat is 45 and has a background every bit as interesting as his name. Beto is a nickname for Roberto (his first and middle names are Robert Francis) and his surname is Irish. He\u2019s fluent in Spanish and represents a Texas district that is 75% Hispanic (Texas is 28% Hispanic). He is dead set against Trump\u2019s border wall.\nRoy Moore was a tainted candidate. Virginia was a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. I\u2019m not seeing how this is evidence of a wave. Any candidate, but Roy Moore, would have beaten Doug Jones\u2014and Jones will be defeated when he\u2019s up in 2020 if a solid Republican candidate arises. That shouldn\u2019t be hard. And what about Texas? Oh yeah, Republicans cast over 500,000 more votes than Democrats in the gubernatorial primary.

There was no evidence of any crime committed by the Trump administration. But there was plenty of evidence that Russian operatives had tried to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, and perhaps other elections, in the hope of destabilizing democracy. Yet, appointing a special counsel to look for crimes, behind the closed doors of a grand jury, was precisely the wrong way to address this ongoing challenge to our democracy. The right way would have been (and still is) to appoint a nonpartisan investigative commission, such as the one appointed following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, to conduct a broad and open investigation of the Russian involvement in our elections.\nThe vice of a special counsel is that he is supposed to find crimes, and if he comes up empty-handed, after spending lots of taxpayer money, then he is deemed a failure. If he can\u2019t charge the designated target \u2014 in this case, the president \u2014 he must at least charge some of those close to the target, even if it is for crimes unrelated to the special counsel\u2019s core mandate.

Maybe those lesser defendants will flip and sing against higher-ups, but the problem is that the pressure to sing may cause certain defendants to \u201ccompose,\u201d meaning make up or enhance evidence in order to get a better deal for themselves. In this case, the appointment of a special counsel has done more harm than good.\u00a0It has politicized our justice system beyond repair.\nHis concluding suggestion is for Mueller to voluntarily suspend his investigation and for Congress to appoint a bipartisan blue panel commission to dig into the Russia question.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2018\nReality check: The special counsel investigation isn't going anywhere until it's over. \u00a0There is a zero percent chance Congress will recommend that Mueller stop his work or initiate yet another investigation designed to supersede whatever Mueller and his team may be up to. \u00a0Regardless of one's thoughts on the efficacy of the special counsel model (many in the GOP are presently calling for another special counsel, mind you) Mueller is a top-flight professional whose integrity is renowned. \u00a0He's been on the job for many months, and any effort to derail his process or prevent his conclusions from coming to light will be widely viewed as a crisis-level development. \u00a0As I've written many times, once Mueller was put on the job, it became essential that he be allowed to finish that job. \u00a0Plus, the Senate Intelligence Committee is acting as the very sort of fact-finding, solutions-oriented bipartisan panel envisioned by Dershowitz. \u00a0Even if it's not a full-blown national commission, the partnership of Richard Burr and Mark Warner has been constructive -- to the point that even Donald Trump, Jr. has praised the committee's professionalism and focus. \u00a0As for the current (quasi-regular) wave of panic sweeping DC about Trump potentially firing Mueller, it sounds like Speaker Ryan has been hearing the same things Sean Hannity has:\n\"I\u2019ve received assurances that his firing is not even under consideration,\" says @SpeakerRyan, asked about Pres Trump's attacks on Special Counsel Mueller. Ryan says the Special Counsel \"should be free to follow through his investigation to its completion without interference.\" pic.twitter.com/7uRysSIddd\n\u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) March 20, 2018\nWhen pressed on where those assurances came from, Ryan declined to get more specific than citing the administration. \u00a0Ryan and Hannity seem to be reading from the same page as the White House:\u00a0Firing Mueller ain't happening. \u00a0On a related note, much to my chagrin, both the president and many of his loudest detractors have tied the dismissal of former FBI deputy chief Andrew McCabe to the Mueller controversy, even though the facts demonstrate that the two issues are separate. \u00a0Nevertheless, because this connection has been established in the realm of public perception, it's worth pointing out that current FBI Director Christopher Wray -- who is widely respected across the political spectrum -- has insisted that McCabe's termination was not related to politics:\n\u201cI am committed to doing things objectively and independently and by the book. I think that has to extend not just to our investigations, our intelligence analysis, but it also has to extend to personnel decisions and disciplinary decisions,\u201d Wray told NBC News\u2019 Pete Williams. Wray said he was not addressing the details of McCabe\u2019s termination, but maintained that he was committed to not allowing politics to be a factor in decisions at the FBI. \u201cI want to be careful about what I can say about the process\u201d of McCabe\u2019s firing, Wray said. \u201cBut I will tell you that my commitment to making sure that our process is followed, that it relies on objective input, and that most importantly, it is not based on political or partisan influence is something I am utterly unyielding on.\u201d\nTranslation: McCabe was sacked for cause, based on misconduct, not due to political considerations or pressures. \u00a0It was done \"by the book.\" \u00a0And he's seen the relevant evidence. \u00a0Would the anti-Trump forces fretting that McCabe's firing is \"dangerous\" or whatever like to question the honesty of Mr. Wray? \u00a0Would that not be exactly the sort of \"attack on the FBI\" for which they've been excoriating Trump, sometimes justifiably? \u00a0Or do the hacktastic new rules dictate that flagrant, self-serving double-standards are just fine, so long as your side is \"winning\" at any particular moment?", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Lawrence Meyers", "body": "I\u2019m a small government guy, however, it\u2019s sadly apparent that the United States of America is paralyzed with political indecision over something the State of Israel figured out more than 40 years ago: all schools should have mandated security features and active shooter protocols.The horrific scene in Parkland, and the upsetting videos broadcast from the school during the shooting, should be the final straw. \u00a0The kids should not have been hiding and screaming, they should have been in the midst of a pre-determined security protocol.President Trump, if the Department of Education can force Americans to deal with the disaster of Common Core, it can certainly issue a federal mandate regarding school security. The time is now. \u00a0My personal manifesto is that government should never get involved in an issue unless an ongoing clear and present danger exists to large numbers of people, and that any regulation or legislation has a sunset provision.Here we are.In 1974, Israel endured the Ma\u2019alot Massacre in which \u201cPalestinian\u201d terrorists took 115 people hostage at Netiv Meir Elementary School. \u00a0Twenty-two children and three others were killed and 68 injured. \u00a0Israel now requires schools with 100 or more students to have a guard posted. The civilian police force handles the entire security system of all schools from kindergarten through college. \u00a0The Ministry of Education funds shelters and fences, reinforces school buses, and hires and trains guards.Guards don\u2019t just stand around. \u00a0They check everyone entering, and engage threats.And yeah, they\u2019ve got guns.The lawful purposes for carrying guns are very clear: protect school personnel and students, create a sense of security, deter the ill-intentioned, and provide self-defense.\u00a0Common sense. \u00a0 Except to the illogical dullards who claim that \u201cadding guns to schools won\u2019t fix anything\u201d and are fixated on the NRA and the ridiculous notions that gun laws magically stop criminals and crazy people from obtaining one of the 300 million guns in our country.But more to the point, Israel\u2019s Police Community  Civil Guard Department have a preventative care program that encourages safe behavior and offers violence protection strategies in normal situations. \u00a0Yet students are also trained in how to respond to an active shooter situation.Ben Goldstein, an American who made aliyah to Israel, and now serves as volunteer security and supporter of IDF soldiers, says America is behind the curve. \u00a0Nevertheless, he says, it doesn\u2019t take much for students and teachers to protect themselves.\u201cBarricade, barricade. Are desks movable? \u00a0Is the teacher\u2019s desk movable? \u00a0Can they barricade inside of 20 seconds? If the shooter gets in, the kids should take whatever they\u2019ve got and attack. \u00a0They can\u2019t just sit there frozen or they will die. \u00a0America does earthquake drills, why not active shooter drills? \u00a0 More kids have been killed by shooters than earthquakes.\u201dBarricading works, says Goldstein.In an active shooter situation, where a gunman is roaming a campus, five minutes is a lifetime, enough time for law enforcement to get to the scene. \u00a0\u201cIn those five minutes, the shooter will have to move from class to class, reload, clear malfunctions, all that stuff takes time. \u00a0And during gunfire lulls, kids must be taught to do something. \u00a0Don\u2019t freeze.Moving once gets you out of that deer-in-headlights space. \u00a0Take command of the classroom.\u201dThere is no other way, says Goldstein, and \u201csometimes children must take matters into their own hands.If the school has no proper security \u2013 two guards in case one gets shot, and no active shooter protocol, and no doors to withstand an attack \u2013 then the child needs to run as fast as they can AWAY from the shooter.\u201dBecause right now, America is the deer-in-headlights. \u00a0Gun control debates are a distraction and impractical, and criminals ignore laws anyway.Crazy people are obviously not being dealt with properly \u2013 students at Parkland even predicted this would happen.The only solution is for America to toughen up. \u00a0We have a pugilist for a president, and that is long overdue. \u00a0Now its time for President Trump to fight for our children by wielding government power in the proper manner, to do something that any reasoned American would agree with. \u00a0Instead of handing out participation trophies, let\u2019s make our kids into the self-reliant, pro-active defenders of themselves and others.Mr. President, the time is now.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Reeves", "body": "Political rebellion is brewing in Southern California over the state\u2019s official sanctuary policies.

Part of me had hoped the party of grave-dancing would find using children in this way would be a bridge too far, but the rest of me knew they didn\u2019t have it in them to be tactful, decent people. After all, every left-wing activist group had, one day after the shooting, \u00a0started sweeping into town to organize what they and their fellow travelers in the media all claimed was an \u201corganic, grassroots\u201d response to the tragedy. If they couldn\u2019t wait 24 hours before attaching the marionette strings to those kids, the fact that they waited 2 weeks before attempting to use them to line their own pockets is as close to decency as they\u2019re going to get.\nWith that in mind, and as liberals line up behind a shield made of children to march on the Second Amendment, it\u2019s important to remember what happens when you attempt to compromise with people whose ultimate goal is your obliteration and why no amount of compromise will ever be enough.\nThere is an example from our recent past that shows how compromise works when it comes to big government liberals. It may not be perfect, and it isn\u2019t pretty, but it is what happens when you accept the concept of diminishing the rights of innocent people over the actions of the guilty.\nYou have to dig in your heels and make clear you will never, ever acquiesce to their demands. This has been the tactic of the National Rifle Association when it comes to the Second Amendment, and it is the correct choice. But it hasn\u2019t been the choice made by others in the past.\u00a0\nOne particular group that has seen \u201ccompromise\u201d used as a way to strip them of their rights is smokers. Now smokers aren\u2019t exactly a group of people who are going to elicit a lot of sympathy or concern from people (junkies, sure, but people who use a legal product are fair game when it comes to attack, which is weird). But what happened to smokers is a useful tool for illustrating why the American people should not compromise with liberals when it comes to one of our fundamental freedoms.\u00a0\nComedian and podcaster Adam Carolla has made this point many times on his show, so I can\u2019t take credit for it. But it certainly exemplifies how a slope quickly becomes slippery and, if your interest is simply compromise, you can compromise your rights away.\nTo paraphrase Carolla, there was a time when you could smoke in restaurants. They are private property, and if the owner wanted to allow smoking, smoking was allowed. Then the government (liberals) decided smokers should be herded into their own area of a restaurant, the \u201csmoking section.\u201d So they went so smokers in the main dining room and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need you to sit over here, in this side room You can smoke all you want, we just don\u2019t want other people to smell it while they\u2019re eating. You understand, right?\u201d\nSmokers, not wanting to cause a scene and knowing some non-smokers could be annoyed, happily complied.\u00a0\nThen the government comes back and says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need you to move to the bar area when you smoke. People are drinking there, and eating here, so it\u2019d just be better if you moved over there.\u201d\nSmokers picked up their ashtrays, \u201cSure thing,\u201d they said, and moved to the bar.\nThe government comes back and says they need smokers to step out front. \u201cIf you could just stand out front and smoke, that would be much better for everyone, OK? Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s an awning and a heater, so you\u2019ll be protected from the weather.\u201d\nSmokers picked up and moved outside.\n\u201cIf you could move 50 feet from the door, that would be very helpful,\u201d the government said next. \u201cPeople smell smoke as they walk in the door and we don\u2019t want that. Thanks.\u201d\nAnd now smokers are stuck down the block, wet and wondering how this happened. If someone had come up to them at first and said, \u201cHey, get down the street if you want to smoke,\u201d it never would have happened, they wouldn\u2019t have stood for it. But little by little, inch by inch, they moved because each move was small and seemed like a compromise.\u00a0\nNow smokers are never getting back inside, even if the owners of a bar or restaurant want them to. Their rights are gone, the private property rights of the owners are gone, and it was all done in the name of compromise.\nThere is no compromise with someone who doesn\u2019t want you to exist, there is only incrementally losing ground until you no longer exist. A right diminished will never return, government does not cede back power once seized.\u00a0\nThe NRA is right to hold its ground, it\u2019s why the organization exists in the first place. Liberals are not honest brokers when it comes to the issue of guns, and neither is the media. Trying to appease leftists never works because nothing short of everything they want is ever enough for them.\nIf people who support the Second Amendment start to compromise with liberals whose ultimate goal is to strip everyone of their right to defend themselves, it won\u2019t be too long before they\u2019re out on the street in the rain with the smokers.

I'll return to the former in a moment, but on the latter, it looks like Democrats -- who've already rejected the White House's broadly-supported 'four pillars' DACA compromise proposal -- are also uninterested in a narrower swap. \u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reports:\nTrump also pushed Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in recent days to close a narrow deal that would protect immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for three years in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funding, according to two Republican officials familiar with the discussions...Democrats were pushing for protections for a larger pool of immigrants, but a Democratic aide said the White House was rejecting that approach. The aide said Tuesday that there are continued musings about a deal but that chances for an agreement were remote.\nRepublicans offered a three-year extension of DACA for all current recipients (the original Trump plan turned down by Democrats would have covered hundreds of thousands of additional eligible 'DREAMers' who never enrolled in DACA) in exchange for $25 billion in wall and border security funding. Other (again, popular) elements of the original plan were off the table, including chain migration and the 'diversity visa' lottery. Democrats have apparently once again said no, leaving prospects for a DACA resolution at a standstill [see update]. \u00a0DACA technically expired earlier this month, but Democrats seem to be comfortable allowing the issue to languish in the courts until they have more power and leverage to fashion legislation that's more to their liking. \u00a0\n\nAs an aside, it's infuriating to conservatives that an executive action conjured into existence by the stroke of a president's pen cannot simply and quickly be undone with another presidential signature. \u00a0It remains unlikely that the judiciary can permanently block Trump on this, but they can gum up the works for awhile. For their part, Democrats are risking angering an element of their base by again declining to play shutdown politics with DACA, but their lone previous attempt to do so ended badly for the party. \u00a0The only \"concession\" they \"won\" as they retreated from that misadventure was an agreement from Mitch McConnell to allow a series of immigration votes in the future. And when that future arrived, the Senate agreed to...nothing. \u00a0Speaking of which, let's turn to gun policy:\nFix NICS is still up in the air for omnibus Fox is told Ryan and McConnell want to include it.

Democrats were seeking to couple that provision with a gun measure of their own.\" \u00a0In the past, Democrats criticized Republicans for insisting that concealed carry reciprocity be linked to 'Fix NICS,' which was a fair point. \u00a0But now the roles have apparently reversed, with Republicans offering the bipartisan background check bill as a standalone element within the larger package -- and it's Democrats threatening to axe it if it's not coupled with more gun control.\n\n\u00a0We'll see if this cynical approach is rewarded in the final legislation. \u00a0Making consensus progress on background checks and school safety should be no-brainers, but agenda-driven poison pills are capable of derailing almost anything, it seems. \u00a0That's how gun votes have gone in recent years. \u00a0Finally, Obamacare funding is a flashpoint in this debate. \u00a0Will Congress agree to provide funding for the failing law (this is an interesting development on that topic, incidentally), or not? \u00a0And while we're on the subject, shouldn't the GOP use this opportunity to further dismantle President Obama's signature, unsuccessful domestic policy achievement?\nWhy not use the omnibus spending bill to repeal/dramatically curtail Obamacare's employer mandate -- implementation of which Obama unilaterally/illegally delayed several times  drastic changes to which have been supported by multiple Senate Democrats? https://t.co/Rlvt0bldIP\n\u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) March 21, 2018", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Katie Pavlich", "body": "President Donald Trump is expected to fire VA Secretary David Shulkin and is strongly considering replacing him with U.S. Army Veteran Pete Hegseth, according to three sources who spoke to Townhall under the condition of anonymity.

Well, there\u2019s a DOJ report that\u2019s about to be released that details how the top FBI official misled investigators and signed off on a media disclosure that detailed the warring state of affairs between the bureau and the Department of Justice concerning the investigation into the Clinton Foundation (via WaPo):\nThe Justice Department inspector general is preparing a damaging report on former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, alleging he was responsible for approving an improper media disclosure, two people familiar with the matter said. One of the people said McCabe will also be accused of misleading investigators about his actions.\nThe report is a part of Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s broad review of the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\nDuring that work, inspector general\u2019s investigators found that McCabe had authorized the disclosure of information to the Wall Street Journal for an October 2016 story that examined feuding inside the FBI and Justice Department around the handling of a separate investigation into Clinton\u2019s family foundation, two people familiar with the case said.\nThose probing the matter believe that McCabe, who stepped down in January, misled them when they initially inquired about the subject, though one person familiar with the forthcoming report said McCabe disputes that he intentionally misled investigators.\nIt is unclear how McCabe is said to have misled investigators.\u00a0\nGuy wrote previously about what caused McCabe to leave prior to his pre-determined retirement in March. It was the DOJ inspector general, who found something disconcerting, which prompted FBI Director Chris Wray to order McCabe into another office. It would have been a demotion, so McCabe decided to exit early.\u00a0\nMcCabe has been a controversial figure at the bureau. He\u2019s directly mentioned in the text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and bureau attorney Lisa Page. The number of messages are in the tens of thousands, but they\u2019re pro-Hillary and explicitly anti-Trump. This is not something you can tolerate during a counterintelligence investigation into Russia-Trump collusion, which Strzok signed off on in July of 2016. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s tolerable when you\u2019re investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, which Strzok was also apart of\u2014and there\u2019s even a text from Page wondering if the FBI was going too hard on the former first lady. The allegation of the fix being in is palpable. When Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who now heads the FBI\u2019s collusion probe, found out about the texts last summer, he removed Strzok and transferred him to human resources in August of 2017. Strzok was a top counterintelligence agent.\u00a0\nThe other eyebrow raising text was one sent by Strzok to Page on August 15, 2016, where the former mentions meeting with \u201cAndy,\u201d McCabe, and mentions an \u201cinsurance policy.\u201d That insurance is alleged to be the Trump dossier, compiled by a British ex-spook who was contracted by Fusion GPS after their services were retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign. It was opposition research that looks like was used to secure a FISA warrant to spy on former Trump adviser Carter Page. \u00a0The two also discussed ways to skirt federal records regulations, so why are they still at the FBI? That\u2019s a tale for another time. For now, we await the DOJ\u2019s report on McCabe and how this is part of a long and sad story about how the nation\u2019s preeminent law enforcement and domestic intelligence agency become engulfed in politics, damaging its reputation for professionalism and impartiality on its investigations. \u00a0Last December, McCabe also drew the ire of House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee after he said he didn\u2019t know where the dossier\u2019s funding came from, despite signed documents by him showing that he knew how this document was financed.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Cortney O'brien", "body": "Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf's decision to alert the Bay Area last month that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was on its way to conduct a raid already appears to have had dangerous consequences.

Businesses added 234,000 jobs in January versus an expected 185,000. Manufacturing added 12,000 jobs and construction 9,000 new jobs - in a traditionally slow month.

Some, including a representative from the ACLU, warned the council that if approved, the new local law would lead to a lawsuit.\n\u201cIf you could build a big, beautiful wall along the 605 (Freeway,) even though that would inconvenience me tremendously, I would give you a thumbs up,\u201d Long Beach resident Janet Wess told the council.\nSamantha Reed, 19, a UC Irvine freshman who graduated from Los Alamitos High, told the council that she won\u2019t forget election-time if members vote for the proposed ordinance.\n\u201cYou do not represent me by passing this ordinance,\u201d Reed said.\nOne long-time resident, Javier Mejia, choked up as he described that he\u2019s proud of his Mexican heritage but is \u201c100 percent American.\u201d He urged the council to vote for the proposed ordinance.\nAccording to video taken at the event, one of the speakers who spoke in opposition to the ordinance compared ICE agents to Nazis when she argued that: \u201cAs I read about ICE rounding up the suspected illegal immigrants with common surnames, many are law-abiding citizens, and it reminds me of Nazi Germany.\u201d\u00a0\nAnother speaker who addressed the council in support of the ordinance made the more cogent argument that: \u201cWe have the law of the land, and that constitution says that the federal government is in charge of immigration law, not the state of California.\u201d\nA self-identified legal immigrant also spoke in favor of Kusumoto\u2019s proposal:\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping and praying that this is the first city, and I\u2019m hoping and praying that other cities will wake up and put the American people first. We need to put the American agenda first. It has nothing to do with color. I\u2019m brown. I\u2019m from El Salvador. It has nothing to do with immigration \u2014 it has to do with legal and illegal.\u201d\nUltimately, the council voted 4-1 in support of the ordinance and amended it to include a directive to the Los Alamitos city attorney to write an amicus brief supporting Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s federal lawsuit against California for its sanctuary state policies.\nCouncilman Mark Chirco, who was the sole dissenting voice in Monday\u2019s vote, took to his official Facebook account afterwards to express his fear that the State of California will now target the small city for a legal challenge:\n\u201cWhen I joined the city council, I vowed that every single vote I would make would be to protect and further the interests of the citizens and businesses of Los Alamitos. I often have disagreements with the laws that are passed in Sacramento. However, after carefully weighing both sides of a very complicated and emotional issue, I could not see how the ordinance proposed tonight would benefit our city. Rather, the ordinance will place our city in danger of a costly and uphill battle with the State of California. For these reasons, I cast the lone vote against the ordinance. I believe our small city is not the appropriate venue nor does it have the resources to fight this battle.\u201d\nAlthough Chirco did not mention them by name, he is also likely worried about the ACLU\u2019s threat to take legal action against the city.\nThe council will have to vote again on April 16th to formally adopt the ordinance into law.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, pro-illegal alien activist groups like the ACLU have already called on their supporters to increase pressure on city authorities to back down:\nCORRECTION: While the ordinance was approvingly introduced, it will not be officially voted on until April 16.\n\nKeep the pressure up  urge the Los Alamitos City Council to do the right thing.

The early voting for Texas Democrats is sky high. The enthusiasm is high. Texas could turn blue in the Trump era. Well, almost all of that was false. This is a mythical unicorn the Democrats keep chasing, turning Texas Blue and once again they were met with disappointment. Now, for Republicans, they\u2019ve been trying to nab Pennsylvania since 1988, which was finally done under Donald J. Trump.\nRepublicans broke their own record for midterm turnout, with over 1.5 million casting ballots in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Why? Well, while the Democrats dominate the cities (shocker!), their strength in rural America remains absolute trash.\u00a0\nVIDEO\n\n\u201cYet even as Democrats in the state\u2019s biggest cities came out in large numbers, Republicans still cast more ballots over all thanks to their rural strength,\u201d reported The New York Times. The only thing Democrats have going for them in the Lone Star State is enthusiasm, but that\u2019s no guarantee of victory (via Politico):\nThe 2018 midterms kicked off in eye-opening fashion in Texas on Tuesday, as a series of surprises in Democratic House primaries jolted the landscape while the party\u2019s large turnout sent a warning to Republicans nationwide.\nBut the GOP remained in the driver\u2019s seat in statewide races throughout Texas by night\u2019s end, leaving most of the shocks to down-ballot races.\nWashington Democrats saw some of their runoff plans go down the drain. Well-funded candidates fell in contest after contest. George P. Bush unexpectedly cruised to victory. And women kept on winning.\nThe Democratic civil war that erupted in the Texas primaries will continue as Laura Moser, a progressive insurgent, claimed the number two spot in the race for the Texas 7th congressional district, triggering a runoff and keeping that wound between establishment and progressives open. Here\u2019s some background on that race prior to Election Day (via CNN):\nA crowded Democratic House primary in the Houston area has become a stand-in for the broader battle within the party between progressives who backed Bernie Sanders and members of the establishment.\nThe controversy erupted more than a week ago, when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s political arm for House races, unleashed a scathing attack against journalist and activist Laura Moser, one of seven candidates in the Texas 7th District Democratic primary to take on Republican Rep. John Culberson this fall.\n[\u2026]\nCentral to the DCCC's case against Moser is a 2014 Washingtonian article in which she wrote that she'd \"sooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\" than live in Paris, Texas. The committee feared the article was ready-made for scathing attack ads casting Moser as a DC-loving, Texas-loathing carpetbagger -- the kind that her campaign might never be able to overcome. Attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, nonprofit executive Alex Triantaphyllis and oncologist Jason Westin are others seen as leading candidates.\n\"Democratic voters need to hear that Laura Moser is not going to change Washington. She is a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress,\" the DCCC said on its website as it posted a bundle of research critical of Moser.\u00a0\nBut progressive activists were incensed to see the DCCC -- which has long been accused of recruiting too many moderate, milquetoast candidates and weighing fundraising potential too heavily in deciding who to back -- weigh in with such a heavy hand less than three weeks from the March 6 contest.\nWell, even as liberal publications are noting, Moser survived, with some, like Mother Jones, saying this DCCC attempt to wipe her out \u201cblew up\u201d in their face:\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee waded into the seven-way primary for Texas\u2019 seventh congressional district last month with a specific goal in mind: delivering a knockout blow to Laura Moser, a freelance writer and Resistance activist with a large national following, who it feared would crater the party\u2019s chances in the closely watched swing district.\nBut the DCCC\u2019s attacks on Moser 10 days before the primary\u2014a broadside so clumsy and transparent it drew criticism from DNC chair Tom Perez and members of Congress\u2014didn\u2019t work as intended. Moser raised $87,000 in the days after the DCCC nuclear barrage and basked in the free publicity during the homestretch of the campaign. And on Tuesday, she secured a spot in the May 22nd runoff against Lizzie Fletcher, a Houston lawyer backed by EMILY\u2019s List who led the field in the first round of voting.\nNow Democrats in the seventh district, a longtime Republican stronghold that swung harder to Hillary Clinton than any other district in the country in 2016, will be faced with an unusual choice: a progressive candidate denounced by the official campaign organ of the House Democratic caucus, or a more moderate candidate rejected by the AFL-CIO.\nThis infighting among Democrats in competitive races is what very well could derail their 2018 plans. With TX-7, it\u2019s a total split among the base concerning the Democratic candidates and the organizations that have endorsed them.\u00a0\nVIDEO\n\nCongrats to Beto O\u2019Rourke for winning the right to get steamrolled by Ted Cruz in November!\n\u2014 Sean Spicier (@sean_spicier) March 7, 2018Dems accounted for ~40% of all TX primary votes cast this year. That's up from 29% in 2014  31% in 2010, but it's a bit lower than some Dems were hoping (they were 44% in 2006). Despite Trump's mediocre standing in TX, it's still a pretty Republican state.\n\u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 7, 2018Does this mean a blue wave is about to wash over TX? Most likely not.

Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Ted Cruz? Yeah, he won his primary\u2014but he\u2019s not going to win if he barely gets above 30 percent in the rural areas. Once again, Democrats are given a reminder that the cities can\u2019t carry you to victory (via WSJ):\nTexans also voted in primaries for state races, including governor and the state legislature. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is also up for re-election and won the GOP nomination with no serious primary opposition. Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke won his party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Cruz in what is shaping up as an unusually competitive race.\nAlthough Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s victory was solid, early returns showed his support was weak in the rural areas where he has campaigned aggressively in his effort to appear in every one of the state\u2019s 254 counties. While Mr. Cruz won his party\u2019s nomination by a resounding margin, Mr. O\u2019Rourke lost almost 40% of the Democratic primary vote to two little-known, poorly funded opponents.\nSo, there you have it. Maybe the early voting number isn\u2019t the best gauge for measuring real, actual turnout. There is no doubt that the shifting demographics could make Texas a more competitive state, which should keep Republicans up at night, but for this cycle\u2014the Democratic wave hopes in Texas is all hype.\u00a0\nFolks, it came as a great surprise to me that the early vote in a few Texas counties turned out not to be predictive of actual overall turnout.

The American Mirror captured the possible nasty spill, but it\u2019s also a great image that says so much about her campaign and the nonsense she doled out at an event in Mumbai. India Today\u2019s Aroon Purie interviewed her. He asked if America deserved a Trump presidency. Lauretta covered this yesterday, where the former secretary of state said of course not. Oh, and she decided to reload her deplorables attack on the people who voted for him:\nVIDEO\n\n\"His whole campaign: 'Make America Great Again' was looking backwards. You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women, you know, getting jobs, you don't want to you know see that Indian American succeeding more than you are, whatever your problem is, I'm going to solve it.' So it was a symptom.\" \u00a0 \u00a0\nOh, but she had more before this slice of nonsense (via NTK Network):\nIf you look at the map of the United States, there\u2019s all that red in the middle where Trump won. I win the coasts, I win Illinois, I win Minnesota, places like that,\u201d Clinton said.\n\u201cWhat the map doesn\u2019t show you is that I won the places that represent two-thirds of America\u2019s gross domestic product,\u201d Clinton explained. \u201cSo I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was looking backwards.\u201d\nAlas, folks\u2014why her almost falling down some stairs is emblematic. The first trip up was her pretty much calling half the country deplorable for supporting Trump. Also, totally avoiding the Rust Belt and rural America, as if the former was already locked up and the latter totally lost to the GOP. It\u2019s about margins. If Hillary had lost white working class voters by a two-to-one margin, instead of her three-to-one with Trump, she would have won the race. It\u2019s not hard. Obama did this twice. He knew he probably wasn\u2019t going to win rural America, but losing by 25 points instead of 50, plus winning the areas that she so eloquently described as the only places that matter in the U.S., is how Obama was able to defeat the GOP in both presidential contests. Oh, and he also had an economic message, had political skill, and drove an appealing message to voters; Clinton had none of that because she has no political talent, she had no message, and she wonders why she lost. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I forgot; she takes responsibility for her shocking loss to Trump, but the FBI, Russia, James Comey, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, the Democratic National Committee, and Wikileaks are to blame too. Did the Kremlin tell her to avoid Michigan? No, she was getting dirt from them on Trump through the services of Fusion GPS, who hired a former British spook to collect the data. That sort of sounds like collusion, right? Or at least according to liberal Democrat standards set forth by members of said party and the media. Lady, own it\u2014and move on.\u00a0\nIf we were to apply something to go with her second almost trip up down the stairs, it would be her explicitly anti-rural bias. I won the coasts, the cities, and a few states in between\u2014you know the real places that matter in America. Northeastern elitism reeks with these remarks. I know\u2014I grew up in the Northeast and let me tell you, these people still don\u2019t know that some folks in this country still need to hunt in order to survive, especially during the winter. No, hunting didn\u2019t just stop after the colonial era and the days of Daniel Boone.\nVIDEO\u00a0\nAlso, it\u2019s another deplorables swipe without saying the word. The rural areas are full of country bumpkins and racists, who aren\u2019t educated like us highly educated, morally superior, and insufferably snobby people. I may have lost, but I won the real Americans in November 2016. No\u2014you didn\u2019t, lady. You just lost. Is there some solace in how close it was in some states? Maybe\u2014but you still lost. That\u2019s like saying, well, we lost the football game but we scored four touchdowns\u2014the ones that really mattered. It embodies how the professional left has taken over the Democratic Party, who are anti-rural, hate rural voters, yet totally unaware that rural voters are the folks they desperately need to win back. Take a look at Texas. Democrats cast a lot of ballots in the primaries last Tuesday. Why were there over 500,000 more Republican votes cast? Rural Texas is a GOP stronghold. Rural voters are movable. They will vote Democratic if you give them a reason, have an agenda that isn\u2019t something out of far left social justice warrior\u2019s diary, and have quality candidate who can a) win; and b) doesn\u2019t bash them for being less than those coastal elites. So, take notes rural and Trump voters. Democrats think you\u2019re less than, live in backwards, Deliverance-esque surroundings, and are just relics of an old America that should die out and be relegated to economic destitution. Anyone remember when she wanted to put coalminers out of business?\u00a0\nHuh. AP\u2019s writes up Clinton\u2019s remarks in the most benign/favorable way.

It\u2019s pathetic. Hillary almost falling down those steps captures her rather ugly descent since leaving public life.

She also strongly dislikes when people call Trump supporters racist because it is so easy and wrong. The Michigan Democrat added that her party could learn something from Trump: show you care, have a message, that you get these peoples\u2019 concerns (the economic issues), and have some empathy. Trump did that in his Rust Belt excursions.

How many legal, law-abiding, native-born Americans will be robbed, raped, or murdered in the coming weeks because of that act of sedition?\nA California judge just sided with the ACLU and barred LA County from enforcing gang restrictions that dramatically lowered crime.

Lizbeth Mateo, a 33-year old illegal alien-turned-attorney, will serve on the official state committee that doles out money to illegals attending college.

It\u2019s not a \u201cSanctuary State.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cFugitive State.\u201d It\u2019s a place that chooses to let felons and fugitives run free. It\u2019s a place where the rights of criminals are far more important than protecting legal, law-abiding American citizens who pay taxes. We are the second class citizens in California.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the way to fix the problem. Liberal Californians want to secede. I'm joining the movement. How about you?\u00a0\nConservatives should beg California to secede. We should make it easy for them. We should help pay for it. Pass the hat. Every conservative should chip in $20. I\u2019ll throw $1000 to get the ball rolling.\nJust think of elections. Without California, Trump and all future Republican presidential candidates would win, without breaking a sweat. Without California, we\u2019d easily win the popular vote. And we'd win the electoral vote by a landslide.\nNext think of Congress. California has 53 House seats. Democrats lead 39-14, for a net gain of 25 seats. Send California packing and the GOP gains a 25 House seat lead. We would dominate the House for decades to come.\u00a0\nAnd of course, the GOP would gain an automatic two seats in the Senate through the subtraction of California. As it stands now, those two U.S. Senate seats are deep blue Democrat forever. But if California secedes a 51-49 GOP lead instantly moves to 51-47.\u00a0\nIf 63 million Trump voters just gave an average of $20 each to the \"Calexit movement\" that\u2019s over $1.2 billion dollars.

With scenic beauty, the Pacific Ocean coastline, the major cities of San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, California recruited entrepreneurs looking for economic growth. As the home of Hollywood and multitudes of celebrities, California presented an enticing potential to enjoy\u201clifestyles of the rich and famous.\u201d\nToday, California has become an economic and cultural disaster. The state is home to over 114,000 homeless people, one quarter of the total in the nation. In San Francisco, a health crisis has developed as the homeless have created a mess in the downtown area, littering it with fecal matter, spent needles and piles of trash.\nThe droughts have led to misguided water regulations imposed by environmentalists and liberal government bureaucrats. These officials also love to burden state residents and corporations with higher taxes. As a result, people and businesses are fleeing a state beset with too many regulations, tax rates that are not competitive with neighboring states and an array of other insufferable liberal policies. Even a sizable portion of the film industry has moved from Hollywood to other states offering tax incentives and a better business climate.\nCalifornia officials have implemented high tax rates to fund an array of expensive services for an ever-growing population of illegal aliens. Their statewide elected politicians, such as Governor Jerry Brown, support open borders and sanctuary status for illegal aliens. In fact, the entire state has become a sanctuary for those who break our immigration laws.\nAmericans should never forget\u00a0Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal alien who had been deported five times to Mexico, who shot 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier and ran away from the scene as she died in the arms of her father. Several months before the July 1, 2015 incident, Lopez-Sanchez was in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after serving a federal prison sentence. However, San Francisco Police wanted him on a drug related warrant, so he was transferred to their control. Unfortunately, the San Francisco Police subsequently released him and did not bother to notify federal authorities. This is due to their refusal to honor \u201cimmigration detainers\u201d that San Francisco officials believe is a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nAs a result of their desire to protect the rights of non-citizens, San Francisco officials allowed an illegal alien back onto the streets. Sadly, that decision ultimately cost one young woman her life. The tragic death produced a national outcry, but it did not lead to any changes in California policies. The Steinle killing was not an isolated incident as throughout California, local and state officials refuse to work with federal authorities to combat the out-of-control problem of illegal immigration. These misguided policies prevent the Trump administration from taking effective action.\nOver the last week, California was in the news again for the wrong reasons. The liberal Democrat Mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, issued a warning to illegal aliens that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were conducting raids in the city. She asked residents to \u201cprotect\u201d these illegal aliens, who she called the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d residents of Oakland.\nAs a result, 800 illegal aliens evaded capture and the ICE agents were only able to apprehend 232 lawbreakers. These individuals were not Boy Scouts, in fact, 180 of them had criminal records and 115 of them had convictions for serious offenses such as child sex crimes, weapons charges or assault.\nICE was doing the community a favor by removing criminal threats and protecting innocent citizens. Regrettably, the Oakland Mayor decided to give support to illegal aliens and violent criminals instead of law abiding taxpayers.\nAt a press availabilityon Thursday, President Trump denounced her actions and called it \u201ca disgrace\u201d that she undercut the ability of ICE agents to conduct raids.The acting Director of ICE, Tom Homan, labeled her comments \u201ca whole new low, to intentionally warn criminals that law enforcement is coming.\u201d\nFortunately, the Trump administration acted in federal court against the rogue state of California. On Tuesday night, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit which claimed that three state laws are illegal and are pre-empted by federal law. The laws prevent employers and state officials from cooperating with federal officials on cases involving illegal immigrants.\nIn his speech announcing the lawsuit, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the California laws \u201cunjust, unfair and unconstitutional.\u201d He also condemned the actions of the Mayor of Oakland by asking \u201cHow dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical open borders agenda?\u201d\nThese are good first steps by the Department of Justice, but they are not enough.

Other Democrats running include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state Treasurer John Chiang, and former Hillary Clinton staffer Amanda Renteria.\nThe primary for that contest will be held on June 5.\u00a0\nYet, Newsom might be playing on both sides of this issue. When he was mayor of San Francisco, he reported illegal aliens who were arrested crimes to ICE. All were minors and the Board of Supervisors voted in 2009 stating these undocumented youths could only be reffered to ICE if they had been convicted of a crime. Newsom disregarded the board and continued to report illegal aliens who were minors to ICE (via Mercury News):\nDuring his run for governor, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he\u2019s proud to represent a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d sparred publicly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions over immigration, and vowed he\u2019d go to jail to protect undocumented immigrants.\nBut a fight over sanctuary policy a decade ago when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco suggests that he wasn\u2019t always as strident a defender of immigrant rights.\nIn July 2008, Newsom imposed a city policy that reported undocumented youth arrested for felonies to federal immigration authorities. That decision \u2014 made the week after a father and his two sons were killed by an undocumented immigrant \u2014 meant that some kids were put at risk of deportation even if charges against them were later dropped.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to overturn Newsom\u2019s policy in 2009, mandating that minors could only be referred to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement if they were convicted of a felony. But Newsom\u2019s administration simply ignored the board, continuing to turn juvenile arrestees over to ICE for the rest of his term.\nMeanwhile, according to emails obtained by the Bay Area News Group, Newsom\u2019s administration also conducted a review of people in the city\u2019s probation system and referred more than 350 suspected undocumented immigrants to ICE.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "Whether there was collusion between FBI agent Peter Strzok, bureau lawyer Lisa Page, and a FISA judge remains to be seen, but the optics certainly are not good.

Strzok expressed concern that a one-on-one meeting between the two men might require Contreras\u2019 recusal from matters in which Strzok was involved.\n\u201c[REDACTED] suggested a social setting with others would probably be better than a one on one meeting,\u201d Strzok told Page. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just going to have to invite you to that cocktail party.\u201d\n\u201cHave to come up with some other work people cover for action,\u201d Strzok added.\n\u201cWhy more?\u201d Page responded. \u201cSix is a perfectly fine dinner party.\u201d\nIt is not known whether the proposed party happened as planned.\nIt\u2019s all part of a long saga of impropriety and unethical behavior concerning top officials at the FBI. Strzok was a top counterintelligence agent at the bureau, being involved in two highly sensitive investigations in 2016. One involving whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information sent through her unauthorized and unsecure email server, the other signing off on the counterintelligence probe into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians; the latter of which is now being headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\u00a0\nStrzok was also having an extramarital affair with Lisa Page, with the two exchanging tens of thousands of texts, all of them anti-Trump and pro-Clinton\u2014highly unseemly for a man in a key position in the nation\u2019s preeminent domestic law enforcement and intelligence agency. It was bad enough for Mueller to remove Strzok from the Russia investigation in August of 2017 when he became aware of the texts. In August of 2016, Strzok and Page texted about their meeting with ex-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was forced out after an inspector general report cited him for an improver media disclosure concerning disagreement between the DOJ and the FBI over their investigation into the Clinton Foundation. McCabe also reportedly misled investigators about his actions.\u00a0\nIn that exchange with \u201cAndy,\u201d Strzok makes a reference to an insurance policy, which many have speculated is the Trump dossier, a piece of partisan opposition research subsidized by the Clinton campaign. The Hillary Team contacted Fusion GPS, who then hired former British spook Christopher Steele to find dirt on Donald Trump. This file was used to secure a FISA warrant against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. There have also been allegations that FISA powers were abused, citing the Carter warrant, which is another issue entirely. Yet, the notion that opposition research from a political campaign can be used to secure a spy warrant on members of an opposing presidential campaign is deeply troubling. Of course, Democrats say this is overblown.\nOn top of this, there were other texts that show Page and Strzok were concerned that the bureau was going too hard on Hillary during the email probe Strzok was also made aware that analyst had found a possible breach in the server. There was no follow up.\u00a0\nAnd there were other communications reportedly showing the two discussing how to \u00a0skirt federal records protocols.

Her meaning was not lost on the Washington Post: \"It's difficult not to read Clinton's comments as an argument that her votes were more valuable \u2014 or at least more productive \u2014 than were Trump's. Why bring up gross domestic product? Some have suggested Clinton was saying wealthy people's votes should have counted for more. Whether you see it that way or not, she does seem to suggest Trump subsisted on voters who were simply...less sophisticated or advanced.\" \u00a0And also racist, sexist xenophobes. \u00a0This is a grotesque smear of 63 million Americans. \u00a0Yes, some Trump supporters were motivated by ugly prejudice (just as some number of Clinton backers certainly cast their ballots for 'problematic' reasons). \u00a0But the vast, vast majority of US voters, across the ideological spectrum, simply selected the person whom they thought would be better for the country, in good faith. \u00a0I've said and written many times that I believe Donald Trump is unfit for the office he holds, but Mrs. Clinton's nasty, embittered slanders further confirm that she was always unworthy of the job she coveted for her entire adult life. \u00a0Her broad-brush, ham-fisted impugning of motives is revealing: She's precisely the sneering, entitled, elitist, out-of-touch, dishonest hack that many people have long believed her to be.\nBut she wasn't finished. \u00a0Up next came some obnoxious shaming of women who opposed her candidacy. \u00a0Tens of millions of female voters decided to reject her, and Hillary thinks they did so because the boys instructed them to. \u00a0Just as she struggles to fathom why someone might have voted for Trump for reasons other than bigotry, she can't comprehend why an independent, enlightened woman may have come to her own conclusion not to vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton:\nHRC says white women voted for Trump because their husbands, bosses, sons told them to. @ the India Today Conclave this weekend.\n\u2014 Martha MacCallum (@marthamaccallum) March 12, 2018'Democrats going back to my husband and even before but just in recent times going back to bill and our candidates and then President Obama, have been losing the white vote including white women.

It\u2019s going to be terrible you can\u2019t vote for that.\u201d It stopped my momentum and it decreased my vote enough. Because I was ahead and I was winning and I thought I had fought my way back,' she concluded.\nSetting aside the well-founded belief that she's fortunate not to have been indicted for criminally negligent conduct connected to her national security-compromising email scandal, the Comey letter was not \"ill-advised.\" New, unexplored information had come to light and Congress was notified of that development. More importantly, every single setback Clinton experienced because of her emails is 100 percent her fault and responsibility. The Democratic Party chose to nominate someone who was under active FBI investigation and who incessantly lied about her actions. Choices have consequences. There's evidence that the Comey letter impacted the election. But the conclusion she draws -- that women were on the brink of \"standing up to the men in their lives\" until the FBI Director swindled them -- is fantastical, arrogant fiction.

Scores of students from across the country walked out to demand their elected representatives do more to secure schools, specifically by pushing new gun control legislation. This spike in activism is due to the recent and tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Seventeen people were shot and killed by Nikolas Cruz. The Sunshine State has already passed a law allowing school districts to permit school employees carry concealed firearms, establish a tip line to report possible threats, more programs for mental health, and raised the age limit to buy long guns to 21. The latter part of the law is grossly unconstitutional and the National Rifle Association has rightfully filed a lawsuit against it. Regardless, legislation has been passed as a direct result of student activism, though a lot of it is funded and coordinated by the professional Left. In D.C., a school safety bill overwhelmingly passed.\u00a0\nThese walkout were supposed to be a peaceful event, meant to put more pressure of the political class to do more on gun control. In Tennessee, however, a protest by students was marred by them tearing down the American flag, jumping on a police vehicle, and briefly created an atmosphere of chaos,\u00a0according to the Lexington Herald Leader. The publication added that blessedly no one was injured, and that security quickly brought order to the situation:\n\n\nAround the country, thousands upon thousands of students walked out of their classrooms on March 14 to peacefully protest inaction on gun laws in the aftermath of the deadly Florida school shooting last month.\nAnd then there was Antioch High School near Nashville, Tenn.\nSome of the students who walked out of class at the school Wednesday pulled down an American flag hanging from a flagpole, video shows.\nSome students jumped on a police car, Nashville police told News Channel 5.\n[\u2026]\nA spokesperson for Metro Nashville Public Schools told Fox 17 in a statement that no students were injured at Antioch High School, and that security swiftly controlled the situation.\n\n\nWe have to be fair here. The vast majority of the student walkouts yesterday were peaceful. Still, it seems that Parkland\u2019s tragedy could have been avoided not because of lax gun laws, but because the local, state, and federal officials totally dropped the ball on acting on the red flags presented to them by Cruz. The state kicked the can down the road on what to do with him, not even acting on reports that he was cutting himself in 2016. That alone could have warranted commitment at a state facility for a mental evaluation via the Baker Act. That would have shown up on a background check, preventing him from buying firearms, specifically the AR-15 he used in the shooting. He bought that rifle days after he was expelled from Stoneman Douglas in February of 2017. The FBI received a tip about Cruz on January 5. They did nothing, not even forwarding this information to their Miami office. Local law enforcement also had to have known this kid was trouble, being called to his home over 30 times.

She made these remarks in an interview with National Public Radio (via NPR):\nOur biggest problem for women trying to lead in politics is there's not a model that people are used to seeing that they can compare that woman to and be comfortable with her in that role. Our only model that we have for anyone who runs America, who is the head of the United States, is a man. So, I had a moment where I realized in October during the campaign, I thought \"Wow, what we have done is made Hillary a female facsimile of the qualities that we look for in a male president.\" And ... it was a gut punch ... realizing there was a fundamental design \u2014 in October! \u2014 and you can't go back and fix it ... And I think that people's distrust of her isn't that everybody is sexist or misogynist; she vexes people and they don't know what to make of her... because I think they don't know what a woman in charge looks like.\nWe were trying to present her with these qualities that you're used to seeing in a male president: That she's strong enough, that she can handle national security, that she's tough enough that Donald Trump can come after her and try to humiliate her and she's never going to let it show. And I think she had to do that. I do think that the first woman nominee had to prove that she could do the job the way a man would, but that robbed her of a lot of her own authenticity.\n[\u2026]\nThe one time I thought that we were going to lose was actually in early September of 2016. We had had a bad August ... and then Hillary came down with pneumonia herself. Trump had just kind of hit his stride. Bannon had been named CEO, he [Trump] was being more disciplined. This was before the debates started. And I thought, \"Why do we think that we're going to be the ones that can stop this guy?\" He just rolled over 16, 17 candidates on the Republican side. It seemed to me, we're going to look back in 2016 and say the only possible outcome with Trump wins.\nOn the latter part, very true, but this whole notion of not knowing what a women in charge looks like is a bit tiring. Yes, there is a point that more women need to be in leadership positions, but we\u2019ve seen from across the board female leaders past and present that embodied those qualities.

There\u2019s also Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook, Nikki Haley at the United Nations, Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom, and Boudica in the revolt against the Romans. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that the electorate doesn\u2019t know what a women in charge looks like, it was more of they didn\u2019t want that woman in charge because she was seen as inauthentic, dishonest, and ultimately unlikable.\u00a0\n\u00a0The authenticity problem was established well before the general election. The email scandal entrapped her as dishonest way before the Democratic primaries had concluded. She was for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge free trade agreement, while working for Obama, and then decided to run away from it.

The more she remained the limelight, like when you run for president, it dropped like a rock. She remains below 40 percent in the approval ratings.

A massive slate of weapons are slated to be banned since the legislation calls for the prohibition of semi-automatic rifles and handguns that have detachable magazines, and can carry more than 10 rounds (via Washington Examiner) [emphasis mine:\nHouse Democrats have introduced a bill banning semi-automatic firearms in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.\nRep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., announced Monday he is introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. More than 150 Democrats have signed on in support of the legislation, Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., said.\n[\u2026]\nThe bill prohibits the \u201csale, transfer, production, and importation\u201d of semi-automatic rifles and pistols that can hold a detachable magazine, as well as semi-automatic rifles with a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds.

They do not belong in our communities.\u201d\nDeutch vowed during a CNN town hall last week to introduce a bill banning semi-automatic weapons.\nAssault Weapons Ban of 2018 by blc88 on Scribd\nIn all, 156 of 193 House Democrats have backed this legislation. Yet, this is destined to fail. There\u2019s not a single Republican who will support this in the House, or at least not nearly enough to ensure passage. Moreover, the votes are not there in the Senate. Red state Democrats would be put in a bind. There is nothing as vivid to their constituents as their guns being taken away. That\u2019s a tangible thing. Something that\u2019s in their home being confiscated due to hyper regulatory leftist hysteria over our Second Amendment rights. They would be voting for that\u2014I would bet heavily that more than a couple would vote with Republicans if\u00a0this ever got to their doorstep, but it won\u2019t. \u00a0Also, if we\u2019re going by his word, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), who is a key player in the gun control pushes on the Hill, said he\u2019s not pushing for a total ban on semiautomatics. In some ways, I think even he, a die-hard gun control advocate, knows a semiautomatic ban is a bridge too far.\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s the same old game. Democrats say let\u2019s have a discussion, only to spring a trap on the rest of us\u2014yelling, condemning, and denigrating those with whom they disagree on gun policy. They use children to shield them from criticism. \u00a0I don\u2019t play that game. If you go on national television, spew nonsense, and push for the evisceration of American civil rights\u2014I\u2019m going to attack you. And by nonsense, I don\u2019t mean simple disagreements; I mean things that are demonstrably false. I\u2019m a proud NRA member.

The NRA does not sell guns; that\u2019s another garbage lie.

It\u2019s an attribution that resulted from a fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft...Guccifer 2.0 sprang into existence on June 15, 2016, hours after a report by a computer security firm forensically tied Russia to an intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. In a series of blog posts and tweets over the following seven months\u2014conspicuously ending right as Trump took office and not resuming\u2014the Guccifer persona published a smattering of the DNC documents while gamely projecting an image as an independent Romanian hacktivist who\u2019d breached the DNC on a lark....Guccifer famously pretended to be a \u201clone hacker\u201d who perpetrated the digital DNC break-in. From the outset, few believed it. Motherboard conducted a devastating interview with Guccifer that exploded the account\u2019s claims of being a native Romanian speaker. Based on forensic clues in some of Guccifer\u2019s leaks, and other evidence, a consensus quickly formed among security experts that Guccifer was completely notional.\nEhmke led an investigation at ThreatConnect that tried to track down Guccifer from the metadata in his emails. But the trail always ended at the same data center in France. Ehmke eventually uncovered that Guccifer was connecting through an anonymizing service called Elite VPN, a virtual private networking service that had an exit point in France but was headquartered in Russia. But on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government\u2019s Guccifer investigation. Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency\u2019s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow.\nIt wasn't some random hacker. \u00a0It wasn't a fat slob in a basement somewhere. \u00a0It wasn't a murdered DNC staffer. \u00a0It was the Russians' foreign military intelligence agency, which engaged in a series of actions to disrupt Americans' faith in our electoral process -- just as our intelligence community has assessed for more than a year. \u00a0Some people will never be convinced of this fact, including a cohort of Americans who would rather believe Putin's propaganda over their own country's unified intelligence assessment. \u00a0But for most people, this is just another powerful piece of hard evidence detailing Moscow's treacherous meddling. \u00a0The Daily Beast's\u00a0story tries to introduce a strong Trump angle, but Ed Morrissey isn't particularly impressed: \"Spencer Ackerman and Kevin Poulson argue that the news also \u201cmove[s] the investigation closer to Trump himself.\u201d Er, not really, although it clearly rebuts Trump\u2019s earlier claims that the DNC hack might not have been conducted by Russia. We already knew that Roger Stone had been in contact with Guccifer 2.0 because Stone publicly declared it a years ago. That contact came after the hack, Stone insisted, and whether or not it\u2019s true, Stone\u2019s contact with Guccifer 2.0 has been well known for a long time. There\u2019s nothing in the rest of this story to suggest that the revelation provides any more connection to Trump and his campaign than the data points already known.\" \u00a0In any case, this is good news:\nBipartisan bill to strengthen our elections infrastructure  prevent hacking from bad actors  Albert Eisenberg (@Albydelphia) March 22, 2018For the first time since the 2016 election, Congress is poised to move legislation to combat hackers and online trolls targeting American democracy. \u00a0Senior Republicans and Democrats will come together on Thursday to stump for a revised version of a stalled election security proposal that has gained new momentum in recent days. The measure has now gathered enough backing from high-level lawmakers that it could prove the first concrete action taken in response to repeated calls from cybersecurity experts, election integrity advocates and state officials for Congress to help cash-strapped states upgrade their aging voting technology in the wake of the Russian hacks and disinformation campaigns that roiled the 2016 presidential race. When the updated bill is reintroduced Thursday afternoon, it will include sponsorship from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, giving the legislation the leadership backing it previously lacked.\nThe number one objective of all of these Russia probes should be to get to the very bottom of the Kremlin's machinations and take active steps to thwarting future interference. \u00a0And Republicans should recognize that if Putin and his gang had decided that it was the GOP that they wanted to troll and harm (as they very well may in the future, as they partially did in 2016), the party would rightly be screaming bloody murder about foreign influence in the campaign. \u00a0The Democrats may not be entirely innocent victims here, as some of their fingerprints are on various pieces of this Russia puzzle, but every American should stand against a hostile power using subterfuge to impact our democracy.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Brent Bozell", "body": "NBC News star Chuck Todd recently made a lectern-pounding speech to attendees of a journalism awards dinner. He proclaimed: \"One thing we're not is the opposition. We've never tried to be a part of the political debate, but people want to drag us into it. We shouldn't take the bait. We're simply a voice of truth.\"\n\n\nSo, let's consider the case of Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI.\n\n\nThe FBI Office of Professional Responsibility recommended that McCabe be fired for lying, or, to be gentle, a \"lack of candor\" -- even under oath -- in the Justice Department inspector general's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email probe. The inspector general is a career department official. The head of the OPR was appointed in 2002 ... by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller.\nSo when Attorney General Jeff Sessions sacked McCabe, the \"voice of truth\" media were pleased, right? Well, actually, no. They were so upset by the president's victory-lap tweets that they fast-forwarded past the facts about McCabe's lies.\n\n\nThe ABC and NBC morning shows skipped the part about McCabe's \"lack of candor.\" They went straight to McCabe's self-defense about being a target of partisans (despite his wife having run for office as a Democrat), not to the honesty problem for career government officials. ABC's Cecilia Vega reported, \"McCabe says he was let go as '... part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation ...\"\n\n\nTodd, who claimed he didn't want to be dragged into the political debate, enthusiastically made a guess, saying, \"I think it signals this president is no longer cooperating with Mueller. It's time for war.\"\n\n\nThe timing of McCabe's sacking looked harsh, since we were routinely told that he had just a few days left to qualify for his FBI pension. So, Todd's NBC colleague Andrea Mitchell even went to Twitter to beg for McCabe to get a job with a Democrat on Capitol Hill, which is what nonpartisan reporters at NBC are supposed to do: \"One suggestion from a McCabe supporter: if a friendly member of Congress hired him for a week he could possibly qualify for pension benefits by extending his service the extra days.\" Former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer deliciously tweeted back: \"Pensions before Honesty. Great slogan.\"\n\n\nBut it turns out the \"pro-truth\" media missed the boat on that claim. McCabe was nearly eligible for pension benefits after 20 years of service, at the age of 50. Now he can't claim them until age 57. Good luck selling that as a terrible scenario to people who retire at the private sector-accepted age of 65, or whose meager pensions don't allow them to retire -- ever.\n\n\nNone of these not-the-opposition networks noted that McCabe was getting a sweeter treatment by the legal process than retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was forced to plead guilty to lying to the FBI, rather than lying within the FBI. Nobody at the networks protested about a \"war\" on government officials or tweeted out help-the-poor-public-servant messages for Flynn. He deserved every criticism liberals threw his way. CNN mocked Flynn by quoting a tweet about his 24 days as national security adviser: \"I once had a fungal infection that lasted longer than #flynn.\"\n\n\nThe networks' coverage of Andrew McCabe matches their coverage of everything else in the Trump era. It's not that they look like the Opposition Party. They are the opposition party. Who's telling the truth doesn't matter. Resisting and ruining President Trump is what matters.\n\n\nL.

But President Trump wisely fired him as secretary of state for having an outlook different from Trump\u2019s, and from the agenda Trump was elected on.\nWe have \u201cdifferent mindsets,\u201d Trump said about Tillerson, as a polite understatement. \u201cWe got along, actually, quite well, but we disagree on a lot of things.\u201d\nIndeed. Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. No one could hold that position without being a globalist and he did not convert quickly enough to make America great again.\nTillerson was never on the same page as President Trump in standing up against, not with, the many parts of the world that are hostile to our sovereign interests. A supporter of phony free trade, Tillerson seemed more like the appeasement-type of secretary of state that we would expect if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election.\nIt is not merely that Tillerson thought Obama\u2019s sweetheart deal with Iran was \u201cokay,\u201d as Trump complained in announcing his termination of Tillerson. It was also that Tillerson would say and do things out-of-sync with what the America-First stance needs to be.\nTillerson was mistakenly trying to use diplomacy with the North Korean communist dictator Kim Jong-un while Trump was pursuing tougher measures. When Trump finally got Tillerson to stop groveling, the situation improved.\nEven the media concedes that Tillerson\u2019s departure will not hinder Trump\u2019s highly effective handling of North Korea, which is all-Trump and contrary to Tillerson\u2019s approach. If anything, a successful outcome of the North Korean crisis is more likely with Tillerson gone.\nGiven how often Tillerson disagreed during his confirmation hearing with Trump\u2019s positions, it is surprising that Tillerson lasted as long as he did. In merely one day of testimony Tillerson disagreed with Trump about the harmful Trans-Pacific Partnership, Russian policies toward the Ukraine, so-called climate change, and the need for Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons.\nPresident Trump indicated that the upcoming renegotiation of trade deals was a reason for his timing in letting Tillerson go now. Trump recently stood up against China by blocking the foreign takeover of Qualcomm, thereby signaling that American technology secrets are not for sale to foreign countries hostile to us.\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has long been a much stronger Trump supporter than Tillerson ever was, will step in without the baggage of a globalist mindset. Pompeo brings a welcomed enthusiasm and focus that Tillerson unfortunately lacked.\n\u201cTremendous energy, tremendous intellect, we\u2019re always on the same wavelength,\u201d Trump said about Pompeo after picking him. \u201cThe relationship has been very good, and that\u2019s what I need as secretary of state.\u201d\nIn addition to his stellar record of being first in his class in West Point and then serving in the Army, Pompeo has a strongly conservative track record as a congressman from Kansas. His positions include being outspokenly pro-life and taking many stances that fit hand-in-glove with those of Trump and the conservative movement.\nPhyllis Schlafly praised the freshman congressman Pompeo in early 2011, for sponsoring a budget amendment that would have cut $8.5 million from the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Registry. She applauded how Pompeo observed that the registry would be \u201cthe very foundation of the EPA\u2019s effort to pursue its radical anti-jobs agenda.\u201d\nUnlike Tillerson, Pompeo has been a leader in cracking down on terrorists from Muslim countries. When confronted with an alleged hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp for terrorists, Pompeo took it upon himself to personally visit the camp and quipped afterwards that it looked to him \u201clike a lot of them have put on weight.\u201d\nFor months it has been perceived that Tillerson, who is younger than Trump but appears older, has been unhappy in his position. He failed to fill key vacancies in his department despite being on the job for more than a year, and at key moments seemed to be in his home state of Texas rather than in D.C.\nTrump was perceptive in his post-firing comments: \u201cI think Rex will be much happier now, but I really appreciate his service.\u201d With Mike Pompeo in charge at the State Department, Americans can be more confident that the interests of the United States will be foremost in any foreign policy decision-making.\nIt took a year, but we have finally arrived to the point of \u201clet Trump be Trump,\u201d reminiscent of the moment in 1984 when \u201clet Reagan be Reagan\u201d started to carry the day.

You\u2019re not standing up for them until you say \u2018I want less weapons,\u2019\u201d Israel said to Loesch.\n\nIn other words, unless you\u2019re in favor of restricting Second Amendment rights, you don\u2019t give a damn about children.\n\nIt turns out, Sheriff Israel was simply projecting. \n\nBefore appearing on CNN Wednesday evening, Israel knew the deputy on duty at the school that day sat by and listened as children were slaughtered. He was armed, wearing a bulletproof vest and stood outside the school instead of going inside for at least four minutes. The shooting lasted for six. Football coach Aaron Feis lost his life after using his body to shield students from bullets.\n\nInstead of presenting that damning information to the live audience and those watching it at home, he placed the body count on the NRA and gun owning Americans. His deputy had quite literally failed to stand up for the children he was sworn and paid to protect.\n\n\u201cWhen did you find out that Deputy Peterson had not gone into the building?\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Sunday morning on State of the Union. \u201cYou spent much of the Wednesday night town hall on CNN, with the entire Stoneman Douglas community, students, teachers and parents, attacking the NRA, saying that police need more powers, more money to prevent future tragedies, you didn\u2019t disclose any of this to the crowd then, the Stoneman Douglas High School community, did you know it then? Did you know it Wednesday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was spoken about earlier during that day. I\u2019m not on a timeline for any TV or any news show,\u201d Israel said, saying later in the interview his leadership was \"amazing\" and his department did a fine job.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just one deputy who failed to act, it was four, indicating some kind of protocol or stand down order not to go in was being followed. That protocol would have been handed down and approved by Sheriff Israel. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen Coral Springs police officers arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14 in the midst of the school shooting crisis, many officers were surprised to find not only that Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson, the armed school resource officer, had not entered the building, but that three other Broward County Sheriff's deputies were also outside the school and had not entered, Coral Springs sources tell CNN,\u201d CNN reported over the weekend. \u201cThe deputies had their pistols drawn and were behind their vehicles, the sources said, and not one of them had gone into the school.\u201d\n\nAfter Parkland, government officials are taking advantage of a crisis to push their anti-gun agenda. Worse, they\u2019re using the rights of citizens as a scapegoat for their massive and completely unacceptable failures.\n\nLike mass shootings in the past, there was a long list of warning signs and multiple reports to authorities about the threat. The FBI was notified twice of the assailant\u2019s behavior. They did nothing. The Broward County Sheriff\u2019s deputies visited his home and received calls 45 times (Sheriff Israel says it was only 23 times, which is a lie). He was expelled from school for violent behavior. He sent fellow students death threats, which they reported to teachers. He said in a YouTube video he was \u201cgoing to be a professional school shooter,\u201d and indicated as much through a series of Instagram posts. His foster family reported to local authorities he had held a gun up to the head of his brother and mother. Nothing. Was. Done.\nParkland was preventable, not through gun control but government competency or action. Government failed, repeatedly, to stop the massacre from occurring. It wasn\u2019t the NRA that carried out the massacre, it was a young man who practically screamed to multiple government authorities about what he was going to do. \n\nThe civil liberties and rights of American citizens -- specifically gun owners -- are not a scapegoat for government failure.

Next, he comes to an important point about self-defense: A prime anti-gun claim is that documented incidents of firearms being used to fend off crime are swamped by actual gun crime. \u00a0Essentially, we are told that the self-defense effect is overblown and overrated by Second Amendment supporters who rely on an emotionally-appealing argument that doesn't comport with statistics. \u00a0But as Freitas highlights, many of the studies on which that case rests only count examples in which would-be perpetrators are actually shot by innocent armed civilians. \u00a0The problem with that framing is that the large majority of self-defense comes through deterrence and the credible threat of a gun (untold numbers of which are never reported) -- not by bullets flying. \u00a0By narrowly tabulating the number of legally-justifiable shootings that are committed for self protection, it's easy for advocates to claim that \"good\" gunshots are vastly outnumbered by criminal ones.\u00a0\nA broader review is necessary for a more accurate picture. \u00a0One government study (the National Crime Victimization Survey) found that guns are used or brandished in self-defense approximately 100,000 times per year. \u00a0By comparison, in 2017, roughly 15,500 people were killed with guns in America, excluding suicides. \u00a0That ratio looks healthier. \u00a0A 2013 CDC study commissioned by the Obama administration confirmed that defensive gun uses outnumber gun crimes:\n\"Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals,\" says the report, which was completed in June and ignored in the mainstream press. The study, which was farmed out by the CDC to the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, also revealed that while there were \"about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008,\" the estimated number of defensive uses of guns ranges \"from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year.\"\nFreitas goes on to question some Democrats' ardent opposition to the idea of arming some -- not all -- teachers, especially those with law enforcement or military backgrounds. He quotes one colleague dismissing the proposal \"ridiculous,\" asking, \"why? Is it because the other side of this debate will only accept one 'solution' to this problem, and that is tearing apart or gutting the Second Amendment?\" After mentioning Democratic bills on background checks and bump stocks, Freitas speaks to a deeply-held suspicion (boosted by evidence like this and this) that many gun rights supporters harbor about the ultimate intentions of incrementalist gun control advocates: \"If you're wanting the other reason why we can't have an honest debate over this one, it's because quite frankly, I don't think any of us on this side of the aisle believe you when you say [small changes are] all you want to do.\" When politicians like Barack Obama positively cite Australia's confiscatory regime (the effectiveness of which is hotly disputed), that level of suspicion escalates.\nThe conservative lawmaker continues his remarks by expressing profound resentment over being compared to Nazis and segregationists (he goes after the Democratic Party's own history regarding the latter charge, hastening to add that he doesn't believe any of his present-day opponents share Democrats' previous stances on civil rights) during the course of heated gun debates. \u00a0He also seethes over being stuck at the wrong end of a \"false dilemma\" that posits he can only care about either guns or innocent lives. \u00a0\"If we want to have an open and honest debate, I am all for that. \u00a0Let's do that,\" he says. \u00a0\"But it does start with a certain degree of mutual respect. \u00a0It starts with a certain degree of not assuming that the only reason that we believe in the Second Amendment is that the NRA paid us off.\" \u00a0He argues that if the Left believes conservative politicians are 'bought off' by the NRA, they should look at their own donations from groups like Planned Parenthood. \u00a0\"When I get up here and talk about abortion, I don't assume you're all bought and paid for by Planned Parenthood. \u00a0I don't assume you're horrible people because I disagree with you on a policy position,\" he says, gesturing across the aisle. \u00a0\"I assume that you have deep convictions, and we can have an argument and debate about it.\"\n\nHe closes by warning that if Democrats are unwilling to \"reciprocate that respect,\" they shouldn't be surprised when constructive compromise becomes more difficult to achieve (especially when good-faith efforts are ignored). His final point: \"We are going to have a problem with so-called solutions which infringe on people's liberty under the promise the government will provide for their security,\" pointing out that in Parkland, the government failed over and over again to address the threat posed by the eventual shooter. \u00a0And Freitas advanced that point before he had a chance to see this video footage:\nFootage of the Parkland shooting shows Scot Peterson standing outside of the Florida high school as the gunman kills 17 people inside. https://t.co/BK9zyg46gp\n\u2014 The Federalist (@FDRLST) March 15, 2018\nAs I intimated at the onset, I don't agree with every single argument Delegate Freitas references or amplifies during those seven impactful minutes; some contentions were stronger and more persuasive than others. \u00a0But as a 'non-guns person' who nevertheless supports the Second Amendment and is consistently repulsed by the Left's ugly rhetoric and demonization during \"debates\" over gun policy, I completely understand why Freitas received an ovation when he put down the microphone and yielded the floor.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "Earlier today, a small group of Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. students staged a sit in outside of Sen.

Shooter Nikolas Cruz shot and killed 17 people on February 14. He was formally charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\u00a0\nWhile young Americans are certainly getting involved in the political process with this shooting, they\u2019re also going to find out the limits of idealism. What they want\u2014a ban on so-called assault weapons\u2014is not going to happen. The votes aren\u2019t there. What can pass Congress on gun control is the Fix NICS bill, which would strengthen our National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which any one purchasing a gun through a federally licensed firearm dealer has to go through in order to complete the transfer. The ironic twist is that Democrats might nix any chance this could pass since\u2026it could actually pass. It would give the Trump White House a win on a salient 2018 issue and give the GOP the opportunity to argue that they\u2019ve done all they could on new gun legislation. The Left wants a legislative assault on the Second Amendment. To make things more interesting, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), one of the most vocal advocates for gun control in Congress, backs the legislation.\u00a0\nSo, Congress could do something on guns, but they won\u2019t because Democrats want to use it for the 2018 election in the hopes of trying to get more of them elected. It\u2019s not about saving lives. On top of that, we have to look at the current system. It should have stopped Cruz from buying a firearm. In 2016, via the Baker Act, he should have been committed for self-mutilation. That would have been cited on a background check and could\u2019ve prevented him from buying an AR-15 rifle just days after he was expelled from the school in February of 2017. The FBI was warned on January 5 about him. Local law enforcement knew about Cruz\u2019s disturbing behavior, visiting his home over 20 times. This was a preventable shooting, but we had a total breakdown of the system at the federal, state, and local level. Maybe that\u2019s where we should look to reform. The system, by and large, should have protected these kids from this heinous event, but incompetent staffers at all levels of government failed them. The FBI didn\u2019t even forward the Cruz tip to their Miami office.\u00a0\nThere should be a call to action, I just don\u2019t think the issue here is AR-15 rifles or so-called high-capacity magazines, which contrary to the media and liberal pundits, have nothing to do with the rate of fire of a firearm.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Morefield", "body": "The recent gun control debate ignited by last month\u2019s tragedy in Parkland, Florida, has liberals trotting out what has become a favorite Leftist talking point - Australia\u2019s 1996 National Agreement on Firearms, an act which, among other things, severely restricted semi-automatic rifles after after a similarly horrific mass shooting.\nLiberals consider the cornerstone of the law, a massive forced gun buyback program, a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to what might otherwise be perceived by gun owners as an unwelcome curtailing of traditional American freedoms. Sure, the government may be forcing gun owners to make the transaction, but exchanging money for items IS capitalism, right? And it sure beats the alternative, a Communist-style door-to-door roundup of weapons that both sides agree would likely lead to civil war.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think most true Leftists would LOVE to harness the power of the State to crush liberty-minded gun owners by every means necessary, and if a few of the right eggs are broken in the process, so much the better. But realists on both sides know such a scenario is highly unlikely to happen, at least to a result the Left would want. In all likelihood, open displays of tyrannical force such as openly rounding up certain people groups or door-to-door weapons confiscations are highly likely to result in open displays of resistance, and a civil war that is likely to be fought, and won, by the good guys.\nOn this matter, right-wing pundits are correct:\nOn the topic of whether or not citizens could resist \u201cviolent tyranny,\u201d Townhall\u2019s Kurt Schlichter writes, \u201cThe short answer is, \u2018Yes.\u2019 As Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan all teach, a decentralized insurgency with small arms can effectively confront a modern police/military force ... But the bottom line is that two untrained idiots with handguns shut down Boston. What do you think 100 million Americans \u2013 many trained and some battle-tested \u2013 could do with their rifles?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no other way around it: The mandatory confiscation of the American citizenry\u2019s guns would involve tens of thousands of heavily armed federal agents going door-to-door to demand of millions of Americans that they surrender their guns. That. Is. Not. Going. To. Happen,\u201d opines National Review\u2019s Mark Wright.\n\u201cMake no mistake, armed rebellion would be the consequence,\u201d writes Varad Mehta for The Federalist in a piece that\u2019s par for the course when it comes to most thinking on the right. \u201cArmed men would be dispatched to confiscate guns, they would be met by armed men, and blood would be shed. Australia is a valid example for America only if you are willing for that blood to be spilled in torrents and rivers. To choose Australia is to choose civil war.\u201d\nEven the more sane gun control proponents are wise to the political situation. University of Sydney professor Philip Alpers, who is also the founding director of GunPolicy.org, told the New York Times, \u201cWhat Australia did was a confiscation of private property under the threat of jail time, compensated or not. That wouldn\u2019t wash in the United States.\u201d\nFurther, when unduly oppressive laws are actually passed in the United States, such as recent laws in New York and Connecticut passed after the Sandy Hook massacre, they are often ignored by the majority of gun owners and sparsely enforced by the states themselves. \u201cNew York and Connecticut authorities so far have shown no inclination to enforce their laws by going door to door to round up unregistered guns and arrest their owners,\u201d Mehta wrote in the 2015 piece. \u201cBut that\u2019s what would be necessary to enforce the law. A federal law, therefore, would require sweeping, national police action involving thousands of lawmen and affecting tens of millions of people. If proponents of gun control are serious about getting guns out of Americans\u2019 hands, someone will have to take those guns out of Americans\u2019 hands.\u201d\nSure, it\u2019s hard to argue with Mehta\u2019s logic, at least on the surface. And it\u2019s a good thing for gun owners, right?\nNot necessarily, not if you look just beneath that surface.\u00a0\nConsider: If rational minds on the Left know all this, to what end are they still pushing for such laws, especially when it\u2019s obvious that they don\u2019t care whether ANY gun control laws are actually enforced. Not yet anyway. (Remember, it\u2019s always conservatives, not liberals, pushing for enforcement of existing law.)\nAnd yet, they do want more and more laws on the books, and the more draconian, obscure, and hard to keep track of, the better. But why?\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the answer, and it should scare every gun owner in the country:\nThey want to make de facto criminals out of the majority of the gun owning population.\u00a0\nThat way, they can essentially pick us off, one by one.\u00a0\nWithout necessarily meaning to, Mehta hits on this critical point in his piece: \u201cA national gun buyback law would turn a significant portion of the American people into criminals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cResidents of New York and Connecticut snubbed their new laws \u2026 Compliance with the registration requirement has been modest at best, as hundreds of thousands of gun owners in both states refused to register their weapons. So far, then, the laws have been most successful in creating hundreds of thousands of lawbreakers who feel obligated to break the law.\u201d\nIf liberals are able to pass any sort of \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban, buyback or no buyback, they know they will make criminals out of several million currently law-abiding gun owners. And even if the majority of those gun owners don\u2019t follow the law now, that won\u2019t make them any less a criminal. They just haven\u2019t been caught yet.\nBut when the \u2018right people\u2019 control the levers of power and the \u2018right laws\u2019 are all in place, make no mistake - they will be caught.\nHere\u2019s the rub. It\u2019s one thing to hold up your rifle and shout \u201ccome and take it,\u201d \u00e0 la Charleton Heston, before thousands of like-minded people. The Feds aren\u2019t going to come to a National Rifle Association convention and start arresting people, at least not yet. And they aren\u2019t going to conduct door-to-door house searches, arresting gun owners and confiscating their firearms, either. Not yet.\nBut believe me, under the right circumstances and with the right laws in place, the arrests will come. They\u2019ll come when you\u2019re going to work, or to the bank, or to the park with your kids, or a thousand other places. They\u2019ll come after you\u2019ve used your now-illegal AR-15 to defend yourself against a home invader, or if they spot it during a \u201croutine\u201d home search.\nNever, ever underestimate these people and the depth of their evil. Remember, the Cheka managed to fill the Soviet gulags to the brim, and yet they did it quietly, with little fuss and even less armed revolt.\nAnd they won\u2019t need to arrest everyone to make the majority obey. No, they only need a few, and word will spread quickly.\u00a0\nSo what will you do, dear AR-15 owner, when the \u2018Cheka\u2019 comes for your neighbor, and you know the laws are on the books to prosecute? Will a \u201cbuyback\u201d and \u201camnesty\u201d be enough to convince YOU to acquiesce? You\u2019ve got a job, a wife, kids to raise. When they \u201ccome and take it,\u201d is your family worth risking?\u00a0\nNo, when they take your guns there will be no civil war. There will be no large-scale revolution, because liberals are experts at pushing that Overton Window enough not to shock the system. Like frogs in water that\u2019s about to boil, people won\u2019t jump until it\u2019s too late.\nThat is why it\u2019s so important to not get complacent and believe a worse case scenario will never happen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to fight the gun controllers\u2019 efforts to change the law at EVERY turn, using EVERY legal means possible.\nLong before they \u201ccome and take\u201d our guns, and our freedoms.", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Cortney O'brien", "body": "On Thursday, the House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017.

For years, we\u2019ve been subjected to Democrats voicing their support for hunters, while saying they want to get AR-15s and other so-called assault weapons, off the street. Hunting rifles are actually more powerful than the AR-15, but that\u2019s a different debate. Then, there\u2019s the anti-gun Left not knowing what they hell they\u2019re talking about, saying they don\u2019t want to take away people\u2019s guns, but draft legislation that bans semiautomatic firearms. Um, that\u2019s a gun ban. Most, if not all, of the firearms owned by civilians, with the exception of revolvers and hunting rifles, are semiautomatic. It\u2019s not scary. It merely means self-reloading after firing a round. It\u2019s one round per trigger pull. It\u2019s not the same as automatic or machine guns, the latter of which use belt-fed ammunition.\nRegardless, the whole crux of their argument is that banning so-called assault weapons, expanded background checks, waiting period etc. will save lives. It won\u2019t do that, and the anti-gun Left knows it. So, thanks to Vox for actually showing the end game of the Democratic agenda on firearms, which is that they really just want to ban guns. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have cited the Australian model on gun control. Clinton even went so far as to say the Supreme Court got the Second Amendment wrong in 2016. The level of violence in Europe, which is often cited by liberals to make the false argument that America is a shooting gallery, would require gun confiscation. Also, the Second Amendment\u2019s language in the Constitution might not prevent such an extreme piece of legislation from passing; it\u2019s the fact that there are not enough votes\u2014and there probably never will be. Hey, at least there are gold stars for honesty:\n\u2026let's be clear about precisely what kind of decision is letting events like this recur. Congress's decision not to pass background checks is not what's keeping the US from European gun violence levels. The expiration of the assault weapons ban is not behind the gap. What's behind the gap, plenty of research indicates, is that Americans have more guns. The statistics are mind-blowing: America has 4.4 percent of the world's population but almost half of its civilian-owned guns.\nRealistically, a gun control plan that has any hope of getting us down to European levels of violence is going to mean taking a huge number of guns away from a huge number of gun owners.\n[\u2026]\nThe legal scholars I talked to suggested that an Australia-style program would probably pass muster. If we went further than Australia and also banned handguns, that might cause problems; the Supreme Court struck down Washington, DC's handgun ban in 2008. But Australia's actual system is probably constitutional.\n\"Courts have consistently upheld bans on military-style semiautomatic rifles because other firearms are equally useful for self-defense,\" Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, says. \"Gun control isn't stalled because of the Second Amendment. It's stalled because elected officials won't pass effective new laws to reduce gun violence.\"\nSanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas Austin and author of the landmark article \"The Embarrassing Second Amendment,\" concurs: \"If such an extraordinary law actually got through Congress (meaning with necessary Republican support), then I find it impossible to imagine that there would be five votes on the Court to say no,\" he says. \"But the real problem, of course, is that there\u2019s not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of Congress actually passing any meaningful legislation re guns, let alone this kind of quite radical legislation.\"\nWell, I\u2019ll let you debate the Australia model being constitutional. The idea that people would a) turn over their AR-15s is laughable; and b) police going door-to-door to arrest and confiscate firearms to those who refuse would be political poison not to mention a tsunami of lawsuits that would clog the legal system. Also, not a single Republican would support this so Levinson is right about the political reality. Still, Vox showcased the anti-gun Left\u2019s ultimate goal, which is why the upcoming 2018 elections are key. In fact, every election in every state is key to protecting our Second Amendment rights.\u00a0\nWe left Europe for independence and to be free from tyranny, but thanks for your honesty.\n\u2014 Razor (@hale_razor) March 14, 2018", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Vespa", "body": "Well, it\u2019s finally here: a piece of gun control legislation that could actually pass.

The horrific shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas that left over 20 people dead, prompted the legislation.

It doesn\u2019t have the votes in the Senate and it would certainly meet a quick death in the House.

I [take] a more pragmatic approach to this, which is with Susan. I do think there\u2019s zero chance that this group of Republicans that now control the House will initiate an impeachment hearing,\u201d Press said. Press then discussed the Supreme Court decision regarding Congressional Districts in Pennsylvania, which Press called, \u201cextremely important,\u201d to the makeup of Congress...Press then said that states should put redistricting in the hands of retired judges, who he claims would draw nonpartisan lines. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely important, and that\u2019s sort of, I think, a first step and necessary step to getting too down the road impeachment. And Susan, it will be day one of the new Congress, I think, if Democrats take control,\u201d Press said.\nClick through for video of the MSNBC exchange. \u00a0Meanwhile, amid the latest round of buzz and conjecture about whether the president is considering firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, nationally-syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt asked two Senators whether such an action -- which we addressed here -- would constitute an impeachable offense. \u00a0South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, an emerging Trump ally, answered 'probably:'\nHewitt: Okay, now let me ask you, back in the day, a long time, ago, 1998, you were one of the 13 impeachment managers named by the House to press the case against Bill Clinton. So this is going way back. So I have a very simple question. If the President fired Robert Mueller, do you think that would be an impeachable offense?\n\nGraham: Probably so, if he did it without cause, yeah...I think what the President will have done is stopped an investigation in whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign. I can\u2019t see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\n\nHH: You see, I am in agreement with you that an impeachable offense is anything that the Congress says it is, regardless of what scholars might say. And I believe the Congress would say that if it were run by Democrats. Do you think a Republican-led House would impeach the President?\n\nLG: Well, that\u2019s a good point. Let\u2019s say that Obama fired somebody. I think we\u2019d all have a different view on the Republican side. A high crime and misdemeanor in the Constitution is a fairly vague term. But what is at the essence of impeachment is a check and balance on a President, right?\n\nHH: Yes.\n\nLG: \u2026who\u2019s gotten out of their lane, who changed the rule of law and basically turns it upside down. I can\u2019t think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president\u2019s campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government, what kind of crimes may have been committed. I\u2019ve seen no evidence of collusion, but to stop investigation without cause, I think, would be a Constitutional crisis.\n\nHH: Have you told him that specifically, Senator Graham, so that he hears it from Republicans, do not fire Bob Mueller?\n\nLG: I think I just, I think I just did.\nIntriguingly, when Hewitt put the same question to Maine Independent Angus King, a liberal who caucuses with the Democrats, his answer was similar in some respects -- but strikingly different on the core issue:\nHewitt: Let me talk to you now about the Special Counsel investigation. And I\u2019m going to ask this of Lindsey Graham next hour.\u00a0If Mr. Mueller was fired, would you consider that to be an impeachable offense?\n\nKing: No. I would consider it a crisis.\u00a0I would want to think about it in terms of all the other material that we\u2019ve seen. High crimes and misdemeanors is the standard for impeachment, and I have a high standard for impeachment. I don\u2019t think impeachment should be used to change a government you don\u2019t like. I think going back to Andrew Johnson in, you know, 1867, this is something we\u2019ve got to be really careful with. We don\u2019t want to change our form of government. But the problem is that if the President does this, I think it is a huge mistake. It adds weight to the argument that there\u2019s been an ongoing obstruction of justice of trying to basically quash in investigation. I think it\u2019s, I wouldn\u2019t say it rises to the level of an impeachable offense, but I certainly think it\u2019s going to create a real problem.\u00a0And I think, I went down the list yesterday. There are 8 or 9 senators, including people like Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley and John Cornyn who have said this would be a huge mistake. Newt Gingrich said it would be a disaster. Lindsey said he thought it would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. So I think everybody\u2019s concerned about this, and I think it would be a huge mistake from his point of view. If he\u2019s really, if he\u2019s innocent, which he keeps saying that he is, he ought to want this thing to go forward and be as thorough as possible so the American people can get the results, can be, have confidence and say yeah, look, this Mueller guy did a tough job and a thorough job, and there\u2019s no evidence. That\u2019s the result the President should want.

Last Friday, they did a massive raid in Los Angeles, where they nabbed over 200 illegal aliens, most with criminal convictions. Over 100 businesses also have to prove that they aren\u2019t hiring illegal aliens (via Washington Times):Federal deportation officers staged one of the biggest enforcement actions in years against businesses in Los Angeles this week, arresting 212 people and serving audit notices to 122 businesses who will have to prove they aren\u2019t hiring illegal immigrants.Nearly all of those arrested were convicted criminals, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.ICE said it targeted Los Angeles because it\u2019s a sanctuary city, meaning it refuses to fully cooperate with federal authorities on deportations from within its jails.Pew Research noted that\u00a074 percent of illegal aliens arrested by ICE in 2017 had criminal records, most relating to drunk driving:Immigrants with past criminal convictions accounted for 74% of all arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in fiscal 2017, according to data from the agency. The remainder were classified as \u201cnon-criminal\u201d arrestees, including 16% with pending criminal charges and 11% with no known criminal convictions or charges.[\u2026]Among ICE arrestees in 2017 with prior convictions, the most common criminal conviction category was driving under the influence of alcohol (59,985 convictions, or 16% of the total), followed by possessing or selling \u201cdangerous drugs\u201d such as opioids (57,438, or 15%). Immigration offenses, which include illegal entry or false claim to U.S. citizenship, were the third-most common crime type (52,128 convictions, or 14%). Those arrested can have more than one type of conviction or pending charge so the total number of charges and convictions is greater than the total number of arrestees; ICE counts an immigrant with a prior criminal conviction and pending criminal charges only in the criminal conviction category.For ICE arrestees with pending criminal charges in 2017, general traffic offenses topped the list of most common charges (24,438, or 17% of all charges), followed by driving under the influence of alcohol (20,562, or 14%) and possession or selling of \u201cdangerous drugs\u201d (19,065, or 13%). Pending immigration violations were the fifth-most common charge (10,389, or 7%).Assault ranked among the five most common pending criminal charges and conviction categories for ICE arrestees in 2017, accounting for 11% and 8% respectively.There\u2019s a new sheriff in town on this issue with President Trump, who was catapulted to the top of the GOP field for his tough stance on immigration. At the same time, it\u2019s a stance that has Congress in a bind, as both sides failed to reach a deal on immigration last week. Yet, Trump\u2019s offer was generous: 1.8 million illegals to receive a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a border wall and other immigration enforcement provisions. That\u2019s all 800,000 Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals recipients, plus a million more; Democrats and some Republicans rejected it. \u00a0DACA is an Obama-era program that shielded children who were brought where illegally from being deported. \u00a0It\u2019s constitutionally questionable, as it raises separation of powers concerns. The Trump White House was faced with a dilemma: either face a lawsuit by a dozen GOP state attorneys general over the illegal Obama executive action or have a gradual wind down of the program, with a six-month enforcement delay to afford Congress time to pass a legal DACA fix. The latter option was chosen. \u00a0The alternative would have been a nationwide injunction that would have put all 800,000 recipients, who have their addresses along with proof that they were in the U.S. illegally, in the crosshairs of deportation. For DACA applicants, admitting that you\u2019re here illegally is part of the process.\u00a0So, that\u2019s why the Hill is taking up immigration and why Democrats decided to shut down the government for illegal aliens in January.

Never mind that members have had no time to read the 1,000-page bill and figure out what is actually in it. They just have to take Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's word. He said, \"It has some things no one likes, and it has a lot of things not everybody likes but most people like. It was a fair compromise.\"\nSchumer's uncharacteristic cheerfulness about the measure probably had much to do with the $900 million in funding for the Gateway tunnel project, a boondoggle supported by all New York-area lawmakers. It most likely won't be in the final bill, though, because President Donald Trump threatened to veto the bill if the project were to be included. Immigration is another sticky point, but we can all expect it to be resolved at some point by nudging the right people for their support.\nYou can also expect Republicans and President Trump to spin this as a \"yuge\" victory for their team. After all, isn't it a sign that they can govern? Sure, if you tolerate massive deficit spending, being irresponsible and pushing all that liability down the throat of future generations. I don't, because I actually care about the well-being of my kids and grandkids.\nTo be fair, this is no surprise. These are the same guys who agreed back in February to add $300 billion of spending over two years to the already monstrous federal tab. Showing yet again that bipartisanship isn't good news for those of us who care about the fiscal path our country is on, the agreement blew the budget caps that were meant to control excess spending by opportunistic politicians.\nDemocrats are, of course, loving it. Let's face it; they know that when Republicans are in power, they can act like a drunken teenager with Daddy's credit card, but they sober up when they have the gavel. What's worse, Republicans are terrible negotiators. For example, Democrats have once again managed to get most of their non-defense priorities funded by the Republican-controlled Congress and White House in exchange for allowing more defense spending. The result is a $143 billion boost to this year's spending above budget caps. Who cares about budget rules and deficits when you can throw more cash at the Department of Defense?\nThis will, of course, lead to much larger deficits than originally projected. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, red ink for 2018 will reach $800 billion. That's a solid $230 billion higher than what was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in its June 2017 10-year forecast. That's a whole $2 trillion in additional debt after just one year of Republican control of the legislative and executive branches.\nLarger deficits also mean larger interest payments. A CRFB analysis found that \"interest payments will quadruple, topping $1 trillion per year in as little as a decade. That's more than we will spend each year on the military or Medicaid, and as a share of the economy, it is the highest in history. ... Over the next decade, we'll spend around $7 trillion -- $55,000 per household -- just servicing our debt.\"\nThe economy is growing. The scale of the Afghanistan War is relatively small -- and even some defense hawks recognize that there's enough waste and unnecessary spending already in the military budget that could be cut to pay for whatever modernization is necessary.

Yes, there\u2019s room for agreement on strengthening background checks on mental health, but Democrats don\u2019t want just that. They need something else to satisfy their confiscatory ethos inherent in this issue. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. That\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s becoming more fact-based as the Democratic Party has lurched to the far left in recent years.\u00a0\nThe tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left seventeen people dead, has thrust gun control back into the limelight. CNN held a town hall on February 21 in Sunrise, Florida, where Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch descended into the lion\u2019s den, facing a rabid anti-gun crowd in what was essentially an Orwellian two minutes of hate exercise against gun owners, conservatives, Republicans, and anyone else who didn\u2019t agree with left wing gun politics. It was a kangaroo court\u2014and we were all found guilty.\u00a0\nNow, YouGov has a poll showing that 82 percent of Democrats want to ban semiautomatic firearms, while they\u2019re evenly split on a total handgun ban. This is where the party stands on gun rights, our civil right to own firearms. They want to shred the Second Amendment and the gauge of Democratic Party members offers a dark vision of what could come if enough of these people are elected to Congress. Allahpundit broke down the numbers:\nYouGov asked people whether they favor or oppose banning semiautomatic weapons. Note: Not semiautomatic rifles, which some might incorrectly but understandably treat as a question about AR-15s or \u201cassault weapons.\u201d YouGov asked about semiautomatic weapons. That means handguns too. Result:\nOverall Americans are at 55/33, with even Republicans at a surprisingly narrow 37/53 in opposition. YouGov should have followed up by asking people to define \u201csemiautomatic\u201d and presenting them with four possible definitions. I\u2019d be curious to see what percentage answered correctly. Instead they followed up by asking how people feel about banning all handguns (except those issued to officers of the state, of course!), which would include revolvers. Result:\nAmericans are strongly opposed overall but Democrats are on the fence at 44/46. Which way will those numbers tilt in coming years, do you suppose, as the party drifts left and gives up on working-class white voters to chase an Obama-style coalition of young adults, minorities, and the highly educated?\nDemocrats are also evenly split at 39/41 on, uh, whether to repeal the Second Amendment.\nHere\u2019s a possible silver lining: maybe the 55 percent figure would go down if people understood the terms. The media is terrible at basic gun knowledge. They think we can buy machine guns in the same fashion as we purchase milk at a grocery store. They think magazines impact the rate of fire; they don\u2019t. They use terms like \u201cassault weapon\u201d and \u201cfull semi automatic,\u201d which are meaningless. So, maybe once the media actually uses firearm lexicon properly, this support for a semiautomatic firearm ban could go down especially with a surge in independents now saying they\u2019re strongly opposed to it. I note the shoddy gun knowledge aspect because if 82 percent of Democrats think all semiautomatics should be banned, then why do only 46 percent support a handgun ban? Could it be that they think semiautomatic weapons specifically concerns the AR-15? Handguns are semiautomatic as well. So, in all, almost the entire party wants to nix firearms in America, with an appallingly high proportion of them saying they want to repeal the Second Amendment outright.\nNew @CNN poll suggests that 57% of respondents support banning\"rifles capable of semi-automatic fire, such as the AR-15.\"\n\nWhat percentage of respondents can accurately define what a \"rifle capable of semi-automatic fire\" is?

I mean it\u2019s nice that we explicitly see where this party stands on Second Amendment rights. But when it comes to issues where bipartisan support can be found, like strengthening mental health provisions for better background checks, will Democrats support it, or drag their feet because they know if it passes\u2014and most likely a bill like this will\u2014then the legislative assault on gun rights will be over. We\u2019ll have something on that later today. In short, the answer is yes\u2014they will drag their feet, even block legislation by their own members. And people wonder why this place is a swamp.\u00a0\nI do think that because of the media disinformation, a lot of answers to these polls can be skewed. Yet, the 82 percent figure with Democrats is different. These people saw \u201csupport,\u201d \u201cban,\u201d and \u201cgun\u201d in the same sentence and said they wanted to ban guns. Okay\u2014the word \u201csemiautomatic\u201d was used, but everyone knows in itself that\u2019s a firearm. It\u2019s hard to skew such a definitive statistic. The Democratic Party wants to impose Australian-style gun bans and execute confiscatory policies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to trust them.

We have federal immigration laws for a reason. The days of Ellis Island and Vito Corleone\u2019s story are over. This is about ensuring people who come here arrive legally. It\u2019s to make sure terrorists don\u2019t have an open door into America. There is nothing racist about enforcing exiting immigration laws, but this is problematic for Democrats. Part of it is the party\u2019s aversion to white people. Another aspect is that Democrats see millions in untapped voter potential with all the illegals that are here. They want open borders. They don\u2019t want enforcement, and they certainly don\u2019t care about the illegals that have killed American citizens either through cold-blooded murder or driving under the influence. Yes, there are bad immigrants, and they certainly shouldn\u2019t be here. They should be deported. The wall should be built. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with the Border Patrol, should have their ranks increased to improve efficiency in enforcement. Yet, to many on the Left, ICE is the modern day Gestapo (isn\u2019t that the IRS?), who are akin to a terrorist organization. A slate of Democrats running in 2018 are running on abolishing the federal law enforcement agency on the basis that it\u2019s pretty much too mean (via The Nation):\nGroups like Indivisible Project and the Center for Popular Democracy have also called for defunding ICE. Brand New Congress, a progressive PAC, has the proposal in its immigration platform.\n\u201cICE is terrorizing American communities right now,\u201d said Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project. \u201cThey\u2019re going into schools, entering hospitals, conducting massive raids, and separating children from parents every day. We are funding those activities, and we need to use all the leverage we have to stop it.\u201d\nThough ICE abolition is spreading on the left, it quickly meets extreme skepticism elsewhere. In part, this is because the mainstream political discourse has a huge blind spot for the agency\u2019s increasingly brutal policies.\n[\u2026]\nOthers tend to dismiss ICE abolition as more of a troll than a serious policy demand. Josh Barro, a senior editor at Business Insider, argued that progressives have not paired the proposal with \u201ca plan to do the function without the hated agency.\u201d\nBut the goal of abolishing the agency is to abolish the function. ICE has become a genuine threat to democracy, and it is destroying thousands of lives. Moreover, abolishing it would only take us back to 2003, when the agency was first formed.\n[\u2026]\nThe central assumption of ICE in 2018 is that any undocumented immigrant is inherently a threat. In that way, ICE\u2019s tactics are philosophically aligned with racist thinkers like Richard Spencer and the writers at the white-supremacist journal VDare.\n[\u2026]\nThe call to abolish ICE is, above all, a demand for the Democratic Party to begin seriously resisting an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state that it had a hand in creating.\nThis is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it https://t.co/GOuoLnBHWG\n\u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) March 9, 2018Yeah, Democrats think this is a winning issue. How far gone do you have to be to think that a healthy majority would want to abolish immigration enforcement and allow illegals to willingly cross the border, some of who will commit crimes and go unpunished? And people wonder why Trump was elected in 2016. Yeah, the Left says they want \u201ccommon sense\u201d reform on enforcement. That\u2019s political speak for doing nothing significant that ensures the protection of the integrity of our border or our citizens.\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s not just left wing publications, like The Nation, that are peddling this nonsense. The Philadelphia Inquirer is running op-eds on it as well:\nThe conduct of ICE and its first cousin, the Border Patrol, has been arguably the darkest moral stain on the sometimes comical but too often diabolical Trump era. And yet these one-off individual outrages \u2014 the Indonesian who led Superstorm Sandy rebuilding efforts who took refuge in a church to avoid ICE, or Philadelphia\u2019s Carmelo Apolonio Hernandez, the mother of four that ICE wants to send back to the Mexican town where her relatives were killed by drug lords \u2014 have a hard time breaking through the bubble, amid the mass chaos of our 45th president. But now we have actual numbers to tell the sorry state of our current Deportation Nation.\nIn the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, we now know, immigration arrests and detentions spiked by a whopping one-third over 2016 \u2014 proof that the president has kept has his campaign promise for a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d merely by \u201ctaking the shackles off\u201d the ready and willing team he already had in place, ICE. What\u2019s more, the biggest driver of this increase has been the seizure of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record, which has doubled under the Trump administration.\nThose are the grim numbers behind a human rights catastrophe of families ripped apart and entire communities in our country now infected by fear, afraid to drive their kids to school or testify against those who actually are criminals. We\u2019ve done a decent job in America teaching our kids about the inhumane nightmares of the recent past, to adopt a mantra, \u201cNever again.\u201d But the not-so-secret-police-force called ICE that operates with an almost mechanical heartlessness within our borders is what \u201cagain\u201d looks like, here in America, in 2018.\nIt\u2019s time to say, \u201cEnough!\u201d\nYet, first things first, you have to win elections to get this plan set in motion, so Republicans\u2014this awaits, along with higher taxes, single-payer health care, speech codes, and gun confiscation.

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is holding firm, though her base of support has been chipping away ever since her party has lost control of the House. The House Minority Leader has promised endlessly that her party would claim victory in 2012, 2014, and 2016. It\u2019s only ended with the GOP majority becoming more entrenched. Now, with Democratic energy at an all-time high, with their first congressional win in the post-2016 era in Pennsylvania, the party, along with their allies in the media, is promising a GOP wipeout. Take that with a grain of salt. We have roughly eight months until Election Day; anything can happen. Plus, this recent election in PA-18 won\u2019t exist soon. It\u2019s quite possible that despite losing the special election, Republican Rick Saccone could be serving with Democrat Conor Lamb; Lamb has already filed to run in PA-18, which will soon encompass more of Pittsburgh. Saccone has filed to run in the more Republican-leaning 14th district. In January, the Democrat-controlled PA Supreme Court tossed the current congressional map.\u00a0\nPA-18 was a +20 Trump district, so you can see why liberal pundits are harping on it. But the GOP turnout was probably depressed due to the resignation of pro-life GOP Rep. Tim Murphy, who resigned after it was revealed that he had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to have an abortion in the midst of a pregnancy scare. This crisis is solely the GOP\u2019s doing, but Lamb ran as a pro-gun, anti-Pelosi Democrat and won. Other Democrats are following suit. Even former Rep. Brad Ashford (D-NE), who is gearing up for a rematch with Republican Don Bacon who beat him in 2016, is running away from Pelosi. Actually, he admitted that Democratic strategists are telling him to flee from the House Minority Leader. Ashford had backed Pelosi while in Congress; I mean it's all there. You have Democratic hopefuls either saying \u201chello no, Nancy,\u201d or we\u2019re not committing just yet. On the Hill, top Democrats like Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Joseph Cawley (D-NY) have laid down the groundwork to launch their own speakership bids should Pelosi\u2019s base of support become smaller. The only downside is if there is a tsunami come November, Pelosi is probably going to become speaker with ease, but anything short of that \u00a0(i.e. Democrats with a slim single-digit majority), then there could be a huge move to clear out the older members of the leadership. The New York Times detailed the brewing revolt against Pelosi, while adding that the longtime Democratic leader had planned to retire if Hillary Clinton had won the election. That plan got shot to hell when Trump won the election. She opted to stay to show there was a powerful woman in politics and to prevent a \u201cmusical chairs\u201d game regarding the vacuum that would have been left with her departure (via NYT):\nA few hours after Conor Lamb, the Pennsylvania Democrat, claimed victory in a House race with a vow to oppose his party\u2019s leader, Nancy Pelosi, the once-and-perhaps-future speaker was explaining to a group of female congressional candidates why she did not retire after 2016.\nShe intended to do so after Hillary Clinton won, Ms. Pelosi recalled Wednesday at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception here. But she stayed to ensure Washington had at least one woman in power.\nTo some lawmakers in the room who described her remarks, the message was clear: Ms. Pelosi is not going anywhere \u2014 a point she underscored in an interview.\nYet her resolve is at odds with growing numbers of Democratic candidates who view her as politically toxic and are pledging to vote against her as their leader, as Mr. Lamb did without suffering consequences with voters and donors. These candidates and some current House Democrats \u2014 tired of years of attack ads invoking Ms. Pelosi as a \u201cSan Francisco liberal,\u201d and impatient to see a younger set of leaders take power \u2014 are now openly distancing themselves from Ms. Pelosi or declaring outright that it is time for her to go.\n[\u2026]\nAt least two other senior Democrats, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and Joseph Crowley of New York, are already actively laying the groundwork to seek the leader\u2019s job if Ms. Pelosi\u2019s position becomes untenable.\n[\u2026]\nAs Democratic House candidates descended on Washington last week for a round of training and fund-raising, the topic of how to confront the Pelosi question came up repeatedly, according to multiple officials.\n\u201cI was just in D.C. and that\u2019s the advice everybody gives: Don\u2019t say you\u2019re for Pelosi,\u201d recalled former Representative Brad Ashford, a Nebraska Democrat trying to reclaim his seat. (He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)\nMost ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.\n\u201cI would have to see who\u2019s running,\u201d said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker.\nFrankly, if chaos is a prelude to a new party that could win, I think a great many Democrats would prefer that, even if it means they fall short in 2018. With Pelosi, disappointment has permeated her time of the helm of the ship. Clear the rot in 2018, gain some ground, and hope a Pelosi-less party could reclaim the majority outright in 2020. Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA) pretty much said she wants the old folks home to be cleared out last October. Last June, there was a realization that the Democratic brand in some parts of the country was worse than Trump\u2019s, and that Pelosi was more toxic than the president. I mean what the hell have they got to lose. They\u2019ve been sucking for almost a decade now.\nRegardless, Pelosi is holding firm, at least for now\u2014saying the Left needs her to quarterback these elections:\nDemonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.\n\u201cI am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,\u201d she said.\nWhile she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.\n\u201cIf I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,\u201d she said.\nStill, from Kansas to Massachusetts, Democrats seem to have a growing impatience with the California Democrat, whom an increasing number are seeing her as an obstacle. In Oregon, the Times noted that Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader has liberal constituents who praise him for voting against Pelosi for leader. Also, for a woman who touts her shrewd political acumen, it was sheer idiocy to bash and denigrate American workers for getting $1,000 or more in bonuses thanks to Trump's tax bill. I don't think 'you're too stupid to understand that $1,000 is crumbs' is an exercise in master political messaging.

Among other proposals, Dick\u2019s called for completely banning \u201cassault-style firearms\u201d and \u201chigh-capacity magazines,\u201d closing the \u201cgun show loophole,\u201d and raising the minimum federal gun buying age to 21. At the same time, Dick\u2019s also announced that they would be complying with their gun control proposals in their own stores from then on.\nOn the same day, Walmart made a similar statement to Dick\u2019s announcing restrictions on its sales of both actual firearms and airsoft toy guns. Importantly for this case, Walmart followed Dick\u2019s lead in implementing a nationwide minimum gun purchasing age of 21 in its stores (Walmart has already had a self-imposed \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban since 2015).\nAccording to Watson\u2019s lawsuit, on February 24th, he walked into one of Dick\u2019s stores with the intention of buying a Ruger .22 caliber rifle, but was prevented from purchasing the gun because he was only 20 years old. On the same day, Watson went to a Walmart store to try purchasing a gun again, but they refused him service too.\nStrangely, Watson tried to make these purchases four days before Dick\u2019s public gun control push and Walmart\u2019s announcement, but the large chain stores\u2019 policies were already apparently in effect.\nWalmart told The Oregonian that it will defend its age limits on buying guns in court:\nWalmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Monday that the retailer will defend its new policy.\n\u201cIn light of recent events, we reviewed our policy on firearm sales,\u201d Hargrove said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs a result, we raised the age restriction for the purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age. We stand behind our decision and plan to defend it. While we haven\u2019t seen the complaint, we will respond as appropriate with the court.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John Stossel", "body": "Sunday, Hollywood sycophants give out Oscars.\nBut they will miss some of the better performances of the year because Academy Awards just go to movie actors.

Some of their performances deserve recognition.\nSo, I created the Stosscars to fill the gap. Here are this year's awards:\nBest Performance by a Rich Elitist goes to Nancy Pelosi. In her eagerness to trash Republican tax cuts, she said this about $1,000 bonuses: \"The crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic.\"\nThe award for Best Performance by a Democrat goes to San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon. After California legalized marijuana, the DA announced he would drop 3,000 misdemeanor marijuana convictions and reduce the penalties for thousands of felony convictions, and the poor guys sitting in jail would not have to petition to get the relief: \"People will not have to hire attorneys. They will never have to come to our courts. We believe it's the right thing to do.\"\nThe Stosscar for Best Performance by the President goes to the speech in which Donald Trump said, \"We have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every one new rule.\"\nIt's not clear that this is true, but the thought behind it is great. Any reduction in regulations will increase Americans' freedom and prosperity.\nOn the other hand, President Trump chose Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions wins the award for Worst Praise of Abusive Government. He said this about asset forfeiture: \"I love that program. We had so much fun doing that, taking drug dealers' money.\"\nFun? Police grabbed billions of dollars, mostly from people who never got trials. That's a crime, not good government, but both political parties supported it.\nStill, it wasn't even the Worst Result of Bipartisanship. Senators Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell win that Stosscar for their recent budget deal.\nSchumer called it, \"The first real sprout of bipartisanship.\" McConnell thanked \"my friend the Democratic leader\" and said he hoped \"we can build on this bipartisan momentum.\"\nPlease don't! That deal added billions of dollars to our unsustainable debt and cut almost nothing.\nDoes any politician ever say \"no\" to more government?\nOne did. Sen. Rand Paul wins the Stosscar for Best Defense of the Constitution. Paul demanded the NSA and FBI get warrants before they listen to Americans' phone calls picked up during surveillance of foreigners.\n\"Do we really want all of our phone calls recorded ... (I)f you are not perfectly accurate in recording your phone calls, you can go to prison? ... (F)or Americans, the Constitution should be in order.\"\nUnfortunately, the Constitution bores most Americans. So domestic spying continues.\nThis year's Stosscar for Best Democrat on Free Speech goes to Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Despite denouncing good people like Charles Murray, she said of them: \"It's dangerous to suppress speech. First, suppression can backfire. Instead of shutting up individuals with disgusting views, it becomes a launching pad to national attention. ... Suppression suggests weakness. It makes it sound like we're afraid that we can't defeat evil ideas with good ideas.\"\nGood point. The way to fight bad ideas is with good ideas. Unfortunately, Warren's ideas are usually not good ideas.\nFinally, the Stosscar for Worst Performance by a President. The winner is ... President Trump -- for bragging like a narcissistic child in tweet after tweet.\nDon't misunderstand. The Stosscar judges love his tweeting, but some bragging is so repulsive it deserves an award. Samples:\nTrump tweeted that he was: \"not smart, but genius ... and a very stable genius at that!\"\n\"Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news -- it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017.\"\nGive me a break. He still hasn't even done anything that affected aviation.\nMany presidential tweets deserve awards.

Despite him hammering Republican Gov. Rick Scott for not attending CNN\u2019s kangaroo court that indicted every law-abiding gun owner, NRA member, and Second Amendment supporter as murderers for merely supporting the Bill of Rights, it hasn\u2019t yielded any political dividends. A new poll showed Scott with a two-point lead over Nelson (via Tampa Bay Times):\nEmerging from his final legislative session, Republican Gov. Rick Scott holds a small lead over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson in a potential U.S. Senate race that could help determine control of the Senate, according to a poll released Monday.\nThe poll of likely voters, conducted this month by the Tallahassee-based firm Clearview Research, shows Scott receiving 43.3 percent of the support, while Nelson gets 41.3 percent. The difference is within the poll's margin of error of 3.58 percentage points.\nScott has not announced that he is running for the Senate but is widely expected to do so \u2014 and no other prominent Republicans are running against Nelson. After the annual legislative session ended Sunday afternoon, Scott indicated a decision on entering the high-profile race could be weeks away.\nThat CNN town hall was one of the biggest political shows of the year, exemplifying the gun control debate in this country and revealing what we all knew about anti-gun liberals\u2019 beliefs and antics. It was a total clown show. Yet, Nelson actually had a shot to gain some ground, but instead decided to politicize the event and turn it into a campaign event. He was criticized for doing so. On top of that, Nelson suffers from poor name recognition, despite being an incumbent U.S. Senator. This piece of data was released in October of 2017 (via Pensacola News Journal):\nDespite 17 years in Senate, Nelson not that well known\nWho the heck is Bill Nelson?\nA new poll suggests that about half of Florida\u2019s voters \u2013 49% \u2013 don\u2019t know enough about the man who has been their U.S. senator for 17 years to form an opinion about the job he\u2019s doing.\n\u201cI saw this number and I was flabbergasted,\u201d said Michael Binder, faculty director of the Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida\u2026\nSo, band name recognition, botching the CNN town hall event, and now he\u2019s dealing with new polling showing that almost half of Floridian voters think the economy has improved from last year.

Moreover, a majority of Florida voters approve of that GOP tax reform package that was signed into law in December of 201; a law that\u2019s incentivized companies to re-invest back into America. Over 250 companies have given bonuses to their employees. Over three million workers have benefitted from the Trump tax package. The overwhelming majority of those who benefit are the middle and working classes\u2014and Democrats decided to screw them over in order to win the 2018 elections. Also, Nelson has shown his hand on gun control, namely saying that the issue will help his party on the ballot. He also appears to be taking advantage of this community\u2019s grief to list-build, which will undoubtedly help his campaign. \u00a0\nPolitico reported last year that the ad campaign in Florida could cost $3 million to run a weeklong media blitz in the Sunshine State.

And yet he\u2019s human rights activist and former political prisoner who suffered tortures Nelson Mandela never even envisioned in his worst nightmares from his (relative) country club incarceration in apartheid South Africa.In fact, Dr. Biscet suffered this jailing and tortures just 90 miles from our shores, in a place absolutely lousy with Fake News Media \u201cnews\u201d bureaus and positively crawling with Fake News Media \u201creporters.\u201dGosh? What could possibly account for this grotesque disconnect between these dramatic, potentially blockbuster human-interest stories on our very doorstep, and the utter silence from all those \u201cGallant Crusades for the Truth!\u201d--as Columbia Journalism schools hails its graduates?Gosh? Might such stories have proven displeasing to the totalitarian apparatchiks who bestow the Fake News Media with their Cuba \u201cpress\u201d bureaus and their \u201cjournalist\u201d visas?It\u2019s a wild guess, but just maybe.Dr. Oscar Biscet is also a presidential Medal of Freedom Winner. More fascinatingly still, he\u2019s also black. Even more amazingly, he\u2019s a foreign \u201cLatino\u201d human rights-activist.With this profile, what odds would Vegas give that the mainstream media would be reporting his every utterance and deed if the medal had been awarded by Obama and his jailers had been an American ally in the Cold War (like South Africa or Pinochet\u2019s Chile?)Alas! Biscet\u2019s Medal of Freedom was awarded by a Republican President (Bush II) and his jailers and torturers were (are) the regime co-founded by the left\u2019s premier pin-up boys (Fidel Castro and Che Guevara.) Any more questions regarding the media black-out on this human rights hero?More specifically, the anti-communist dissident Biscet was jailed and tortured by the Castro regime for peacefully protesting the Stalinist regime\u2019s policy of forced late-term abortions via the drug Rivanol. \"The umbilical cord was cut,\u201d revealed the medical doctor Biscet back in 1998. \u201cAnd they (the babies) were allowed to bleed to death or they were wrapped in paper and asphyxiated.\"Not that most of you have ever heard of this abortion policy from the Castro-accredited U.S. media that \u201creports\u201d from Cuba.What most of you probably have heard from the Castro-accredited U.S. media--from CNN to NBC, from ABC to NPR, from the AP to CBS to The New York Times--is that \u201camazingly low!\u201d Cuban infant-mortality rate! That the Stalinist regime\u2019s abortion policy plays an enormous role in these (nonetheless bogus) low infant-mortality figures is not something the Castro-accredited U.S. media would dare venture to investigate. That Castro-accreditation, you see, would suddenly go POOF!\u201d\u2014and vanish.Castro\u2019s judicial system, lifted from Stalin\u2019s as it functioned during the Great Terror, sentenced Oscar Biscet to 25 years of prison, of which he suffered 11. He was also honored by Amnesty international as one of its official \u201cPrisoners of Conscience,\u201d not that this has much induced the Castro-accredited U.S. media to ever mention Dr. Oscar Biscet.Cuba\u2019s Oscar Biscet suffered longer in Castro\u2019s Gulag than Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalin\u2019s Gulag\u2014and for essentially the same \u201ccrime.\u201d Both Solzhenitsyn and Biscet refused to renounce truth. \u201cLive not by lies\u201d famously advised Solzhenitsyn.This \u201cinconsistency\u201d by the Fake News Media\u2019s reporting on black political prisoners (i.e. featuring Nelson Mandela, almost exclusively) needs further dramatization:According to anti-Apartheid activists, a grand total of 3,000 political prisoners passed through South Africa\u2019s Robben Island prison in roughly 30 years under the Apartheid regime. Usually about a thousand were held. These were out of a South African population of 40 million.According to Freedom House, a grand total of 500,000 political prisoners have passed through Castro\u2019s various prisons and forced labor camps. At one time in 1961, some 300,000 Cubans were jailed for political offenses. This is out of a Cuban population in 1960 of 6.4 million. A quick punch of a calculator will easily reveal the grotesque disparity in repression between the two regimes. A quick scan of the media will reveal the grotesque disparity of condemnation applied to the (relative) molehill instead of to the mountain.In 1964, the government of Apartheid South Africa sentenced Nelson Mandela to 30 years in prison. Mandela\u2019s trial was conducted by an independent judiciary and witnessed by scores of international observers. The charges against Mandela included: \"The preparation, manufacture and use of explosives, including 210,000 hand grenades, 48,000 anti-personnel mines, 1,500 time devices, 144 tons of ammonium nitrate, 21.6 tons of aluminum powder and a ton of black powder. 193 counts of terrorism committed between 1961 and 1963.\"\"The [Mandela] trial has been properly conducted,\" wrote correspondent for the London Observer Anthony Sampson (who later wrote Mandela's authorized biography). \"The judge, Mr Justice Quartus de Wet, has been scrupulously fair.\"Dr. Oscar Biscet and thousands of other Cubans were condemned by a judicial system founded by Felix Dzerzhinsky during Lenin\u2019s Red Terror, perfected by Andrei Vishinsky during Stalin\u2019s Great Terror and transplanted to Cuba in 1959 by their \u201cLatino\u201d disciples. \u201cJudicial evidence is an archaic Bourgeois detail,\u201d Che Guevara stressed to his prosecutors. \u201cWhen in doubt -- execute.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Townhall", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Guy Benson", "body": "To recap, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines last night to make public a classified memorandum, written by Republicans and drawn from US intelligence, pertaining to some element or elements of the overall Russia matter. \u00a0The specific subject matter of the document remains unclear, although the surveillance of former Trump aide Carter Page appears to be at least somewhat relevant. Democrats have objected vociferously to publishing the memo, claiming that it paints an inaccurate picture of reality, based on incomplete information. \u00a0They've drafted their own private memo, which the committee voted unanimously to make available to all House members -- but not the public -- last evening. \u00a0(For what it's worth, I've come to believe that given the volume and severity of the various charges and counter-charges, both memos should be released, along with as much supporting raw intelligence as possible, with a careful eye toward national security considerations). \u00a0Among the criticisms mounted by Democrats in recent days is the accusation that the GOP-authored document isn't factually accurate. \u00a0Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, who first revealed that FBI Director Christopher Wray viewed the memo on Sunday, is reporting today that several FBI/DOJ sources have now viewed the controversial missive and are not questioning its accuracy:Watch the latest video at foxnews.comTwo Senior FBI officials have now reviewed the Republican staff memo, alleging abuses of government surveillance programs during the 2016 election, a source familiar with the matter tells Fox News, adding that the officials \u201ccould not point to any factual inaccuracies.\u201d\u2014 Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) January 30, 2018One of the arguments against publishing the memo was that the FBI and DOJ should be given an opportunity to review its contents and raise concerns on factual or national security grounds. \u00a0According to Herridge's sources, a number of officials have now been afforded that courtesy, and they're not disputing the core facts presented in the memo. \u00a0That doesn't mean that the top brass is now unanimously vouching for its in-context accuracy, or endorsing its conclusions -- nor does it mean that they don't maintain serious qualms about the impact of releasing a document that contains sensitive intelligence. \u00a0Nevertheless, 'not inaccurate' is significant. \u00a0Here's something else to consider: Are Democrats riled up over the prospect of the Republican memo getting out because it contains objectively embarrassing information about their party's actions throughout this whole confusing saga? Here's Congressman Trey Gowdy, who was reportedly instrumental in pressing to allow the FBI access to the memo prior to the vote on its publication:VIDEOMy Democratic colleagues didn\u2019t want us to find this information. They did everything they could to keep us from finding this information. I think it will be embarrassing to Adam Schiff once people realize the extent to which he went to keep them from learning any of this. That would be the embarrassment.Hmm. Meanwhile, the sudden departure of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe remains a hot topic in town, and as we relayed last night, it appears as though McCabe was forced out after Wray was made aware of a \"concerning\" detail uncovered in the course of the nonpartisan Inspector General's investigation of how the FBI handled its probe of Hillary Clinton's national security-compromising email scandal. An MSNBC host tweeted that it was difficult to reconcile Wray's erstwhile passionate defenses of McCabe with his very recent decision to oust McCabe from his position:\u00a0Today:FBI Dir. Wray implies McCabe is out because of internal review of Clinton stuff.

I know which option seems much more likely, especially given the New York Times'\u00a0account of what happened.

When MacCallum asked him about his thoughts on David Hogg, who proudly said that he hung up on the Trump White House, he was visibly irritated.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to control my anger,\u201d he said, noting that it was hypocritical for Hogg to push for change on this issue, only to hang up on the White House who is trying to fin ways to do just that. On a side note, it shows that this isn\u2019t about bipartisanship. Hogg hung up on the White House because of Trump. If a Democrat had called, we all know he would have taken the call. This was about scoring points in left wing activism, and he\u2019s surely succeeded in doing that over the past couple of weeks. Kashuv finds the whole game counterproductive to finding real solutions. He later said he hasn\u2019t spoke to Hogg about this.\nThere were multiple times state, local, and federal authorities could have possibly stopped Cruz from committing this heinous crime. All red flags were not acted upon, which is another issue that should be looked at closely as well. It may not be that we need new gun laws (we don't), it could be that the system needs some reforms, along with competent people to administer the system the could have prevented this strategy.\nEarlier today, Kashuv agreed to meet with the National Rifle Association. At the same time, he appears to be making time to meet with Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX). He's already met with Florida state Sen. Lauren Book, a Democrat.\u00a0\nMore than happy to meet with you guys. Let's schedule a meeting.

Rick Scott [emphasis mine]:\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: David, are you, your family, the community, are you starting to hear a rising concern about how the Broward Sheriffs operated, staying outside while the shooting was going on?\nDAVID HOGG: So, I\u2019m glad you bring that up, and it definitely is raising concern that the fact that they didn\u2019t go in, but that also brings up two things. One\u2014how can we expect our teachers to step in and take action if trained security guards that are part of the sheriff\u2019s department wouldn\u2019t take action? And two\u2014why are these elected officials trying to blame this on the bureaucracy? They\u2019re in charge of them. This is their fault. They should have been regulating them.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to allow them to pressure these people because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s their fault. These elected officials are the boss of these sheriff personnel.\nSCARBOROUGH: Right.\nHOGG: And just like the president is the boss of the FBI,-\nSCARBOROUGH: Right.\nHOGG: -Governor Rick Scott is essentially the boss of Scott Israel, the sheriff, and as such, he should be held accountable.\u00a0He can\u2019t just blame this on the bureaucracy and expect to get re-elected.\nNo Joe, that\u2019s not right. Sheriff Israel is not some lowly paper-pushing bureaucrat without any power or authority. He is the elected chief law enforcement officer in Broward County. He and his deputies, who reportedly failed to adequately respond to more than forty calls about Cruz and his violent behavior, were directly in a position to do something to stop him, not Rick Scott. Governors can\u2019t possibly micromanage every county law enforcement agency in their states to make sure that each individual case is being followed up on properly. That\u2019s insane.\nPerhaps even more ridiculous was Hogg\u2019s first point questioning the courage of teachers to protect their students, even knowing about the example of football coach Aaron Feis, who died while shielding Stoneman Douglas students from Cruz\u2019s bullets. Scarborough did follow up Hogg\u2019s comments by bringing up the football coach and Hogg appeared to recall the story, but it was odd to see Feis\u2019s actions being so blithely discounted to make a cheap political point.\nScarborough also criticized the sheriff\u2019s deputies who stood outside the high school while the mass shooting was taking place. Hogg agreed with Joe's point, describing the sheriff\u2019s deputies as \u201ccowardly,\u201d but then he went right back to attacking Gov.

Toomey, along with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) tried to do a comprehensive background check bill after Newtown, which failed. But it\u2019s been rehashed, with the president wanting to add mental health provisions, raising the age limit for firearms, and having universal background checks, while nixing any hope of having concealed carry reciprocity attached to the legislation to make it at least palatable to Republicans.\u00a0\nManchin tells Trump that Manchin-Toomey background checks bill will pass with Trump's support\n\u2014 Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) February 28, 2018Trump: \"You could buy the weapon used in this horrible shooting at 18...

It pretty much was a capitulation to pro-gun control Democrats. While gun bans aren\u2019t on the table, though the latest bill from Democrats come pretty damn close to that\u2014gun confiscation with no due process is troubling. The raising of the age limit for firearms is another way to chip away and deny Americans their Second Amendment rights. Also, is there any way to conduct universal background checks without a national database? That\u2019s what Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) wrote in an op-ed for CNN after Sandy Hook, citing the American Civil Liberties Union.\u00a0\nIf I were the NRA, I would feel like I\u2019ve been thrown under the bus. Here\u2019s how they explained why they endorsed Trump in 2016:\u00a0\nWhen asked if the NRA was concerned about comments in favor of new gun control Trump had made in the years before his presidential run, Cox pointed to Trump's current positions and said the candidate no longer supports an assault weapons ban.\n\"His first position paper that he put out on the campaign was on immigration,\" he said. \"The second position paper was on the Second Amendment. I encourage people to go to his website and read his Second Amendment paper that outlines his opposition to gun bans, his opposition to magazine bans.\"\n\"He was asked about a past comment he had made 20 some odd years ago about supporting a semi-auto ban and he said he no longer supports that position. So, you look at the campaign he's running and the positions he's articulating versus the one hundred percent certainty that we know with Hillary Clinton and that decision becomes crystal clear.\"\u00a0\nDid the Parkland shooting happen because we have lax gun laws and a broken system or is it due to government incompetence? It\u2019s starting to look like the latter. The FBI was informed and did nothing. Local law enforcement was called to the shooter\u2019s home over 40 times, with some calls detailing how the shooter could be a threat to the public\u2014nothing happened. Concerning state officials, if the shooter\u2019s self-mutilation was taken seriously, he could have been committed via Baker Act. That would have shown up on a background check, which could have prevented him from buying an AR-15 in February of 2017, days after he was expelled from the school. It seems the system is not in a crisis mode, we just have incompetent people administering it. As for bump stocks, Trump vowed to ban them through executive order. President Trump has done a lot of good for the country, but I have to disagree vociferously with him on this one.\u00a0\nThe President seems to want a comprehensive piece of legislation that includes Fix NICS, universal background checks, something on mental health, and a ban on those under 21 owning firearms.\n\u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) February 28, 2018So, if I'm understanding this meeting right, Trump supports adding universal background checks to Fix NICS but not concealed carry reciprocity.
