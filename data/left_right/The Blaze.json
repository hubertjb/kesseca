They believed the only way to stop the cyberattacks was to hit back even harder.\n\nThey developed plans that were \u201cmore aggressive responses beyond anything the Obama administration or the US government had ever before contemplated in response to a cyberattack,\u201d according to Mother Jones.\n\nSome of those plans included: Dismantling websites leaking stolen information, bombarding Russian news sites with automated traffic to shut them down, and to launch an attack on Russia\u2019s intelligence agency. Wallander even suggested targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and his family, knowing it would get under his skin.\n\nWhile Daniel and others worked hard to draft a response to Russia, top Obama aides were not on board, including Rice.\n\nWhat did she do?\nMother Jones explained:\n\n\nOne day in late August, national security adviser Susan Rice called Daniel into her office and demanded he cease and desist from working on the cyber options he was developing. \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of us,\u201d she warned him. The White House was not prepared to endorse any of these ideas. Daniel and his team in the White House cyber response group were given strict orders: \u201cStand down.\u201d She told Daniel to \u201cknock it off,\u201d he recalled.\n\nDaniel walked back to his office. \u201cThat was one pissed-off national security adviser,\u201d he told one of his aides.\n\nAt his morning staff meeting, Daniel matter-of-factly said to his team that it had to stop work on options to counter the Russian attack: \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to stand down.\u201d Daniel Prieto, one of Daniel\u2019s top deputies, recalled, \u201cI was incredulous and in disbelief. It took me a moment to process. In my head I was like, \u2018Did I hear that correctly?\u2019\u201d Then Prieto spoke up, asking, \u201cWhy the hell are we standing down? Michael, can you help us understand?\u201d Daniel informed them that the orders came from both Rice and Monaco. They were concerned that if the options were to leak, it would force Obama to act. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to box the president in,\u201d Prieto subsequently said.\n\nDid anything ever happen?\nNot at the time. According to Obama chief of staff Denis Mcdonough, Obama\u2019s main priority at the time was to protect the integrity of the election. He believed \u201cconfronting Putin was necessary,\u201d but protecting America\u2019s peaceful transition of power was even more so.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until October that Obama went public about the meddling.

When Toomey responded, \u201cWe didn\u2019t address it, Mr. President,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cYou know why, because you\u2019re afraid of the NRA, right?\u201d\n\nVIDEO\n\nOn another occasion, responding to skepticism from Sen.

And it doesn\u2019t feel to me that they are,\u201d Corker said.\n\nCorker was asked if he thinks Trump will pull out of the deal and he said, \u201cI do. I do.\u201d\n\nThe move would mark a major step toward fulfilling a campaign promise made by Trump, who has said he wants to end the Iran nuclear agreement. Trump has called it the \u201cworst deal ever.\u201d\n\nTrump recertified the deal at the end of January. But he also warned it would be the final chance for the Islamic Republic to abide by the agreement before the U.S. pulls out.\n\nWhat was Corker\u2019s role?\nCorker, along with Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) authored the legislation signed into law following the Iran deal. It requires certification every 90 days to Congress on whether Iran is complying with the deal former President Barack Obama entered into in 2015.\n\nIn the past, Trump\u2019s White House blamed Corker for the Iran deal, \u201cFace the Nation\u201d noted. Corker, together with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), \u201crolled out the red carpet\u201d for the deal with that legislation, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has claimed.\n\nIn part, the agreement limits Iran\u2019s ability to produce plutonium and uranium, two key components in creating nuclear weapons. The Trump administration wants to add requirements that allow sanctions if Iran pursues non-nuclear activities the U.S. deems unacceptable. Such sanctions were waived under the deal approved by Obama.\n\nWould this impact dealings with North Korea?\nCorker said he does not believe backing out of the Iran deal will impact negotiations with North Korea. In an unprecedented move, Trump plans to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by the end of May.\n\n\u201cLook, I have used that argument, OK?\u201d Corker said. \u201cBut at the end of the day I think this whole situation with North Korea and the way that it\u2019s shaping up right now is, as I mentioned, is somewhat unorthodox, and I think you\u2019re dealing with a leader there that probably doesn\u2019t think the same way that other countries and their leadership might. So, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s going to end up having a detrimental effect.\u201d\n\nVIDEO", "link": null, "source": "The Blaze", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Enloe", "body": "Rep.

They say the American public needs to see what the memo contains, and more importantly, what the government is doing. They say the four-page memo offers evidence the Obama administration used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to spy on the Trump campaign and transition team.\nDemocrats, on the other hand, say the memo is filled with classified, biased information meant to undermine the Department of Justice and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation.\nThrough a series of well-crafted rhetorical questions, Gowdy hinted at the contents of the memo, which he helped write, in his interview with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace on Sunday.\nFirst, Gowdy made it clear the memo isn\u2019t biased.

If you\u2019re interested in Christopher Steele\u2019s relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, then, yes, you\u2019ll want the memo to come out,\u201d Gowdy explained.\nOne of the central questions surrounding the dossier is whether or not it was used \u2014 or how heavily it was relied upon \u2014 to obtain a FISA court surveillance warrant against Carter Page, a Trump campaign official.\nWallace asked Gowdy about that, but the House Oversight Committee chairman didn\u2019t definitively answer, explaining that if he did, he would be disseminating classified information.\n\u201cI will just ask you again, are you interested in whether or not the world\u2019s premier law enforcement agency relied on a work product produced, paid for by the Democratic National Committee?\u201d Gowdy asked.\n\u201cDo you want to know whether or not the primary source in these court proceedings had a bias against one candidate?

John Carney (D) said Friday\u00a0that he is proposing a statewide ban on the sale of \u201cassault weapons\u201d in the wake of\u00a0the\u00a0deadly Florida high school shooting, which killed 17 people and injured many more on Feb. 14.\n\nWhat did Carney say?\nCarney explained that, in addition to other statewide gun safety measures in the works, his team will \u201cwork closely with lawmakers to craft legislation that would prohibit the sale of assault-style rifles\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen in Las Vegas, Parkland, and in many other horrific incidents across our country, military-style weapons can be used to carry out catastrophic acts of violence,\u201d Carney noted. \u201cThey have no place on the streets of our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nAccording to spokesman Jonathan Starkey, Carney is not\u00a0aiming to ban \u201cmilitary-style\u201d guns\u00a0that have already been legally purchased,\u00a0but instead has aims to prevent any more of these weapons from being purchased from local gun shops, according to Delaware Online.\n\n\u201cPresident [Donald] Trump and members of Congress have the authority to take responsible action nationally to reduce the toll of gun violence across our country,\u201d Starkey added, according to the Washington Post. \u201cGovernor Carney believes they should act but won\u2019t wait to do what is within our power here in Delaware to make our state safer.\u201d\n\nDelaware Online reported that Carney\u2019s definitions of the terms \u201cassault-style rifles\u201d and \u201cmilitary-style weapons\u201d \u2014 terms\u00a0that were used interchangeably in his statement \u2014\u00a0were not clear.\n\nIn response to Carney\u2019s announcement, House Republican Leader Danny Short released the following statement:\n\nWhenever there is a horrendous event involving firearms and a large loss of life, there is a knee-jerk reaction to do something, anything, to fight the horror and pain. That is an understandable human response, but it is a poor way to make meaningful public policy.\n\nWe had a federal ban on assault weapons between 1994 and 2004. It proved ineffective.\n\nOne of the problems then, as now, is defining an \u201cassault weapon.\u201d True assault weapons\u00a0\u2014 rifles capable of fully automatic fire\u00a0\u2014 are already illegal for most Americans to own and have been for decades.\n\nWhat the governor apparently means by the provocative term is any semi-automatic rifle resembling a military weapon, like the AR-15 rifle used in the recent Florida tragedy. According to the National Rifle Association, Americans own about five million AR-15s alone. Millions more semi-automatic rifles of other types are also owned by Americans\u00a0\u2014 the vast majority of which will never be employed in any crime. Such rifles are ubiquitous.\n\nIt also needs to be stressed that violent crime in our nation has dropped dramatically. According to the Pew Research Center (using FBI data) the violent crime rate in the U.S. has fallen by 48% between 1993 and 2016.\n\nPassing laws to restrict the basic firearms ownership rights, guaranteed by both our federal and state constitutions, is not the answer to reducing the anomalous incidents of mass violence perpetrated by a few deranged individuals.\n\nI, and my caucus colleagues, generally support a ban on the sale and use of so-called bump-stocks and trigger-crank devices.\n\nAnd, in lieu of HB 302 (the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act), we support enactment of House Bill 285, which will create procedures for making sure firearms do not find their way into the hands of dangerous people, while protecting due process and avoiding the creation of barriers to treat those suffering from mental illnesses.\n\nIn contrast to HB 302, HB 285 has bipartisan support and is far more comprehensive in its approach.\n\nThe proposed assault weapon sales ban is a misguided effort that will only serve to further politically polarize Delawareans with no hope of making any real impact on the desired goal of reducing isolated incidents of mass violence. I instead urge the governor to work in a non-partisan fashion with all the members of the 149th General Assembly to create rational laws that will actually make a difference.\n\nAre there any other state officials\u00a0looking into doing something similar?\n\nMinnesota Rep.

Daniel and his team in the White House cyber response group were given strict orders: \u201cStand down.\u201d She told Daniel to \u201cknock it off,\u201d he recalled.\n\nDaniel walked back to his office. \u201cThat was one pissed-off national security adviser,\u201d he told one of his aides.\n\nAt his morning staff meeting, Daniel matter-of-factly said to his team that it had to stop work on options to counter the Russian attack: \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to stand down.\u201d Daniel Prieto, one of Daniel\u2019s top deputies, recalled, \u201cI was incredulous and in disbelief. It took me a moment to process. In my head I was like, \u2018Did I hear that correctly?\u2019\u201d Then Prieto spoke up, asking, \u201cWhy the hell are we standing down? Michael, can you help us understand?\u201d Daniel informed them that the orders came from both Rice and Monaco. They were concerned that if the options were to leak, it would force Obama to act. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to box the president in,\u201d Prieto subsequently said.\n\nDid anything ever happen?\nNot at the time. According to Obama chief of staff Denis Mcdonough, Obama\u2019s main priority at the time was to protect the integrity of the election.

That is an understandable human response, but it is a poor way to make meaningful public policy.\n\nWe had a federal ban on assault weapons between 1994 and 2004. It proved ineffective.\n\nOne of the problems then, as now, is defining an \u201cassault weapon.\u201d True assault weapons\u00a0\u2014 rifles capable of fully automatic fire\u00a0\u2014 are already illegal for most Americans to own and have been for decades.\n\nWhat the governor apparently means by the provocative term is any semi-automatic rifle resembling a military weapon, like the AR-15 rifle used in the recent Florida tragedy. According to the National Rifle Association, Americans own about five million AR-15s alone. Millions more semi-automatic rifles of other types are also owned by Americans\u00a0\u2014 the vast majority of which will never be employed in any crime. Such rifles are ubiquitous.\n\nIt also needs to be stressed that violent crime in our nation has dropped dramatically. According to the Pew Research Center (using FBI data) the violent crime rate in the U.S. has fallen by 48% between 1993 and 2016.\n\nPassing laws to restrict the basic firearms ownership rights, guaranteed by both our federal and state constitutions, is not the answer to reducing the anomalous incidents of mass violence perpetrated by a few deranged individuals.\n\nI, and my caucus colleagues, generally support a ban on the sale and use of so-called bump-stocks and trigger-crank devices.\n\nAnd, in lieu of HB 302 (the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act), we support enactment of House Bill 285, which will create procedures for making sure firearms do not find their way into the hands of dangerous people, while protecting due process and avoiding the creation of barriers to treat those suffering from mental illnesses.\n\nIn contrast to HB 302, HB 285 has bipartisan support and is far more comprehensive in its approach.\n\nThe proposed assault weapon sales ban is a misguided effort that will only serve to further politically polarize Delawareans with no hope of making any real impact on the desired goal of reducing isolated incidents of mass violence.

He opposes abortion, and has voted against Obamacare, marriage equality and immigration reform.\n\nQuestions over whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee would endorse Lipinksi have led to bad feelings and finger pointing\u00a0as the March 20 primary election approaches, Politico reported. House Democrats govern a caucus that is more aligned\u00a0with Marie Newman, Lipinski\u2019s opponent. Yet the Democrats\u00a0are also weighing if it\u2019s wise to distance an incumbent.\n\nNewman and her supporters\u00a0have said\u00a0Lipinski is out of touch with Democrats in his Chicago district, a working-class area on the city\u2019s southwest side. The district and surrounding suburbs are about one-third Hispanic.\n\nWhat has Lipinski said?\nLipinski told Politico he doesn\u2019t believe\u00a0the endorsement will matter much, either way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think what the DCCC does or says means a lot for my race as much as sending a signal to other Democrats who are looking to run,\u201d Lipinski said in an interview.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have to know that they\u2019re going to have the full support [of the DCCC] even if they\u2019re not straight in the party line,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we need candidates who are not straight along the party line to win the districts we need for the majority.\u201d\n\nLipinski is one of three co-chairmen of the so-called Blue Dogs.

The Democrats\u2019 rebuttal refutes much of the Republican memo and adds additional context to the highly controversial FISA warrant obtained on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in Oct. 2016.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially denied the request to release the Democratic memo on the grounds that it contained highly classified information that would first need to be redacted. He claimed Democrats included the sensitive details to make it appear he was only willing to make public the Republican document.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has since worked with officials on redacting information that was deemed too sensitive to make public. The memo is 10 pages and includes a number of redactions.\n\nWhat does the memo say?\nThe memo claims the Republican memorandum was a \u201ctransparent effort to undermine\u201d the FBI and Department of Justice for \u201cno legitimate purpose.\u201d\n\nThe memo also backed the FBI and DOJ for seeking the warrant on Page.\n\n\u201cIn fact, DOJ and the FBI would have been remiss in their duty to protect the country had they not sought a FISA warrant and repeated renewals to conduct temporary surveillance of Carter Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian government,\u201d the memo says, adding the government met the \u201crigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis\u201d for seeking and obtaining the warrant on Page.\n\nThe memo also claims the Christopher Steele \u201canti-Trump\u201d dossier was not used to initiate the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign, nor was it used to re-certify the FISA warrant on Page.\n\nRead the memo for yourself below:\n   Dem Memo by Chris Enloe on Scribd", "link": null, "source": "The Blaze", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
