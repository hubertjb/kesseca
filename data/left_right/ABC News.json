[{"author": "More From", "body": "Nearly a year before Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired senior FBI official Andrew McCabe for what Sessions called a \"lack of candor,\" McCabe oversaw a federal criminal investigation into whether Sessions lacked candor when testifying before Congress about contacts with Russian operatives, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.\n\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have repeatedly accused Sessions of misleading them in congressional testimony and called on federal authorities to investigate, but McCabe's previously-unreported decision to actually put the attorney general in the crosshairs of an FBI probe was an exceptional move.\n\n\nOne source told ABC News that Sessions was not aware of the investigation when he decided to fire McCabe last Friday less than 48 hours before McCabe, a former FBI deputy director, was due to retire from government and obtain a full pension, but an attorney representing Sessions declined to confirm that.\n\n\nLast year, several top Republican and Democratic lawmakers were informed of the probe during a closed-door briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and McCabe, ABC News was told.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then, Sessions had recused himself from the FBI\u2019s probe of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, giving Rosenstein oversight of the growing effort.\n\n\nWithin weeks, Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to take over the investigation and related inquiries, including the Sessions matter.\n\n\nTwo months ago, Sessions was interviewed by Mueller's team, and the federal inquiry related to his candor during his confirmation process has since been shuttered, according to a lawyer representing Sessions.\n\n\n\"The Special Counsel's office has informed me that after interviewing the attorney general and conducting additional investigation, the attorney general is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,\" attorney Chuck Cooper told ABC News on Wednesday.\n\n\nAccording to the sources, McCabe authorized the criminal inquiry after a top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and then-Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., wrote a letter in March 2017 to the FBI urging agents to investigate \"all contacts\" Sessions may have had with Russians, and \"whether any laws were broken in the course of those contacts or in any subsequent discussion of whether they occurred.\"\n\n\nIt's unclear how actively federal authorities pursued the matter in the months before Sessions' interview with Mueller\u2019s investigators. It's also unclear whether the special counsel may still be pursuing other matters related to Sessions and statements he has made to Congress \u2013 or others \u2013 since his confirmation.\n\n\nDuring his confirmation in January 2017, Sessions told the Senate committee that he had not been in contact with anyone connected to the Russian government about the 2016 election. He also said he was \"not aware\" of anyone else affiliated with the Trump campaign communicating with the Russian government ahead of the election.\n\n\nTwo months later, after a Washington Post report disputed what Sessions told Congress, the attorney general acknowledged he had met the Russian ambassador twice during the presidential campaign, but insisted none of those interactions were \"to discuss issues of the campaign.\"\n\n\nSessions \"made no attempt to correct his misleading testimony until The Washington Post revealed that, in fact, he had at least two meetings with the Russian ambassador,\" Leahy and Franken said in a statement at the time. \"We know he would not tolerate dishonesty if he were in our shoes.\"\n\n\nSessions called any suggestions that he misled lawmakers \"false.\"\n\n\nNevertheless, charges subsequently brought by Mueller raised more questions over Sessions' testimony to Congress.\n\n\nIn November, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos admitted to federal authorities that during the campaign he was in frequent contact with Russian operatives about setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Papadopoulos pitched the idea to Sessions and Trump at a meeting of the then-candidate's foreign policy team in March 2016.\n\n\nSessions later told lawmakers he \"always told the truth,\" insisting he didn\u2019t recall the March 2016 meeting when first testifying to Congress. He later remembered the meeting after reading news reports about it, he said.\n\n\n\"We are concerned by Attorney General Sessions' lack of candor to the Committee and his failure thus far to accept responsibility for testimony that could be construed as perjury,\" Leahy and Franken said in their March 2017 letter to then-FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Trump two months later.\n\n\nIt is a federal crime for anyone to knowingly provide false information to Congress \u2013 or to a federal law enforcement agency. No charges have been announced against McCabe, and there\u2019s no indication that the FBI has recommended he be charged.\n\n\nMcCabe was fired Friday after the Justice Department's inspector general concluded that McCabe misled investigators looking into how Justice Department and FBI officials handled matters associated with the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\nIn October 2016, hoping to push back on a series of news reports questioning whether he might be trying to protect Hillary Clinton, McCabe authorized two FBI officials to speak with a reporter about his efforts to boost the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation. When he was questioned later about that decision, McCabe \"lacked candor \u2013 including under oath \u2013 on multiple occasions,\" Sessions said in a statement announcing McCabe's firing.\n\n\n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,\" Sessions said. \"As the [FBI's ethics office] stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand.'\"\n\n\nMcCabe vehemently denies misleading investigators, saying in his own statement that he is \"being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\"\n\n\nFor more than a year, Trump and other Republicans have questioned whether McCabe harbored a political bias when making law enforcement decisions as deputy director. McCabe's critics point to his ties to Democrats, particularly his wife's failed Democratic run for state senate in Virginia nearly three years ago.\n\n\nBut in an interview with ABC News, McCabe insisted politics was \"absolutely not\" a factor in any of the decisions he made, noting he has considered himself a Republican all his life.\n\n\nA representative for McCabe declined to comment for this article.\n\n\nFranken, one of the two senators who pushed the FBI to investigate Sessions, resigned from Congress in December amid several claims of sexual misconduct.\n\n\n--ABC News' Trish Turner and Matt Mosk contributed to this report", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "In a presidential memorandum on a Friday, President Trump banned some transgender service members from serving in the U.S. military, saying transgender individuals \u201cwith a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria\u201d are unable to service except under limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nInterested in LGBT?\nAdd LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAmong other things, the policies set forth by the Secretary of Defense state that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances,\u201d Trump wrote in statement released by the White House.\n\n\nIn a memo to Trump dated Feb. 22, Secretary of Defense James Mattis \u2014 citing a panel of expert\u2019s \u201cprofessional military judgment\u201d and his own professional judgment \u2014 recommended the following three policies which Trump concurred with:\n\n\n1. \u201cTransgender person with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under the following circumstances: (1) if they have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to our accession; (2) Servicemembers diagnosed with gender dysphoria after entering into service may be retained if they do not require a change of gender and remain deployable with an applicable retention standards; and (3) currently serving service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration\u2019s policy took a fact and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.\u201d\n\n\n2. \u201cTransgender person who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.\u201d\n\n\n3. \u201cTransgender person without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other service members, and their biological sex.\u201d\n\n\nTrump tweeted last July that he wanted to ban all transgender service members because the military \"must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.\"\n\n\nSince those tweets, federal courts have rejected portions of the proposed ban.\n\n\nMost notably, beginning Jan. 1, the Pentagon complied with a court order that allowed transgender individuals to join the military if they met strict criteria, including certifications from a medical provider about the status of their health.\n\n\nTwo transgender individuals are already under contract to serve in the U.S. military since that court ruling.\n\n\nThe policy announced by the White House on Friday will be subject to and restrained by existing court orders, unless the Department of Justice has judges dissolve preliminary injunctions.\n\n\n\"We will continue to adhere to federal law,\" Department of Defense spokesperson Maj.

At 17, Tarr quickly has found herself emerging in a new role as a gun control activist \u2014 challenging the status quo against political leaders and the NRA.\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve been using our voices as high schoolers, as people who aren\u2019t afraid to back down, who have nothing to lose, and who are eloquent enough to make sense in what they\u2019re saying,\" Tarr said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the immediate days following the shooting, Tarr traveled to the Florida statehouse in Tallahassee to meet with legislators and discuss stronger gun safety proposals. But coming out of those meetings, she called them \"disappointing\" at the subsequent rally.\n\n\n\nColin  Stoneman Douglas High School student Delaney Tarr speaks at a press conference in the Florida state Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla., Feb. 21, 2018.\n\n\n\n\nClad in oversized glasses, Tarr took the podium \u2014 flanked by fellow students \u2014 to deliver a powerful statement: \"We are not here to be patted on the back.\"\n\n\n\"We know what we want, we want gun reform. We want common sense gun laws,\" she said.\n\n\nTarr defiantly bucked those lawmakers who did not discuss policy, calling out those who \"failed us\" and proclaiming, \"Soon we will be given the ability to vote and we will vote them out.\"\n\n\n\"This is to every lawmaker out there,\" she said. \"We are coming after you.\"\n\n\nIn that moment, Tarr metamorphosed into a gun control advocate unafraid to demand action from Florida\u2019s state legislature and Congress.\n\n\n\n'Moving in the right direction' on gun reform\n\nMany believed the killing of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012 would be a turning point on sensible gun laws, but those hopes were diminished after two major pieces of gun legislation, including one on universal background checks, failed to pass the Senate in 2013.\n\n\nTarr remains adamant that this time is different, that she and her fellow survivors will undo the normalization of gun violence \u2014 setting themselves apart from other gun safety advocates who have survived tragedy by using the power of social media.\n\n\n\"I think this time we have a voice that is pretty unprecedented,\" Tarr said. \"We\u2019ve used Twitter in a way that no other shooting survivor has been able to use ...

People died [Wednesday], people died the 14th and they are going to keep dying unless something actually happens.\"\n\n\nAnd some progress has come since Parkland. Three weeks after the shooting, Florida enacted sweeping gun safety legislation that raises the minimum age to buy firearms to 21 from 18 and also includes a measure to arm some teachers with state training. This is the first gun reform legislation in decades in the same gun-friendly state that passed the controversial \u201cstand your ground\u201d law.\n\n\nRaising the minimum age requirement is one of the policy proposals that has received a lot of attention in the post-Parkland gun debate, according to Dr. Shannon Frattaroli at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.\n\n\nOn March 14, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the first piece of gun legislation since Parkland \u2014 the STOP School Violence Act \u2014 to provide grants for school training and make schools safer. The omnibus spending bill that passed both chambers of Congress and now signed by President Trump contains several gun safety measures including offering states funding in exchange for compliance with the federal NICS background check system, implementing the STOP School Violence Act, and stipulating that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can study gun violence, rebuking the 1996 Dickey Amendment.\n\n\nTarr is aware that under the current Trump administration and makeup of Congress, there are still limits to progress, but she remains hopeful.\n\n\n\"We\u2019re doing a lot and even if it is not necessarily the assault weapons ban yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.

Tarr said that the stakes in 2018 are \"at the point where I am voting for my life.\"\n\n\nAs the most political member of her family, according to her mother, Tarr\u2019s enthusiasm to vote has only amplified and her engagement on the gun issue has become more and more central to her decision-making process as she heads to the ballot box.\n\n\n\"Before it was voting for the country, and voting for myself and voting for the people around me,\" she explains. \"According to our government, we do have the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness but that\u2019s what I\u2019m voting for. I\u2019m voting for my own life and I\u2019m voting for the lives of so many others.\"\n\n\n\"We know that with a shift in the people that are elected comes a shift in policy,\" Tarr said.\n\n\n\nDon Juan Moore/Getty Images\nActivists and students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attend a rally at the Florida State Capitol building to address gun control on Feb. 21, 2018 in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\n\n\n\nTo the detractors who might say that a nearly 18-year old might not be old enough to speak on this issue, or even have an opinion, she said: \"We\u2019re expected to know what college we want to go to, what we want to major in, what we want to do for a living at this age so why can\u2019t we be leaders? Why do we have to wait for permission to take charge?\"\n\n\n\"I\u2019m not here to be told from a politician that it\u2019s okay to give my opinion because I know that it\u2019s ok for me to give my opinion and I\u2019m going to keep giving it,\" she added.\n\n\nHer mother feels the same.\n\n\n\"They can go out there and buy a gun at 18, but they can\u2019t have an opinion,\" Jenn Tarr asked rhetorically.\n\n\nWhile it is still too early to tell how the Parkland shooting could impact elections come November, Kristin Goss, an associate professor of public policy at Duke University, said that an important question this cycle will be \u201cwhether the people that have pro-control feelings feel more strongly and prioritize it more highly in their political behavior including voting.\u201d\n\n\nAs she looks forward to joining the newest class of voters, Tarr wants simply the opportunity to educate voters on gun control so they know exactly what they are voting for, rather than who.\n\n\n\"Ultimately, I\u2019m not here to tell people which way to vote,\" she said. \"I\u2019m here to educate people so they can vote and know what they\u2019re voting for.\"\n\n\nAnd she wants people to understand the power of one person's voice and vote.\n\n\n\"I want every single person to know that they can make a difference and that they don\u2019t have to wait for permission to

permanently dry up under Adani's plan to drain billions of litres of groundwater a year for its Queensland mine, scientific experts say.\n\nThe Doongmabulla Springs Complex, a one-square-kilometre expanse of nationally important wetlands near the proposed site of the Carmichael coal mine, faced serious risk under the latest Adani plan before the Queensland Government, hydrogeologists argued.\n\nThe source of the ancient springs remains in doubt, with two Federal Government groundwater studies conducted since Adani received Commonwealth environmental approval in 2014 unable to identify which of two underground aquifers feeds the threatened ecosystem.\n\nRMIT environmental engineering expert Matthew Currell said Adani's groundwater plan, obtained by the ABC, ignored this \"major scientific uncertainty\" and falsely assumed its proposed mine and the springs tapped different sources.\n\nThe mining company plans to extract an average of up to 4.5 billion litres of water a year.\n\nAccording to the \"groundwater-dependent ecosystem management plan\", which Adani submitted to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science for approval on January 23, the miner plans no further work to pinpoint the source of the springs.\n\nMr Currell said while it was the second groundwater plan put to government since last April, Adani had still not flagged any steps to solve the underground mystery, such as seismic surveys or drilling more deep bores.\n\nHe said he and colleagues, who conducted a 2017 academic study of the Carmichael mine and the springs, believed there was a \"significant probability\" Adani was wrong about the spring's source.\n\nA 2016 federal science department study under the Lake Eyre Basin Springs Assessment Project suggested it was more likely the miner would drain the very aquifer that fed the Doongmabulla Springs, Mr Currell said.\n\n\"Based on the current information that we have, I'd say that's more than a remote possibility.\n\n\"It would certainly lead to much greater impacts than have been predicted to date by Adani and its consultants regarding the impact of the mining on the springs.\"\n\nA spokesman for Queensland Environment and Science said it was \"currently assessing the draft plan\".\n\nAn Adani spokeswoman that a \"thorough and transparent scientific investigation conducted as part of the Carmichael mine's approval process showed mining could be conducted without permanent damage to the Doongmabulla Springs\".\n\n\"Groundwater is safely and appropriately managed at many mines throughout Australia using the checks and balances that will be in place at the Carmichael Mine,\" she said.\n\nQueensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane said the miner went through an \"exhaustive\" process to get its water permits.\n\nThis included input from an independent panel set up by the Gillard government \"and obviously the resources of the Department of Natural Resources and Mines here in Queensland\".\n\n\"I guess there's always going to be one other person who has a different view.\"\n\nMr Macfarlane said the Queensland Government could halt the mine's operations immediately if alarm bells rang.\n\n\"If the impact of taking the associated water from the pit is larger than expected, then the Government has the opportunity to basically stop the progress of the mine,\" he said.\n\n\"That is the safeguard but it's extraordinarily unlikely, bearing in mind that this has been done using the best geological science and advice available to both the Federal Government and the State Government.\"\n\nMr Currell said the information that highlighted the risk to the Doongmabulla Springs was \"on the public record\" and had been \"well known to Adani and the people working for them\".\n\n\"There's been ample opportunity for the mining company to go and collect that data and resolve this issue,\" he said.\n\nMr Currell also said Adani's contingency plans such as piping water in from elsewhere \"may not be feasible\".\n\nWangan and Jagalingou elder Adrian Burragubba, an Adani opponent within a group of traditional owners divided over the mine project, said the Doongmabulla Springs was \"vitally important\" to his people's law, custom and identity.\n\n\"Essentially, it's the dreaming story of the Rainbow Serpent,\" he said.\n\n\"It sustains law, custom, culture and it sustains us as a people and a society. Without our dreaming story, we will cease to exist.\"\n\nMr Currell's co-authors on the 2017 paper for the Journal of Hydrology included environmental lawyers Michael Berkman and Chris McGrath.\n\nMr Berkman became the Queensland Greens' first elected state MP last November.\n\nLast December, Dr McGrath gave legal advice on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation to federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, suggesting Labor could revoke Adani's environmental approval.\n\nThis included running a study on the Doongmabulla Springs to see if new information since the mine's approval gave Labor grounds to scrap the licence.\n\nMr Shorten has since backed away from any suggestion of scrapping Adani's licence.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News Australia", "location": [{"country": "AU", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "A Manhattan Supreme Court judge Tuesday denied President Trump\u2019s attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by a former reality show contestant who accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\n\n\nInterested in Donald Trump?\nAdd Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\n\nThe judge rejected the president\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim brought by Summer Zervos, who appeared on \"The Apprentice\" in 2005.\n\n\nZervos claimed that Trump kissed her twice on the lips in 2007 in his New York office, \"making her 'uncomfortable, nervous and embarrassed,'\" when she sought him out for job opportunities and advice after appearing on the show, according to the documents.

One of them, he says, is misunderstood.\n\n\nThe Soviet-born American businessman, who once billed himself as a \u201csenior advisor to Donald Trump,\u201d has become known for his supporting role in the unfolding drama that is Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Sater is often referred to as the convicted felon and onetime stock scammer who promised to \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on a proposed plan to build \u201cTrump Tower Moscow\u201d in the heat of the presidential campaign.\n\n\n\u201cI know how to play it, and we will get this done,\u201d Sater wrote to Trump attorney and confidant Michael Cohen, his childhood friend, in emails published by The Washington Post and The New York Times. \u201cBuddy, our boy can become president of the USA, and we can engineer it.\u201d\n\n\nThe project was abandoned, but as federal investigators launched a wide-ranging probe of alleged Russsian interference in the 2016 election including possible connections to Trump\u2019s campaign and personal businesses, Sater quickly found himself caught in the dragnet. Now, in an exclusive interview with George Stephanopoulos airing Friday morning on Good Morning America, Sater tells ABC News that there is much, much more to his life story.\n\n\nAnd he\u2019s right.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think if a screenwriter was trying to write this movie that they could make this up,\u201d Sater said.\n\n\n\nMark Von Holden/Getty Images\nDonald Trump, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater attend the Trump Soho Launch Party, on Sept. 19, 2007 in New York City.\n\n\n\n\nSater, 52, says that for the past two decades he has served as a high-level intelligence asset for the DIA, CIA and the FBI. As first reported this week by Buzzfeed News, Sater has helped bust mafia families, capture cybercriminals and pursue top terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden \u2014 earning praise from some of the country\u2019s top law enforcement officials.\n\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he\u2019s been interviewed by the special counsel, but it\u2019s almost certain that Mueller knows his body of work well. He served as FBI Director for much of Sater\u2019s clandestine career.\n\n\nAs questions have swirled about his supposed loyalty to Russia, Sater is speaking out, recasting himself as an unheralded protector of the United States.\n\n\n\u201cI am a patriot,\u201d Sater said. \u201cHaving the opportunity to serve my country and do anything in its defense was a no brainer. It was, \u2018Where do I sign up?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nA SURPRISING COVERT PAST\n\n\nSater says he was recruited as an intelligence asset in perhaps the unlikeliest of places \u2014 the bathroom.\n\n\nHe was a young man living in Russia, where he was born, trying to rebuild a business career derailed by what he calls \u201ca bad, stupid, drunken night in a bar.\u201d He had been convicted of felony assault charges and spent a year in prison following a bloody bar fight in which he stabbed a man in the face with a margarita glass.\n\n\nHe needed money so desperately upon his release, he says, that he started working on what he calls \u201cthe dark side of Wall Street,\u201d a reference to a so-called \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d stock scheme that reportedly defrauded investors of nearly $40 million.\n\n\nHe was at a dinner party in Moscow when he says one of the guests followed him into the bathroom and identified himself as an agent of the U.S. government. He told Sater that he had unwittingly gained access to a group of high-level Russian intelligence operatives who had valuable information about Russian defense technology.\n\n\n\u201cThey seem to like you,\u201d Sater recalls being told. \u201cYou speak Russian.

He says he developed assets in several different countries by cultivating cover as a corrupt businessman offering access to illicit schemes and passed information to U.S. agents tasked with handling a variety of threats to national security.\n\n\n\u201cThey used to come to me with cases that had nothing to do with me and ask for my assistance, in which I would enthusiastically and wholeheartedly dive in and try to help,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHe says he tipped off law enforcement to potential assassination attempts on Secretary of State Colin Powell and President George W. Bush; obtained information and photographs about North Korea\u2019s burgeoning nuclear program; lured Russian cybercriminals hacking the U.S. financial system out of hidings so that they could be unmasked and captured.\n\n\nAnd, he says, he was even tasked with hunting for Osama bin Laden and managed to turn Mullah Omar\u2019s personal secretary into a key source that provided intelligence about al-Qaeda hideouts.\n\n\nThe information he had obtained was so valuable that when his past caught up with him and he finally faced his sentencing in connection with that multimillion-dollar fraud, the judge let him off with a mere $25,000 fine.\n\n\nThat work, he says, continues in some unspecified capacity to this day. He said as recently as last year he was asked for \u201cassistance in making evaluations of various foreign governments [and] foreign individuals.\u201d\n\n\nHe reportedly told this story under oath when he testified recently before the House Intelligence Committee, at which point he said even \u201cthe Democratic aides who were there to question [me] regarding the Russia-Trump investigation stopped, paused and thanks me for my service to my country.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne of the few times in my life that I almost cried,\u201d Sater said.\n\n\nWHAT HE SAYS HE DID - AND DIDN'T - KNOW\n\n\nSater says he made himself valuable to the U.S. government by knowing everything. When it comes to Trump, however, he says he knows next to nothing.\n\n\nHis company, Bayrock Group, began renting office space in Trump Tower. Sater says he introduced himself to Trump in 2000 and began funneling development proposals to Trump\u2019s desk shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\u201cI would bring him deals,\u201d Sater said.\n\n\nSater claims he has helped the Trump Organization secure financing on several major projects, but none has garnered more scrutiny than a failed proposal to build \u201cTrump Tower Moscow\u201d amid the launch of Trump\u2019s controversial campaign for the presidency.\n\n\nIn 2015, Trump signed a non-binding letter of intent, which promised a $4 million initial payment to the Trump Organization, to build the tallest building in the world in Moscow. In emails sent to Cohen published by the Post and the Times, Sater appears to celebrate an apparent merger of Trump\u2019s business and political fortunes.\n\n\nFaced with questions about his boast that he and Cohen could \u201cengineer\u201d a Trump presidency using the deal to court Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s support, Sater pleaded ignorance.\n\n\n\u201cI am not a political person,\u201d Sater said. \u201cI don't understand the implications of the politics or the various strings that get attached to it and how good or bad it may look.\u201d\n\n\nAny perceived alignment of Trump\u2019s business and political interests, he said, was purely coincidental.\n\n\n\u201cI was trying to do a real estate transaction,\u201d Sater told ABC News. \u201cI clearly was not involved in the campaign, nor was I involved in any of the political end, and the hope that a large transaction like that would be built, if that was helpful to his run, that would be great.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he knew certain key member of the Trump campaign, he claimed to have had \u201czero contact\u201d with many of the Trump allies who have fallen under the spotlight. He denied knowing Michael Flynn. And Paul Manafort. And Rick Gates. And George Papadopoulos. And Carter Page.\n\n\nAsked if then-candidate Trump could have softened his stance on Russia because he was simultaneously pursuing a business deal there, Sater demurred.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for the president,\u201d he said.\n\n\nAnd asked if \u2014 given his extensive sources in the both the Russian foreign intelligence services and the Russian criminal underworld \u2014 he knew of the effort underway to influence the U.S. election, he paused before issuing a forceful denial.\n\n\n\u201cI was not aware of what they were doing,\u201d Sater said. \u201cI read about it, just like everyone else, in the newspapers.\u201d\n\n\nSater called Trump\u2019s claim that he couldn\u2019t pick him out of a lineup \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but says Trump has nothing to fear from his testimony to investigators. He is unaware, he said, of any Russian money in any of the Trump projects he worked on and unaware of anyone in Trump\u2019s orbit who may have colluded with foreign powers during the campaign.\n\n\nIf Mueller finds any, Sater recommended stiff penalties.\n\n\n\u201cSend \u2018em to jail,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who colluded with anybody-- with any other country against America -- is guilty of crimes against our country.\u201d\n\n\nBut as for himself, Sater isn\u2019t worried.\n\n\n\u201cEventually, it will become known that I\u2019m guilty of trying to build the world\u2019s tallest building,\u201d Sater said, \u201cand that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\n\nABC News\u2019 Matthew Mosk contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Abc News", "body": "The Trump administration said on Friday that it is proposing the amendment of a regulation \"effectively banning bump stocks\", according to a statement from the Department of Justice.\n\n\nIn the DOJ statement, the agency said it has begun the process to amend federal firearms regulations to clarify that bump stocks should fall under the technical definition of \u201cmachinegun\u201d under federal law.

Trump visited the region twice in the two months prior to Election Day, most recently on the Saturday before the election when he stumped in support of Saccone, telling a raucous crowd that he was an \"extraordinary guy\" and that Republicans \"needed him\" in Washington.\n\n\nSaccone, 60, a four-term state representative, was further boosted by appearances by Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. But Saccone was also derided in Republican circles in the closing weeks of the campaign as a weak candidate with anemic fundraising numbers who was too heavily reliant on the injection of outside money from Republican groups.\n\n\nTrump won the district in 2016 by nearly 20 points, largely on the back of his promises to protect American workers, a pledge that resonated with the region's blue-collar workforce that witnessed firsthand the impact of the fading steel and coal industries. Lamb successfully harnessed the organizing power of a substantial number of the district's union-members, earning the endorsement of the AFL-CIO, a strategy that served the district's previous representative, Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, well in his eight election victories.\n\n\n\n\nMurphy resigned in October in the midst of a sex scandal after a report that he urged the woman with whom he was having an affair to seek an abortion.\n\n\nSaccone, who ran a fairly traditional campaign that touted his experience in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and his experience as an Air Force counterintelligence agent, had fundraising trouble from the start. He ultimately lagged behind Lamb by nearly $3 million.\n\n\nThe only thing preventing perhaps a wider margin of victory for Lamb was the injection of outside money into the race. Republican and GOP-aligned groups poured over $10 million into the race on Saccone's behalf, including over $3.5 million from the National Republican Congressional Committee and $3.4 million from the Paul Ryan-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC.\n\n\nNow comes the next election for both men.\n\n\nPennsylvania candidates are running under a new House map in November, thanks to a court-ordered redistricting plan.\n\n\nLamb filed to run in the fall in the 17th Congressional District, where his hometown of Mt. Lebanon was moved to under the new House map. Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus holds that seat and has $1.2 million in his campaign account.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Saccone filed to run in the 14th Congressional District, which holds a lot of the 18th\u2019s original acreage and is much friendlier to Republicans than the district in which his hometown of Elizabeth was placed. The new 14th Congressional District has no sitting incumbent. Its area mainly consists of the seat that Murphy held before he resigned.\n\n\nBut both men will face something they didn\u2019t in their last election \u2013 primary contests.\n\n\nTwo other Democrats filed to run against Lamb in the 17th Congressional District while one other Republican has filed to challenge Saccone in the 14th Congressional District, according to the Pennsylvania Secretary of State\u2019s website, where candidate petitions were due on Tuesday.\n\n\nBoth men would be favored to win their respective contests in the May 15 primary given the national name recognition they received in last week\u2019s special election.\n\n\nAnd should each man prevail in his respective contests in November, they would serve in Congress together next year.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zoe Daniel", "body": "I've only just met my cousin Shane Baton, and we're at an indoor gun range north of Salt Lake City where I'm learning how to shoot.\n\nShane was born and bred in Utah, and grew up with guns.\n\nI've never even fired one.\n\nWe are worlds apart in our attitudes to gun ownership, but we've come together so I can get some personal insight into American gun culture.\n\nAs an Australian, and a journalist who covers America's frequent mass shootings, it's difficult to comprehend why so many people in the United States are so attached to their weapons.\n\nAmid renewed debate over gun rights after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, my cousin has invited me to spend some time trying to understand.\n\nHe's taking me through the features of bolt action and AR-15 rifles.\n\nSeveral others also take turns at shooting targets with everything from rifles to pistols, including his 18-year-old son Terry, who is using his own AR-15.\n\n\"I think my youngest was eight when he shot it for the first time and it's just very easy for him and for smaller-framed people. It's just a great gun.\"\n\nHaving seen what military-grade weapons can do while covering war and civil unrest in Asia and Africa, I don't even allow my children to have toy guns.\n\nIt's especially intimidating because the AR-15 tends to be the weapon of choice for mass shooters, including the killer at Parkland.\n\nBut even taking into account my reluctance, the AR-15 is easy for me too.\n\nUnlike the bolt action rifle, which is heavy and difficult to fire, the AR-15 feels light, easy to position and aim.\n\nHaving entirely missed the target with the first weapon, I'm able to hit it several times with the AR-15.\n\n\"So what did you think about the difference between the two?\" Shane asks me afterwards.\n\n\"It's just a lot lighter and not as much kick,\" I respond, in reference to the AR-15. \"It seems just easier, more gentle.\"\n\n\"And I think that's what makes it so popular,\" he replies. \"I agree with you. That's what I hoped you'd say.\"\n\nMany hobbyists like the AR-15 because they can build it at home, adding and subtracting features depending on the intended use.\n\nBut this weapon has been at the centre of the debate about gun control in America, with everything from increased age limits to closing background check loopholes to banning assault rifles being thrown up for discussion.\n\nRenewed talk of reform has been met with NRA rhetoric about a liberal conspiracy to take guns away.\n\nShane is not an NRA member, but he does support the organisation.\n\n\"This is not even an assault rifle by definition, this is a sporting rifle.\"\n\nThe definition of an \"assault rifle\" is highly contentious.\n\nGun advocates argue the AR-15 doesn't qualify because it does not have the capacity to switch from semi-automatic to full machine gun mode without a converter.\n\nHowever, the federal government defines \"military style\" weapons as both semi- and full-automatics that are capable of firing multiple rounds.\n\nThe AR-15 is a semi-automatic, civilian version of the military's M16.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, there are between 270 million and 310 million guns in America, owned by just over a third of the population.\n\nSome 46 per cent of adults in Utah own a gun, which is well above the US average.\n\nMost cite self-defence and sport as reasons to have a weapon and roughly 60 per cent oppose a ban on assault rifles.\n\n\"What I'm worried about is that, ultimately, kneejerk reactions that don't do anything,\" says Shane.\n\nMany Americans fear a 'slippery slope' that could result from increased gun control, gradually eroding their independence and sense of freedom.\n\nThey want existing laws enforced rather than new ones being introduced.\n\n\"So let's say we give this a try and we ban this. Fine, let's ban it,\" he says.\n\n\"What happens when it doesn't affect it and doesn't do anything? Do I get it back? No, I don't.\n\n\"Then they move on to ban something else. And when that doesn't work, do I get that back? No! Then they move on to ban something else.\"\n\nShane describes a childhood of hunting and camping in the wild, a way of life that Americans outside the large cities are determined to defend.\n\nBeing able to own whichever gun they choose is part of that.\n\nThere's also a desire for self-defence that's particular to America, where some don't believe that law enforcement will be able to provide timely help.\n\nThey raise concerns that banning semi-automatics would lead to criminals having powerful weapons disadvantaging civilians who would be left unable to defend their homes and families.\n\nSome also have a deeply ingrained desire to be able to protect themselves and their state from the federal government, if needed.\n\nExperiencing the ease of shooting an AR-15 first hand, you can easily grasp why many Americans choose it for sport and self-defence.\n\nIt's also clear to see why it's the weapon of choice for the mass shooter and in that sense it's a little chilling.\n\n\"It kills people in the wrong hands,\" says Shane.\n\n\"It kills people. So, are we going to get rid of guns all together? No. Not in America.\n\nAccording to Shane and many Americans, the deep social issues affecting the country, including gaps in parenting and lack of male role models, are the real issue.\n\n\"It's not the firearm, it's the culture,\" he says.\n\nBut does that justify resisting any reform that could make a difference when children are being killed at school?\n\nTo many Australians, the answer may seem obvious.

I'm writing that out myself. I don't care if Congress does it or not, I'm writing it out myself. You put it into the machine gun category, which is what it is. It becomes essentially a machine gun and nobody's going to be able, it's going to be very hard to get them, so we're writing out bump stocks,\" he said.\n\n\nTrump signed a memorandum last week directing the Justice Department to draft a regulation to ban bump stocks and other devices that can be used to transform a rifle into a machine gun shortly after a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida that killed 17 people and injured 14 others earlier this month. Authorities do not believe that gunman used a bump stock.\n\n\nHowever, the gunman in the Las Vegas shooting in October was found to have used bump stocks to increase the number of bullets he was able to fire.\n\n\nMachine guns and accessories like mufflers and silencers are regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. That law, which was updated in 1968, defines machine guns as any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot more than one shot without reloading and any part or combination of parts intended \"for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun.\"\n\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if the Justice Department or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has the authority to ban these devices.\n\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said after Trump announced the directive that the ATF told Congress there would have to be a legislative solution.\n\n\nFeinstein introduced a bill to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting but it did not move forward in  president repeated a comment he made last week that he wants to talk about reopening mental health institutions. He said that \"in the old days\" it was easier to commit people who acted like \"a boiler ready to explode.\" He also said law enforcement should be able to take someone's guns if they have a mental health issue.\n\n\nTrump said last week he wants to reopen mental health institutions as part of the solution to prevent future mass shootings, saying the shooter from Parkland was a \"sicko\" and needed help in a meeting with state and local officials.\n\n\nCurrent federal regulations say that anyone who has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity cannot legally possess a firearm. Neither of these were the case with the Parkland shooter.\n\n\nHe also said that the National Rifle Association \"is on our side\" in taking action to prevent future mass shootings but that they might have to go up against them. The NRA has strongly opposed proposals to raise the age to legally buy an assault rifle from 18 to 21 that the president has supported.\n\n\nThe president is scheduled to go to Capitol Hill this week and meet with Republican members of Congress, where they are expected to likely discuss what, if any, legislation to reform gun laws he would support.\n\n\nSeveral governors at the meeting also weighed in on solutions the president has brought up in the two weeks since the shooting.\n\n\nRepublican Florida Gov. Rick Scott said the state is going to budget $500 million to have a law enforcement presence at every school in the state and that there will be mental health counselors in every school. He also said the state will support allowing family members, law enforcement officer or mental health professionals to petition a court for restraining orders to take guns away from people who are struggling with mental illness or make violent threats.\n\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said similar programs for protective orders in his state have been very effective and that the president should consider it on a national level.\n\n\nInslee also criticized the president's support for the idea of arming some \"gun adept\" teachers as a deterrent for possible school shooters. Inslee said teachers don't want to carry guns and that lawmakers should listen to educators on this issue.\n\n\n\"I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here a little more listening and let's just take that off the table and move forward,\" Inslee told the president.\n\n\nTrump's comments today echoed statements he made last week when he said he wants to reopen mental health institutions as part of the solution to prevent future mass shootings, saying the shooter from Parkland was a \"sicko\" and needed help.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Allyson Horn", "body": "Online shoppers could be slugged up to $7 more per package when buying products from overseas, under a Federal Government proposal.\n\nThe Home Affairs Department is considering whether every package imported into Australia should be hit with a new levy, to help cover the costs of screening items at the border.\n\nThe tax already applies for packages worth more than $1,000, but the Government's plan would see shoppers have to shell out the extra charge for all overseas purchases.\n\nThe ABC understands a tax of between $2 and $7 has been considered.\n\nNearly 40 million of the \"low import\" parcels arrived in Australia last financial year \u2014 roughly two per person.\n\nA discussion paper on the proposed tax argued the levy was needed to recover costs associated with biosecurity, cargo and trade border activities.\n\n\"Existing cost recovery arrangements are no longer sustainable and will not support Australia's future trading environment,\" it stated.\n\nLiberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm said the tax was unnecessary.\n\n\"This Government seems to have an endless capacity to come up with new taxes and increase existing taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"We're already extremely highly taxed and I despair at the idea that we'll ever end up with any of our own money in our own pockets.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News Australia", "location": [{"country": "AU", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "President Trump\u2019s one-time campaign aide Richard Gates is expected to plead guilty in the special counsel\u2019s criminal case against him, setting up the potential for Gates to become the latest well-informed Trump insider to assist in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential contest, according to sources close to the matter.\n\n\nThe potential for a guilty plea could dramatically change the dynamics in the investigation, just one day after special counsel Robert Mueller added a raft of new financial and tax charges to the criminal case against Gates and his longtime colleague, Paul Manafort.\n\n\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images FILE\nDonald Trump, flanked by campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka, checks the podium in preparation for accepting the GOP nomination to be President at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 20, 2016. \n\n\n\n\nGates has for weeks been vacillating between fighting the charges and pleading guilty, and remained undecided through much of this week, according to the sources.

damning review of the tax office by one of its directors has caused angst and discomfort among senior management, with some preferring it never be made public.\n\nThe yet-to-be published review warns financial penalties for tax evaders are so low that some people could be better off taking the risk of being caught.\n\nBut the ATO has dismissed the findings of the report, which was written by its own director of reform within the tax evasion and crime division.\n\nChris Leech wrote the paper while on secondment with the Australian National University's Tax and Transfer Policy Institute and insists it does not reflect the ATO's official opinion.\n\nWhen showed a draft, senior tax office executives were so worried they considered asking Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer to dodge questions if she was ever asked about it.\n\n\"The average tax evader may be financially better off even after they're caught and penalised,\" Mr Leech wrote in a presentation summarising his report.\n\n\"If you just look at it from a purely rational economic view \u2026 it may suggest to some people that you are still better off taking the risk and running the gauntlet of being penalised.\"\n\nMr Leech's paper was scheduled for publication late last year, but freedom of information documents reveal pushback from the ATO was partly to blame for its delayed release.\n\nThe report calls for tax evaders to be publicly named and shamed and for financial penalties to be increased.\n\n\"A very worrying statistic is that just over three quarters of those companies that receive these penalties made zero payment,\" Mr Leech's presentation said.\n\n\"Obviously, penalising a company and collecting a penalty is very difficult because it is so difficult for the controllers to wind up the company, and they would have already stripped the assets for it.\n\n\"But my worry here is that the ATO may be hesitating to devote many resources to auditing these companies.\"\n\nIn his pitch to senior executives, Mr Leech said publishing his report would expose some weaknesses in the tax penalty regime but also gave them a chance to be open with the public.\n\n\"The ATO would be 'on the front foot' and acknowledging the tax penalty isn't working as intended for the very small group of taxpayers who intentionally disregard the system,\" he said.\n\nBecause the report was written while Mr Leech was on secondment, the ATO insists it does not reflect Government policy or discussions within the office.\n\n\"They should not be interpreted as representing any administrative or policy considerations in this area,\" an ATO spokesman said.\n\nEmails seen by the ABC show how senior ATO figures planned mitigation strategies for the report's release, including what to do if it was even presented to Ms O'Dwyer.\n\n\"Maybe she could just say something like, 'The paper raises issues which are also being considered by the taskforce', which is slightly dodging the question, but in the ballpark,\" ATO assistant commissioner Julia Neville said in an email.\n\nMs O'Dwyer's office told the ABC the minister was never given the draft paper.\n\nOther senior executives, including Deputy Commissioner Robert Ravanello said Mr Leech's conclusions were based on incorrect data.\n\n\"Certainly helps provide further justification as to why publication should not be supported,\" one senior staffer said in reply.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Will Day noted the concern among management and said: \"We are happy with the thinking at the moment not to publish.\"\n\n\"This is not the work of the ATO and as a general rule, without properly considering the data used and the conclusions made, I am not comfortable endorsing or approving this as such,\" chief service delivery officer Melinda Stewart said.\n\nMr Leech did admit there were some weaknesses in his report but has strongly defended his final conclusions.\n\n\"My and others'

He joined the FBI in 1996, spending his first 10 years at the FBI\u2019s New York City Field Office. He came to Washington in 2006 and never left, working counterterrorism and national security cases before becoming the head of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office in 2014. Ultimately, in February 2016, he became deputy director of the FBI, working alongside Comey.\n\n\nDeputy director is \u201can oversight\u201d and \u201cstrategic planning role,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI do not tell [senior FBI agents] how to work their case.

His family has been \u201cincredibly supportive\u201d of him, he said.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you that the national security world is a series of unbelievably long days, weekends, missed birthdays, cancelled vacations \u2013 and through everything they have just been totally behind it, because they understand the importance of the work and that you don\u2019t protect America on 9-to-5 schedule,\u201d McCabe said.\n\n\nBut that support is \u201cone of the reasons why it\u2019s been so hard to have to watch them have to go through what we\u2019ve gone through in the last year,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\u201cA REPUBLICAN MY ENTIRE LIFE\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have considered myself to be a Republican my entire life,\u201d albeit \u201ca moderate Republican,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI\u2019ve voted for every Republican candidate for president in every election, except the 2016 one, in which I did not vote. And I chose not to vote because of the political nature of the work that we were engaged in.\u201d\n\n\nMeanwhile, his wife, a pediatrician at a Virginia hospital, was never much of a political person, according to McCabe.\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s voted for Democrats [and] Republicans,\u201d and until a few years ago she would have described herself as \u201can independent and not particularly heavily aligned with either party,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThat changed in February 2015, when she \u201cwas contacted out of the blue by the chief of staff for then-Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and asked if she would be interested in running for state senate,\u201d McCabe said.\n\n\nMcCabe insists he and his wife didn\u2019t know Northam or then-governor Terry McAuliffe, both Democrats.\n\n\nJill McCabe\u2019s name was floated by Northam\u2019s chief of staff as a possible candidate because Medicaid expansion in Virginia had become a \u201cprimary policy initiative\u201d for McAuliffe\u2019s administration. A year earlier, when McAuliffe visited her hospital, Jill McCabe was quoted in a Washington Post article voicing support for the Medicaid expansion efforts, according to McCabe.\n\n\n\u201cThey looked up the article, found Jill\u2019s name and called her out of the blue,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHis wife ultimately decided to run, and McCabe was \u201cvery involved\u201d in that decision, he said.\n\n\n\u201cShe was motivated by health issues,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s in the trenches \u2026 in the battle of providing health care coverage to the entire population, not just the well-insured people of Loudon County [Virginia], but also the disadvantaged side of that population.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions picks up his remarks as Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe looks on during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, July 13, 2017.\n\n\n\n\nDue to his wife\u2019s campaign, McCabe knew he \u201cwould have to take some proactive steps in my role as the [Assistant Director in Charge] of the Washington Field Office to stay out of particular investigative matters,\u201d and after consulting with ethics attorneys at FBI headquarters, counsel at the Washington Field Office and others they \u201ccame up with a protocol where I would essentially be removed from all Virginia state political corruption matters,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\u201cI had no role in Jill\u2019s campaign,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to any events. I didn\u2019t raise money. I didn\u2019t encourage people to vote \u2013 just stayed out of it completely, and she handled it with her staff.\u201d\n\n\nJill McCabe lost her campaign for state senate in November 2015, three months before McCabe became deputy director.\n\n\n\u201cTHIS IS NOT A LEAK\u201d\n\n\nIn October 2016, the Wall Street Journal published a story questioning whether Jill McCabe\u2019s ties to Democrats, particularly McAuliffe, a longtime friend to Hillary Clinton, meant McCabe himself was unfit to oversee the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state.\n\n\nDays later, the Wall Street Journal began working on a follow-up story, with the newspaper\u2019s reporter claiming \u201che was hearing from people within the FBI that I had tried to slow down or stop our investigative efforts on the Clinton Foundation case, which \u2026 was absolutely inaccurate,\u201d McCabe recalled.\n\n\n\u201cI had not slowed our efforts, but it was part of the same theme: \u2018I was maybe politically motivated, and worse, that the FBI was being subjected to influence,\u2019\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI just thought that was incredibly damaging to the FBI. \u2026 I cannot have my people believing some lie, that the leadership of the FBI is sandbagging cases at the political urging of the DOJ. That would be corrosive to our independence and our credibility.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to McCabe, the truth was the opposite of what the reporter was suggesting: The Justice Department was trying to slow the Clinton Foundation investigation, and he was trying to keep pushing it ahead.\n\n\nMcCabe wanted to get the reporter \u201coff this narrative,\u201d so he \u201cauthorized\u201d a top FBI spokesman and FBI attorney to provide the reporter with \u201cthe content of a conversation that I had had with [a senior official] from the Department of Justice,\u201d McCabe recalled.\n\n\n\u201cThe Department was not impressed with the case, and they didn\u2019t believe it should be going forward,\u201d McCabe said.\n\n\n\u201cThe decision to share information with the media is absolutely within my authority as deputy director,\u201d McCabe added. \u201cI am one of three people in the FBI who has the independent authority to make that decision. People could disagree about the decisions I made ... but the fact is this is not a leak.\u201d\n\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility felt differently, according to Sessions.\n\n\nBoth \"concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media,\" Sessions said in a statement.\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s stories in late 2016 prompted Republicans to call for McCabe to recuse himself from the Clinton email investigation. At the time, Trump began calling out McCabe on the campaign trail.\n\n\nInternally at the FBI, some senior officials agreed that McCabe should be walled off from the Clinton-related probe, and days before Election Day 2016 he recused himself.\n\n\nRepublicans then began calling for the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general \u2013 or IG \u2013 to investigate why McCabe didn\u2019t recuse himself earlier. And in January 2017, the inspector general\u2019s office announced it had launched an investigation into, among other things, \u201callegations that the FBI Deputy Director should have been recused from participating in certain investigative matters.\u201d\n\n\nMCCABE MISLEADS INVESTIGATORS?\n\n\n\u201cIn the course of the IG\u2019s investigation and a kind of related Inspection Division investigation, I was asked about ... my decision to share information\u201d with the Wall Street Journal, McCabe told ABC News.\n\n\nAccording to Sessions, McCabe \"lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions.\"\n\n\n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,\" Sessions said in his statement. In recommending that McCabe be fired, the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility noted that \"all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\" Sessions added.\n\n\nBecause the inspector general\u2019s report has not been released publicly yet, it\u2019s still unclear exactly why investigators believe McCabe was not forthcoming, or if McCabe is criticized for other actions.\n\n\nMcCabe, however, insisted he answered investigators\u2019 questions \u201cto the best of my ability, best recollection I had at those times.\u201d He noted that he was questioned in the midst of a \u201cchaotic time\u201d for him, in the wake of Comey\u2019s firing and his temporarily taking an agency \u201creeling from the loss of their director.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to McCabe, after he was questioned by investigators, he realized he needed to clarify some of his responses, so he \u201cproactively reached out to those people to ensure that they clearly understood what my position was.\" He would not offer any further details.\n\n\n\u201cI have tried at every juncture to be as accurate and of course truthful in all of my encounters with whoever was interested in asking questions about that article or anything else,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThe idea of being condemned or miscast in any way contrary to that is just unbelievably disappointing and really offensive to me.\u201d\n\n\nMcCabe insisted to ABC News that the media disclosures he authorized did not constitute \u201ca leak.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a clandestine contact with a reporter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was done by my media representative and my counselor. It took place over the course of several days. ... So to be kind of retrospectively misrepresented as sort of a clandestine secretive leak is sort of just \u2013 it\u2019s not the case and it\u2019s just an unfair portrayal.\u201d\n\n\nAsked whether he believes the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, with its report targeting him, is complicit in what he described as the \u201congoing assault\u201d on the FBI, McCabe simply answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat I do know is that the IG has been subjected to intense pressure by the [Republican] chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d McCabe added. \u201cI do know that the IG is under pressure from the President, who tweeted ... demanding results in these investigations.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAfter 21 years at what I still believe is the greatest organization on earth, having had to go through this gauntlet of public criticism and ridicule by none other than the President of the United States has been unbelievably trying.

Trump spent the weekend at his estate in South Florida, only an hour's drive from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where 17 people were fatally shot last week. His only mentions of the massacre came in tweets Saturday contending that the FBI was too focused on the Russia investigation to respond to warnings about the alleged shooter and mocking Democrats for failing to pass gun control.\n\n\"You're the president. You're supposed to bring this nation together, not divide us,\" said David Hogg, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida, speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"How dare you,\" he added.\n\nAfter more than a day of criticism from the students, the White House said the president would hold a \"listening session\" with unspecified students Wednesday and meet Thursday with state and local security officials.\n\nFlorida politicians, meanwhile, scrambled to produce legislation in response to the Feb. 14 attack that killed 17 people.

He stayed there until 10th grade, when he was transferred to Stoneman Douglas. Last year, Cruz was expelled.\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2016, an investigator from the Florida Department of Children and Families visited Cruz and his mother, Lynda Cruz, after he posted video on Snapchat showing him cutting himself. The report showed that Cruz had written a racial epithet against African-Americans and a Nazi symbol on his book bag, which his mother had forced him to erase. The investigator said Cruz was suffering from depression and on medication and had told Lynda Cruz he planned to buy a gun, but she couldn't determine why.\n\nA school counselor told the investigator that Lynda Cruz had always tried to help her son and followed through on his therapy and medication, but the counselor was concerned about the youth's desire to buy a gun.\n\nA crisis counselor told the DCF investigator he had visited the school and that he did not believe Cruz was a danger to himself or others. The case was closed, with the investigator concluding that Cruz was receiving help from his mother and counselors, and \"no other referrals or services were needed.\"\n\nAfter Lynda Cruz died in November, Cruz moved into the home of a teenage friend. The friend's parents told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper they had no idea the extent of Cruz's issues.\n\n\"We had this monster living under our roof and we didn't know,\" Kimberly Snead told the newspaper in an interview published Sunday. \"We didn't see this side of him.\"\n\nJames Snead added: \"Everything everybody seems to know, we didn't know. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThe teen kept the AR-15 he allegedly used in the massacre locked in a gun safe with a few other firearms. James Snead thought he had the only key to the cabinet but says Cruz must have had another key.

It was unclear late Sunday how effective that had been.\n\n\nNavalny and other opposition leaders, though, mobilized tens of thousands of volunteers as election monitors. At his headquarters in Moscow, about 30 volunteers fielded calls in from monitors, while an election live-broadcast ran on Navalny\u2019s popular YouTube channel.\n\n\nNavalny\u2019s staff said they had approximately 33,000 registered monitors spread across Russia.\n\n\nEven before counting finished it was clear that amid the voting push, Putin\u2019s tally was the largest he has ever received.

It moved election day to the anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, an event that hugely boosted Putin\u2019s popularity.

Navalny refused, saying she had been used by Putin.\n\n\n\u201cI will judge you by your actions,\u201d he told Sobchak on air. \u201cAnd your actions are disgusting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are his instrument, nothing more,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThe short campaign in some ways has been a sideshow for Putin, who campaigned little, appearing before large election crowds only twice.\n\n\nIn any case, with state TV most days showing Putin solving problems in the country, Russia in some ways lives in permanent campaign mode.\n\n\nWith so much effort put into producing such a decisive win ahead of the election, some in Moscow have spoken of it as a declaration of Putin as president for life.\n\n\nAfter his win he was asked would he still be in power in 2030.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s count.

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had given Russia until midnight Tuesday to explain how the nerve agent, known as a \"Novichok,\" came to be used in the small town of Salisbury, or face retribution.\n\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Alexey Navalny, an anti-corruption activist seen as Putin's most-effective critic, said that if it's proved conclusively that the Kremlin was behind the poisoning, the British government should eschew \"symbolic gestures\" such as a soccer World Cup boycott or banning Russian propaganda stations, and instead target wealthy Putin allies in the U.K.\n\n\n\nEvgeny Feldman/AP\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, center, sits at the Russia's Central Election commission in Moscow, Dec. 25, 2017.\n\n\n\n\"One scenario, as it seems to me, is Putin's comfortable scenario,\" Navalny said at the Moscow office of his organization, the Anti-Corruption Foundation. That would mean \"quite standard responses,\" Navalny said, such as diplomatic punishments or symbolic sanctions, that he said Putin expects.\n\n\n\"There is a second option,\" he added, \"that would really be painful for Putin and his corrupt circle that consists of applying targeted sanctions on those oligarchs and state officials whose families have been based for a very long time in Great  officials have suggested they're looking at a broad range of retaliatory actions, including diplomatic expulsions, fresh economic sanctions and cyberattacks, and the government has also made clear that it's considering sanctions against individual Putin allies, by imposing visa bans and possibly freezing assets.\n\n\nSergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said it will not respond to May's midnight ultimatum until the U.K. provides details of the nerve agent used. Officials in Moscow, however, have have lined up to reject the British allegations as inventions meant to smear Russia, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman calling them \"fairy tales.\"\n\n\nWith her ultimatum deadline seeming to have passed without Russia acquiescing, May is under pressure to respond toughly amid criticism the U.K. failed to act strongly enough over a previous Russian-linked poisoning, that of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian intelligence officer turned dissident who was murdered with radioactive substance in London in 2006. With Russia seen as mounting an increasingly aggressive challenge to Western countries, there are calls for the U.K. to take a harder line to make the Kremlin take notice.\n\n\nIrking the Kremlin is an area Navalny has experience in. A former lawyer, he came to prominence in Russia by carrying out investigations revealing the alleged illegal wealth of senior officials and members of Putin's circle. Recently, he's built a grassroots movement with tens of thousands of followers, demanding fair elections and an end to official corruption. Regularly jailed for holding rallies against the Kremlin, he was barred from running for president against Putin in elections due to take place this month over a fraud conviction he says is trumped up.\n\n\nNavalny has argued that the Kremlin's pressure points are the oligarchs around it, the few dozen businessmen and friends of Putin who made immense fortunes during his rule, often benefiting from state contracts. The Kremlin will not, Navalny said, be phased by symbolic responses, having got used to them after years of escalating confrontation with Western countries. In particular, he said he is opposed to the proposal to ban RT, the Kremlin-funded broadcaster formerly known as \"Russia Today\" that has been accused of acting as a propaganda outlet. Putin would be untroubled by such a ban, given it's relatively little watched, and it would allow the Kremlin to say censorship exists in Western countries.\n\n\nSuch steps, Navalny, said just allowed Putin to \"use them in his propaganda.\"\n\n\nInstead, he added, the U.K. should take advantage of the concentration of Putin allies' wealth in London. The UK has become a hub for rich Russians under Putin, with large numbers of the country's elite owning property there and educating their children in English schools.\n\n\nNavalny said UK authorities should impose asset freezes and strip visas from oligarchs close to the Kremlin who were enjoying lives in England, saying he could name 20 figures to start with.\n\n\n\"It will lead to the creation of an anti-Putin coalition, one in the shadows for now, inside the Putin establishment,\" Navalny said. \"Up to now, they have seen that Putin solves problems, Putin is able to do whatever he wants \u2014- to shoot down airplanes, to start wars, to lie in every interview, in every conversation with world leaders -- but in a remarkable way he gets away with everything.\"\n\n\n\"And here will be the first example,\" Navalny added, \"if it will all be proved, where it leads to some kind of consequences.\"\n\n\nNavalny told U.K. authorities they should immediately target Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov.\n\n\nUsmanov, one of Russia's richest men, is solidly invested in Britain, where he owns the London soccer club Arsenal FC. The Kremlin has reportedly tapped him when in need of cash for projects; Usmanov even once paying the wages of the coach of Russia's national soccer team.\n\n\nShuvalov, is an influential first deputy prime minister. Navalny has previously alleged that he owns an $18 million, 5,380-square-foot penthouse in central London, despite having an annual government salary of only around $17,000.\n\n\nShuvalov has previously said his income declarations are in order and his earnings are entirely legal. Usmanov has sued Navalny over allegations of being part of a bribery scheme involving Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. Last year he released a video in which he told Navalny, \"I spit on you.\"\n\n\nEnthusiasm for targeting assets belonging to Kremlin-linked figures in London has been expressed in British official circles since Skripal\u2019s poisoning. In particular, there have been calls for Britain to introduce a so-called Magnitsky Act, legislation similar to that already in the U.S. that imposes visa bans and asset freezes on Russians implicated in human-rights abuses.\n\n\nThe Act is named after Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer murdered after he uncovered a $230 million tax fraud involving Russian officials. The U.K. government has also suggested it's considering applying recently introduced legislation allowing for freezes of wealth suspected to be corrupt.\n\n\nNavalny, however, said he feared the U.K. \"unfortunately\" was likely to opt for \"the route of symbolic gestures\" in the latest clash. A large number of individuals identified as close to Putin are already under European Union and U.S. Treasury sanctions imposed over Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. But Navalny argued that these have been relatively toothless, claiming that most of Putin's key allies still own property in Europe and the U.S.\n\n\n\u201cWhile about these sanctions there are a lot of conversations,\" Navalny said, \"they unfortunately have no practical influence on what is happening.\"", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "Three package bombings that killed two people and injured two others, all of them African-American or Hispanic, in Austin, Texas, may have been motivated by hate, authorities said.\n\n\nKilled were a 17-year-old boy, an orchestral musician and essay contest winner, and a 39-year-old father, both of them African-American.

New York, the nation\u2019s fourth-most populous state with a population of 19.4 million reported 595 such crimes.\n\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong when Texas, as a state, has fewer hate crimes than some of the major cities in the U.S.,\u201d Levin said.\n\n\nTexas had a rate of 0.7 hate crimes reported for every 100,000 residents, far lower than the rate of 3.1 for every 100,000 residents in New York and 2.4 for every 100,000 in California, using 2017 Census population figures.\n\n\n\nJon Herskovitz/Reuters\nLaw enforcement personnel including FBI agents are seen near a home where a parcel bomb exploded in Austin, Texas, March 13, 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just Texas.\n\nLevin said law enforcement in Texas could do more to ensure officers recognize and investigate potential hate crimes.\n\n\nIndeed, Texas does not mandate training for police officers on how to investigate potential hate crimes. Gretchen Gribsby with the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement confirmed.\n\n\nIn addition, Texas\u2019 geography with its high numbers of people living in rural areas may partially explain why there are relatively few reports of hate crimes in the state, said Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\n\u201cLess densely populated areas tend to report fewer hate crimes,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\nBut he said Texas isn't alone in what he said is a general underreporting of such crimes.\n\n\n\u201dHate crimes are wildly underreported, I mean, horrifically underreported,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\nOne reason may be that victims of hate crimes may be reluctant to report what happened, he said.\n\n\n\u201cHate crimes likely aren\u2019t being reported because victims fear law enforcement may not believe them or they may be embarrassed and not report to police at all for fear of putting a target on their home,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\n\nOf the hate crimes reported in Texas, a small number go to court\n\nEven among the relatively small number of incidents reported to police as hate crimes in Texas, a yet smaller number results in cases brought to court.\n\n\nSince 2001, when Texas enacted its current hate-crime law, only in 26 instances was a hate-crime finding requested of the courts, according to the Texas Office of Court Administration.\n\n\nAnd in only 23 of those instances did a judge or jury confirm them as hate crimes, according to Megan LaVoie of the Texas Office of Court Administration said.\n\n\nSo, while roughly 200 hate crimes are reported by Texas law enforcement agencies each year, over a 17-year period only 23 were confirmed by the courts as alleged hate crimes.\n\n\nExperts believe that may be because the state's hate-crime law -- called the Byrd Statute after James Byrd Jr., an African-American man who was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck by white supremacists in 1998 -- has strict limits.\n\n\nThe law, for example, doesn't allow for perpetrators to be found guilty of a hate crime on top of any other crime they committed. It also only allows judges or juries to impose harsher sentences for the hate crime if a prosecutor can prove a suspect was motivated by hate.\n\n\nProving motivation can be nearly impossible, Lenz said.\n\n\n\u201cKnowing the motivation of an assailant and being able to convince a jury that that motivation was the primary motivation in committing that crime is a pretty high hurdle for prosecutors,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\nA criminal law professor in Texas agreed.\n\n\n\nRicardo B. Brazziell/Austin American-Statesman via AP\nAuthorities work on the scene of an explosion in Austin, March 12, 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to prove some crimes beyond a reasonable doubt without adding another element like motive,\u201d said Brian Serr, professor of criminal law and procedure at Baylor University. \u201cProsecutors have to decide, \u2018Should I take on trying to prove this suspect committed a hate crime when I\u2019m already putting a bad guy in jail for the actual crime committed?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nExperts interviewed by ABC News also said few hate crimes may be tried in court simply because prosecutors may not want to try to prove hate was the suspect\u2019s motive when it is easier to show simply that the suspect is guilty of the crime committed, as Lenz said.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean perpetrators of hate crimes are walking free in Texas, Serr said.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a hate criminal is going to get off the hook if they aren\u2019t prosecuted for a hate crime,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the punishment he deserves without prosecutors having to go thru the process of proving motive.\u201d\n\n\n\nExploding packages\n\nThe first package explosion occurred March 2, killing Anthony Stephan House, a 39-year-old father. Then two other packages blew up on March 12, one of them killing 17-year old Draylen Mason, a talented bass player who was set to enroll at the Butler School of Music at the University of Texas for the next year.\n\n\nInvestigators believe that the trio of bombs displayed a level of sophistication, indicating that the bomb-maker or bomb-makers were highly skilled.\n\n\nThe devices were set up to be detonated by motion like shaking or jostling, which is why they exploded when they were picked up. They also had some sort of safety switch, which enabled the bomber to move the devices without blowing themselves up, the sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "Rep.

The subpoena in that case calls on Fusion GPS to turn over information about the controversial political research project as part of a defamation suit. Fusion GPS has objected.\n\n\nThe defamation case involving the legal request is being argued in a Miami federal court, but because Fusion GPS\u2019 offices are based in Washington, a D.C. federal judge was assigned to oversee the dispute over the subpoena. In January, Fusion GPS first sought to have the subpoena reassigned to a different judge because McFadden served as a \u201cvolunteer\u201d adviser on the Trump presidential transition team.\n\n\nThe research firm also argued that, during McFadden\u2019s prior employment as an attorney at the multinational law firm Baker  McKenzie \u2013 where he worked until January 2017 \u2013 he represented a company controlled by Russian billionaire business magnate Mikhail Fridman of the investment firm, Alfa Group.

The Russian leader's popularity remains high despite his suppression of dissent and reproach from the West over Russia's increasingly aggressive stance in world affairs and alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\nPutin's main challenges in the vote were to obtain a huge margin of victory in order to claim an indisputable mandate. The Central Elections Commission said Putin had won about 72 percent of the vote, based on a count of 22 percent of the country's precincts.\n\n\nRussian authorities had sought to ensure a large turnout to bolster the image that Putin's so-called \"managed democracy\" is robust and offers Russians true choices.\n\n\nHe faced seven minor candidates on the ballot. Putin's most vehement and visible foe, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, was rejected as a candidate because he was convicted of fraud in a case widely regarded as politically motivated. Navalny and his supporters had called for an election boycott but the extent of its success could not immediately be gauged.\n\n\nThe election came amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West, with reports that Moscow was behind the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Britain and that its internet trolls had mounted an extensive campaign to undermine the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Britain and Russia last week announced diplomat expulsions over the spy case and the United States issued new sanctions.\n\n\nRussian officials denounced both cases as efforts to interfere in the Russian election. But the disputes likely worked in Putin's favor, reinforcing the official contention that the West is infected with \"Russophobia\" and is determined to undermine Putin and Russian cultural values.\n\n\nPutin has come to embody Russia's exceptionalism, the sense of the state and culture as an extraordinary entity that is nonetheless under constant attack from outside.\n\n\nThe election took place on the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, one of the most dramatic manifestations of Putin's drive to reassert Russia's power.\n\n\nCrimea and Russia's subsequent support of separatists in eastern Ukraine led to an array of US and European sanctions that, along with falling oil prices, damaged the Russian economy and slashed the ruble's value by half. But Putin's popularity remained strong, apparently buttressed by nationalist pride.\n\n\nIn his next six years in office, Putin is likely to assert Russia's power abroad even more strongly. Just weeks before the election, he announced that Russia has developed advanced nuclear weapons capable of evading missile defenses. The military campaign in Syria is clearly aimed at strengthening Russia's foothold in the Middle East and Russia eagerly eyes possible reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula as a lucrative economic opportunity.\n\n\nAt home, he will be faced with how to groom a successor or devise a strategy to circumvent term limits, how to drive diversification in an economy still highly dependent on oil and gas and how to improve medical care and social services in regions of the sprawling country far removed from the modern glitter of Moscow.\n\n\nCasting his ballot in Moscow, Putin was confident of victory, saying he would consider any percentage of votes a success.\n\n\n\"The program that I propose for the country is the right one,\" he declared.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAngela Charlton in Moscow, Nataliya Vasilyeva in Yekaterinburg and Yuras Karmanau in Minsk, Belarus, contributed.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSee complete Associated Press coverage of the Russian election: \u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took to the floor Wednesday morning to address the emerging bipartisan federal spending deal in the Senate, pointing to several \u201cDemocrat priorities\u201d included in the deal but drawing the line over the lack of a solution for so-called Dreamers whose status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy is in jeopardy after March 5.\n\n\nInterested in Immigration?\nAdd Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\nPelosi announced she and a \u201clarge number\u201d of House Democrats will oppose any deal unless Speaker Paul Ryan commits to a future open immigration debate, complaining House Democrats are second-class members of Congress without a commitment from Ryan.\n\nAs minority leader, Pelosi exercised her power to speak uninterrupted on the House floor for more than two hours \u2013 a speech that continues late Wednesday morning and focused almost entirely on Dreamers.\n\nPelosi said she expects a sweeping budget deal to be unveiled today, boasting that Democrats secured \u201chundreds of billions\u201d of dollars for their legislative priorities by extracting a dollar-for-dollar deal on defense and non-defense spending.\n\nBut she demanded Ryan match Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s commitment to the Senate to open the upper chamber for free and clear debate on immigration.\n\n\u201cSo why can\u2019t we have some sort of commitment on this side?\u201d Pelosi asked Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the speaker does intend to address immigration reform.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Ryan has already repeatedly stated we intend to do a DACA and immigration reform bill \u2013 one that the president supports,\u201d Strong said in a statement.\n\nPelosi pointed to a bipartisan bill fronted by Reps.

No Republicans opposed the parliamentary move.\n\n\nThe tax bill had previously passed the state House before the Delta-NRA controversy erupted, with the jet fuel exemption intact. But the House quickly approved the Senate's version Thursday with a 135-24 vote.\n\n\n\"It's been strenuous,\" said GOP Sen. Michael Williams of Cumming, another candidate for governor. \"We've been attacked by the media, we've been attacked by the left. Big corporate has gone after us. And we've stayed strong. We've even stayed strong against our own governor.\"\n\n\nAmong Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift actions on guns after the Florida shootings. She said Delta's decision to end its NRA discounts swayed her to support the jet fuel tax break.\n\n\n\"The small steps that Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,\" the Democratic lawmaker said. \"We're the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing.\"\n\n\nDick's Sporting Goods had previously announced it would no longer sell assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida shooting.\n\n\nDeal, serving his last year in office, said he plans to sign the broader tax bill, even if it's without the airline tax break he had pushed for. Deal said he will pursue exempting jet fuel from sales taxes separately.\n\n\nThat could be a tough sell with GOP leaders in the legislature. Though he refrained Thursday from further fiery rhetoric on Delta, Cagle showed no softening of his opposition to the jet fuel exemption.\n\n\n\"I think everyone knows my position on this issue, so I don't see any wiggle room, no,\" Cagle told reporters.\n\n\nDelta's decision to stop offering NRA members discounted fares was announced in the wake of the deadly Valentine's Day shooting at a Florida high school. The airline employs 33,000 workers in Georgia. Its busy Atlanta hub has made Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport the busiest in the world.\n\n\nDeal has said the broader tax bill \"represents one of the single largest income tax reforms in the history of our state.\" It would cut the top income tax rate for individuals and businesses from 6 to 5.75 percent in 2019, with the option for legislators to further cut it to 5.5 percent in 2020.

It was meant to address a significant crime problem of that era: the frequent use of machine guns by gangsters in high-profile killings like the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre.\n\n\nNew machine guns were effectively banned for the civilian U.S. market when the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.\n\n\nNo machine guns produced after May 19, 1986, could be sold or possessed. With the right Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) paperwork and tax payments, machine guns made before that date can still be purchased on the private market, but because of the 1986 ban, prices have skyrocketed due to demand outpacing the limited supply.\n\n\nGun experts say a machine gun can cost anywhere from several thousand to several hundred thousand dollars.\n\n\nThe money the Trump DOJ wants to spend, $13.2 million, would go to \u201caddress workload\u201d and reduce the backlog of applications under the federal National Firearms Act.\n\n\nIt\u2019s aimed at reducing the time it takes the ATF to approve the transfer and sale of devices regulated under the act, including machine guns, silencers, short-barreled shotguns, short-barreled rifles and other \u201cdestructive devices,\u201d including bombs.\n\n\n\u201cATF is overwhelmed with NFA paperwork,\u201d according to Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the leading gun industry trade group. \u201cIt has been a significant problem. It takes eight to nine months to process a single form,\u201d Keane told ABC News.\n\n\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\nThis undated photo shows the ATF Reference Library, a working collection of more than 15,000 firearms.\n\n\n\n\nGun industry experts say the bulk of applications under the act are for silencers and so-called \u201cshorty\u201d guns, rifles and shotguns with barrels less than 16 or 18 inches respectively. The latest 2017 ATF data shows there are more than 630,000 machine guns registered with the ATF and more than 1.36 million silencers registered. Last year, according to ATF, more than 5.2 million weapons were registered under the NFA.\n\n\nSilencers have become a popular accessory for gun enthusiasts and silencer manufacturers have pressed to have the devices, which have the effect of muffling the sound of gunfire, to be deregulated in the Hearing Protection Act of 2017. That measure was introduced last year in the House of Representatives but was tabled after the Las Vegas massacre last October that killed 58 people.\n\n\nThe number of silencers registered with the ATF has exploded in recent years, more than tripling since 2011, going from 360,000 registered silencers in 2011 to more than 1,360,000 in 2017. The number of silencers jumped 50 percent from 2016 and 2017, according to ATF data reviewed by ABC News.\n\n\nThe president\u2019s son, Donald Trump, Jr., has been a big supporter of the Hearing Protection Act and recorded a video touting the benefits of the accessory with Joshua Waldron, CEO of top silencer manufacturer SilencerCo. Silencers are now legal in 40 states.\n\n\nKeane says NSSF supports additional funding for ATF\u2019s law enforcement mission, but that they have an industry mission that needs to be supported as well. He says ATF is chronically understaffed.\n\n\nAccording to President Trump\u2019s budget request, the additional funding would pay for 25 more people to \u201csupport the timely and effective registration of restricted weapons under the National Firearms Act while upholding the constitutional rights of the American people.\u201d\n\n\nBut current and former ATF officials who spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity say reducing the backlog of applications for NFA restricted weapons has little to do with violent crime. \u201cIt would have minimal to no effect on combatting violent crime,\u201d one former ATF official said. \u201cIt appears to be a compromise for the gun lobby,\u201d the former official added.\n\n\nUnder the NFA, a machine gun is defined as, \u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d That means if more than one bullet is fired from a single trigger pull, it\u2019s a machine gun. This the reason why, current and former ATF officials say, bump stocks are difficult to regulate \u2013 the law defines a machine gun in plain language they say permits bump stocks. A bump stock slides back and forth on a rifle making it easier for the user to pull the trigger in rapid succession, with one bullet being fired with each trigger pull.\n\n\nJustice Department officials could not say exactly how reducing the NFA backlog would reduce violent crime. They would only say that some prohibited purchasers could be rejected in the application process. Those rejections would still happen in the existing system, but they would occur more slowly. Either way, a prohibited purchaser would not be allowed to buy an NFA regulated weapon.\n\n\nThe NFA approval process is distinguished from standard firearms background check in that the weapon is registered with the federal government. The application process also requires the submission of fingerprints a photograph and notification to local law enforcement official that an application for an NFA weapon is being made.\n\n\nUnder the Trump administrations budget request for reducing violent crime, the $13.2 million to fix the NFA backlog is far more than the $8.9 million requested for increasing gun intelligence capabilities to solve violent crimes. Current and former ATF agents say the money would be better spent on hiring and training new agents that could enforce existing gun laws.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "The president's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been stripped of his temporary, high-level security clearance under new rules imposed by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly designed to crack down on West Wing staff with long-pending background investigations, sources tell ABC News.\n\n\n\nInterested in Trump Administration?\nAdd Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\n\nThat means Kushner, whose portfolio includes the solving the Middle East peace process, will no longer have regular access to the nation's most closely guarded secrets as the FBI continues its nearly 15-month review of his application for permanent clearance. Kelly's action was not limited to Kushner alone, the sources said.\n\n\nThe move became effective last Friday.\n\n\nThe White House would not comment on the record about Kushner\u2019s clearance.\n\n\nSources familiar with the matter say Kushner's downgraded clearance may still allow him access to sensitive information, but details are unclear. Officials familiar with the matter stressed that Kushner, like others previously on a temporary clearance including Ivanka Trump and White House Counsel Don McGahn, could eventually receive full clearance once the background checks are complete.\n\n\nEarlier this month, Kelly and McGahn implored Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to expedite Kushner's review, but Rosenstein informed the White House that the FBI could not move any faster and that the check was still ongoing, one source told ABC News.\n\n\nKelly's move came a week after he declared in a five-page memo to staff that he'd end all temporary Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information clearances for staffers who have had background check investigations pending since June 2017. Kushner's application has been pending since January 2017. Sensitive compartmented information reveals sources and methods by which intelligence is gathered, making it highly valuable.\n\n\nIn a statement after his memo was released, Kelly said he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Kushner\u2019s abilities to advise the president, but made clear his duties were limited to \u201chis foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israel-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico.\u201d\n\n\nThe directive came as Kelly faced mounting criticism for his handling of the resignation of former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter. It was revealed earlier this month that Porter's application for top clearance had been denied by the FBI after they uncovered allegations of violent domestic abuse in his past.\n\n\nOne White House official questioned the wisdom of Kelly's decision, suggesting it would be unwise for the Chief of Staff \"to go to war with Jared over this.\"\n\n\nTrump said Friday that the decision on Kushner\u2019s status was up to Kelly alone.\n\n\n\"General Kelly respects Jared a lot, and General Kelly will make that call,\u201d Trump told reporters at an afternoon press conference. \u201cI will let General Kelly make that decision. And he's going to do what's right for the country, and I have no doubt he will make the right decision.\"\n\n\nKushner has, at times, clashed with Kelly since he took over as chief of staff last summer and sought to impose a more stringent chain of command in the West Wing, with Kushner reporting to him, sources familiar with their relationship have told ABC. Prior to Kelly's arrival, Kushner had unlimited direct access to the President.\n\n\nWhite House officials and sources close to Kushner would not explain how Kushner could maintain access to some highly classified information without the temporary clearance, but the office of the presidency comes with unfettered authority to declassify information, giving Trump a unique ability to share information with Kushner as he sees fit. It\u2019s unclear if the president would exercise that authority.\n\n\nNational security attorney Mark Zaid, who often handles clearance cases, said in an interview with ABC that although there is nothing stopping the president from declassifying information for Kushner, the president would have to consider that \"once it's declassified for one, it's declassified for all.\"\n\n\nZaid also says it possible the president could declassify information and then reclassify it before making it public, but by law that process would need to be documented. \"The optics of that would obviously be horrible,\" Zaid said.\n\n\nKushner\u2019s security clearance application has been caught up for well over a year after he failed to disclose some contacts he had with foreign officials -- including Russians -- as required by law.\n\n\nAnother attorney for Kushner, Jamie Gorelick, has previously stated that Kushner's security clearance form, known as an SF-86, was \"prematurely submitted\" and that \"among other errors, [it] did not list any contacts with foreign government officials.\" Kushner has since updated the questionnaire multiple times to with all relevant meetings, including \"over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries,\" Gorelick told ABC News.\n\n\nAs a former businessman, Kushner also has numerous financial dealings that the FBI is currently reviewing, which could further account for the delay.\n\n\nNevertheless, it is very uncommon for one of the closest aides to the president to remain without formal permanent clearance more than a year into the administration. National security lawyer Bradley Moss told ABC that security clearance background checks for staffers close to the president are expedited because of the sensitivity of their position. For a senior staffer like Kushner to have a 15 month investigation, even considering his complex financial background, is \"highly unusual,\" Moss said.\n\n\nLast week President Trump seemed to blame the system, rather than Kushner himself. \u201cWe inherited a system that's broken.

We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign\".\n\nIn one of the covertly recorded meetings, Mr Turnbull said Cambridge Analytica pushed its \"Defeat Crooked Hillary\" campaign onto millions of social media users.\n\n\"The 'OO' of 'Crooked' were a pair of handcuffs and it was all about \u2026 she belongs behind bars,\" Mr Turnbull said.\n\nMr Turnbull said the campaign was pushed through proxy organisations such as charities and activist groups.\n\n\"We just put information into the bloodstream [of] the internet and then \u2026 watch it grow,\" he said.\n\n\"Give it a little push every now and again over time, to watch it take shape.\n\nMr Nix told the undercover reporters he was \"absolutely convinced\" US investigators had no jurisdiction to obtain information about the firm's foreign clients.\n\nHe also instructed the reporters to set up a secure ProtonMail account, which deleted emails.\n\n\"No-one knows we have it.

Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and then-Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., wrote a letter in March 2017 to the FBI urging agents to investigate \"all contacts\" Sessions may have had with Russians, and \"whether any laws were broken in the course of those contacts or in any subsequent discussion of whether they occurred.\"\n\n\nIt's unclear how actively federal authorities pursued the matter in the months before Sessions' interview with Mueller\u2019s investigators. It's also unclear whether the special counsel may still be pursuing other matters related to Sessions and statements he has made to Congress \u2013 or others \u2013 since his confirmation.\n\n\nDuring his confirmation in January 2017, Sessions told the Senate committee that he had not been in contact with anyone connected to the Russian government about the 2016 election. He also said he was \"not aware\" of anyone else affiliated with the Trump campaign communicating with the Russian government ahead of the election.\n\n\nTwo months later, after a Washington Post report disputed what Sessions told Congress, the attorney general acknowledged he had met the Russian ambassador twice during the presidential campaign, but insisted none of those interactions were \"to discuss issues of the campaign.\"\n\n\nSessions \"made no attempt to correct his misleading testimony until The Washington Post revealed that, in fact, he had at least two meetings with the Russian ambassador,\" Leahy and Franken said in a statement at the time. \"We know he would not tolerate dishonesty if he were in our shoes.\"\n\n\nSessions called any suggestions that he misled lawmakers \"false.\"\n\n\nNevertheless, charges subsequently brought by Mueller raised more questions over Sessions' testimony to Congress.\n\n\nIn November, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos admitted to federal authorities that during the campaign he was in frequent contact with Russian operatives about setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Papadopoulos pitched the idea to Sessions and Trump at a meeting of the then-candidate's foreign policy team in March 2016.\n\n\nSessions later told lawmakers he \"always told the truth,\" insisting he didn\u2019t recall the March 2016 meeting when first testifying to Congress. He later remembered the meeting after reading news reports about it, he said.\n\n\n\"We are concerned by Attorney General Sessions' lack of candor to the Committee and his failure thus far to accept responsibility for testimony that could be construed as perjury,\" Leahy and Franken said in their March 2017 letter to then-FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Trump two months later.\n\n\nIt is a federal crime for anyone to knowingly provide false information to Congress \u2013 or to a federal law enforcement agency. No charges have been announced against McCabe, and there\u2019s no indication that the FBI has recommended he be charged.\n\n\nMcCabe was fired Friday after the Justice Department's inspector general concluded that McCabe misled investigators looking into how Justice Department and FBI officials handled matters associated with the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\nIn October 2016, hoping to push back on a series of news reports questioning whether he might be trying to protect Hillary Clinton, McCabe authorized two FBI officials to speak with a reporter about his efforts to boost the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation. When he was questioned later about that decision, McCabe \"lacked candor \u2013 including under oath \u2013 on multiple occasions,\" Sessions said in a statement announcing McCabe's firing.\n\n\n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,\" Sessions said. \"As the [FBI's ethics office] stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand.'\"\n\n\nMcCabe vehemently denies misleading investigators, saying in his own statement that he is \"being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\"\n\n\nFor more than a year, Trump and other Republicans have questioned whether McCabe harbored a political bias when making law enforcement decisions as deputy director. McCabe's critics point to his ties to Democrats, particularly his wife's failed Democratic run for state senate in Virginia nearly three years ago.\n\n\nBut in an interview with ABC News, McCabe insisted politics was \"absolutely not\" a factor in any of the decisions he made, noting he has considered himself a Republican all his life.\n\n\nA representative for McCabe declined to comment for this article.\n\n\nFranken, one of the two senators who pushed the FBI to investigate Sessions, resigned from Congress in December amid several claims of sexual misconduct.\n\n\n--ABC News' Trish Turner and Matt Mosk contributed to this report", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "In a presidential memorandum on a Friday, President Trump banned some transgender service members from serving in the U.S. military, saying transgender individuals \u201cwith a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria\u201d are unable to service except under limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nInterested in LGBT?\nAdd LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAmong other things, the policies set forth by the Secretary of Defense state that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances,\u201d Trump wrote in statement released by the White House.\n\n\nIn a memo to Trump dated Feb. 22, Secretary of Defense James Mattis \u2014 citing a panel of expert\u2019s \u201cprofessional military judgment\u201d and his own professional judgment \u2014 recommended the following three policies which Trump concurred with:\n\n\n1. \u201cTransgender person with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under the following circumstances: (1) if they have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to our accession; (2) Servicemembers diagnosed with gender dysphoria after entering into service may be retained if they do not require a change of gender and remain deployable with an applicable retention standards; and (3) currently serving service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration\u2019s policy took a fact and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.\u201d\n\n\n2. \u201cTransgender person who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.\u201d\n\n\n3. \u201cTransgender person without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other service members, and their biological sex.\u201d\n\n\nTrump tweeted last July that he wanted to ban all transgender service members because the military \"must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.\"\n\n\nSince those tweets, federal courts have rejected portions of the proposed ban.\n\n\nMost notably, beginning Jan. 1, the Pentagon complied with a court order that allowed transgender individuals to join the military if they met strict criteria, including certifications from a medical provider about the status of their health.\n\n\nTwo transgender individuals are already under contract to serve in the U.S. military since that court ruling.\n\n\nThe policy announced by the White House on Friday will be subject to and restrained by existing court orders, unless the Department of Justice has judges dissolve preliminary injunctions.\n\n\n\"We will continue to adhere to federal law,\" Department of Defense spokesperson Maj.

People died [Wednesday], people died the 14th and they are going to keep dying unless something actually happens.\"\n\n\nAnd some progress has come since Parkland. Three weeks after the shooting, Florida enacted sweeping gun safety legislation that raises the minimum age to buy firearms to 21 from 18 and also includes a measure to arm some teachers with state training. This is the first gun reform legislation in decades in the same gun-friendly state that passed the controversial \u201cstand your ground\u201d law.\n\n\nRaising the minimum age requirement is one of the policy proposals that has received a lot of attention in the post-Parkland gun debate, according to Dr. Shannon Frattaroli at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.\n\n\nOn March 14, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the first piece of gun legislation since Parkland \u2014 the STOP School Violence Act \u2014 to provide grants for school training and make schools safer. The omnibus spending bill that passed both chambers of Congress and now signed by President Trump contains several gun safety measures including offering states funding in exchange for compliance with the federal NICS background check system, implementing the STOP School Violence Act, and stipulating that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can study gun violence, rebuking the 1996 Dickey Amendment.\n\n\nTarr is aware that under the current Trump administration and makeup of Congress, there are still limits to progress, but she remains hopeful.\n\n\n\"We\u2019re doing a lot and even if it is not necessarily the assault weapons ban yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.

rhetorically.\n\n\nWhile it is still too early to tell how the Parkland shooting could impact elections come November, Kristin Goss, an associate professor of public policy at Duke University, said that an important question this cycle will be \u201cwhether the people that have pro-control feelings feel more strongly and prioritize it more highly in their political behavior including voting.\u201d\n\n\nAs she looks forward to joining the newest class of voters, Tarr wants simply the opportunity to educate voters on gun control so they know exactly what they are voting for, rather than who.\n\n\n\"Ultimately, I\u2019m not here to tell people which way to vote,\" she said. \"I\u2019m here to educate people so they can vote and know what they\u2019re voting for.\"\n\n\nAnd she

permanently dry up under Adani's plan to drain billions of litres of groundwater a year for its Queensland mine, scientific experts say.\n\nThe Doongmabulla Springs Complex, a one-square-kilometre expanse of nationally important wetlands near the proposed site of the Carmichael coal mine, faced serious risk under the latest Adani plan before the Queensland Government, hydrogeologists argued.\n\nThe source of the ancient springs remains in doubt, with two Federal Government groundwater studies conducted since Adani received Commonwealth environmental approval in 2014 unable to identify which of two underground aquifers feeds the threatened ecosystem.\n\nRMIT environmental engineering expert Matthew Currell said Adani's groundwater plan, obtained by the ABC, ignored this \"major scientific uncertainty\" and falsely assumed its proposed mine and the springs tapped different sources.\n\nThe mining company plans to extract an average of up to 4.5 billion litres of water a year.\n\nAccording to the \"groundwater-dependent ecosystem management plan\", which Adani submitted to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science for approval on January 23, the miner plans no further work to pinpoint the source of the springs.\n\nMr Currell said while it was the second groundwater plan put to government since last April, Adani had still not flagged any steps to solve the underground mystery, such as seismic surveys or drilling more deep bores.\n\nHe said he and colleagues, who conducted a 2017 academic study of the Carmichael mine and the springs, believed there was a \"significant probability\" Adani was wrong about the spring's source.\n\nA 2016 federal science department study under the Lake Eyre Basin Springs Assessment Project suggested it was more likely the miner would drain the very aquifer that fed the Doongmabulla Springs, Mr Currell said.\n\n\"Based on the current information that we have, I'd say that's more than a remote possibility.\n\n\"It would certainly lead to much greater impacts than have been predicted to date by Adani and its consultants regarding the impact of the mining on the springs.\"\n\nA spokesman for Queensland Environment and Science said it was \"currently assessing the draft plan\".\n\nAn Adani spokeswoman that a \"thorough and transparent scientific investigation conducted as part of the Carmichael mine's approval process showed mining could be conducted without permanent damage to the Doongmabulla Springs\".\n\n\"Groundwater is safely and appropriately managed at many mines throughout Australia using the checks and balances that will be in place at the Carmichael Mine,\" she said.\n\nQueensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane said the miner went through an \"exhaustive\" process to get its water permits.\n\nThis included input from an independent panel set up by the Gillard government \"and obviously the resources of the Department of Natural Resources and Mines here in Queensland\".\n\n\"I guess there's always going to be one other person who has a different view.\"\n\nMr Macfarlane said the Queensland Government could halt the mine's operations immediately if alarm bells rang.\n\n\"If the impact of taking the associated water from the pit is larger than expected, then the Government has the opportunity to basically stop the progress of the mine,\" he said.\n\n\"That is the safeguard but it's extraordinarily unlikely, bearing in mind that this has been done using the best geological science and advice available to both the Federal Government and the State Government.\"\n\nMr Currell said the information that highlighted the risk to the Doongmabulla Springs was \"on the public record\" and had been \"well known to Adani and the people working for them\".\n\n\"There's been ample opportunity for the mining company to go and collect that data and resolve this issue,\" he said.\n\nMr Currell also said Adani's contingency plans such as piping water in from elsewhere \"may not be feasible\".\n\nWangan and Jagalingou elder Adrian Burragubba, an Adani opponent within a group of traditional owners divided over the mine project, said the Doongmabulla Springs was \"vitally important\" to his people's law, custom and identity.\n\n\"Essentially, it's the dreaming story of the Rainbow Serpent,\" he said.\n\n\"It

One of them, he says, is misunderstood.\n\n\nThe Soviet-born American businessman, who once billed himself as a \u201csenior advisor to Donald Trump,\u201d has become known for his supporting role in the unfolding drama that is Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Sater is often referred to as the convicted felon and onetime stock scammer who promised to \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on a proposed plan to build \u201cTrump Tower Moscow\u201d in the heat of the presidential campaign.\n\n\n\u201cI know how to play it, and we will get this done,\u201d Sater wrote to Trump attorney and confidant Michael Cohen, his childhood friend, in emails published by The Washington Post and The New York Times. \u201cBuddy, our boy can become president of the USA, and we can engineer it.\u201d\n\n\nThe project was abandoned, but as federal investigators launched a wide-ranging probe of alleged Russsian interference in the 2016 election including possible connections to Trump\u2019s campaign and personal businesses, Sater quickly found himself caught in the dragnet. Now, in an exclusive interview with George Stephanopoulos airing Friday morning on Good Morning America, Sater tells ABC News that there is much, much more to his life story.\n\n\nAnd he\u2019s right.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think if a screenwriter was trying to write this movie that they could make this up,\u201d Sater said.\n\n\n\nMark Von Holden/Getty Images\nDonald Trump, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater attend the Trump Soho Launch Party, on Sept. 19, 2007 in New York City.\n\n\n\n\nSater, 52, says that for the past two decades he has served as a high-level intelligence asset for the DIA, CIA and the FBI. As first reported this week by Buzzfeed News, Sater has helped bust mafia families, capture cybercriminals and pursue top terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden \u2014 earning praise from some of the country\u2019s top law enforcement officials.\n\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he\u2019s been interviewed by the special counsel, but it\u2019s almost certain that Mueller knows his body of work well. He served as FBI Director for much of Sater\u2019s clandestine career.\n\n\nAs questions have swirled about his supposed loyalty to Russia, Sater is speaking out, recasting himself as an unheralded protector of the United States.\n\n\n\u201cI am a patriot,\u201d Sater said. \u201cHaving the opportunity to serve my country and do anything in its defense was a no brainer.

He told Sater that he had unwittingly gained access to a group of high-level Russian intelligence operatives who had valuable information about Russian defense technology.\n\n\n\u201cThey seem to like you,\u201d Sater recalls being told. \u201cYou speak Russian.

He says he developed assets in several different countries by cultivating cover as a corrupt businessman offering access to illicit schemes and passed information to U.S. agents tasked with handling a variety of threats to national security.\n\n\n\u201cThey used to come to me with cases that had nothing to do with me and ask for my assistance, in which I would enthusiastically and wholeheartedly dive in and try to help,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHe says he tipped off law enforcement to potential assassination attempts on Secretary of State Colin Powell and President George W. Bush; obtained information and photographs about North Korea\u2019s burgeoning nuclear program; lured Russian cybercriminals hacking the U.S. financial system out of hidings so that they could be unmasked and captured.\n\n\nAnd, he says, he was even tasked with hunting for Osama bin Laden and managed to turn Mullah Omar\u2019s personal secretary into a key source that provided intelligence about al-Qaeda hideouts.\n\n\nThe information he had obtained was so valuable that when his past caught up with him and he finally faced his sentencing in connection with that multimillion-dollar fraud, the judge let him off with a mere $25,000 fine.\n\n\nThat work, he says, continues in some unspecified capacity to this day. He said as recently as last year he was asked for \u201cassistance in making evaluations of various foreign governments [and] foreign individuals.\u201d\n\n\nHe reportedly told this story under oath when he testified recently before the House Intelligence Committee, at which point he said even \u201cthe Democratic aides who were there to question [me] regarding the Russia-Trump investigation stopped, paused and thanks me for my service to my country.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne of the few times in my life that I almost cried,\u201d Sater said.\n\n\nWHAT HE SAYS HE DID - AND DIDN'T - KNOW\n\n\nSater says he made himself valuable to the U.S. government by knowing everything. When it comes to Trump, however, he says he knows next to nothing.\n\n\nHis company, Bayrock Group, began renting office space in Trump Tower. Sater says he introduced himself to Trump in 2000 and began funneling development proposals to Trump\u2019s desk shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\u201cI would bring him deals,\u201d Sater said.\n\n\nSater claims he has helped the Trump Organization secure financing on several major projects, but none has garnered more scrutiny than a failed proposal to build \u201cTrump Tower Moscow\u201d amid the launch of Trump\u2019s controversial campaign for the presidency.\n\n\nIn 2015, Trump signed a non-binding letter of intent, which promised a $4 million initial payment to the Trump Organization, to build the tallest building in the world in Moscow. In emails sent to Cohen published by the Post and the Times, Sater appears to celebrate an apparent merger of Trump\u2019s business and political fortunes.\n\n\nFaced with questions about his boast that he and Cohen could \u201cengineer\u201d a Trump presidency using the deal to court Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s support, Sater pleaded ignorance.\n\n\n\u201cI am not a political person,\u201d Sater said. \u201cI don't understand the implications of the politics or the various strings that get attached to it and how good or bad it may look.\u201d\n\n\nAny perceived alignment of Trump\u2019s business and political interests, he said, was purely coincidental.\n\n\n\u201cI was trying to do a real estate transaction,\u201d Sater told ABC News. \u201cI clearly was not involved in the campaign, nor was I involved in any of the political end, and the hope that a large transaction like that would be built, if that was helpful to his run, that would be great.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he knew certain key member of the Trump campaign, he claimed to have had \u201czero contact\u201d with many of the Trump allies who have fallen under the spotlight. He denied knowing Michael Flynn. And Paul Manafort. And Rick Gates. And George Papadopoulos. And Carter Page.\n\n\nAsked if then-candidate Trump could have softened his stance on Russia because he was simultaneously pursuing a business deal there, Sater demurred.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for the president,\u201d he said.\n\n\nAnd asked if \u2014 given his extensive sources in the both the Russian foreign intelligence services and the Russian criminal underworld \u2014 he knew of the effort underway to influence the U.S. election, he paused before issuing a forceful denial.\n\n\n\u201cI was not aware of what they were doing,\u201d Sater said. \u201cI read about it, just like everyone else, in the newspapers.\u201d\n\n\nSater called Trump\u2019s claim that he couldn\u2019t pick him out of a lineup \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but says Trump has nothing to fear from his testimony to investigators.

Trump visited the region twice in the two months prior to Election Day, most recently on the Saturday before the election when he stumped in support of Saccone, telling a raucous crowd that he was an \"extraordinary guy\" and that Republicans \"needed him\" in Washington.\n\n\nSaccone, 60, a four-term state representative, was further boosted by appearances by Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. But Saccone was also derided in Republican circles in the closing weeks of the campaign as a weak candidate with anemic fundraising numbers who was too heavily reliant on the injection of outside money from Republican groups.\n\n\nTrump won the district in 2016 by nearly 20 points, largely on the back of his promises to protect American workers, a pledge that resonated with the region's blue-collar workforce that witnessed firsthand the impact of the fading steel and coal industries. Lamb successfully harnessed the organizing power of a substantial number of the district's union-members, earning the endorsement of the AFL-CIO, a strategy that served the district's previous representative, Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, well in his eight election victories.\n\n\n\n\nMurphy resigned in October in the midst of a sex scandal after a report that he urged the woman with whom he was having an affair to seek an abortion.\n\n\nSaccone, who ran a fairly traditional campaign that touted his experience in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and his experience as an Air Force counterintelligence agent, had fundraising trouble from the start. He ultimately lagged behind Lamb by nearly $3 million.\n\n\nThe only thing preventing perhaps a wider margin of victory for Lamb was the injection of outside money into the race. Republican and GOP-aligned groups poured over $10 million into the race on Saccone's behalf, including over $3.5 million from the National Republican Congressional Committee and $3.4 million from the Paul Ryan-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC.\n\n\nNow comes the next election for both men.\n\n\nPennsylvania candidates are running under a new House map in November, thanks to a court-ordered redistricting plan.\n\n\nLamb filed to run in the fall in the 17th Congressional District, where his hometown of Mt.

Keith Rothfus holds that seat and has $1.2 million in his campaign account.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Saccone filed to run in the 14th Congressional District, which holds a lot of the 18th\u2019s original acreage and is much friendlier to Republicans than the district in which his hometown of Elizabeth was placed. The new 14th Congressional District has no sitting incumbent. Its area mainly consists of the seat that Murphy held before he resigned.\n\n\nBut both men will face something they didn\u2019t in their last election \u2013 primary contests.\n\n\nTwo other Democrats filed to run against Lamb in the 17th Congressional District while one other Republican has filed to challenge Saccone in the 14th Congressional District, according to the Pennsylvania Secretary of State\u2019s website, where candidate petitions were due on Tuesday.\n\n\nBoth men would be favored to win their respective contests in the May 15 primary given the national name recognition they received in last week\u2019s special election.\n\n\nAnd should each man prevail in his respective contests in November, they would serve in Congress together next year.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zoe Daniel", "body": "I've only just met my cousin Shane Baton, and we're at an indoor gun range north of Salt Lake City where I'm learning how to shoot.\n\nShane was born and bred in Utah, and grew up with guns.\n\nI've never even fired one.\n\nWe are worlds apart in our attitudes to gun ownership, but we've come together so I can get some personal insight into American gun culture.\n\nAs an Australian, and a journalist who covers America's frequent mass shootings, it's difficult to comprehend why so many people in the United States are so attached to their weapons.\n\nAmid renewed debate over gun rights after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, my cousin has invited me to spend some time trying to understand.\n\nHe's taking me through the features of bolt action and AR-15 rifles.\n\nSeveral others also take turns at shooting targets with everything from rifles to pistols, including his 18-year-old son Terry, who is using his own AR-15.\n\n\"I think my youngest was eight when he shot it for the first time and it's just very easy for him and for smaller-framed people. It's just a great gun.\"\n\nHaving seen what military-grade weapons can do while covering war and civil unrest in Asia and Africa, I don't even allow my children to have toy guns.\n\nIt's especially intimidating because the AR-15 tends to be the weapon of choice for mass shooters, including the killer at Parkland.\n\nBut even taking into account my reluctance, the AR-15 is easy for me too.\n\nUnlike the bolt action rifle, which is heavy and difficult to fire, the AR-15 feels light, easy to position and aim.\n\nHaving entirely missed the target with the first weapon, I'm able to hit it several times with the AR-15.\n\n\"So what did you think about the difference between the two?\" Shane asks me afterwards.\n\n\"It's just a lot lighter and not as much kick,\" I respond, in reference to the AR-15. \"It seems just easier, more gentle.\"\n\n\"And I think that's what makes it so popular,\" he replies. \"I agree with you. That's what I hoped you'd say.\"\n\nMany hobbyists like the AR-15 because they can build it at home, adding and subtracting features depending on the intended use.\n\nBut this weapon has been at the centre of the debate about gun control in America, with everything from increased age limits to closing background check loopholes to banning assault rifles being thrown up for discussion.\n\nRenewed talk of reform has been met with NRA rhetoric about a liberal conspiracy to take guns away.\n\nShane is not an NRA member, but he does support the organisation.\n\n\"This is not even an assault rifle by definition, this is a sporting rifle.\"\n\nThe definition of an \"assault rifle\" is highly contentious.\n\nGun advocates argue the AR-15 doesn't qualify because it does not have the capacity to switch from semi-automatic to full machine gun mode without a converter.\n\nHowever, the federal government defines \"military style\" weapons as both semi- and full-automatics that are capable of firing multiple rounds.\n\nThe AR-15 is a semi-automatic, civilian version of the military's M16.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, there are between 270 million and 310 million guns in America, owned by just over a third of the population.\n\nSome 46 per cent of adults in Utah own a gun, which is well above the US average.\n\nMost cite self-defence and sport as reasons to have a weapon and roughly 60 per cent oppose a ban on assault rifles.\n\n\"What I'm worried about is that, ultimately, kneejerk reactions that don't do anything,\" says Shane.\n\nMany Americans fear a 'slippery slope' that could result from increased gun control, gradually eroding their independence and sense of freedom.\n\nThey want existing laws enforced rather than new ones being introduced.\n\n\"So let's say we give this a try and we ban this. Fine, let's ban it,\" he says.\n\n\"What happens when it doesn't affect it and doesn't do anything? Do I get it back? No, I don't.\n\n\"Then they move on to ban something else. And when that doesn't work, do I get that back? No! Then they move on to ban something else.\"\n\nShane describes a childhood of hunting and camping in the wild, a way of life that Americans outside the large cities are determined to defend.\n\nBeing able to own whichever gun they choose is part of that.\n\nThere's also a desire for self-defence that's particular to America, where some don't believe that law enforcement will be able to provide timely help.\n\nThey raise concerns that banning semi-automatics would lead to criminals having powerful weapons disadvantaging civilians who would be left unable to defend their homes and families.\n\nSome also have a deeply ingrained desire to be able to protect themselves and their state from the federal government, if needed.\n\nExperiencing the ease of shooting an AR-15 first hand, you can easily grasp why many Americans choose it for sport and self-defence.\n\nIt's also clear to see why it's the weapon of choice for the mass shooter and in that sense it's a little chilling.\n\n\"It kills people in the wrong hands,\" says Shane.\n\n\"It kills people. So, are we going to get rid of guns all together? No. Not in America.\n\nAccording to Shane and many Americans, the deep social issues affecting the country, including gaps in parenting and lack of male role models, are the real issue.\n\n\"It's not the firearm, it's the culture,\" he says.\n\nBut does that justify resisting any reform that could make a difference when children are being killed at school?\n\nTo many Australians, the answer may seem obvious.

Authorities do not believe that gunman used a bump stock.\n\n\nHowever, the gunman in the Las Vegas shooting in October was found to have used bump stocks to increase the number of bullets he was able to fire.\n\n\nMachine guns and accessories like mufflers and silencers are regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. That law, which was updated in 1968, defines machine guns as any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot more than one shot without reloading and any part or combination of parts intended \"for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun.\"\n\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if the Justice Department or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has the authority to ban these devices.\n\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said after Trump announced the directive that the ATF told Congress there would have to be a legislative solution.\n\n\nFeinstein introduced a bill to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting but it did not move forward in  president repeated a comment he made last week that he wants to talk about reopening mental health institutions. He said that \"in the old days\" it was easier to commit people who acted like \"a boiler ready to explode.\" He also said law enforcement should be able to take someone's guns if they have a mental health issue.\n\n\nTrump said last week he wants to reopen mental health institutions as part of the solution to prevent future mass shootings, saying the shooter from Parkland was a \"sicko\" and needed help in a meeting with state and local officials.\n\n\nCurrent federal regulations say that anyone who has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity cannot legally possess a firearm. Neither of these were the case with the Parkland shooter.\n\n\nHe also said that the National Rifle Association \"is on our side\" in taking action to prevent future mass shootings but that they might have to go up against them. The NRA has strongly opposed proposals to raise the age to legally buy an assault rifle from 18 to 21 that the president has supported.\n\n\nThe president is scheduled to go to Capitol Hill this week and meet with Republican members of Congress, where they are expected to likely discuss what, if any, legislation to reform gun laws he would support.\n\n\nSeveral governors at the meeting also weighed in on solutions the president has brought up in the two weeks since the shooting.\n\n\nRepublican Florida Gov. Rick Scott said the state is going to budget $500 million to have a law enforcement presence at every school in the state and that there will be mental health counselors in every school. He also said the state will support allowing family members, law enforcement officer or mental health professionals to petition a court for restraining orders to take guns away from people who are struggling with mental illness or make violent threats.\n\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said similar programs for protective orders in his state have been very effective and that the president should consider it on a national level.\n\n\nInslee also criticized the president's support for the idea of arming some \"gun adept\" teachers as a deterrent for possible school shooters. Inslee said teachers don't want to carry guns and that lawmakers should listen to educators on this issue.\n\n\n\"I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here a little more listening and let's just take that off the table and move forward,\" Inslee told the president.\n\n\nTrump's comments today echoed statements he made last week when he said he wants to reopen mental health institutions as part of the solution to prevent future mass shootings, saying the shooter from Parkland was a \"sicko\" and needed help.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Allyson Horn", "body": "Online shoppers could be slugged up to $7 more per package when buying products from overseas, under a Federal Government proposal.\n\nThe Home Affairs Department is considering whether every package imported into Australia should be hit with a new levy, to help cover the costs of screening items at the border.\n\nThe tax already applies for packages worth more than $1,000, but the Government's plan would see shoppers have to shell out the extra charge for all overseas purchases.\n\nThe ABC understands a tax of between $2 and $7 has been considered.\n\nNearly 40 million of the \"low import\" parcels arrived in Australia last financial year \u2014 roughly two per person.\n\nA discussion paper on the proposed tax argued the levy was needed to recover costs associated with biosecurity, cargo and trade border activities.\n\n\"Existing cost recovery arrangements are no longer sustainable and will not support Australia's future trading environment,\" it stated.\n\nLiberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm said the tax was unnecessary.\n\n\"This Government seems to have an endless capacity to come up with new taxes and increase existing taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"We're already extremely highly taxed and I despair at the idea that we'll ever end up with any of our own money in our own pockets.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News Australia", "location": [{"country": "AU", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "President Trump\u2019s one-time campaign aide Richard Gates is expected to plead guilty in the special counsel\u2019s criminal case against him, setting up the potential for Gates to become the latest well-informed Trump insider to assist in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential contest, according to sources close to the matter.\n\n\nThe potential for a guilty plea could dramatically change the dynamics in the investigation, just one day after special counsel Robert Mueller added a raft of new financial and tax charges to the criminal case against Gates and his longtime colleague, Paul Manafort.\n\n\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images FILE\nDonald Trump, flanked by campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka, checks the podium in preparation for accepting the GOP nomination to be President at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 20, 2016. \n\n\n\n\nGates has for weeks been vacillating between fighting the charges and pleading guilty, and remained undecided through much of this week, according to the sources.

Trump has discussed with the closest advisers potentially firing Cobb, the White House lawyer responsible for Russia matters, but has privately assured him his job is safe, sources say.\n\n\nWhile some of Trump\u2019s past lawyers have described their client as compliant and easy to work with, sources close to those currently representing the president have described a compulsive side of him that at times can be difficult to manage, say sources with direct knowledge.\n\n\nJay Goldberg, who represented Trump personally from 1990 to 2005, recalled to ABC News a client who was at the time \u201cvery easy to control\u201d and \u201cvery careful in his answers and followed direction all the time.\u201d He insisted Trump is a very different client than how he appears on television.\n\n\n\u201cPeople think he shoots from the hip and sometimes he is too lippy,\u201d Goldberg said of the president. \u201cBut behind it is a very organized person who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\n\nMichael Wildes, the managing partner at Wildes  Weinberg PC, represented the Trump Organization on immigration matters for more than a decade, as well as Trump Models, the Miss Universe Organization and Melania Trump and her family. He told ABC News that \u201cas a proud Democrat\u201d he profoundly disagrees with Trump on policy matters, but his experience representing him was generally positive.\n\n\nTrump has the ability to \u201captly cut through legal issues, to break things down to rudimentary elements, in matters that often got complicated. And he has a quick wit to boot,\u201d Wildes said. \u201cThe people I dealt with in his inner circle were all highly talented, responsible and professional,\u201d Wildes said about his working relationships that predate Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\n\nAP\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event honoring the Native American code talkers in the Oval Office of the White House, Oct. 27, 2017.

You get it?\u201d\n\n\nLegal experts have been alarmed by what they consider questionable behavior in connection with some of the cases he has faced such as when he repeatedly blasted Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who presided over a case against the now-defunct Trump University.\n\n\n\u201cEverybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He\u2019s a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel and he is not doing the right thing,\u201d Trump said at a 2016 campaign rally. \u201cSo what happens is, the judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great; I think that\u2019s fine. You know what? I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald trump when I give all these jobs, OK? I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself.\u201d\n\n\nAnd his lawyers are facing a range of legal challenges with a client who makes no secrets of how he wishes to handle them.\n\n\nHe\u2019s given contradictory messages about the standing of those currently representing him, tweeting just days ago that reporting he was going to add another lawyer to his legal team was \u201cwrong\u201d insisting he is \u201cVERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow.\u201d\n\n\nSince that tweet just twelve days ago, Dowd has resigned and Trump hired diGenova.\n\n\nHe tweets frequently about the special counsel probe, even as his lawyers and close advisers have strongly advised against it. That came to a head this week when Trump for the first time called out Robert Mueller by name \u2014 attacking his investigation and the political leanings of the team he has assembled.\n\n\nAccording to sources Dowd had been at odds with Trump for months over the whether President Trump would meet with members of Mueller\u2019s team for an interview and had advised the president against it. Immediately following Dowd\u2019s resignation on Thursday, Trump declared: \u201cI would like to.

And I chose not to vote because of the political nature of the work that we were engaged in.\u201d\n\n\nMeanwhile, his wife, a pediatrician at a Virginia hospital, was never much of a political person, according to McCabe.\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s voted for Democrats [and] Republicans,\u201d and until a few years ago she would have described herself as \u201can independent and not particularly heavily aligned with either party,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThat changed in February 2015, when she \u201cwas contacted out of the blue by the chief of staff for then-Lt.

A year earlier, when McAuliffe visited her hospital, Jill McCabe was quoted in a Washington Post article voicing support for the Medicaid expansion efforts, according to McCabe.\n\n\n\u201cThey looked up the article, found Jill\u2019s name and called her out of the blue,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHis wife ultimately decided to run, and McCabe was \u201cvery involved\u201d in that decision, he said.\n\n\n\u201cShe was motivated by health issues,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s in the trenches \u2026 in the battle of providing health care coverage to the entire population, not just the well-insured people of Loudon County [Virginia], but also the disadvantaged side of that population.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions picks up his remarks as Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe looks on during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, July 13, 2017.\n\n\n\n\nDue to his wife\u2019s campaign, McCabe knew he \u201cwould have to take some proactive steps in my role as the [Assistant Director in Charge] of the Washington Field Office to stay out of particular investigative matters,\u201d and after consulting with ethics attorneys at FBI headquarters, counsel at the Washington Field Office and others they \u201ccame up with a protocol where I would essentially be removed from all Virginia state political corruption matters,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\u201cI had no role in Jill\u2019s campaign,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to any events.

That would be corrosive to our independence and our credibility.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to McCabe, the truth was the opposite of what the reporter was suggesting: The Justice Department was trying to slow the Clinton Foundation investigation, and he was trying to keep pushing it ahead.\n\n\nMcCabe wanted to get the reporter \u201coff this narrative,\u201d so he \u201cauthorized\u201d a top FBI spokesman and FBI attorney to provide the reporter with \u201cthe content of a conversation that I had had with [a senior official] from the Department of Justice,\u201d McCabe recalled.\n\n\n\u201cThe Department was not impressed with the case, and they didn\u2019t believe it should be going forward,\u201d McCabe said.\n\n\n\u201cThe decision to share information with the media is absolutely within my authority as deputy director,\u201d McCabe added. \u201cI am one of three people in the FBI who has the independent authority to make that decision. People could disagree about the decisions I made ... but the fact is this is not a leak.\u201d\n\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility felt differently, according to Sessions.\n\n\nBoth \"concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media,\" Sessions said in a statement.\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s stories in late 2016 prompted Republicans to call for McCabe to recuse himself from the Clinton email investigation. At the time, Trump began calling out McCabe on the campaign trail.\n\n\nInternally at the FBI, some senior officials agreed that McCabe should be walled off from the Clinton-related probe, and days before Election Day 2016 he recused himself.\n\n\nRepublicans then began calling for the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general \u2013 or IG \u2013 to investigate why McCabe didn\u2019t recuse himself earlier. And in January 2017, the inspector general\u2019s office announced it had launched an investigation into, among other things, \u201callegations that the FBI Deputy Director should have been recused from participating in certain investigative matters.\u201d\n\n\nMCCABE MISLEADS INVESTIGATORS?\n\n\n\u201cIn the course of the IG\u2019s investigation and a kind of related Inspection Division investigation, I was asked about ... my decision to share information\u201d with the Wall Street Journal, McCabe told ABC News.\n\n\nAccording to Sessions, McCabe \"lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions.\"\n\n\n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,\" Sessions said in his statement. In recommending that McCabe be fired, the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility noted that \"all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\" Sessions added.\n\n\nBecause the inspector general\u2019s report has not been released publicly yet, it\u2019s still unclear exactly why investigators believe McCabe was not forthcoming, or if McCabe is criticized for other actions.\n\n\nMcCabe, however, insisted he answered investigators\u2019 questions \u201cto the best of my ability, best recollection I had at those times.\u201d He noted that he was questioned in the midst of a \u201cchaotic time\u201d for him, in the wake of Comey\u2019s firing and his temporarily taking an agency \u201creeling from the loss of their director.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to McCabe, after he was questioned by investigators, he realized he needed to clarify some of his responses, so he \u201cproactively reached out to those people to ensure that they clearly understood what my position was.\" He would not offer any further details.\n\n\n\u201cI have tried at every juncture to be as accurate and of course truthful in all of my encounters with whoever was interested in asking questions about that article or anything else,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThe idea of being condemned or miscast in any way contrary to that is just unbelievably disappointing and really offensive to me.\u201d\n\n\nMcCabe insisted to ABC News that the media disclosures he authorized did not constitute \u201ca leak.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a clandestine contact with a reporter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was done by my media representative and my counselor. It took place over the course of several days. ... So to be kind of retrospectively misrepresented as sort of a clandestine secretive leak is sort of just \u2013 it\u2019s not the case and it\u2019s just an unfair portrayal.\u201d\n\n\nAsked whether he believes the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, with its report targeting him, is complicit in what he described as the \u201congoing assault\u201d on the FBI, McCabe simply answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat I do know is that the IG has been subjected to intense pressure by the [Republican] chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d McCabe added. \u201cI do know that the IG is under pressure from the President, who tweeted ... demanding results in these investigations.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAfter 21 years at what I still believe is the greatest organization on earth, having had to go through this gauntlet of public criticism and ridicule by none other than the President of the United States has been unbelievably trying.

HUD also noted that Foster was not fired and is still classified as a senior executive service employee. The agency said it's not unusual for such employees to rotate into different roles.\n\n\nFoster says there was another incident not included in the complaint in which she said that she was asked to justify paying for a security system at Carson's house in Virginia using taxpayer funds.

HUD confirmed that the couple made the purchase.\n\n\nThe complaint says that Foster had received positive evaluations since she started working at HUD in July 2016 and that the only reason to remove her from her position as chief administrative officer was the issues she raised about spending and that she is being retaliated against as a whistleblower.

Trump spent the weekend at his estate in South Florida, only an hour's drive from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where 17 people were fatally shot last week. His only mentions of the massacre came in tweets Saturday contending that the FBI was too focused on the Russia investigation to respond to warnings about the alleged shooter and mocking Democrats for failing to pass gun control.\n\n\"You're the president.

The report showed that Cruz had written a racial epithet against African-Americans and a Nazi symbol on his book bag, which his mother had forced him to erase. The investigator said Cruz was suffering from depression and on medication and had told Lynda Cruz he planned to buy a gun, but she couldn't determine why.\n\nA school counselor told the investigator that Lynda Cruz had always tried to help her son and followed through on his therapy and medication, but the counselor was concerned about the youth's desire to buy a gun.\n\nA crisis counselor told the DCF investigator he had visited the school and that he did not believe Cruz was a danger to himself or others. The case was closed, with the investigator concluding that Cruz was receiving help from his mother and counselors, and \"no other referrals or services were needed.\"\n\nAfter Lynda Cruz died in November, Cruz moved into the home of a teenage friend.

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had given Russia until midnight Tuesday to explain how the nerve agent, known as a \"Novichok,\" came to be used in the small town of Salisbury, or face retribution.\n\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Alexey Navalny, an anti-corruption activist seen as Putin's most-effective critic, said that if it's proved conclusively that the Kremlin was behind the poisoning, the British government should eschew \"symbolic gestures\" such as a soccer World Cup boycott or banning Russian propaganda stations, and instead target wealthy Putin allies in the U.K.\n\n\n\nEvgeny Feldman/AP\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, center, sits at the Russia's Central Election commission in Moscow, Dec. 25, 2017.\n\n\n\n\"One scenario, as it seems to me, is Putin's comfortable scenario,\" Navalny said at the Moscow office of his organization, the Anti-Corruption Foundation. That would mean \"quite standard responses,\" Navalny said, such as diplomatic punishments or symbolic sanctions, that he said Putin expects.\n\n\n\"There is a second option,\" he added, \"that would really be painful for Putin and his corrupt circle that consists of applying targeted sanctions on those oligarchs and state officials whose families have been based for a very long time in Great  officials have suggested they're looking at a broad range of retaliatory actions, including diplomatic expulsions, fresh economic sanctions and cyberattacks, and the government has also made clear that it's considering sanctions against individual Putin allies, by imposing visa bans and possibly freezing assets.\n\n\nSergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said it will not respond to May's midnight ultimatum until the U.K. provides details of the nerve agent used. Officials in Moscow, however, have have lined up to reject the British allegations as inventions meant to smear Russia, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman calling them \"fairy tales.\"\n\n\nWith her ultimatum deadline seeming to have passed without Russia acquiescing, May is under pressure to respond toughly amid criticism the U.K. failed to act strongly enough over a previous Russian-linked poisoning, that of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian intelligence officer turned dissident who was murdered with radioactive substance in London in 2006. With Russia seen as mounting an increasingly aggressive challenge to Western countries, there are calls for the U.K. to take a harder line to make the Kremlin take notice.\n\n\nIrking the Kremlin is an area Navalny has experience in. A former lawyer, he came to prominence in Russia by carrying out investigations revealing the alleged illegal wealth of senior officials and members of Putin's circle. Recently, he's built a grassroots movement with tens of thousands of followers, demanding fair elections and an end to official corruption. Regularly jailed for holding rallies against the Kremlin, he was barred from running for president against Putin in elections due to take place this month over a fraud conviction he says is trumped up.\n\n\nNavalny has argued that the Kremlin's pressure points are the oligarchs around it, the few dozen businessmen and friends of Putin who made immense fortunes during his rule, often benefiting from state contracts. The Kremlin will not, Navalny said, be phased by symbolic responses, having got used to them after years of escalating confrontation with Western countries. In particular, he said he is opposed to the proposal to ban RT, the Kremlin-funded broadcaster formerly known as \"Russia Today\" that has been accused of acting as a propaganda outlet. Putin would be untroubled by such a ban, given it's relatively little watched, and it would allow the Kremlin to say censorship exists in Western countries.\n\n\nSuch steps, Navalny, said just allowed Putin to \"use them in his propaganda.\"\n\n\nInstead, he added, the U.K. should take advantage of the concentration of Putin allies' wealth in London. The UK has become a hub for rich Russians under Putin, with large numbers of the country's elite owning property there and educating their children in English schools.\n\n\nNavalny said UK authorities should impose asset freezes and strip visas from oligarchs close to the Kremlin who were enjoying lives in England, saying he could name 20 figures to start with.\n\n\n\"It will lead to the creation of an anti-Putin coalition, one in the shadows for now, inside the Putin establishment,\" Navalny said. \"Up to now, they have seen that Putin solves problems, Putin is able to do whatever he wants \u2014- to shoot down airplanes, to start wars, to lie in every interview, in every conversation with world leaders -- but in a remarkable way he gets away with everything.\"\n\n\n\"And here will be the first example,\" Navalny added, \"if it will all be proved, where it leads to some kind of consequences.\"\n\n\nNavalny told U.K. authorities they should immediately target Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov.\n\n\nUsmanov, one of Russia's richest men, is solidly invested in Britain, where he owns the London soccer club Arsenal FC. The Kremlin has reportedly tapped him when in need of cash for projects; Usmanov even once paying the wages of the coach of Russia's national soccer team.\n\n\nShuvalov, is an influential first deputy prime minister. Navalny has previously alleged that he owns an $18 million, 5,380-square-foot penthouse in central London, despite having an annual government salary of only around $17,000.\n\n\nShuvalov has previously said his income declarations are in order and his earnings are entirely legal. Usmanov has sued Navalny over allegations of being part of a bribery scheme involving Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. Last year he released a video in which he told Navalny, \"I spit on you.\"\n\n\nEnthusiasm for targeting assets belonging to Kremlin-linked figures in London has been expressed in British official circles since Skripal\u2019s poisoning. In particular, there have been calls for Britain to introduce a so-called Magnitsky Act, legislation similar to that already in the U.S. that imposes visa bans and asset freezes on Russians implicated in human-rights abuses.\n\n\nThe Act is named after Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer murdered after he uncovered a $230 million tax fraud involving Russian officials. The U.K. government has also suggested it's considering applying recently introduced legislation allowing for freezes of wealth suspected to be corrupt.\n\n\nNavalny, however, said he feared the U.K. \"unfortunately\" was likely to opt for \"the route of symbolic gestures\" in the latest clash. A large number of individuals identified as close to Putin are already under European Union and U.S. Treasury sanctions imposed over Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

In an interview with ABC News, Manley speculated on possible motivations for the crimes: \u201cIs this driven by an ideology? A philosophy? Is it driven by hate?\u201d\n\n\nIf whoever planted the exploding packages is found to have been motivated by hate, the bombings will be part of a larger trend of an increase in hate crimes in the Texas capital. But experts suspect hate crimes overall are underreported in Texas, and federal and state data obtained by ABC News show very few suspects are ever convicted of hate crimes in the state.\n\n\n\"We don\u2019t know for sure what the motivation is, not until the suspect is caught, questioned and prosecuted will we know that,\" cautioned Ryan Lenz, an investigative writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-bigotry organization.\n\n\nBut he noted that with all of the package bombings apparently aimed at minority residents, \"There is the commonality of target.\"\n\n\n\nJon Herskovitz/Reuters\nThe doorway of a home where a fatal parcel bomb exploded on March 2, 2018 is seen boarded-up in Austin, Texas, March 12, 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\nHate crimes in Texas appear underreported\n\nReports of hate crimes in Austin rose by 46 percent in 2016, but that is against the relatively small totals of 13 in 2015 and 19 in 2016, according to the FBI\u2019s annual report on hate crimes. The city has nearly 950,000 residents.\n\n\nStatewide in Texas -- the nation\u2019s second-most populous state with about 26.9 million residents -- the total number of reported hate crimes in 2016 was just 178, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety\u2019s Texas Crime Report.\n\n\nThat fits the trend of roughly 200 hate crimes getting reported each year to law enforcement agencies in Texas, according to publicly-available Texas Crime Reports analyzed by ABC News.\n\n\nBut those numbers strike hate-crimes expert Brian Levin as suspiciously low for such a big state.\n\n\n\u201cRelative to its population, Texas reports fewer hate crimes than other big states,\u201d said Levin, a criminologist and attorney who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\n\n\nHe noted that California -- which with 38.8 million residents is the only state bigger than Texas -- reported 931 hate crimes in 2016. New York, the nation\u2019s fourth-most populous state with a population of 19.4 million reported 595 such crimes.\n\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong when Texas, as a state, has fewer hate crimes than some of the major cities in the U.S.,\u201d Levin said.\n\n\nTexas had a rate of 0.7 hate crimes reported for every 100,000 residents, far lower than the rate of 3.1 for every 100,000 residents in New York and 2.4 for every 100,000 in California, using 2017 Census population figures.\n\n\n\nJon Herskovitz/Reuters\nLaw enforcement personnel including FBI agents are seen near a home where a parcel bomb exploded in Austin, Texas, March 13, 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just Texas.\n\nLevin said law enforcement in Texas could do more to ensure officers recognize and investigate potential hate crimes.\n\n\nIndeed, Texas does not mandate training for police officers on how to investigate potential hate crimes. Gretchen Gribsby with the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement confirmed.\n\n\nIn addition, Texas\u2019 geography with its high numbers of people living in rural areas may partially explain why there are relatively few reports of hate crimes in the state, said Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\n\u201cLess densely populated areas tend to report fewer hate crimes,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\nBut he said Texas isn't alone in what he said is a general underreporting of such crimes.\n\n\n\u201dHate crimes are wildly underreported, I mean, horrifically underreported,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\nOne reason may be that victims of hate crimes may be reluctant to report what happened, he said.\n\n\n\u201cHate crimes likely aren\u2019t being reported because victims fear law enforcement may not believe them or they may be embarrassed and not report to police at all for fear of putting a target on their home,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\n\nOf the hate crimes reported in Texas, a small number go to court\n\nEven among the relatively small number of incidents reported to police as hate crimes in Texas, a yet smaller number results in cases brought to court.\n\n\nSince 2001, when Texas enacted its current hate-crime law, only in 26 instances was a hate-crime finding requested of the courts, according to the Texas Office of Court Administration.\n\n\nAnd in only 23 of those instances did a judge or jury confirm them as hate crimes, according to Megan LaVoie of the Texas Office of Court Administration said.\n\n\nSo, while roughly 200 hate crimes are reported by Texas law enforcement agencies each year, over a 17-year period only 23 were confirmed by the courts as alleged hate crimes.\n\n\nExperts believe that may be because the state's hate-crime law -- called the Byrd Statute after James Byrd Jr., an African-American man who was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck by white supremacists in 1998 -- has strict limits.\n\n\nThe law, for example, doesn't allow for perpetrators to be found guilty of a hate crime on top of any other crime they committed. It also only allows judges or juries to impose harsher sentences for the hate crime if a prosecutor can prove a suspect was motivated by hate.\n\n\nProving motivation can be nearly impossible, Lenz said.\n\n\n\u201cKnowing the motivation of an assailant and being able to convince a jury that that motivation was the primary motivation in committing that crime is a pretty high hurdle for prosecutors,\u201d Lenz said.\n\n\nA criminal law professor in Texas agreed.\n\n\n\nRicardo B. Brazziell/Austin American-Statesman via AP\nAuthorities work on the scene of an explosion in Austin, March 12, 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to prove some crimes beyond a reasonable doubt without adding another element like motive,\u201d said Brian Serr, professor of criminal law and procedure at Baylor University. \u201cProsecutors have to decide, \u2018Should I take on trying to prove this suspect committed a hate crime when I\u2019m already putting a bad guy in jail for the actual crime committed?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nExperts interviewed by ABC News also said few hate crimes may be tried in court simply because prosecutors may not want to try to prove hate was the suspect\u2019s motive when it is easier to show simply that the suspect is guilty of the crime committed, as Lenz said.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean perpetrators of hate crimes are walking free in Texas, Serr said.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a hate criminal is going to get off the hook if they aren\u2019t prosecuted for a hate crime,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the punishment he deserves without prosecutors having to go thru the process of proving motive.\u201d\n\n\n\nExploding packages\n\nThe first package explosion occurred March 2, killing Anthony Stephan House, a 39-year-old father. Then two other packages blew up on March 12, one of them killing 17-year old Draylen Mason, a talented bass player who was set to enroll at the Butler School of Music at the University of Texas for the next year.\n\n\nInvestigators believe that the trio of bombs displayed a level of sophistication, indicating that the bomb-maker or bomb-makers were highly skilled.\n\n\nThe devices were set up to be detonated by motion like shaking or jostling, which is why they exploded when they were picked up.

The subpoena in that case calls on Fusion GPS to turn over information about the controversial political research project as part of a defamation suit. Fusion GPS has objected.\n\n\nThe defamation case involving the legal request is being argued in a Miami federal court, but because Fusion GPS\u2019 offices are based in Washington, a D.C. federal judge was assigned to oversee the dispute over the subpoena.

The Russian leader's popularity remains high despite his suppression of dissent and reproach from the West over Russia's increasingly aggressive stance in world affairs and alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\nPutin's main challenges in the vote were to obtain a huge margin of victory in order to claim an indisputable mandate. The Central Elections Commission said Putin had won about 72 percent of the vote, based on a count of 22 percent of the country's precincts.\n\n\nRussian authorities had sought to ensure a large turnout to bolster the image that Putin's so-called \"managed democracy\" is robust and offers Russians true choices.\n\n\nHe faced seven minor candidates on the ballot. Putin's most vehement and visible foe, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, was rejected as a candidate because he was convicted of fraud in a case widely regarded as politically motivated. Navalny and his supporters had called for an election boycott but the extent of its success could not immediately be gauged.\n\n\nThe election came amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West, with reports that Moscow was behind the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Britain and that its internet trolls had mounted an extensive campaign to undermine the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Britain and Russia last week announced diplomat expulsions over the spy case and the United States issued new sanctions.\n\n\nRussian officials denounced both cases as efforts to interfere in the Russian election. But the disputes likely worked in Putin's favor, reinforcing the official contention that the West is infected with \"Russophobia\" and is determined to undermine Putin and Russian cultural values.\n\n\nPutin has come to embody Russia's exceptionalism, the sense of the state and culture as an extraordinary entity that is nonetheless under constant attack from outside.\n\n\nThe election took place on the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, one of the most dramatic manifestations of Putin's drive to reassert Russia's power.\n\n\nCrimea and Russia's subsequent support of separatists in eastern Ukraine led to an array of US and European sanctions that, along with falling oil prices, damaged the Russian economy and slashed the ruble's value by half. But Putin's popularity remained strong, apparently buttressed by nationalist pride.\n\n\nIn his next six years in office, Putin is likely to assert Russia's power abroad even more strongly. Just weeks before the election, he announced that Russia has developed advanced nuclear weapons capable of evading missile defenses. The military campaign in Syria is clearly aimed at strengthening Russia's foothold in the Middle East and Russia eagerly eyes possible reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula as a lucrative economic opportunity.\n\n\nAt home, he will be faced with how to groom a successor or devise a strategy to circumvent term limits, how to drive diversification in an economy still highly dependent on oil and gas and how to improve medical care and social services in regions of the sprawling country far removed from the modern glitter of Moscow.\n\n\nCasting his ballot in Moscow, Putin was confident of victory, saying he would consider any percentage of votes a success.\n\n\n\"The program that I propose for the country is the right one,\" he declared.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAngela Charlton in Moscow, Nataliya Vasilyeva in Yekaterinburg and Yuras Karmanau in Minsk, Belarus, contributed.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSee complete Associated Press coverage of the Russian election: \u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took to the floor Wednesday morning to address the emerging bipartisan federal spending deal in the Senate, pointing to several \u201cDemocrat priorities\u201d included in the deal but drawing the line over the lack of a solution for so-called Dreamers whose status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy is in jeopardy after March 5.\n\n\nInterested in Immigration?\nAdd Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\nPelosi announced she and a \u201clarge number\u201d of House Democrats will oppose any deal unless Speaker Paul Ryan commits to a future open immigration debate, complaining House Democrats are second-class members of Congress without a commitment from Ryan.\n\nAs minority leader, Pelosi exercised her power to speak uninterrupted on the House floor for more than two hours \u2013 a speech that continues late Wednesday morning and focused almost entirely on Dreamers.\n\nPelosi said she expects a sweeping budget deal to be unveiled today, boasting that Democrats secured \u201chundreds of billions\u201d of dollars for their legislative priorities by extracting a dollar-for-dollar deal on defense and non-defense spending.\n\nBut she demanded Ryan match Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s commitment to the Senate to open the upper chamber for free and clear debate on immigration.\n\n\u201cSo why can\u2019t we have some sort of commitment on this side?\u201d Pelosi asked Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the speaker does intend to address immigration reform.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Ryan has already repeatedly stated we intend to do a DACA and immigration reform bill \u2013 one that the president supports,\u201d Strong said in a statement.\n\nPelosi pointed to a bipartisan bill fronted by Reps.

GOP Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an \"unbecoming squabble\" but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed.\n\n\nThe Senate's presiding officer is Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who vowed Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sparking a showdown at the state Capitol between gun-rights supporters and one of Georgia's largest private employers.\n\n\nThe Delta provision barely came up in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to reimburse Georgia taxpayers for $5.2 billion in extra state revenues expected in the next five years because of the recent federal tax changes approved by Congress.\n\n\nA day after Deal blamed election-year posturing for Delta debate, Cagle took a softer tone in celebrating victory Thursday.\n\n\n\"Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it's all about the product,\" said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. \"And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of.\"\n\n\nEven as Deal sought Wednesday to minimize potential damage to Georgia's business-friendly reputation, the GOP-dominated Senate Rules Committee chopped from the broader tax bill a provision to lift the state sales tax on jet fuel.\n\n\nRank-and-file Republicans in the Senate stood by Cagle's threat to squash the jet fuel perk, which he announced Monday with a tweet that said: \"Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\"\n\n\nThe chamber took up the full tax bill Thursday with a 34-15 vote to prohibit amendments, blocking any efforts to restore the Delta tax break. No Republicans opposed the parliamentary move.\n\n\nThe tax bill had previously passed the state House before the Delta-NRA controversy erupted, with the jet fuel exemption intact. But the House quickly approved the Senate's version Thursday with a 135-24 vote.\n\n\n\"It's been strenuous,\" said GOP Sen. Michael Williams of Cumming, another candidate for governor. \"We've been attacked by the media, we've been attacked by the left. Big corporate has gone after us. And we've stayed strong. We've even stayed strong against our own governor.\"\n\n\nAmong Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift actions on guns after the Florida shootings. She said Delta's decision to end its NRA discounts swayed her to support the jet fuel tax break.\n\n\n\"The small steps that Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,\" the Democratic lawmaker said. \"We're the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing.\"\n\n\nDick's Sporting Goods had previously announced it would no longer sell assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida shooting.\n\n\nDeal, serving his last year in office, said he plans to sign the broader tax bill, even if it's without the airline tax break he had pushed for. Deal said he will pursue exempting jet fuel from sales taxes separately.\n\n\nThat could be a tough sell with GOP leaders in the legislature. Though he refrained Thursday from further fiery rhetoric on Delta, Cagle showed no softening of his opposition to the jet fuel exemption.\n\n\n\"I think everyone knows my position on this issue, so I don't see any wiggle room, no,\" Cagle told reporters.\n\n\nDelta's decision to stop offering NRA members discounted fares was announced in the wake of the deadly Valentine's Day shooting at a Florida high school. The airline employs 33,000 workers in Georgia. Its busy Atlanta hub has made Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport the busiest in the world.\n\n\nDeal has said the broader tax bill \"represents one of the single largest income tax reforms in the history of our state.\" It would cut the top income tax rate for individuals and businesses from 6 to 5.75 percent in 2019, with the option for legislators to further cut it to 5.5 percent in 2020.

It was meant to address a significant crime problem of that era: the frequent use of machine guns by gangsters in high-profile killings like the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre.\n\n\nNew machine guns were effectively banned for the civilian U.S. market when the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.\n\n\nNo machine guns produced after May 19, 1986, could be sold or possessed. With the right Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) paperwork and tax payments, machine guns made before that date can still be purchased on the private market, but because of the 1986 ban, prices have skyrocketed due to demand outpacing the limited supply.\n\n\nGun experts say a machine gun can cost anywhere from several thousand to several hundred thousand dollars.\n\n\nThe money the Trump DOJ wants to spend, $13.2 million, would go to \u201caddress workload\u201d and reduce the backlog of applications under the federal National Firearms Act.\n\n\nIt\u2019s aimed at reducing the time it takes the ATF to approve the transfer and sale of devices regulated under the act, including machine guns, silencers, short-barreled shotguns, short-barreled rifles and other \u201cdestructive devices,\u201d including bombs.\n\n\n\u201cATF is overwhelmed with NFA paperwork,\u201d according to Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the leading gun industry trade group. \u201cIt has been a significant problem. It takes eight to nine months to process a single form,\u201d Keane told ABC News.\n\n\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\nThis undated photo shows the ATF Reference Library, a working collection of more than 15,000 firearms.\n\n\n\n\nGun industry experts say the bulk of applications under the act are for silencers and so-called \u201cshorty\u201d guns, rifles and shotguns with barrels less than 16 or 18 inches respectively. The latest 2017 ATF data shows there are more than 630,000 machine guns registered with the ATF and more than 1.36 million silencers registered. Last year, according to ATF, more than 5.2 million weapons were registered under the NFA.\n\n\nSilencers have become a popular accessory for gun enthusiasts and silencer manufacturers have pressed to have the devices, which have the effect of muffling the sound of gunfire, to be deregulated in the Hearing Protection Act of 2017. That measure was introduced last year in the House of Representatives but was tabled after the Las Vegas massacre last October that killed 58 people.\n\n\nThe number of silencers registered with the ATF has exploded in recent years, more than tripling since 2011, going from 360,000 registered silencers in 2011 to more than 1,360,000 in 2017. The number of silencers jumped 50 percent from 2016 and 2017, according to ATF data reviewed by ABC News.\n\n\nThe president\u2019s son, Donald Trump, Jr., has been a big supporter of the Hearing Protection Act and recorded a video touting the benefits of the accessory with Joshua Waldron, CEO of top silencer manufacturer SilencerCo. Silencers are now legal in 40 states.\n\n\nKeane says NSSF supports additional funding for ATF\u2019s law enforcement mission, but that they have an industry mission that needs to be supported as well. He says ATF is chronically understaffed.\n\n\nAccording to President Trump\u2019s budget request, the additional funding would pay for 25 more people to \u201csupport the timely and effective registration of restricted weapons under the National Firearms Act while upholding the constitutional rights of the American people.\u201d\n\n\nBut current and former ATF officials who spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity say reducing the backlog of applications for NFA restricted weapons has little to do with violent crime. \u201cIt would have minimal to no effect on combatting violent crime,\u201d one former ATF official said. \u201cIt appears to be a compromise for the gun lobby,\u201d the former official added.\n\n\nUnder the NFA, a machine gun is defined as, \u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d That means if more than one bullet is fired from a single trigger pull, it\u2019s a machine gun. This the reason why, current and former ATF officials say, bump stocks are difficult to regulate \u2013 the law defines a machine gun in plain language they say permits bump stocks. A bump stock slides back and forth on a rifle making it easier for the user to pull the trigger in rapid succession, with one bullet being fired with each trigger pull.\n\n\nJustice Department officials could not say exactly how reducing the NFA backlog would reduce violent crime. They would only say that some prohibited purchasers could be rejected in the application process. Those rejections would still happen in the existing system, but they would occur more slowly. Either way, a prohibited purchaser would not be allowed to buy an NFA regulated weapon.\n\n\nThe NFA approval process is distinguished from standard firearms background check in that the weapon is registered with the federal government. The application process also requires the submission of fingerprints a photograph and notification to local law enforcement official that an application for an NFA weapon is being made.\n\n\nUnder the Trump administrations budget request for reducing violent crime, the $13.2 million to fix the NFA backlog is far more than the $8.9 million requested for increasing gun intelligence capabilities to solve violent crimes. Current and former ATF agents say the money would be better spent on hiring and training new agents that could enforce existing gun laws.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "More From", "body": "The president's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been stripped of his temporary, high-level security clearance under new rules imposed by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly designed to crack down on West Wing staff with long-pending background investigations, sources tell ABC News.\n\n\n\nInterested in Trump Administration?\nAdd Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\n\n\n\n\nThat means Kushner, whose portfolio includes the solving the Middle East peace process, will no longer have regular access to the nation's most closely guarded secrets as the FBI continues its nearly 15-month review of his application for permanent clearance. Kelly's action was not limited to Kushner alone, the sources said.\n\n\nThe move became effective last Friday.\n\n\nThe White House would not comment on the record about Kushner\u2019s clearance.\n\n\nSources familiar with the matter say Kushner's downgraded clearance may still allow him access to sensitive information, but details are unclear. Officials familiar with the matter stressed that Kushner, like others previously on a temporary clearance including Ivanka Trump and White House Counsel Don McGahn, could eventually receive full clearance once the background checks are complete.\n\n\nEarlier this month, Kelly and McGahn implored Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to expedite Kushner's review, but Rosenstein informed the White House that the FBI could not move any faster and that the check was still ongoing, one source told ABC News.\n\n\nKelly's move came a week after he declared in a five-page memo to staff that he'd end all temporary Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information clearances for staffers who have had background check investigations pending since June 2017. Kushner's application has been pending since January 2017. Sensitive compartmented information reveals sources and methods by which intelligence is gathered, making it highly valuable.\n\n\nIn a statement after his memo was released, Kelly said he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Kushner\u2019s abilities to advise the president, but made clear his duties were limited to \u201chis foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israel-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico.\u201d\n\n\nThe directive came as Kelly faced mounting criticism for his handling of the resignation of former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter. It was revealed earlier this month that Porter's application for top clearance had been denied by the FBI after they uncovered allegations of violent domestic abuse in his past.\n\n\nOne White House official questioned the wisdom of Kelly's decision, suggesting it would be unwise for the Chief of Staff \"to go to war with Jared over this.\"\n\n\nTrump said Friday that the decision on Kushner\u2019s status was up to Kelly alone.\n\n\n\"General Kelly respects Jared a lot, and General Kelly will make that call,\u201d Trump told reporters at an afternoon press conference. \u201cI will let General Kelly make that decision. And he's going to do what's right for the country, and I have no doubt he will make the right decision.\"\n\n\nKushner has, at times, clashed with Kelly since he took over as chief of staff last summer and sought to impose a more stringent chain of command in the West Wing, with Kushner reporting to him, sources familiar with their relationship have told ABC. Prior to Kelly's arrival, Kushner had unlimited direct access to the President.\n\n\nWhite House officials and sources close to Kushner would not explain how Kushner could maintain access to some highly classified information without the temporary clearance, but the office of the presidency comes with unfettered authority to declassify information, giving Trump a unique ability to share information with Kushner as he sees fit. It\u2019s unclear if the president would exercise that authority.\n\n\nNational security attorney Mark Zaid, who often handles clearance cases, said in an interview with ABC that although there is nothing stopping the president from declassifying information for Kushner, the president would have to consider that \"once it's declassified for one, it's declassified for all.\"\n\n\nZaid also says it possible the president could declassify information and then reclassify it before making it public, but by law that process would need to be documented. \"The optics of that would obviously be horrible,\" Zaid said.\n\n\nKushner\u2019s security clearance application has been caught up for well over a year after he failed to disclose some contacts he had with foreign officials -- including Russians -- as required by law.\n\n\nAnother attorney for Kushner, Jamie Gorelick, has previously stated that Kushner's security clearance form, known as an SF-86, was \"prematurely submitted\" and that \"among other errors, [it] did not list any contacts with foreign government officials.\" Kushner has since updated the questionnaire multiple times to with all relevant meetings, including \"over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries,\" Gorelick told ABC News.\n\n\nAs a former businessman, Kushner also has numerous financial dealings that the FBI is currently reviewing, which could further account for the delay.\n\n\nNevertheless, it is very uncommon for one of the closest aides to the president to remain without formal permanent clearance more than a year into the administration. National security lawyer Bradley Moss told ABC that security clearance background checks for staffers close to the president are expedited because of the sensitivity of their position. For a senior staffer like Kushner to have a 15 month investigation, even considering his complex financial background, is \"highly unusual,\" Moss said.\n\n\nLast week President Trump seemed to blame the system, rather than Kushner himself. \u201cWe inherited a system that's broken. It's taken months and months and months to get many people that do not have the complex financial -- complicated financials, they don't have that. It's still taken months.

We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign\".\n\nIn one of the covertly recorded meetings, Mr Turnbull said Cambridge Analytica pushed its \"Defeat Crooked Hillary\" campaign onto millions of social media users.\n\n\"The 'OO' of 'Crooked' were a pair of handcuffs and it was all about \u2026 she belongs behind bars,\" Mr Turnbull said.\n\nMr Turnbull said the campaign was pushed through proxy organisations such as charities and activist groups.\n\n\"We just put information into the bloodstream [of] the internet and then \u2026 watch it grow,\" he said.\n\n\"Give it a little push every now and again over time, to watch it take shape.\n\nMr Nix told the undercover reporters he was \"absolutely convinced\" US investigators had no jurisdiction to obtain information about the firm's foreign clients.\n\nHe also instructed the reporters to set up a secure ProtonMail account, which deleted emails.\n\n\"No-one knows we have it. We set our ProtonMail emails with a self destruct timer \u2026 so that you send them, and after they've been read two hours later they disappear,\" Mr Nix said.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica from June 2014 to August 2016.\n\nIn August 2016, Mr Bannon became chief executive of the Trump campaign. He was fired a year later.\n\nOn Saturday Mr Trump's campaign denied using Cambridge Analytica's data, saying it instead relied on information from the Republican National Committee (RNC).\n\n\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"\n\nTrump campaign officials downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.", "link": null, "source": "ABC News Australia", "location": [{"country": "AU", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
