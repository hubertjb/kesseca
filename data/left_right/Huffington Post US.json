[{"author": "Marina Fang", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 John Bolton, who\u00a0President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0said on Thursday\u00a0will replace H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser on April 9, is a polarizing pick, even by Trump administration standards.\u00a0\n\n\nBolton is a notoriously hawkish former United Nations ambassador whose\u00a0views don\u2019t even align with the isolationist foreign policy platform on which Trump campaigned\u00a0\u2015 although it is difficult to tell what the president actually believes. \n\n\nBolton has had Trump\u2019s ear, both as an informal adviser and as a commentator on Fox News, for a while. As a presidential candidate, Trump called Bolton \u201ca tough cookie [who] knows what he\u2019s talking about\u201d\u00a0(although the president apparently is\u00a0not a fan of his mustache).\n\n\nHere is a brief history of the new national security adviser\u2019s career in foreign policy:\u00a0\n\n\nBolton fiercely advocated for the Iraq War and promoted the false justification for it.\n\n\nWhile serving as a top State Department official under President George W. Bush, Bolton was a chief promulgator of the administration\u2019s justification for the Iraq War: that U.S. intelligence showed evidence of Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Famously, this claim later turned out to be false.\n\n\nBut Bolton continued to insist that he was right in calling for war, even years later.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam [Hussein] was correct,\u201d he told the Washington Examiner in 2015. \u201cI think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, \u2018Oh, things would have been much better if you didn\u2019t overthrow Saddam,\u2019 miss the point that today\u2019s Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t assume if he had stayed in power, sweetness and light would prevail in the Middle East today,\u201d he added.\n\n\nHe has called for bombing Iran and North Korea.\n\n\nThis does not bode well for diplomatic efforts, such as Trump\u2019s apparent plan to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In fact, Bolton said on Fox News earlier this month that he predicts the meeting will fail\u00a0\u2015 which he suggested would likely lead to military action.\n\n\n\n\nHe damaged the United States\u2019 foreign policy reputation while serving as the ambassador to the U.N.\n\n\nBolton has a history of speaking about international organizations with derision. While at the U.N., Bolton criticized it as \u201ca twilight zone.\u201d\u00a0His extreme views and brash manner alienated many U.S. allies.\n\n\nHe has aligned himself with anti-Muslim hate groups.\n\n\nBetween his work at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, commentating on Fox News, and writing op-ed columns for right-leaning publications, Bolton has\u00a0promoted Islamophobic conspiracy theories\u00a0and\u00a0supported anti-Islam organizations\u00a0that have appeared on the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s list of hate groups.\n\n\nHe joked that former President Barack Obama was a Muslim.\n\n\nWhile speaking at an event for one such hate group, Bolton joked about Obama\u00a0being Muslim.

I realized if we don\u2019t start now, it\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d \n\n\nMore than 150,000 students in the U.S. have experienced a shooting on campus since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, according to a Washington Post analysis. \n\n\nLebrun and a few other students from Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland, helped coordinate lodging for teens who are coming to D.C. for the march but might have trouble finding or affording a hotel room.\u00a0\n\n\nTeens are expected to travel to Washington from all over the country, and some area restaurants are offering\u00a0free or discounted meals to student activists.\u00a0More than 100 GoFundMe campaigns have sprung up to organize bus trips to marches in major cities, according to a spokesperson for the crowdfunding platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLilly Pribish, a 17-year-old high school junior from outside of St. Louis, plans to attend the march by herself and stay with family in the D.C. area. \n\n\n\u201cHaving Congress and the people in power right now see how many people are supporting these victims of gun violence \u2026 hopefully that pushes the fact that there needs to be a change,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is serious now \u2014 like, it\u2019s not a joke, and there\u2019s a lot of people that are done with seeing issues like this on the news.\u201d\n\n\nMarch For Our Lives Action Fund, the 501(c)(4) nonprofit connected to the event, has raised millions of dollars. The money is covering expenses associated with the D.C. march, but will also be used to\u00a0lobby for gun safety legislation. It\u2019s not clear what those legislative priorities are yet, and it\u2019s likely they will continue to evolve. A board of directors, which includes public servants, legal experts and professionals, will work with a student advisory board to make decisions on how to spend the money, a spokesperson\u00a0told HuffPost. \u00a0\n\n\n\nAs a 17-year-old, I really don\u2019t have a voice in Congress or in politics because there\u2019s not much I can do. If there\u2019s an opportunity for my voice to be heard, to do something, I\u2019m going to take that.\nLilly Pribish, student\n\n\nTop Republican lawmakers have so far shown little appetite for major reforms. Generating the political will to take more forceful steps, like mandating universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons \u2014 two priorities of the student activists from Parkland \u2014 is likely to be a tough road. Both proposals have failed to gain traction after prior mass shootings.\n\n\nThe only congressional legislation that currently has broad bipartisan support is the Fix NICS Act, which aims to reform the National Instant Criminal Background Check System by improving data collection for state and national law enforcement agencies. Capitol Hill leaders included the limited step in this week\u2019s government spending agreement, which also features language that would lift a long-standing ban on federal gun violence research.\n\n\nIn addition to supporting Fix NICS, President Donald Trump\u00a0released a minimal set of proposals, largely backed by the National Rifle Association. He has backpedaled after boasting\u00a0that he would stand up to the NRA\u00a0and suggesting he might be open to measures such as raising the minimum age for gun purchases, which the NRA opposes.\n\n\nBut students planning to attend Saturday\u2019s march in Washington told HuffPost that they hoped the event \u2015 and the\u00a0\u201cthe sheer volume\u201d of activists coming out to protest gun violence, as Pribish said \u2015 could start to move the needle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI hope that there will be real change, instead of this bogus [proposal] that the president has put forth, which doesn\u2019t even mention assault weapons at all,\u201d said John Papanier, a 17-year-old high school senior from Staten Island, New York. \u201cI\u2019m talking real laws. They\u2019re just trying to quiet us with a joke of a [proposal].\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many counter-rallies might take place. Spokespeople for the Second Amendment Foundation and the National Association for Gun Rights told HuffPost earlier this month that they were not aware of any. News reports have since indicated that protests planned in Indiana, Montana (dubbed \u201cMarch For Our Guns\u201d) and Utah (\u201cMarch Before Our Lives\u201d). In New Jersey, parents reportedly plan to rally for armed security officers in schools.\n\n\nMarch For Our Lives will help gauge whether students can sustain the momentum of their movement and push lawmakers to act.\u00a0The event follows last week\u2019s\u00a0National School Walkout, when high school students around the country left class to hold a moment of silence for the Parkland victims. Students are planning a similar walkout on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine.\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest test of this activism is still to come: It has yet to be seen whether the momentum can make it to the ballot box. But for now, teens \u2014 some of whom can\u2019t even vote yet \u2014 are leading that charge and refusing to stay quiet.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAs a 17-year-old, I really don\u2019t have a voice in Congress or in politics because there\u2019s not much I can do,\u201d Pribish said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity for my voice to be heard, to do something, I\u2019m going to take that.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carla Herreria", "body": "President Donald Trump announced Friday\u00a0that he\u2019s sticking to his ban on transgender people in the military, even though the Pentagon showed little enthusiasm for the proposal.\n\n\nIn a memo released Friday night,\u00a0the White House said that transgender individuals are \u201cdisqualified from military service except under limited circumstances.\u201d\u00a0The full ban was set to officially take effect\u00a0Friday, though a pair of federal courts in December ordered the U.S. military to allow the recruitment of transgender citizens into the armed forces despite Trump\u2019s declaration.\n\n\n\u201cTransgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria \u2015 individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery \u2015 are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances,\u201d the memo says.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to keep the ban comes one month after a Washington Post report suggested that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would urge Trump to allow transgender citizens to continue serving in the military.\n\n\nMattis delivered his recommendations to Trump in late February, but their conversation remained private.\n\n\nIn a statement following the memo, the White House said Friday\u2019s announcement allows Mattis to \u201cimplement a new policy developed through extensive study by senior uniformed and civilian leaders, including combat veterans.\u201d\n\n\nThe White House added that Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have concluded that the \u201caccession or retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria ... presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\u201d\n\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s controversial transgender military ban has faced opposition at every corner since Trump announced the policy change in a series of surprising tweets last summer.\n\n\nIn July, Trump said he was banning transgender citizens from the armed forces because of the supposed \u201cburden\u201d of their \u201ctremendous medical costs.\u201d (Transition-related care costs the military only a fraction of its overall budget. The Department of Defense spends tremendously more on Viagra\u00a0for erectile dysfunction than it does on transgender medical costs.)\u00a0\n\n\nHis tweets, which reportedly took the Pentagon by surprise, were followed by an official White House memo sent to the departments of defense and homeland security that provided details and a timeline for his proposed ban.\u00a0\n\n\nThe memo required the armed forces to stop accepting transgender recruits by Jan. 1 and halt the use of federal funds for transition-related care for military personnel by March 22.\n\n\nDespite the memo, the Pentagon began accepting transgender recruits again on Jan. 1, complying with federal court orders calling for a halt to the ban while it was being legally challenged.\n\n\nIn late February, the U.S. military accepted its first openly transgender recruit\u00a0to sign up for service since Trump\u2019s pronouncement. The Department of Defense confirmed that the recruit had signed a contract for service in the military and would be attending basic training in the coming months.\n\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said that the Defense Department will continue allowing transgender people in the military as ordered by the federal court, despite the Trump administration\u2019s announcement.

Really, it was a different mindset, a different thinking.\u201d \n\n\nThat different way of thinking had been apparent from the start of Tillerson\u2019s stint at State, visible not only in the secretary\u2019s disagreement with Trump on how best to handle North Korea, but also in the pettier matters that have come to define this pitiful presidency. Tillerson, a former Eagle Scout, reportedly objected to Trump\u2019s gross politicization of his visit to the Boy Scout Jamboree over the summer. And he found the president\u2019s ability to command basic facts so unimpressive that he reportedly referred to Trump as a moron\u00a0in front of other administration officials.\n\n\nWhile the coming negotiations with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un provided a useful cover for Trump\u2019s hasty actions, Tillerson\u2019s exit really owed to his failure to fall in line with the president, something Trump assured reporters would not be a problem with his new appointee to State, Mike Pompeo. \u201cWe\u2019re always on the same wavelength,\u201d Trump said of Pompeo. \n\n\nPerhaps anticipating more criticism of the continually revolving door that is the White House these days, Trump defended his move. \u201cI\u2019m really at a point where we\u2019re getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things I want,\u201d Trump explained, as if the West Wing\u2019s constant turnover was some refining process of personnel rather than a crisis of presidential leadership. \n\n\nOn Thursday, Trump continued his staffing shuffle, naming John Bolton as his new national security adviser in place of H.R. McMaster. Trump\u2019s selection of Bolton, the warmongering U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under George W. Bush, is a chilling prospect for those who hoped Trump\u2019s saber-rattling with North Korea might be tempered by cooler heads inside the White House. Bolton is an aggressive hawk who is certain to cheerlead Trump\u2019s worst impulses. \n\n\nAll of these moves undercut Trump\u2019s businessman boasts that he would bring only the \u201cbest people\u201d to Washington, of course. But they also make plain that the real business of this administration is to serve Trump\u2019s ego rather than the nation. In cutting out dissenters or even strong counterweights in his administration for the steady stream of sycophants and, let\u2019s not forget, fawning family members he has gathered around him, Trump has ensured his White House will never be mistaken for Abraham Lincoln\u2019s \u201cteam of rivals.\u201d Instead, Trump is assembling a cabal of cronies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early American administrations, presidential Cabinets often included fractious elements who battled with each other and their president over what the young nation\u2019s course should be. But Lincoln\u2019s decision to appoint the three men he had defeated for the Republican nomination in 1860 \u2013 William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates \u2013 along with three former Democrats to his Cabinet established the adversarial model that subsequent presidents would follow. \n\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt may have best continued the tradition. Faced with the challenges of leading the country through the Great Depression and up against a Republican Party that wanted him to fail, FDR might have chosen a Cabinet that affirmed his every step. Instead, Roosevelt selected a team of advisers notorious for arguing and rarely in agreement. Believing the best ideas would arise out of this maelstrom, FDR understood that he would have to first take on counterarguments inside his own ranks if he hoped to bring about the large-scale changes he desired for the country. \n\n\nOther presidents followed suit. John F. Kennedy chose two Republicans to fill spots in his Cabinet, a move he hoped demonstrated a bipartisan spirit after a razor-thin win over Richard Nixon in 1960. Just as FDR had wanted his staff to challenge his ideas on how to deal with the nation\u2019s economic crisis, JFK purposefully sought voices of disagreement as he determined how to handle the escalating tensions with the Soviet Union. The strategy paid off during the Cuban missile crisis. \n\n\nMore recently, George W. Bush assembled a Cabinet that included powerful, qualified officials, including Robert Gates and Colin Powell, to fill in the spots where his inexperience would show. (Trump has shown no similar thoughtfulness about how a carefully selected Cabinet could help cover up his glaring inadequacies as chief executive.)\n\n\nBarack Obama frequently cited Lincoln\u2019s \u201cteam of rivals\u201d style of leadership as the reason for stocking his administration with his former competitors for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, and picking three Republicans for his Cabinet. (One of those, Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, withdrew from consideration before he was confirmed as secretary of commerce, however.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is no student of history, certainly, and his leadership style veers more to the impulsive than the pragmatic. Still, it\u2019s worth taking stock of the personality cult Trump has built for himself inside the White House, and what it means for the nation that he is using the presidency as his personal form of therapy.\n\n\nStaff members provide Trump with folders twice a day filled with favorable news articles, flattering tweets, and even pictures of the president for him to pore over. This for a man who can\u2019t be bothered to read national security briefings, we might remember.\n\n\nRecall also the Cabinet meetings that have begun with Trump calling on each member to praise him and express appreciation for working for him. Other presidents usually prefer hearing updates about the work those secretaries\u2019 departments are carrying out, but Trump has made clear to those around him that what he most wants to hear is how well they think he is doing. The nation can take care of itself. \n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no pushback. But Tillerson\u2019s experience shows what a self-defeating approach that voicing dissent can be in this White House. Jeff Sessions may be the next to learn the lesson. Although one of Trump\u2019s first and most enthusiastic backers, Sessions now finds himself on the outs with the president and possibly next in the firing line due to his refusal to follow some of Trump\u2019s ideas about how to use the Justice Department.\n\n\nWhether Sessions stays or goes, Trump will continue to use the threat of expulsion to draw out unquestioning adherence and unwavering loyalty \u2013 his favorite word \u2013 from those around him. But most of that effort will be merely for show. Trump consults few of his advisers, in fact, and relies mostly on his own flawed and impetuous judgment. In the end, this emperor has no close associates. \n\n\nFrighteningly, Trump\u2019s tendencies for isolation and self-direction will only increase in whatever time he has left in office. As The New York Times reported\u00a0 this week, Trump, having grown confident in the role of president, now feels \u201cnewly emboldened\u201d to ignore the advice of those around him and follow only his own instincts. \n\n\nAfter more than a year in office, Trump may have finally found his sea legs. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s captaining the Titanic while his obsequious lackeys in the White House quietly rearrange the deck chairs.\n\n\nNeil J.

At one point, Trump and his advisers had been pushing for $25 billion for the project.\n\n\nHouse Speaker\u00a0Paul Ryan\u2019s office Wednesday evening touted $1.6 billion in the bill that would pay for \u201cphysical barriers and infrastructure, and funding for related technology and personnel\u201d along 95 miles. And Trump himself\u00a0tweeted\u00a0later that night: \u201cGot $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.\u201d\n\n\nBut Democrats pointed out that only $641 million of that money is designated for 33 miles of \u201cnew fencing or levees\u201d \u2015 specifically not a concrete wall. The rest of the money is for repairing or replacing existing fencing or border security technology.\n\n\nThe White House press office did not respond to a HuffPost query regarding the lack of wall money in the omnibus bill. Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement generally praising the spending plan that had still not been finalized.\n\n\nTrump promised from the day he began his campaign in June 2015 that he would build a \u201cgreat wall\u201d to keep out illegal immigrants from Mexico.\n\n\n\u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d Trump boasted during his Trump Tower announcement speech. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\u201d\n\n\nOver the next 17 months, he promised hundreds of times that he would build the wall quickly, and at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Trump explained that his wall would be at least 30 feet tall and extend deep underground to prevent tunneling. At a December 2015 visit to Manassas, Virginia, Trump even went into construction details.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be made of hardened concrete, and it\u2019s going to be made out of rebar. That\u2019s steel,\u201d Trump said in response to a boy\u2019s question. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to set (the rebar) in nice, heavy foundations.\u201d\n\n\nBut having Mexico pay for a wall that that country does not even support was never a realistic possibility. A planned meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was recently canceled because Pe\u00f1a Nieto would not back away from his refusal to pay.\n\n\nGetting Congress to appropriate as much as $25 billion of American taxpayer money for Trump\u2019s project has also proved difficult. Democrats hold enough votes to block a spending bill, and they have refused to go along with Trump\u2019s wall unless he agrees to a bill that protects undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. They have been allowed to work in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created by former President Barack Obama. Trump canceled DACA last year, a decision that is now tied up in the courts.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, predicted during a February White House briefing that the border wall money was essentially contingent on Trump and Congress agreeing on a DACA fix.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) had asked the FBI director about the \u201ccounterintelligence risk posed to U.S. national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in science and mathematics.\u201d\n\n\nWray responded by accusing Chinese individuals in academia, from professors to scientists to students, of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of and \u201cexploiting the very open research and development environment\u201d in the U.S.\n\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end,\u201d Wray said during the hearing. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us.\u201d\n\n\nWray\u2019s initial statement had garnered immense criticism from Asian-American civil rights groups, who wrote a letter demanding a meeting with the FBI chief. The coalition of 14 organizations who signed the note described the Chinese community\u2019s anger at being labeled a threat and warned that \u201cwell-intentioned public policies might nonetheless lead to troubling issues of potential bias, racial profiling, and wrongful prosecution.\u201d\n\n\nBut in speaking with NBC News, Wray only doubled down on his remarks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cBut when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.\u201d\n\n\nHe added that both the Chinese government and Chinese companies have been searching for trade secrets and have targeted U.S. companies across industries to acquire them.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Wray touched on his comments during the interview with NBC, he has yet to respond to the civil rights coalition\u2019s request for a meeting,\u00a0John C.

A white paper published by the nonpartisan Chinese-American organization Committee of 100\u00a0in June revealed that Asians\u00a0were more likely to be charged with economic espionage than any other group. They were also found innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals of any other race.\u00a0But when they were convicted, those with Asian-sounding names were given sentences twice as long than those with Western-sounding names.\n\n\nXiaoxing Xi, a Chinese-American professor, sued FBI agents who stormed his house in 2015, rounded up his family at gunpoint and arrested him. Xi was threatened with up to 80 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million. Though the charges were abruptly dropped with little explanation, the professor had already lost his position as the interim chairman of the physics department at Temple University and was put on administrative leave for a period of time.\u00a0\n\n\nHydrologist Sherry Chen, who\u2019s also Chinese-American, was also prosecuted on espionage-related charges.

The new map is expected to make congressional elections more competitive in the state.\n\n\n\u201cAs Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, I am very concerned by the reported filing of impeachment resolutions against Justices of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania related to the Court\u2019s decision about congressional redistricting,\u201d\u00a0Saylor said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThreats of impeachment directed against Justices because of their decision in a particular case are an attack upon an independent judiciary, which is an essential component of our constitutional plan of government.\u201d\n\n\nSaylor and Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy, the only other Republican on the seven-member court, were the only justices who voted against striking down the map.\n\n\nChristopher Borick, a professor of political science at Muhlenberg College, said it was uncommon for a sitting Supreme Court justice to speak out the way Saylor did.\n\n\n\u201cThis is a very unusual move on the part of the Chief Justice and reflects the unprecedented calls for impeachment against a number of justices,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe Court rarely makes such public statements toward another institution of government and in this case the rattling of the impeachment sword was loud enough to make Saylor react to a threat to the independence of the judiciary.\u201d\n\n\nState Rep. Cris Dush (R), who has led the call for impeachment, denied in a Wednesday interview that he sought retribution or to intimidate Democrats on the court. He also said he had received guarantees from House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R), the chair of the state government committee, that they would allow a vote on the impeachment legislation.\n\n\nA majority of the House must vote to advance impeachment proceedings to the Senate, where two-thirds of the body must vote to remove an official from office. As of January, Republicans control 120 of 203 seats in the state House and 34 of 50 seats in the state Senate. The impeachment power is rarely used in the state.\n\n\nThe impeachment talk comes the same week that the United States Supreme Court and a lower federal court\u00a0rejected Republican challenges to the state court\u2019s decision.

I didn\u2019t seek this job,\u201d he admitted to the conservative news outlet Independent Journal Review in March.\n\n\n\u201cMy wife told me I\u2019m supposed to do this,\u201d he responded when an aide asked him why he accepted the position anyway.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce in office, Tillerson sought to reorganize the State Department and prioritize its activities toward business and security. He publicly illustrated the pivot after weeks on the job, opting to skip the presentation\u00a0of the department\u2019s annual human rights report.\n\n\nDuring his tenure, the department faced drastic budget cuts and a crucial leadership vacuum. Amid massive international challenges like North Korea\u2019s nuclear arms race and the war in Syria, Trump proposed cutting the State Department budget by nearly one-third.\u00a0Dozens of vacancies remained unfilled, including top deputies, because of White House refusal to accept Tillerson\u2019s picks.\u00a0\n\n\nTillerson and the White House also clashed on policy and messaging. \u00a0\n\n\nAs a diplomatic crisis in Qatar unfolded, Trump directly undermined Tillerson\u2019s calls for calm,\u00a0expressing support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic and diplomatic blockade of the Gulf state, and accusing Qatar of funding terrorism.\n\n\nIn an August interview, Tillerson declined to defend Trump\u2019s support for \u201cAmerica\u2019s values,\u201d telling Fox News that \u201cthe president speaks for himself.\u201d The questioning arose during a conversation about Trump\u2019s much criticized response to\u00a0violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u00a0earlier that month, when counterprotesters clashed with hate groups protesting the planned removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\n\nFrom the White House, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, often ran a parallel track of diplomacy \u2015 traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories to explore ways to revive peace talks, and interacting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\u00a0\n\n\nSources told CNN in July that Tillerson was becoming increasingly frustrated with the White House. In late August, Axios reported that Trump was losing patience with his secretary of state, in part because key roles at the department still remained unfilled more than eight months into Trump\u2019s presidency. A State Department spokesperson told Axios that Tillerson was working to fill the vacancies but that the White House was effectively sitting on his recommendations.\u00a0\n\n\nNauert had repeatedly insisted\u00a0Tillerson was not considering resignation. Asked if a July vacation indicated Tillerson wanted to step away from the spotlight, Nauert said the secretary was \u201cjust taking a little time off\u201d after that month\u2019s G-20 summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTillerson, like Trump, wasn\u2019t a fan of reporters\u2019 questions, doing away with the State Department\u2019s daily briefing and limiting media access during his foreign travels.\u00a0\n\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t \u201ca big media press-access person,\u201d when he allowed just one journalist \u2015 a reporter from the Independent Journal Review \u2015 to accompany him on a visit to South Korea.

The spending spree follows another budget buster \u2015 their $1.5 trillion unpaid tax cut.\n\n\nThe splurge sets a drastically different tone for a party that not long ago professed to be extremely worried about the budget deficit, whose members screamed about a looming fiscal apocalypse and demanded dollar-for-dollar cuts in exchange for proposed spending increases by former President Barack Obama.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t begin to deal with our debt and deficit in a serious way, we\u2019re not going to have many options,\u201d\u00a0then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) warned in 2012, during one debt ceiling showdown. \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for leading.

Why aren\u2019t authorities calling this terrorism?\n\n\nThe debate broke out once again Wednesday morning after the news broke that the bomber behind a string of deadly attacks in Austin, Texas, was a 23-year-old white Christian male.\n\n\nMedia coverage often grants white non-Muslim perpetrators a level of humanity not typically seen in coverage of other attackers, and \u201cterrorism\u201d can often be used simply as a stand-in for \u201cMuslim.\u201d But it\u2019s more than just politics and privilege that makes authorities \u2015 and in turn, the media \u2015 shy about calling terrorism by its name.\n\n\nThe United States has no federal law criminalizing acts of domestic terrorism. That\u2019s something the FBI Agents Association, an organization that represents more than 14,000 current and former FBI special agents, would like to see changed.\n\n\n\u201cCalling it what it is is something that I believe is important,\u201d Thomas O\u2019Connor, a current FBI agent who has worked on domestic terrorism investigations, said in an interview earlier this year. O\u2019Connor, speaking to HuffPost in his capacity as head of the FBI Agents Association, said that the lack of a federal charge has broad implications for how the American public thinks about the threat of domestic terrorism.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to wrap their heads around someone coming in with an internationally based ideology and committing a crime,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cBut when it\u2019s a domestic terrorist, because there\u2019s no charge, we can\u2019t get our head wrapped around it.\u201d\n\n\nWhile the U.S. code defines domestic terrorism, there\u2019s no broad criminal statute that outlaws such acts. As HuffPost previously explained, the lack of a criminal domestic terrorism statute makes the federal government extremely cautious about using the term \u201cterrorism\u201d when there\u2019s no link to a group the United States has officially designated as an international terrorist organization. In practical terms, that means the government doesn\u2019t call white, non-Muslim terrorists what they are.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not really an excuse in the case of Mark Conditt, the young man behind the Austin attacks. Because Conditt is dead, there\u2019s no future trial to be concerned about.\n\n\nConditt\u2019s precise motive is not entirely clear.\u00a0Austin Police Chief Brian Manley received a lot of backlash Wednesday evening for describing a 25-minute tape Conditt recorded as an \u201coutcry by a very challenged young man\u201d and noting that it \u201cdoes not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate.\u201d Nevertheless, the federal government would have been able to charge Conditt with a terrorism-related crime had he lived: His package bombs would count as weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Connor says that doesn\u2019t make much sense and that the federal government needs to be able to charge domestic terrorists with domestic terrorism regardless of their weapon of choice.\n\n\n\u201cThe weapon itself shouldn\u2019t be the determining factor on when someone is committing an act of domestic terror,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\u00a0\u201cCall it what it is. If you have an incident that takes place, and the person uses a firearm, a car, a knife \u2015 if that crime of force or violence is done to forward a social or political agenda, then that person fits the elements of domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\n\nO\u2019Connor points to the Family Research Council shooting in Washington, D.C., in 2012, when a man shot a security guard because of the organization\u2019s opposition to gay marriage. It was clearly an act of terrorism. But because the terrorist used a gun, there was no federal terrorism-related federal statute under which he could\u2019ve been charged. The only reason he faced a terrorism charge was that the District of Columbia has its own terrorism statute, which federal prosecutors were able to use because they handle criminal cases in the nation\u2019s capital. \n\n\n\nThis week here in Wichita, three white men from rural Kansas are facing trial, accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex occupied by Muslim refugees they considered \u201ccockroaches.\u201d If the defendants did what the government says they did, they\u2019re domestic terrorists. But the only reason they\u2019re facing terrorism-related charges is because their alleged plot involved bombs. Had they decided to go door to door shooting Muslims living in an apartment complex in Garden City, as they are accused of discussing on audiotapes, there would be no basis for a terrorism-related charge and they\u2019d likely be facing only civil rights charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs HuffPost first reported\u00a0last summer, there has been an internal debate at the Justice Department about whether the executive branch should lobby Congress to create an actual criminal statute that would outlaw acts of domestic terrorism. Thomas Brzozowski, the Justice Department\u2019s top authority on domestic terrorism, said in January that the Justice Department was \u201ccontinuing to look at that very closely\u201d and getting input from multiple agencies. O\u2019Connor\u2019s group has been lobbying for such a plan, but the effort hasn\u2019t gained much traction on Capitol Hill.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not only a question of fairness, says O\u2019Connor. It\u2019s also about measuring the extent of the problem of domestic terrorism in the United States.

HuffPost is keeping track.\n\nGet Ready To March\nIt all leads to this: On March 24, a \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d will be held across the country to demand that lawmakers enact meaningful gun control legislation. A group of student activists from Douglas High have organized what is likely to be a massive event, and will be marching in the country\u2019s capital.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoneman Douglas students announce March for Our Lives on March 24. \"One of the things we've been hearing is that it's not the yet time to talk about gun control... so here's the time we're going to talk about gun control.\" pic.twitter.com/CLUf6JM9fs\n\u2014 Axios (@axios) February 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn every single city, we are going to be marching together as students begging for our lives,\u201d Kasky said on ABC. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the GOP.

But dropped from the plan was Trump\u2019s call to raise the legal age for buying certain firearms \u2015 including semi-automatic rifles \u2015 from 18 to 21 years old.\n\n\nTrump endorsed changing the age requirement last month during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers at the White House in the wake of the Florida shooting in which the suspected gunman used a semi-automatic rifle. The NRA, however, quickly came out against the age proposal.\n\n\n\u201cWhat President Trump showed when he said he wanted to raise the age to 21 is bipartisanship and he wanted to work together on this and save some lives,\u201d Hogg told CNN. \u201cBut the other thing that he showed after that is he is no better than the other politicians because he called out other GOP members and said essentially that you\u2019re owned by the NRA and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to take action.\u201d\n\n\nAt the White House meeting, Trump had pointedly scolded lawmakers for not having previously acted on raising the minimum age for buying semi-automatic weapons, saying they were \u201cafraid of the NRA\u201d and he wasn\u2019t.\n\n\nBut in a series of Monday morning tweets, he touted his proposal to arm some teachers and sought to justify his backpedaling on the age issue.\n\n\n\u201cHighly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law.

Date", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Having failed to get Mexico and then Congress to pay for his promised \u201cgreat wall\u201d along the southern border, President Donald Trump\u2019s White House nevertheless described 33 miles of levees and fencing in a new spending bill as a substantial victory Thursday.\n\n\nTrump and his staff had been trying to carve out\u00a0$25 billion in U.S. taxpayer money in the appropriations package for the budget year that ends Sept. 30, even though Trump had promised hundreds of times during his campaign in 2015 and 2016 that Mexico would pay for the wall\u2019s construction.\n\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we think this is a really, really good immigration package,\u201d budget director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday while acknowledging that Trump was unable to get anywhere near what is needed to build a wall along the border, which is nearly 2,000 miles. \u201cIf Congress would give us the money to do it, we would do it now.\u201d\n\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s political advisers, though, see wall construction as critical to Trump\u2019s survival. He promised a wall along the Mexican border so many times over the course of his presidential campaign that failing to deliver would be disastrous \u2015 in the November midterms and then in his presidential re-election campaign.\n\n\nAlthough his base has been patient so far, the thinking goes, that could evaporate instantly if Trump signs the $1.3 trillion spending bill that does not make good on the wall promise. The Senate faces a midnight Friday deadline to pass the bill, which cleared the House on Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou could key yourself up to lose 50 seats if you fuck around with this thing,\u201d one Republican close to Trump said on the condition of anonymity. \u201cHe ought to shut down the government if he doesn\u2019t get the money to start building the wall,\u201d the Republican added.\n\n\nAt a White House press briefing, Mulvaney assured that Trump would not be doing that. \u201cLet\u2019s cut right to the chase: Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,\u201d he said.\n\n\nMulvaney blamed Senate rules that require 60 votes to move most legislation \u2015 including appropriations bills \u2015 to a final vote. This allows Democrats to extract \u201ctheir pound of flesh\u201d in the spending package, he said.\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t control all of the government,\u201d Mulvaney said, even though Republicans hold the White House and control both chambers of Congress. \u201cWe do not control the Senate, under the current rules. Therefore we have to give the Democrats something.\u201d\n\n\nYet, in this case, Trump was unable to get the wall money he wanted because he was unwilling to give Democrats what he has claimed he also wants: a permanent answer for the undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children, often called the Dreamers.\n\n\nTrump tried to end protection from deportation for nearly 700,000 of those immigrants by rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September. Two courts temporarily have blocked Trump and forced him to reopen the program to current applicants, who can continue to renew their two-year work permits and deportation relief.\n\n\nTrump has nonetheless insisted since he ended DACA that he is the champion of DACA recipients and that it is the Democrats who do not care about them.\n\n\n\u201cDemocrats refused to take care of DACA,\u201d Trump tweeted Friday evening. \u201cWould have been so easy, but they just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Michael Short said Trump offered Democrats three years of wall funding for three years of DACA protections but that Democrats rejected it. Short said the White House was willing to negotiate but Democrats were not.\n\n\n\u201cThe Democrats in the House and the Senate have made it clear they think they\u2019re winning in the courts and they do not want to fix this legislatively,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\n\nBut Democrats point out that they offered to support the full $25 billion to build Trump\u2019s wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers. The White House rejected that offer, said Matt House, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\n\nOutside of the recent spending bill negotiations, Democrats have also proposed a number of bills to protect DACA recipients and other Dreamers, some of them with Republican support. They argue any solution should be permanent \u2015 not renewable permits but a path to citizenship.\n\n\nThe White House worked to sink two of those bipartisan proposals in February while pushing its preferred plan to give a path to citizenship for Dreamers in exchange for wall funding, cuts to legal immigration and changes in asylum policies. That plan received only 39 votes on the Senate floor last month, while one of the bipartisan measures his administration successfully undermined had received 54 votes.\n\n\nThe failure to resolve DACA, however, has left Trump unable to deliver on one of his signature campaign promises.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump promised from the day he began his campaign in June 2015 that he would build a \u201cgreat wall\u201d to end illegal immigration from Mexico.\n\n\n\u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d Trump said in his Trump Tower announcement. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\u201d\n\n\nOver the coming 17 months, Trump promised many hundreds of times that he would build the wall quickly and at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Trump said that his wall would be at least 30 feet tall and extend deep underground to prevent people from tunneling beneath it. At a December 2015 visit to Manassas, Virginia, Trump even went into construction details.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be made of hardened concrete, and it\u2019s going to be made out of rebar. That\u2019s steel,\u201d Trump said to a question from a young boy in the audience. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to set [the rebar] in nice, heavy foundations.\u201d\n\n\nBut having Mexico pay for a wall that country does not at all support has proved unrealistic. A planned meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was recently canceled because Pe\u00f1a Nieto would not back away from his refusal to pay.\n\n\nIn the new \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill, a grand total of 33 miles of the border between Mexico and the United States that is currently unsecured will get fencing, with 25 miles of that going atop new levees along the Rio Grande. A total of 14 miles of modern \u201cwall,\u201d such as the examples Trump recently visited in San Diego, will be built, Mulvaney said, but it will be on the U.S. side of an existing barrier in Southern California. In all, $1.6 billion was appropriated for border security enhancements, of which only $641 million are for the new fencing.\n\n\n\u201cWe want the whole wall funded. You\u2019ve heard the president say he wants $25 billion to finish the wall,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cCongress will not give us that without a DACA fix.\u201d\n\n\nTrump\u2019s base of supporters, though, will not be interested in excuses, his Republican adviser warned, and Trump risks losing them by not following through. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing in there for the wall, it\u2019s not going to fly. The wall is a big deal. The wall is a huge deal,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cNo wall?

That\u2019s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.\nThe president\u2019s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump\u2019s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.\nTrump\u2019s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national\u00a0criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.\nMass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country \u2015 and so is Congress\u2019 inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018.

Then Russia, the Philippines, Greece and Cambodia.\u00a0Randazza, who also represents far-right propagandist and smear artist Mike Cernovich, used the misdirection to argue that Anglin had permanently established himself overseas in an undisclosed location and, therefore, existed beyond the reach of the federal courts as a \u201cstateless\u201d person, an unusual legal category that applies to American citizens who live abroad with the intent to remain there indefinitely. For that reason, the lawsuit should be dismissed, Randazza contended.\n\n\nBut he and Anglin offered no real evidence to support this argument. In January, Anglin submitted a sworn declaration that included photos of his passport adorned with tourist visa stamps. He claimed to have worked as a tour guide in Athens without offering any proof. He said he lived in a hotel in Cambodia and bought a motorcycle there. Again, he offered no proof. He stated that he\u2019d left Ohio and the United States in July 2013 \u201cfor the last time,\u201d never to return, despite having admitted on his website to being in his hometown of Columbus as recently as February 2017 for a court hearing in another matter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN MY HUNT FOR ANDREW ANGLIN\n\n\n\n\nLynch on Wednesday found Anglin\u2019s domicile argument unpersuasive and recommended it be denied.\u00a0The judge described Anglin\u2019s declaration as mostly a \u201cseries of subjective statements\u201d\u00a0that were insufficient to demonstrate, for legal purposes, that\u00a0Anglin had set himself up abroad permanently.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t win em all,\u201d Anglin\u2019s lawyer Randazza tweeted late Tuesday night.\n\n\nThe judge also determined that Gersh had presented ample evidence to establish a legal presence for Anglin in Ohio, where the neo-Nazi is registered to vote and maintains a mailing address. Both of Anglin\u2019s active businesses \u2015 Moonbase Holdings, LLC and Daily Stormer\u00a0\u2014 are registered with the Ohio Secretary of State. He collects money in Ohio.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Anglin\u2019s travels around the globe do not absolve him of responsibility for the harm he caused in the United States,\u201d said David Dinielli, one of Gersh\u2019s attorneys from the SPLC.\n\n\nDinielli added that Gersh\u2019s legal team is seeking to do discovery in the case to \u201dsee if there were additional parties who may have played a role in the planning and implementation of the troll storm against our client\u201d and whether the complaint needs to be amended with the names of other defendants. Gersh\u2019s lawyers want to know, for example, if Richard Spencer had a hand in the harassment.\n\n\nAnglin\u2019s legal predicament should come into better focus on April 3 during a hearing in Missoula on a second argument Anglin put forward in his motion to dismiss Gersh\u2019s suit. That argument asserts that the case should be tossed on First Amendment grounds. Essentially, Anglin is arguing that anything he writes on a website that stops short of \u201cfighting words,\u201d a true threat or incitement \u2015 even when his intent might be to incite an online mob to cyberbully a target \u2015 is protected speech.\n\n\nA serial harasser and slanderer, Anglin has advocated violence against minorities, women, journalists and other groups.\u00a0Last week,\u00a0he bragged on The Daily Stormer about his influence on Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynch\u2019s determination this week is just one of several developments that puts Anglin in an increasingly precarious position,\u00a0both legally and personally.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the past months, Anglin has lost support in the \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacist movement, for which he has served as an important ringleader and its chief propagandist. His writings about beating and caging women revolt even deeply misogynistic members of the white power scene.\n\n\nA keyboard warrior, Anglin has also alienated alt-right extremists who endorse real-world activism. This rift widened after anti-fascists delivered a humiliating beatdown to the\u00a0Traditionalist Worker Party, a prominent neo-Nazi group, in Lansing, Michigan, in early March, prompting Anglin to slam the organizers for being ineffective.\u00a0They fiercely attacked him back, accusing him of being a \u201crace-mixer\u201d who targets young girls for sex and is too cowardly to show his face at far-right rallies.\n\n\nOn Gab, a far-right social media platform popular with racists and fascists, alt-right members tore into Anglin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglin even caught flak on his own website\u2019s forum and had to ban several mouthy dissenters. It was an embarrassing twist of fate for a troll whose sense of self-worth has long depended on how many racist simpletons he can delude.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Anglin\u2019s old foes have only drawn closer. Jeff Cremeans, a process server hired by the SPLC to find Anglin in Columbus, is still on the hunt and told HuffPost that his colleagues around the country have called to offer assistance. \n\n\n\u201cWe all stick together, we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Cremeans said. \u201cWhen they heard about my situation, they said if you ever need help, send us the papers and we\u2019ll get him for you. I\u2019ve got complete backing not just locally but nationally.\u201d\n\n\nWhat might that mean for Anglin?\n\n\n\u201cI think he becomes even more paranoid, if that\u2019s even possible,\u201d Cremeans said.\n\n\nDo you have information on the whereabouts of Anglin?

One small item in that mammoth bill bans federal funds from being spent to support a group called the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN. \n\n\nRepublicans loathed the group. They accused it \u2015 baselessly \u2015 of engineering a campaign of mass voter fraud and thus rigging the 2008 election in favor of then-candidate Barack Obama. Republicans hated ACORN so much that they effectively killed it all the way back in 2009 by blocking federal funding to the organization, which helped poor people register to vote and advocated for social services like affordable housing. Many Democrats also voted in favor of the original ban.\u00a0\n\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the committee that drafted the spending bill \u2015 which has to get through the Senate before Friday night to prevent the federal government from partially shutting down \u2015 was unaware of the provision.

There\u2019s no question that the Hillary Clinton folks thought it mattered.\u201d\n\n\nOver the entire final month of the race, Trump essentially centered his campaign on talking about the emails stolen by Russian intelligence and then released through its allied group WikiLeaks. The messages, which were sent to and from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, cast Clinton in a bad light. \u201cWe love WikiLeaks!\u201d Trump would tell his rally crowds and live TV audiences, urging them to go to the website and read the emails for themselves. \u201cBoy, do we love WikiLeaks.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDemocrats and even some Republican consultants said the Trump campaign would not have based its closing strategy on that theme if it were not working.\n\n\n\u201cYou clearly wouldn\u2019t do that if you didn\u2019t think that was effective,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a GOP consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign during the primaries.\n\n\nAlthough Trump lost the popular tally by nearly 3 million votes nationally, he won three states that most observers expected to go to Clinton by a total margin of 77,744. Were the Russian efforts enough to have moved 77,744 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania?\n\n\nClinton supporters argue that when an election is that close, every factor is potentially a game-changer. For example, shifts in polling numbers suggest that former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s letters reopening, and then reclosing, the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state could also have cost her the election \u2015 an argument Clinton herself has made.\n\n\nOne Republican-leaning pollster, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the question is impossible to quantify with any certainty. To move that many votes in those three states, the pollster said, would mean moving about 600,000 votes nationally \u2015 or about half a percentage point. That said, he added that Trump\u2019s success in using WikiLeaks to hammer on about emails and thereby remind voters of Clinton\u2019s biggest vulnerability \u2015 the FBI probe into her emails \u2015 clearly makes that kind of vote shift plausible.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much more open to the notion that it mattered,\u201d he said.\n\n\nExit polling suggests that voters\u2019 concern about Clinton and emails \u2014 and Trump\u2019s pounding on that theme with the help of WikiLeaks in the final weeks \u2014 indeed made a difference.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Michigan, for instance, 60 percent of the electorate was bothered by the email issue, and 75 percent of those voters supported Trump. Relatedly, a quarter of Michigan voters settled on a candidate in the final month. That group broke for Trump 52 to 37 percent, while those who decided earlier voted for Clinton 50 to 47 percent.\n\n\n\nThey engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's indictment against multiple Russians\n\n\nTrump has been deeply sensitive to the appearance that he did not earn the presidency on his own. That\u2019s one of the reasons,\u00a0according to those close to him, why he has repeatedly pushed the false claim that he lost the popular vote because \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants supposedly cast ballots for Clinton. It is also why Trump has resisted admitting that Russians interfered in the election at all, let alone tried to boost his candidacy, sources close to him told HuffPost on condition of anonymity.\n\n\nThe fact of Russian interference in the election and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s preference for Trump was detailed in a Jan. 6, 2017, report released by the U.S. intelligence agencies. That conclusion was reinforced by Mueller\u2019s Feb. 16, 2018, indictment.\n\n\n\u201cThey engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment states.\n\n\nFor over a year, Trump questioned the conclusion of U.S. intelligence, as he continued to play up the possibility that the culprit in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails was someone other than Russia. At various times,\u00a0he suggested it might have been China, a 400-pound guy in his bed or someone from New Jersey.\n\n\nAt last, he appears to have abandoned that argument in the wake of Mueller\u2019s indictment against 13 actual Russians and a Russian government-run group that employs hundreds of internet \u201ctrolls\u201d who create and disseminate propaganda to influence foreign elections. Instead,\u00a0the president turned to claiming that the Russian assistance did not have any effect.\n\n\n\u201cThe results of the election were not impacted,\u201d Trump wrote the afternoon the indictment was released.\n\n\nThe following day, he chided his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, for not making that assertion at a conference in Europe where McMaster acknowledged that it was now \u201cincontrovertible\u201d that Russia had interfered in the election. \u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians,\u201d Trump tweeted\u00a0\u2015 and then proceeded to cite a string of conspiracy theories promoted by Fox News that he believed McMaster also should have mentioned.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t say that what you were doing was effective, but what the Russians were doing wasn\u2019t effective.\nRepublican consultant Rick Tyler\n\n\nSome Trump supporters argue that the value of the ads the Russians bought on Facebook and other social media platforms was a pittance compared to the total amount of money spent on the race, so they couldn\u2019t have mattered at all. Others simply insist there is no proof that American voters were affected by the thousands of fake news posts written by Russians and then spread via fake accounts and computer programs.\n\n\nAnd former Trump campaign aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said neither Trump nor campaign officials were measuring the effect of his WikiLeaks speeches.\n\n\n\u201cJust trolling,\u201d said one aide. \u201cWhat we know worked was \u2018Crooked Hillary.\u2019 \u2018Clinton Cash\u2019 had impact on Dems \u2015 Bernie \u2018Bros\u2019\u00a0\u2015 and independents.\u201d The aide added that the only emails WikiLeaks had were \u201cBS Podesta and DNC.\u201d\n\n\nBut Mellman, the Democratic pollster, said it is disingenuous to draw distinctions between the DNC emails released by WikiLeaks and the separate State Department emails when the average voter was aware only that Clinton had been under investigation for something to do with emails.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the whole email controversy did damage Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said, adding that many voters found the issue confusing and that Trump took advantage of that confusion. \u201cIf the press was talking about emails, it was bad for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\nTyler, the Republican consultant, wonders how Trump supporters can argue that the social media ads and fake stories had no impact, when it was exactly the sort of thing the Trump campaign was doing itself. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that what you were doing was effective, but what the Russians were doing wasn\u2019t effective,\u201d\u00a0he said.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mary Papenfuss", "body": "The National Rifle Association filed a lawsuit in federal court on Friday to block a new gun law in Florida just over an hour after it was signed by Republican Gov.

That\u2019s virtually nothing compared to the millions of votes cast in Kansas over the last two decades and the 1.8 million voters currently registered there.\n\n\nKobach likes to call those 129 cases just the \u201ctip of the iceberg.\u201d It\u2019s a remarkably powerful metaphor \u2015 a way to pivot around a seemingly insignificant statistic and instead draw concern from the uncertainty of what we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the kind of thinking he used in 2011 to persuade Kansas lawmakers to pass a law requiring people to bring a document proving their citizenship when they go to register to vote.\n\n\nOver the course of an eight-day trial this month, Kobach had the floor in a Kansas City federal courtroom to show just how deep that iceberg was. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing him over the Secure And Fair Elections Act, or SAFE Act.\u00a0The civil rights group says that it is needlessly restrictive and has impacted 35,000 voters. To uphold the Kansas statute, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told Kobach he had to show that noncitizen voter registration was a widespread issue and that nothing short of Kansas\u2019 proof of citizenship law could stop the problem.\n\n\nAs the trial progressed, it became clear that the case was about much more than the Kansas law and Kobach. It began to revolve around a deeper question: Is the evidence that supports the idea of widespread voter fraud credible at all? For the ACLU, the trial offered a unique chance to get a judge to assess the reliability of experts whose research is used to justify claims about voter fraud across the country; even though several studies and investigations have shown it is not a widespread problem.\n\n\nThe ACLU repeatedly got Kobach\u2019s experts to concede their work was not always subject to peer review and highlighted flaws in their methodology. In doing so, the ACLU sought to deal a more devastating blow to claims about voter fraud, creating a court record anyone can point to in the future to question claims about illegal voting.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU repeatedly got Kobach\u2019s experts to concede their work was not always subject to peer review and highlighted flaws in their methodology.\n\n\nThe most tense moments of the trial came when ACLU cross-examined the experts whose research Kobach relied on to say noncitizen voter registration was a substantial problem. One of those witnesses was Jesse Richman, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, who did an analysis of Kansas voter registration that showed as many as 18,000 noncitizens could be on the rolls in Kansas. Kobach has also relied on Richman\u2019s work to estimate that more than 3 million noncitizens could have voted in the 2016 election, a figure that would be greater than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s margin of victory in the popular vote. President Donald Trump has said he believes he only lost the popular vote because of illegal votes.\n\n\nBut when Richman was on the stand, Dale Ho, the director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project, got him to concede that he did not believe noncitizens voting changed the outcome of the popular vote. It was a significant victory for the ACLU because it provided an unequivocal challenge to the basis of Trump and Kobach\u2019s claims about voter fraud.\n\n\nHo also questioned Richman\u2019s methodology and led him into a trap. When Richman was looking at Kansas voter roll data and DMV records to identify potential noncitizens, one factor he took into account was how \u201cforeign-sounding\u201d a name was. Even though it was just one factor in Richman\u2019s analysis, the ACLU recognized it was a chance to show his analysis was unscientific. Ho asked Richman if he would consider the name Carlos Murguia to be a foreign sounding one. When Richman said he would, Ho informed him that Murguia was a federal judge who sat in the courthouse where the trial was being conducted.\n\n\n\nWhen Richman was looking at Kansas voter roll data and DMV records to identify potential noncitizens, one factor he took into account was how \u201cforeign-sounding\u201d a name was.\n\n\nHo launched a similar attack on the credibility of Hans von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department official and member of Trump\u2019s now-defunct Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Von Spakovsky, another one of Kobach\u2019s witnesses testified that he believed voter fraud to be a problem both in Kansas and nationally. But pressed by Ho, von Spakovsky admitted that his understanding of voter fraud in Kansas was based entirely on a list of around 30 voters that Kobach\u2019s office had provided to him and that he was not familiar with any of the particular circumstances. He was also forced to admit that some of the research on noncitizen voting he had prepared in the case contained incomplete information that could make it look like there were more noncitizens trying to register to vote than there actually were. Most significantly, von Spakovsky conceded he could not name of a single election in which the outcome was swayed by noncitizens.\n\n\nThe concessions from von Spakovsky and Richman produced answers that critics can point to qualify any of their future claims about noncitizen voting, making it more difficult for anyone to rely on their expertise to back up claims.\n\n\nBeyond attacking the credibility of voter fraud experts, the ACLU also sought to show how incidents that look like fraud can often turn out to be mistakes. A key piece of Kobach\u2019s evidence of voter fraud was a spreadsheet his office had filed of 38 incidences of noncitizens \u00a0from 1999 until 2017 in Sedgwick County, Kansas. The ACLU highlighted that in several of those examples, people had checked they wanted to register to vote but not that they were citizens (though they did sign an affirmation indicating they were a citizen). After some people got a notification in the mail that they needed to prove they were citizens, they contacted their election office to cancel their registrations. The ACLU used the stories to break down how incidents that seem like nefarious voter fraud can just be mistakes.\n\n\nNow it\u2019s up to U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, to ultimately decide whether Kobach gave her enough evidence that noncitizen voter registration in Kansas is a substantial problem. But regardless of what Robinson ultimately rules, the ACLU was able to dive under Kobach\u2019s iceberg and show\u00a0there wasn\u2019t\u00a0much underneath.\n\n\nDuring his closing statement in the case, Ho made this clear.\n\n\n\u201cThe iceberg, on close inspection your honor, is more of an ice cube,\u201d\u00a0he said.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sam Levine", "body": "When Thomas Hofeller travelled across the country at the beginning of the decade to talk to lawmakers about the redistricting process,\u00a0he brought a warning: \u201cDon\u2019t get cute.\u201d \n\n\nRepublicans were fresh off a remarkably successful effort to take control of state legislatures so they could control the redistricting process \u2015 a significant victory, because redistricting is only done every 10 years. Hofeller, a veteran Republican redistricting consultant and mapmaker,\u00a0cautioned lawmakers against drawing \u201cstupid irregularities\u201d in boundaries obviously contorted to include voters likely to support them,\u00a0The Atlantic reported.\n\n\nBut in 2011, Republicans were focused on maximizing every possible advantage they could squeeze out of the redistricting project, and saw an opportunity to entrench their control of at least 20 seats in the U.S. House. They took it.\n\n\nRepublicans have since enjoyed considerable advantage from those maps. According to an estimate by the Brennan Center for Justice, Republican gerrymandering accounts for 16 or 17 GOP seats in the current Congress that the party may not otherwise control.\n\n\nBut now, that gerrymandering greed of Republicans is coming back to haunt them.\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January struck down the congressional map state Republicans drew, saying it was so partisan that it violated the state constitution. That same month, a panel of three federal judges struck down North Carolina\u2019s congressional map. In October, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in a Wisconsin case may set a standard for defining unconstitutional gerrymandering on partisan grounds.\u00a0(The court also will consider a case challenging a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland at the end of March.)\n\n\nAs these legal contests settle out, it\u2019s worth looking back on how the GOP got here.\n\n\nThe reckoning Republicans are seeing now is one that could have been avoided, lawyers and redistricting experts say, had the GOP not been so ruthless.\n\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have gerrymandered in the past to their advantage, but Republicans took it to a new level in 2011. In an amicus brief to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, political science professors Keith Gaddie and Bernard Grofman wrote that there was as much as three times more partisan bias in congressional maps this decade than in ones drawn in 2000. Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor at the University of Chicago helping challenge a Wisconsin map, said a \u201cdramatic number\u201d of the worst gerrymanders of the last half-century have occurred since 2010.\n\n\nUntil the courts began stepping in, Republican gerrymandering paid off. From 2012 to 2016, the GOP won 13 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18 congressional seats, even though the party\u2019s candidates only got around half of the vote. In Ohio, the party consistently won 12 of 16 congressional seats, but 50 percent of the statewide vote. In Wisconsin, they won at least\u00a060 of 99 state assembly seats, with about half of the popular vote.\n\n\nAs a lawyer, Stephanopoulos said the clear egregiousness of the Republican redistricting made it easier to show something was amiss. It would have been harder to make a case, he said, if Republicans had only been winning slim majorities.\n\n\n\u201cIn Wisconsin, if Republicans had been winning a narrow majority of the statehouse with roughly a tied election, Democrats would have been upset by that, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have risen to a major constitutional challenge,\u201d Stephanopoulos said.\n\n\nRepublican mapmakers in 2011 may have been emboldened by a 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case in which justices declined to strike down Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional plan on partisan grounds.\u00a0\n\n\nRepublicans could have been cautious. They could have drawn maps that benefitted their party, but at the same time were fairer, compact and contiguous, said Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues. The Constitution gives state lawmakers the broad responsibility of drawing electoral districts, and the GOP maps would have stood up better against judicial scrutiny had lawmakers offered public justification in their legislatures for the boundaries, Wice added.\n\n\n\u201cYou can draw a plan to benefit a party, but do so in a fair way through a more transparent, objective process that follows criteria,\u201d Wice said. \u201cIf politicians weren\u2019t as greedy and secretive, then we wouldn\u2019t be seeing as many challenges to plans for the egregious overreaching in the last round.\u201d\n\n\nIn many cases, Republicans didn\u2019t offer a defensible justification. In North Carolina, a Republican said his party\u2019s lawmakers drew a map that gave Republicans a 10-3 advantage because he didn\u2019t see a way to draw one that was 11-2. In Wisconsin, GOP lawmakers sought to avoid scrutiny by hiring a law firm to draw the maps, hoping the work would be hidden by attorney-client privilege.\n\n\nWithout a public explanation for the redrawn boundaries, it\u2019s easier for those challenging the maps to claim Republicans intended to dilute Democratic votes.\n\n\nMichael Li, redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center, pointed to the GOP-drawn congressional map in Pennsylvania as a good example of a brazen Republican attempt to maximize control. The districts were clearly contorted into odd-looking shapes, and there was no attempt to explain why \u2015 other than partisan advantage.\n\n\n\u201cThe 2011 map in Pennsylvania resulted in such contorted districts, it was hard to explain away as product of neutral decisions, such as about keeping towns or counties together. It just was so nakedly partisan,\u201d Li said in an email. \u201dThat\u2019s not to say a map that was less contorted couldn\u2019t have been challenged if it also produced durable bias in favor of a party. But at least there would be a colorable defense that a court would have to take seriously.\u201d\n\n\nSuch strong evidence also could make it more palatable for courts to wade into political redistricting \u2015 a topic the judiciary had long avoided.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe courts are going to police outlier cases, rather than trying to wade into each and every one,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cThe same principle\u2019s true in any kind of discrimination: The more blatant, the easier it is to establish, and the more likely the courts are to call it out.\u201d\n\n\nEven if the Supreme Court does decide Republicans went too far with gerrymandering, its anticipated ruling in the spring would likely come too late to affect this year\u2019s congressional elections, and wouldn\u2019t have an impact on maps until at least 2020. Even if Republicans lose the ability to gerrymander in the future, their ruthlessness will have helped them for nearly an entire decade.\n\n\nEd Gillespie, the former Republican National Committee chair who oversaw the party\u2019s effort to target state legislatures, envisioned that kind of success. In 2011 talking points, obtained by journalist David Daley, Gillespie thanked donors who had given to the party\u2019s effort to make gains in state legislatures. He said Republicans hadn\u2019t waste a \u201cdrop\u201d of their money on state races, and had made \u201cmaximum impact.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Amanda Terkel", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2015 When John Kelly took over as President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff last July, many in the Washington establishment breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe this man, a retired Marine Corps general who received praise from both sides of the political aisle as well as the media, would be able to restore some dignity to the White House.\n\n\nHe would \u201cdial back the drama\u201d and \u201cturn the White House around.\u201d Kelly\u2019s perceived effectiveness was enhanced by the fact that he looked like many people\u2019s expectation of a leader: an older white man with a military bearing. One article noted his \u201csquare-jawed\u201d features and said he would be \u201can imposing and strait-laced figure.\u201d\n\n\nBut there\u2019s still been plenty of drama over the past eight months. Trump continues to\u00a0tweet about random celebrities\u00a0and make\u00a0shocking comments about other nations. Now he\u2019s also rapidly hiring\u00a0all his favorite people\u00a0on cable news to help him run the nation.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Kelly has been anything but a grown-up holding down \u201cthe adult wing of the new regime.\u201d In fact, he\u2019s revealed himself to be a bit of a jerk, even in a job known to attract jerks. (President Barack Obama once joked about how his first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, lost a middle finger while working at Arby\u2019s, which \u201crendered him practically mute.\u201d)\u00a0\n\n\nRex Tillerson faced a fair amount of humiliation last week when he learned Trump had fired him by reading the news on Twitter. But Kelly decided to make Tillerson\u2019s week even shittier: He told reporters that he had informed Tillerson he would soon be fired at a time when the secretary of state, who was suffering through a stomach bug, was sitting on the toilet.\n\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that journalists who were in the off-the-record briefing with the White House chief of staff were \u201cstunned\u201d that this mature adult would share such a personal,\u00a0embarrassing detail about a man who had just been ousted so unceremoniously.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe Kelly just thought it was a funny anecdote. He once made a joke about how Trump should use a sword on the press. Ha. Ha.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly also created a significant scandal for Trump when he protected then-White House aide Rob Porter in the face of domestic violence accusations \u2015\u00a0with\u00a0photographic evidence \u2015\u00a0made by his ex-wives. Kelly tried to spin his own involvement, claiming that he and other top White House officials didn\u2019t know about the physical abuse allegations and took immediate action when they found out. But other White House aides disputed his characterization, saying Kelly looked the other way on Porter, another official who was supposed to be one of the grown-ups in the room.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump reportedly blamed not Kelly, but White House communications director Hope Hicks, who was dating Porter at the time. The president believed Hicks put her personal feelings over his best interests.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Kelly, according to a new New York Magazine story, had trouble dealing with Hicks because she was a woman in power.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe was extraordinarily dismissive of her. He would refer to her as \u2018the high-schooler,\u2019 he would joke about\u00a0how she was inexperienced, she was in over her head, she was immature,\u201d a former senior White House said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like a woman that potentially has some position of power over him. He thinks women should be subservient to him. If you look at his relationship with Ivanka or Hope \u2014 women who aren\u2019t subservient to him \u2014 he has problems with those people.\u201d\n\n\nThis description fits perfectly with what Kelly himself has said about women \u2015 that they should be \u201csacred,\u201d like they were in the good old days. In the past, of course,\u00a0there were fewer women in positions of power in places like the government.\n\n\nLast October, Kelly had another run-in with a powerful woman. When Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.)\u00a0revealed the callous comments that Trump had made to the family of a fallen U.S. service member, Kelly publicly criticized her and told reporters about past comments from the congresswoman that made her seem selfish and self-glorifying. Video of Wilson\u2019s remarks revealed that Kelly had completely misrepresented\u00a0them, yet like his boss, he refused to apologize and retract his claims.\n\n\nKelly has also asserted that the Civil War was caused by \u201cthe lack of ability to compromise.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what compromise on the central issue of the war \u2015 slavery \u2015 Kelly would like to have seen.\u00a0\n\n\nHuffPost reached out to a number of former White House chiefs of staff to ask about Kelly and his conduct.\u00a0They all either didn\u2019t respond or didn\u2019t want to comment for this article.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Peck", "body": "It\u2019s tempting to get swept up in the salacious details of President Donald Trump\u2019s (alleged) sexual antics. \n\n\nThe possibility of a sex tape or, God forbid, Trump nudity\u00a0isn\u2019t actually what matters about his (alleged) extramarital affairs with former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and former model Karen McDougal. Those affairs (allegedly) took place over a decade ago, when Trump was simply a reality TV star. Adultery is not a crime; nor is it surprising, given what we know about the president.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is the way Trump and his circle of enablers went about trying to cover up these (alleged) affairs, while Trump himself was seeking the top political office in the country. \n\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer and his allies at the National Enquirer used nondisclosure agreements to silence these women, taking a page from the corporate playbook.\n\n\nNDAs are already far too common in the business world, used to paper over a host of misdeeds, most crucially sexual harassment and discrimination. Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is perhaps the most egregious abuser of NDAs, which allowed him to harass and assault women for decades. \n\n\nTo be clear, Clifford and McDougal both say they had consensual relationships with Trump.\n\n\n\u201cHe always told me he loved me,\u201d McDougal told Anderson Cooper in a nearly hourlong interview Thursday.\u00a0Clifford is set to appear in her own interview with Cooper on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday.\n\n\nBut with Trump, the stakes are even higher. \u201cThe entire country pays the cost of not knowing things about the president,\u201d said David Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who specializes in contracts and psychology. \n\n\nBoth payouts happened when Trump was the Republican nominee for president and are already the subject\u00a0of federal complaints for possibly violating election laws.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is acting like he personally owns this information, as though he can act like a king and take any measures to control the way people talk about him.\nHeidi Kitrosser, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School\n\n\nTrump\u2019s use of these agreements is even more critical now because he is reportedly wielding NDAs in the White House \u2015 an unprecedented act\u00a0\u2015 in an attempt to silence his staffers, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\nMost First Amendment lawyers think those agreements would not be enforceable in court. However, the contracts do serve to intimidate and chill speech about public matters \u2015 essentially how the government runs. Stories about the president, from staffers, are critical to understanding history.\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is acting like he personally owns this information, as though he can act like a king and take any measures to control the way people talk about him,\u201d said Heidi Kitrosser, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re acting with the power of the federal government.\u201d\n\n\nThe public rarely finds out about NDAs. But thanks to lawsuits filed by McDougal and Clifford, their contracts are now publicly available. \n\n\nThe women are both suing to break free of their contracts and talk about Trump; he\u2019s pushing back hard. The White House denies that he ever had an affair with McDougal. Though she\u2019s recently started talking to the media, McDougal said she fears legal repercussions.\n\n\n\u201cThere could be financial ruin,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cDo I feel threatened? Absolutely.\u201d\n\n\nSeparately, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has filed suit against Clifford seeking $20 million because he claims she violated their agreement. Lawyers say Cohen is mainly trying to intimidate Clifford and stop her from talking. Previously, he admitted to paying her $130,000 out of his own pocket, but denies Trump was involved. \u00a0\n\n\nBoth women argue in their suits that there is a public policy interest in their stories \u2015 meaning that because they have information about the president of the United States, Americans have a right to know what happened.\n\n\n\u201cWhen we have a public figure \u2015 the most public figure, the president of the U.S. \u2015 the details are something that the public needs to know,\u201d said Orly Lobel, a labor law professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who\u2019s written extensively about the societal dangers of NDAs.\n\n\nBut there\u2019s little precedent for that argument in court, contract lawyers told HuffPost. None could think of any other instance in which a president was fighting to silence private citizens in this way.\n\n\n\u201cTrump is sui generis in a lot of ways,\u201d Hoffman said, echoing many of the lawyers who spoke with HuffPost, who agreed Trump is in a class all to himself.\n\n\nIf these women win in court, it will likely be because of the way their contracts were negotiated \u2015 particularly Clifford\u2019s, which was written with pseudonyms. Clifford is referred to as Peggy Peterson (PP) and Trump as David Dennison (DD). DD never signed the thing, which is the primary argument Clifford is using to try to invalidate the contract.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird document,\u201d said Greg Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, noting the pseudonyms and a few other factors that are out of the ordinary about the deal. He also said that Cohen\u2019s explanation for the deal \u2015 he paid Clifford $130,000 with his own money and claims that Trump was unaware \u2015 makes no sense. \n\n\n\u201cThe lawyer saying he\u2019s acting on Trump\u2019s behalf but didn\u2019t tell him,\u201d Germain said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he thinks that\u2019s going.\u201d\n\n\nHoffman said the Clifford agreement is the hot topic among contract lawyers at the moment. \n\n\n\u201cYou just never see this stuff,\u201d he said, referring to NDAs. \u201cIt never emerges from the swamp. It was never supposed to be tested in the light of a thousand suns.\u201d\n\n\nMcDougal\u2019s case is perhaps the stronger of the two, lawyers told HuffPost, because according to the suit she was misled into silence.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very straightforward application of longstanding contract principals,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cif you\u2019re lied to in making a contract, then the contract is not valid.\u201d \n\n\nMcDougal\u2019s story may be the more troubling one. She appears to have been manipulated in a manner reminiscent of so many sexual harassment cases. For her silence, she was promised career opportunities. \n\n\nAmerican Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story (her lawyer took nearly half) and assured her she would be able to write fitness columns for two years. AMI also said she would land on the cover of several of the company\u2019s publications, including Star magazine, Radar Online and Men\u2019s Fitness, where she had appeared in 1998. In pushing her to sign the deal, the men at AMI emphasized McDougal\u2019s age, telling her that since she was an \u201colder model,\u201d the deal would be very important, according to the suit.\n\n\nMcDougal was excited about the opportunity, she told Cooper. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want this work?\u201d she said.\n\n\nShe signed the agreement in August 2016, shortly after Trump won the Republican nomination. (Clifford signed her deal about a week before the presidential election.)\n\n\n\u201cThey wanted to squash the story,\u201d McDougal told Cooper \u2015 presumably to protect Trump, she added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to hurt him.\u201d\n\n\nAMI is now saying McDougal can discuss her alleged affair, but says it still owns the life rights to her story.\n\n\n\u201cI almost feel violated in that I didn\u2019t know what was happening behind the scenes. I\u2019m angry,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my life rights back. I want to share my truth. Everyone else is talking about it. I\u2019m standing up for myself.\u201d\n\n\nOf course, these aren\u2019t the quotes that got picked up from McDougal\u2019s CNN interview. Most outlets focused on her claim that Trump tried to pay her for sex and that he compared her with his elder daughter, Ivanka.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Robert Kuttner", "body": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is methodically, brilliantly filling in pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When complete, the puzzle will depict a president who is ripe \u2015 overripe \u2015 for impeachment.\nMueller\u2019s indictment on Friday of Russia\u2019s cyberwarfare against the 2016 election was a tactical and investigative masterstroke. President Donald Trump is now cornered. Mueller\u2019s report makes a total liar out of Trump for his\u00a0repeated claims that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin when Putin says Russia had nothing to do it, that the hacking could have been \u201csome guy in New Jersey.\u201d\nThe indictments do not quite connect the Russian operation to Putin personally, but that\u2019s beside the point. No serious person believes that an operation as sensitive as deliberate disruption of the U.S. election could go forward without Putin\u2019s full knowledge and support in a state as authoritarian as his.\nTrump, having repeatedly denied Russian involvement, has now shifted gears and is insisting that the proper test of wrongdoing is \u201ccollusion.\u201d But this is a straw man.\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly and publicly urged the Russians to come forward with dirt on Hillary Clinton. His top advisers met with Russian operatives to see what they had. That part of Mueller\u2019s investigation is still open.\nWhat we already know is plenty damning. A conspiracy of interest does not have to include an explicit tit-for-tat deal. It can be based on signaling.\nIn this case, Trump and his family relied on massive bailouts of his failing business enterprises from Russian oligarchs close to the Kremlin. When he became a presidential candidate, the Russians treated him as an asset \u2015 a useful idiot, as Stalinists used to put it. And when the campaign finalists turned out to be Trump versus the hard-line Clinton, the Russians sought to destroy her and elect Trump. Trump, meanwhile, became the most pro-Russia president in U.S. history, refusing to breathe a word of criticism of Putin, behaving like the head of a client state. This much of the story is hidden in plain view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details \u2015 of Russian financing of Trump\u2019s businesses, and of more campaign contacts \u2015 are likely to be spelled out in further indictments, almost surely including members of Trump\u2019s family, and in Mueller\u2019s final report, which will look very much like a bill of impeachment.\nWhat\u2019s astonishing \u2015 and devastating \u2015 is that this detailed report on Russian manipulation of a U.S. presidential election had to come from a special counsel. Under a normal administration, evidence of a foreign power meddling in a U.S. election would have prompted a presidential order for a full investigation. Instead, Trump mocked the whole idea and used his influence to block such inquiries by House and Senate panels.\nRather than looking deeply into Russian interference,\u00a0the president appointed a commission on election integrity, headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state best known for voter suppression, based on the premise that massive voter fraud by immigrants and others not qualified to vote had helped Clinton win the national popular vote. This was so preposterous that the commission collapsed of its own weight.\nSo where does Mueller\u2019s latest set of indictments leave us?\u00a0\nFirst, these disclosures end Trump\u2019s intermittent efforts to fire Mueller. If he were to try that now, it would be an open-and-shut case of obstruction of justice. Congressional Republicans would have no choice but to begin the impeachment process.\nSecond, they drive a further wedge between Trump and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. All key Republicans, whatever their marriage of convenience with Trump on other issues, have expressed outrage at the Russian operations and praised Mueller. Trump, by contrast, has only proclaimed his own lack of complicity, and has said nothing about what documented Russian interference means for American democracy, much less vowed to resist it and punish Putin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also see a further wedge between Trump and the entire intelligence community. Last week, on the eve of the Mueller indictments, the leaders of every major intelligence agency, including Trump appointees, testified unanimously before Congress that there was no doubt that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Unlike Trump, they are alarmed that Putin tipped a U.S. election to a pro-Kremlin stooge.\nOne question is the degree to which Mueller\u2019s 37-page indictment relied on materials from those U.S. intelligence agencies, and what else the government has that it isn\u2019t revealing out of concern for disclosing \u201csources and methods.\u201d Mueller\u2019s indictment goes into far more detail than anything else that has been made public.\nTwo other questions remain. First is Mueller\u2019s timing. When will other indictments come? He could wrap things up in a matter of weeks, or the investigation could drag out beyond November\u2019s midterm elections.\nSecond is how the U.S. should punish and deter Russia. The Russian actions to undermine American democracy and tip the election amounted to an act of war. And if those actions were as effective as much reporting and now Mueller\u2019s indictments have suggested they were, it means Trump literally became president in a Russia-sponsored coup d\u2019etat.\nThe U.S. and the Russians surely have the capacity to knock out each other\u2019s vital defense and infrastructure systems that rely on the internet. But unlike the nuclear deterrence of Mutually Assured Destruction, there are no bright lines when it comes to self-restraint in cyberwar. If there were, Russia surely crossed one in 2015 and 2016.\nWhat sort of retaliation makes sense? Mutually assured cyberdestruction would be a catastrophe; that\u2019s why Russia gets away with these incursions. But slaps on the wrist like banning the travel or freezing the bank accounts of a few Russian individuals just makes America look pitiful.\nThis is the serious question America needs to take up, once Trump is gone. Thanks to Mueller\u2019s latest revelations and those still to come, that day may not be far off.\nRobert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a professor at Brandeis University\u2019s Heller School.

Several studies and investigations have shown it is not.\n\n\nThe back-and-forth between the two men in U.S. District Court ostensibly was about Kansas law (von Spakovsky is serving as an expert witness for Kobach). But Ho\u2019s cross-examination had deeper significance in the national debate over voting restrictions because he was able to show that allegations of widespread voter fraud can often be based on incomplete information derived using unscientific methods.\n\n\nVon Spakovsky has said that voter fraud is a serious problem both in Kansas and nationally. Questioned by Kobach in court on Friday, he pointed to a handful of cases in Kansas and hundreds of allegations of noncitizens on the voter rolls that date back to the 1980s.\n\n\nBut Ho noted that von Spakovsky had donated to defendant Kobach\u2019s campaign in 2010 and had voiced support for the idea that being born in the United States doesn\u2019t guarantee U.S. citizenship. Ho intended to show that von Spakovsky had formed an opinion about the Kansas law before he knew much about it and had written an expert report based on unreliable information.\n\n\nVon Spakovsky admitted that he was not aware of a single election in which noncitizen votes determined the outcome. He also conceded that his research into voter fraud had not been subjected to the same kind of rigorous peer review that academic work would face.\n\n\nHo noted that von Spakovsky\u2019s expert report in the case contained incomplete information that allowed him to inflate the likelihood of noncitizens getting on the rolls. In one example, von Spakovsky pointed to a NBC News story that said 100 registered voters had returned jury duty questionnaires indicating they were not U.S. citizens. Von Spakovsky failed to note in his report, however, that NBC followed up with those voters and that about a third actually were citizens.\n\n\nUnder Ho\u2019s questioning, von Spakovsky also admitted that his entire understanding of voter fraud in Kansas was based on a spreadsheet prepared by Kobach\u2019s office of about 30 noncitizens who attempted to get on the voter rolls in one county in the state over the course of 18 years. Pressed if he knew the circumstances behind any of the cases, such as if any of reports were caused by an administrative error or confusion, von Spakovsky said he did not.\n\n\nVon Spakovsky\u2019s testimony is crucial to Kobach\u2019s defense of the Kansas law.\u00a0 Kobach, who was also on the voter fraud commission with von Spakovsky, has to show that noncitizens getting on the voter rolls is a substantial problem and that nothing short of asking people to provide proof of citizenship can prevent it.\n\n\nHo had not spoken much during the trial since the opening arguments on Tuesday, but it was clear he had been waiting for an opportunity to question von Spakovsky. As he questioned him, Ho was icy. His questions were short and rapid, and he often raised his voice as he asked them, while von Spakovsky mostly answered quietly. At one point he turned his back to von Spakovsky. Kobach objected throughout that Ho was harassing the witness, and U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson admonished Ho to dial down his theatrics.\n\n\nRobinson also questioned von Spakovsky\u2019s understanding of voter fraud. In his Friday testimony, von Spakovsky said that any ineligible voter who cast a ballot was committing voter fraud because they were diluting the vote of a legitimate citizen. Robinson wanted to know if he believed it would also be voter fraud if thousands of legitimate voters were blocked from casting ballots because of a voting restriction (the ACLU estimates the Kansas law affected more than 35,000 people). Von Spakovsky said that he didn\u2019t consider it to be fraud because every voter had an opportunity to obtain the necessary documents to register.\n\n\nPressed later by Ho, he was unable to name any voting restriction in the United States that he believed to be a burden to voters.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ryan J. Reilly", "body": "WICHITA, Kansas \u2015 An overwhelmingly white jury will decide the fate of three white militiamen facing federal charges for allegedly plotting a terrorist attack that targeted a community of Somali Muslim refugees.\n\n\nPatrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were\u00a0arrested and charged\u00a0in connection with a FBI domestic terrorism sting that wrapped up a few weeks ahead of the 2016 presidential election. They\u2019ll be on trial in a quiet federal courthouse in downtown Wichita over the next six weeks.\n\n\nThe federal government says they intended to slaughter Muslim refugees living in an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, whom they considered \u201ccockroaches\u201d and a threat to the United States. The trio allegedly planned their attack for the day after the election because they didn\u2019t want to hurt President Donald Trump\u2019s chances of victory.\u00a0\n\n\nThere were only a handful of African-Americans in the jury pool called to the federal courthouse. Just one black individual, the daughter of refugees from Eritrea, made the final panel of 40 potential jurors. But she was ultimately struck from the jury \u2015\u00a0almost certainly by the defense attorneys, who had questioned the woman about whether she could be fair to a group of defendants who thought refugees needed to be exterminated and referred to President Barack Obama as the \u201cnigger in the White House.\u201d\n\n\nGebilet, whom HuffPost agreed to identify by her first name only, said in an interview afterward that she considered it a blessing that she had been summoned in the first place.\n\n\n\u201cThe immigrant community here is so small, to even have been selected is an honor,\u201d she said.\n\n\nShe suggested that the defense attorneys probably decided just from her name and her appearance that they didn\u2019t want her as a juror. And she wasn\u2019t surprised by the ultimate makeup of the jury.\n\n\n\u201cGenerally, minorities are not picked,\u201d Gebilet said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that that happened,\u201d she said, but she still has faith in the jury process in this case.\n\n\nThe lack of black representation on the jury is especially stark because it adds to the probable dearth of black voices in the courtroom.\u00a0The judge has ruled that none of the potential victims of the plot will be allowed to testify during the trial, since they only knew about the planned attack because the government told them about it. The apartment complex the trio allegedly targeted is more than 200 miles away, so it\u2019s unlikely many members of that community will be present in the courtroom either.\n\n\nThe final jury, including four alternates, is made up of eight men and eight women. It includes one woman who described herself as half-native American. That group was narrowed down from an initial 600 people who received jury questionnaires. The attorneys on both sides ultimately qualified just over 100 potential jurors after probing them extensively about their views on a wide range of issues over the course of two days.\n\n\nAfrican-American jurors faced questions about their ability to give three racists a fair trial, especially given the fact that the defendants had repeatedly used the n-word.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a part of life, it always has been,\u201d one woman, a customer services manager, said of the slur. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you have to move past.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost 60 years old, I\u2019ve been hearing that all my life,\u201d said another woman.\n\n\nYet another woman said she wouldn\u2019t be able to get past the language and she was dismissed from the panel.\n\n\nA number of potential jurors were excused for other reasons, including a former deputy sheriff dismissed because his ex-girlfriend used to date one of the defendants, Patrick Stein. Also, a man who said that the allegations made his \u201cblood boil\u201d and that the defendants were \u201cguilty until proven innocent.\u201d A woman who, upon hearing the term \u201cweapon of mass destruction,\u201d thought of her uncle who was killed in the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. A woman who used to live in the apartment complex targeted and got to know the families there.\n\n\nOne man described himself on his jury questionnaire as a \u201cWestern chauvinist\u201d and complained about refugees moving into neighborhoods. He said he\u2019d seen a lot of the world and was convinced that America was the best and he didn\u2019t want to live anywhere else.\n\n\n\u201cI am 100 percent for America all the time,\u201d he told the attorneys.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very unapologetic about it.\u201d He later said he wasn\u2019t offended by those who called another human being a cockroach or a whole group of people an infestation. It was just a way of describing a group of people who have \u201coverrun\u201d an area, he said.\n\n\nHe also objected to labeling Trump\u2019s travel ban as a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, that\u2019s just what they put out there,\u201d he said, but he insisted religion wasn\u2019t really the focus of Trump\u2019s effort. He didn\u2019t make the final jury.\n\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi, a Kansas-based prosecutor with a high-and-tight haircut and an affinity for American flag socks, is leading the prosecution of the case alongside two attorneys from the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division based out of the nation\u2019s capital. Mattivi made sure the potential jurors knew he wasn\u2019t an out-of-towner. \u201cMy office is in Topeka, and I live in Topeka with my family,\u201d he told one group.\n\n\nMattivi also told the jurors that it was his job to make sure the trial was fair. He asked whether there was anyone who believed the government had no role in protecting civil rights. He asked if anyone had been bullied before. He asked them about their views on immigration and whether they thought the government should take religion into account when deciding who was admitted to the U.S. He asked what American values meant to them.\n\n\nMany of the potential jurors with the most interesting views didn\u2019t make the cut. The final jury does include a woman who had great concerns about immigration policy, a strong Second Amendment supporter with a Muslim friend, a man with a son-in-law who just immigrated to the United States, another Second Amendment supporter who advocated for gun rights on Facebook but said he\u2019s not a fanatic, and a man who wrote his congressman recently hoping to do something about AR-15s.\n\n\nHuffPost is covering the trial from Wichita this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost\u2019s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

On the commercial market, however, the building has been forced to drop its prices dramatically.\n\n\nTrump Tower had been charging $120 per square foot per year in 2016 \u2013 about 50 percent more than the going rate in midtown Manhattan. Today, the asking price is down to $80 a square foot, according to a New York City real estate broker, and there is plenty of space available, including the entire 14th floor where Trump had his campaign headquarters for the 2016 general election.\n\n\n\u201cHe is really unpopular,\u201d said the broker, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nobody there.

It\u2019s just a joke.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to those FEC filings, Trump\u2019s campaign sent paychecks to a total of 21 people over the course of last year. Ten left at the end of January 2017. Two more received their last paycheck in mid-March. Only six collected a paycheck at the end of December, and one of those now has an auto-response email stating that she left the campaign this January.\n\n\nNo one on the campaign staff at year\u2019s end responded to HuffPost emails. The campaign\u2019s phone number provided an email address for media inquiries, but emails sent there were returned as undeliverable. A security guard in the Trump Tower lobby turned away a HuffPost reporter who tried to visit the campaign office on Tuesday. Eventually, a public relations business owner in Northern Virginia replied to a query that had been sent to newly named campaign manager Brad Parscale\u2019s social media and data analytics firm in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n\n\u201cBrad is not currently available for interviews,\u201d wrote Mark Serrano of ProActive Communications. \u201cHe is working with the campaign leadership team to develop plans to engage in the 2018 midterm elections, providing support and endorsements for candidates, and engaging Trump supporters in districts and states throughout the country to support and vote for GOP candidates.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s What You Signed Up For\u2019\n\nTrump opened his re-election campaign account on the day of his inauguration last year, which enabled him to continue using donor money to rent space in his own building. No other presidential victor has kept his campaign alive in this fashion. Barack Obama did not start his re-election campaign until April 2011. George W. Bush did not start his until May of 2003.\n\n\nStuart Stevens, a GOP consultant who worked on the campaign of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, said donors should not be shocked that Trump is spending their money this way. \u201cThis is the least surprising president in history. He\u2019s exactly the same person he was in the campaign,\u201d\u00a0Stevens said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you signed up for.\u201d\n\n\nTrump made a practice of spending donor money at properties that he owned from the time he locked up the GOP nomination in the spring of 2016. The rent on the Trump Tower offices\u00a0nearly quintupled, from $35,458 to $169,758 a month by July 2016, even though the number of campaign staff remained about the same. Trump also spent hundreds of thousands of donated dollars at his hotels and golf clubs, where he hosted fundraisers for himself and the party.\n\n\nThat habit continued into the first year of his presidency. With control of the Republican National Committee\u2019s purse strings, Trump started to personally profit from contributions to that group as well.\n\n\nIn 2017, the RNC spent $232,042 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, $3,000 at Trump\u2019s golf club in Miami and $1,228 at Trump Caf\u00e9 in Trump Tower. The RNC also took over the monthly $37,542 rent payment for the re-election campaign\u2019s space at Trump Tower in mid-autumn, spending a total of $150,169 by the end of the year. In the same period, it began paying the salary for campaign staffer John Pence, nephew to Vice President Mike Pence,\u00a0which amounted to $28,412 by year\u2019s end.\n\n\nThe RNC did not respond to questions about why it took over the latter expenses. The move did coincide with the party\u2019s decision to no longer pay the president\u2019s legal expenses incurred as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia (the timing was\u00a0first noted by CNBC).\n\n\nTrump Likes To Pay Trump\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has been even more generous at his properties in 2017 than the RNC. It spent $473,371 for rent at Trump Tower before that cost was shifted to the party, although about $150,000 of that was likely for the month immediately after his election, when the campaign was occupying more space in the building. The campaign also spent $58,686 at Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, and $14,860 at his hotel in Las Vegas. In all, the Trump campaign spent\u00a0$774,163 in donor money at Trump-branded businesses last year.\n\n\nWhat exactly the campaign has done to work toward Trump\u2019s re-election is less clear. It staged several rallies in states that the president had won in 2016, including one in Melbourne, Florida, not even a month after he took office. It continued to pay Parscale\u2019s firm an average of $474,000 a month.\n\n\nThe GOP consultant who believes there are only a few campaign staffers working at the Trump Tower headquarters said that Parscale was named to his new job last week only because the president hoped to draw attention away from the news that son-in-law Jared Kushner had lost his top-secret security clearance.\n\n\n\u201cThey knew the bad stuff was coming. It was a media spin play,\u201d the consultant said, adding that Parscale would certainly be replaced by someone else following the midterm elections this fall. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. But he doesn\u2019t know anything about politics. He knows about digital marketing.\u201d\n\n\nHuffPost reporter Nina Golgowski contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sebastian Murdock", "body": "Russia flexed its muscles Thursday when it unveiled new \u201cinvincible\u201d nuclear weapons.

It reaches across four counties and includes the affluent, center-left suburbs of Pittsburgh in the north, the solidly Republican bedroom communities to the east,\u00a0and the increasingly conservative coal towns by the West Virginia border.\n\n\nBut Democrats hoped that in a year marked by liberal fury with Trump, the right candidate could at least be competitive in a special election where turnout was bound to be lower than normal.\n\n\nLamb, 33, a square-jawed Marine veteran who resigned his assistant U.S. attorney post to run for office, fit the bill like a charm. In addition to his military service, Lamb\u2019s devout Catholic faith and more conservative stances on guns, coal and fracking made him the kind of Democrat that blue-collar voters in the district\u2019s union strongholds would at least be open to supporting. \n\n\nSaccone, a 60-year-old state representative, political science professor and former Air Force counterintelligence officer, is a staunch Tea Party conservative famous for sponsoring a bill that would permit public schools to display the motto\u00a0\u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d After beating three Republican competitors for the party nomination at a closed convention in November \u2015 including state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler, a younger and more moderate up-and-comer \u2015 Saccone made clear that his strategy would be to focus almost exclusively on turning out the right-wing GOP base. \u201cI was Trump before Trump was Trump,\u201d he declared.\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s redrawing of the congressional district boundaries in February lowered the immediate stakes of the special election. The 18th District will only exist in its current form until the end of year. Lamb\u2019s hometown of Mt. Lebanon has been moved into the new 17th District, enabling him to subsequently run again in November a place where Trump would have won by just 3 percentage points.\n\n\nBut given the symbolic power that a loss in such red territory would have, the official national GOP organs and aligned super PACs poured over $10.7 million into the district to help Saccone win.\n\n\nInitially, those groups blasted Lamb for his opposition to the Republican tax cuts. \n\n\n\nRepublicans have said the tax issue is gonna be what propels them to victory in November and Lamb showed Democrats how to combat that.\nMike Mikus, Democratic strategist\n\n\nBut Lamb argued in a February debate that he had \u201calways been for middle-class tax cuts,\u201d he simply opposed the GOP legislation because the vast majority of the savings would accrue to the rich and corporations, all while adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt.\n\n\nIn apparent recognition that the tax cut line of attack was not working, Republicans began cycling ads about the issue off of the airwaves by the end of February.\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have said the tax issue is gonna be what propels them to victory in November and Lamb showed Democrats how to combat that,\u201d Mikus said.\n\n\nRepublicans also struggled to pin Lamb as a liberal stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2015 who is unpopular in the district \u2015 despite featuring her in virtually every attack ad against Lamb.\n\n\nLamb neutralized the claim by promising in January that he would not vote for Pelosi as leader.\n\n\n\u201cMy opponent wants you to believe that the biggest issue in this race is Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Lamb said in a 30-second television ad. \u201cIt\u2019s all a big lie.\u201d\n\n\nDistancing himself from Pelosi was one of several ways that Lamb ran as a moderate unafraid to be independent from the national party. When the federal government briefly shut down in January over a dispute about the status of undocumented immigrants, Lamb broke with Senate Democrats to oppose the impasse, insisting that his experience as a Marine would help him build bridges with his Republican colleagues.\n\n\nLamb occasionally faltered in his attempts to balance the priorities of his liberal base and the swing voters he needed to win. Following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Lamb sparked progressive ire with what sounded like Republican talking points. He warned that the \u201cemotions that a lot of us are feeling right now\u201d were not a good reason to adopt new gun restrictions. He favors expanded background checks, but not an assault weapons ban and other more stringent measures.\n\n\nAt the same time, Lamb ran as a pro-union economic progressive, promising to protect Social Security and Medicare, shore up coal miners\u2019 distressed pensions and defend collective bargaining rights. Lamb told the progressive Social Security Works PAC that he supported expanding Social Security and Medicare. And while he stopped short of endorsing single-payer health care, Lamb supports empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.\n\n\nLamb likewise stuck to his support for abortion rights, despite his personal view that life begins at conception and the district\u2019s large Catholic community.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a population that is 93 percent white, Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th is not representative of the country, let alone the districts in which Democrats must generally compete.\n\n\nBut in the larger national debate over Democrats\u2019 best routes to victory, Lamb\u2019s win has a little something to offer multiple sides.\u00a0Like most of the victorious Democratic candidates in recent elections in Virginia and Alabama,\u00a0Lamb\u2019s base of support is in the educated and affluent suburbs, a locus of Democratic activists and moderate Republicans disgusted with Trump. Yet he also won back some of the working-class voters in outlying counties who historically voted for Democrats, but turned out in droves for Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\nIn the latter task, Lamb relied heavily on the region\u2019s mighty labor unions, which claim nearly a quarter of the district\u2019s voters as their members.\n\n\nAlthough former Rep. Murphy had a strong working relationship with unions, backing enough of their priorities to elicit their periodic support, Saccone established himself as a major foe of organized labor while serving in the state capitol. He is a supporter of anti-union\u00a0right-to-work\u00a0laws and had not made clear whether he would join bipartisan legislation to shore up the troubled union mine workers\u2019 pension fund.\n\n\nUnions mobilized their voter education and turnout machine to inform members and retirees that Saccone was not the kind of Republican they should back. In conversations across the district, union members who voted for Trump and Murphy cited appeals from their unions as a reason why they planned to vote for Lamb.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t cut my own throat,\u201d said Dwight Harris, a 40-year-old Republican coal miner who was voting for Lamb out of concern for his pension.\n\n\nRecognizing that a loss for Saccone would reflect poorly on his political coattails, Trump held a packed rally for the Republican candidate at the Pittsburgh airport on Saturday night. In a speech that focused mostly on his own policy priorities, Trump made the case that he needed Saccone to enact his agenda.\n\n\n\u201cI need people who can help me and this guy can really help me,\u201d he said.\n\n\nBut not enough Trump voters saw a vote for Lamb as a betrayal of Trump. Lamb\u2019s lead grew in the final days after enthusiasm for Saccone dropped, according to a Republican official familiar with the polling data.\n\n\nAnd while Saccone fashioned himself as a copy of Trump, he both lacked the president\u2019s bombastic oratory and ideological flexibility on contentious right-wing social causes.\n\n\nAt a Monday rally at a VFW Hall with Donald Trump Jr., Saccone launched into an inflammatory rant against the political left, which he said has a \u201chatred for our country\u201d and a \u201chatred for God.\u201d\n\n\nBut during a Lamb rally at the Greene County fairgrounds on Sunday deep in coal country, Lars Lange, a 64-year-old miner-turned-attorney, thought Lamb was the candidate in the race who most approximated Trump\u2019s political nack for showering attention on economically neglected areas.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming down to these areas where nobody thinks a Democrat is gonna get supporters and he\u2019s getting all these big crowds,\u201d Lange said. \u201cThat he might have taken from Trump\u2019s playbook.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Reuters", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave the green light to two class-action lawsuits filed by residents of Flint, Michigan who are pursuing civil rights claims against local and state officials over lead contamination in the city\u2019s water supply.\n\n\nThe justices left in place a July 2017 ruling by the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that revived the litigation after the lawsuits were thrown out by a lower court.\n\n\nThe high court rejected separate appeals filed by the city of Flint, Genesee County\u2019s drainage commissioner and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality officials.\n\n\nThe 6th Circuit decided that the civil rights claims brought by the plaintiffs under federal law could proceed, ruling they were not precluded by a statute that sets the standards for drinking water, the Safe Drinking Water Act. That law has its own provisions for people to file suit over unsafe water, although they cannot seek monetary damages like those available under civil rights law.\n\n\nFlint, a predominantly black city, switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in a cost-cutting move in April 2014. The polluted river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Lead poisoning stunts children\u2019s cognitive development. No level of exposure is considered safe.\n\n\nThe city switched back to Lake Huron water in October 2015, but lead levels remained above federal standards until early 2017.\n\n\nThe crisis prompted several lawsuits against the city, state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and several individual city and state officials. Two of those suits were the subject of the Supreme Court appeals.\n\n\nIn one, Melissa Mays and several other Flint-based parents sued in November 2015 on behalf of themselves and their children. In the other, Flint residents Beatrice Boler, Edwin Anderson and others sued in January 2016 on behalf of Flint residents and businesses.\n\n\nJulie Hurwitz and Bill Goodman, lawyers representing Mays, praised Monday\u2019s action by the justices, saying in a statement that it \u201csignals that the State of Michigan and all of its cronies are reaching the end of the line in their ongoing efforts to avoid being held accountable.\u201d\n\n\nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality declined comment.

If it\u2019s true, Jared Kushner has to go,\u201d Murphy, a prominent voice on foreign policy, said of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d\n\n\nThe Intercept reported on Friday that representatives of Kushner Companies, including Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, met with Qatari Finance Minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi in New York in April in a bid to secure Qatari financing for the firm\u2019s\u00a0distressed signature property, 666 5th Avenue.\u00a0\n\n\nThere was a follow-up meeting between Kushner Companies representatives and Qatari officials the following day.\u00a0But a deal never materialized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in early June, a coalition of nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates abruptly severed diplomatic relations with Qatar. They proceeded to blockade the small, natural gas-rich nation, ostensibly in retaliation for Qatar\u2019s support of islamist movements abroad and cordial relationship with Iran. The blockade remains in effect.\n\n\nTrump surprised many in the diplomatic community by initially backing the Saudis and Emiratis so whole-heartedly. Qatar, a longtime American partner,\u00a0is home to a key strategic base for the U.S. military in the Middle East where thousands of troops are deployed.\n\n\n\u201cWe could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudis\u2019 side in this dispute between the Saudis, the Emiratis and Qatar, because the United States has very important interests in Qatar,\u201d Murphy said Sunday.\n\n\nMurphy noted the large U.S. troop presence in Qatar.\n\n\n\u201cTo so firmly take the side of the Saudis against the Qataris that could potentially result in the downward spiral of the Qatari economy put thousands of Americans at risk,\u201d he said.\n\n\nJared Kushner\u2019s friendship with UAE Ambassador to the United States Yousef al-Otaiba and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman raised suspicion at the time he had encouraged Trump to take a hard line against Qatar.\n\n\nNews of the Kushner family\u2019s attempts to gain Qatari financing for a family-owned property raises the prospect that Kushner advised the president to side with the Saudis and Emiratis for personal financial reasons.\u00a0\n\n\nIf verified,\u00a0that should be grounds for Kushner\u2019s ouster, Murphy said.\n\n\n\u201cIf the reason this administration put U.S. troops at risk in Qatar was to protect the Kushners\u2019 financial interests, then that\u2019s all the evidence you need to make some big changes in the White House,\u201d he said.\n\n\nNBC News reported Friday that special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Kushner\u2019s business discussions with foreign powers during the presidential transition, well before his father\u2019s April 2017 meeting, later influenced American foreign policy. In addition to Qatari representatives, Kushner met with figures from Turkey, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to the report.\n\n\nThe potentially damaging revelations about Kushner surfaced during an already punishing week for the Trump relative and confidant. Kushner, who had enjoyed a temporary top-secret security clearance, saw his clearance downgraded\u00a0by the White House to merely \u201csecret.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the justification for the downgrade was not immediately clear, experts note that it was unusual for someone to have a temporary clearance for so long without receiving permanent access. The White House\u2019s decision not to grant him a permanent security clearance likely sprang from intelligence agencies\u2019 concerns that foreign governments have tried to influence him and that he initially failed to report his meetings with officials from those governments.\n\n\nAlso speaking on \u201cThis Week,\u201d former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a onetime Trump transition team chief, implied that Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump (who\u2019s also a White House adviser), should consider stepping down from their posts for the good of the president. (As a United States attorney, Christie sent Kushner\u2019s father to prison, which likely chilled his relationship with Jared.)\n\n\nAsked by Stephanopoulos whether Trump should fire Kushner, Christie responded, \u201cThe president\u2019s going to have to make that judgment.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe went on to suggest that Kushner and Ivanka might do well to spare Trump the difficulty of spurning family members by volunteering their resignations.\n\n\n\u201cThe situation is made much worse by the fact that we have family members in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for Jared and for Ivanka and for all the other members of the family who were involved in one way or the other, I think everybody\u2019s got to focus on what\u2019s best for the president.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Reuters", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping Saturday after the ruling Communist party announced it was eliminating the two-term limit for the presidency, paving the way for Xi to serve indefinitely, according to audio aired by CNN.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s now president for life, president for life.

She\u2019s running for Congress.\n\n\nA single mom based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Haaland isn\u2019t new to politics. She chaired the state\u2019s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2017, and was the Native American vote director for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012. That\u2019s in addition to nearly two decades of volunteering on Democratic campaigns, and a failed bid for lieutenant governor in 2014.\n\n\nBut if she wins her race, it will be her first time in the House and the House\u2019s first time having someone like her. An enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, Haaland would be the first Native American woman to serve in Congress.\n\n\n\u201cCrazy, right?\u201d\u00a0she said during a recent sit-down with HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s 2018.\u201d\n\n\nShe could end up sharing the historic distinction with Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation,\u00a0who is also running for Congress this year.\u00a0Davids, a Democrat, is taking on Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kansas).\n\n\nHaaland said the last thing she could do in Congress is speak on behalf of any tribes. But she does understand what life is like for native people living on reservations or in rural areas, and said they deserve a voice at the table when policy issues are being debated. She noted, for example, that tribes didn\u2019t get to weigh in at all on the GOP\u2019s massive tax reform bill that became law late last year.\u00a0It\u00a0does nothing\u00a0to address economic development disparities affecting Indian Country.\n\n\nShe also knows what it\u2019s like to be poor.\u00a0Haaland\u00a0describes a childhood of used clothes, working at a bakery for $1.95 an hour and later in life being denied food stamps for Thanksgiving. She didn\u2019t go to\u00a0college until she was 28 because she didn\u2019t know she was supposed to go. Neither of her parents, who were both in the military, went to college. Haaland ended up getting a degree in English, and later a law degree.\n\n\nMost members of Congress can\u2019t relate to people who grew up in poverty, she said, and Trump definitely can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re insulated by private schools and money and everything you could ever dream of, it\u2019s hard to put yourself in the position of an everyday American.\u00a0He\u2019s too selfish,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cHe\u2019s never had to struggle.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked how her friends and family in tribal communities are feeling about Trump\u2019s presidency, Haaland laughed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe is not liked,\u201d she finally said.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the president would be unpopular in Indian Country.\u00a0Never mind Trump\u2019s\u00a0plans to shrink national monuments that Native Americans consider sacred land, or his budget\u2019s massive proposed cuts to job training programs that directly help Native Americans. He straight-up insults them frequently.\n\n\nTrump routinely mocks Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d referring to her contested claims of Native American ancestry. He even made the crack at a White House event honoring Native American war heroes. Attendees responded with silence.\u00a0It didn\u2019t help that Trump held the event in front of a portrait of President Andrew Jackson, a man nicknamed \u201cIndian Killer\u201d for being a forceful proponent of Indian removal.\n\n\nTribal communities are \u201cabsolutely\u201d paying attention to slights like this, said Haaland. \u201cAndrew Jackson is the worst Indian hater we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\n\nShe has been going after Trump ever since he became a presidential candidate. As state Democratic Party chairwoman,\u00a0Haaland held multiple press conferences denouncing his rhetoric and wrote a scathing May 2016 op-ed\u00a0about his\u00a0\u201cdisrespectful\u201d use of Pocahontas\u2019 name in his attacks on Warren.\n\n\n\u201cMy point in defending Elizabeth Warren is it\u2019s not up to him. It\u2019s not up to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to decide who is Indian and who is not Indian.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to decide who is Indian and who is not Indian.\nDeb Haaland on Trump\n\n\nHaaland is vying for the seat currently held by Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D), who is running for governor. It\u2019s a safe Democratic seat, but because the incumbent is leaving, Haaland has stiff competition. Six Democrats are competing in the June 5 primary.\n\n\nShe\u2019s doing pretty well financially, having raised roughly\u00a0$385,000\u00a0as of Dec. 31 for her campaign, which is focused largely on clean energy and jobs.\u00a0But one of her opponents, Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, had raised about $505,000 by then. And both Lopez and another candidate, Damon Martinez, had more cash on hand than Haaland.\n\n\nMoney isn\u2019t everything, of course.\u00a0Haaland has endorsements from a dozen members of Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Organization for Women PAC. Nearly four dozen national and state tribes and pueblos are also behind her.\n\n\nShe points to her successes as chairwoman of the state Democratic Party as one thing that sets her apart in the race. On her watch, Democrats increased their seats in the state Senate, won two out of three statewide elections and made New Mexico one of just two states to flip its state House from GOP to Democratic control.\n\n\nBut clearly, it\u2019s her fight for Native American priorities that distinguishes her time in public office. As state party chair,\u00a0she traveled to Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota and joined people protesting the planned construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which threatens the region\u2019s clean water and ancient burial grounds. She also led an effort to divest the state\u2019s party from Wells Fargo over the bank\u2019s investments in the pipeline.\n\n\n\u201cIs there anyone in Congress who went to Standing Rock to stand up for Native folks? No,\u201d\u00a0Haaland said. \u201cI can tell you one thing.

Rick Saccone in Tuesday\u2019s election, although the margin was thin. It was a staggering show of Democratic strength in a deep-red Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by almost 20 points in 2016.\n\n\n\u201cThe young man last night that ran, he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.\u2019 He ran on that basis,\u201d Trump said at a fundraiser in Missouri on Wednesday, according The Atlantic. \u201cHe ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, \u2018Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nLamb, in fact, ran against the GOP-passed tax cut law. And even conservative groups realized that the signature achievement of the Republican Congress wasn\u2019t resonating with voters; they shifted away from that issue as the campaign went on. Saccone, however, tried to sell himself as a politician in the mold of Trump.\n\n\nJust last weekend,\u00a0Trump campaigned outside of Pittsburgh for GOP candidate Rick Saccone, a state senator whose message was built on support of Trump and his policies.\u00a0But what typically would have been an easy GOP victory on Tuesday evening became a narrow race between Saccone and Democratic opponent Conor Lamb that stretched into the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n\nLamb declared victory, leading by only a few hundred votes. By Wednesday evening, he was projected to win as the remaining absentee, provisional and military ballots would not have been enough for Saccone to surpass Lamb.\n\n\nTrump claimed Wednesday that he \u201clifted [Saccone]\u00a07 points up,\u201d although it\u2019s not clear how he came up with that number.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually interesting, because it\u2019s only a congressman for five months,\u201d Trump added, downplaying the results.\u00a0Because of redistricting, the 18th District will exist in its current form only until the end of the year. Lamb\u2019s hometown will be shifted into a new district, an area where Trump would have won by just 3 percentage points.\n\n\nSaccone\u2019s projected loss would add to a string of embarrassing Republican performances in special elections as the 2018 midterm primaries loom. Trump has distanced himself from previous GOP special election losers, including\u00a0Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was upset by Democrat Doug Jones.\n\n\nThe southwestern Pennsylvania congressional district, a traditional GOP bastion that includes the affluent south suburbs of Pittsburgh and rural towns in former coal country, became vacant late last year, when former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) resigned after pressuring a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion.\n\n\nRepublicans had invested vast time and energy trying to prevent a close race against Lamb, who gained support in part by distancing himself from national Democrats and staking out more conservative positions.\n\n\nIn addition to Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and two of Trump\u2019s children, Donald Trump Jr. and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, had visited the area in recent weeks to drum up support for Saccone.\n\n\nBy Tuesday night, as a closer-than-expected race appeared likely, Republicans were already coming up with various reasons to blame Saccone and downplay the results,\u00a0with one GOP strategist complaining about the candidate\u2019s facial hair.\n\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Raj Shah suggested to reporters Wednesday that Trump should take credit for helping Saccone \u2015 a message similar to what the president said at the fundraiser later that night.\n\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s engagement in the race turned what was a deficit for the Republican candidate to what is essentially a tie,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\n\nBut Saccone was widely predicted to win the traditionally GOP district.\n\n\nShah also claimed that Lamb won because he\u00a0\u201creally embraced the president\u2019s policies and his vision.\u201d\n\n\nUnder Pennsylvania law,\u00a0this congressional election does not automatically trigger a recount.

It\u2019s not too far from what some U.S. political consultants are doing themselves.\n\n\nTake Sally Albright, a\u00a0Democratic Party communications consultant who backed presidential candidate\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016. Unsurprisingly, Albright is vocally opposed to President\u00a0Donald Trump and a big supporter of the resistance to his administration. She is also one of the loudest, most divisive voices attacking Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton\u2019s onetime Democratic primary opponent, and his left-wing supporters.\n\n\nWell after the primary, Albright continues to claim that Sanders is a fraud, a liar, racist and corrupt, among many other things. In one instance she declared that the policy idea of free college, as promoted by Sanders, was racist. This provoked Sanders supporters to argue back.\n\n\nTrevor, a Sanders supporter who declined to provide his last name for fear of being doxxed, but goes by @likingonline on Twitter, noticed a strange pattern of behavior when Albright responded to him. Her tweets addressing him were rapidly retweeted by the same series of accounts. This created a barrage of notifications making it look as though there was an avalanche of opposition to everything he said.\n\n\nBut as Trevor discovered, after an extensive amount of research that he posted online, these were not normal accounts. They appeared to be bots \u2015 automated accounts masked as real people being used to amplify a particular political message. Who is really pulling the strings, however, remains a mystery.\n\n\nAlbright told HuffPost that the accounts were voluntarily handed over by their original users to an unnamed client of hers to be automated in \u201can analytics program.\u201d She said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement and could not disclose who was collecting and automating these accounts or for what purpose.\n\n\nBut like her, these accounts were all pro-Clinton, anti-Trump and anti-Sanders.\n\n\nDoes \"free college\" specifically benefit women and minorities? Does it benefit anyone who isn't already going to college and just doesn't want to pay? Reinforcing the status quo is racist.\n\u2014 Sally Albright (@SallyAlbright) January 17, 2018\n\n\n\nTwitter allows users to automate their accounts, including\u00a0setting up automatic retweeting and liking of other accounts. This increases activity on the platform, something Twitter obviously wants to do, and allows busy users to promote messages or businesses that they support. Presumably Twitter did not anticipate that users would simply hand their accounts over to another person or campaign to artificially spread the latter\u2019s tweets.\n\n\nThe ability to swamp a debate with automated messages is a problem for political discourse around the world. Twitter is a vital platform for political debate. Automating Twitter accounts to retweet or otherwise promote specific messages thus becomes a tactic to silence political debate and squelch free speech.\n\n\nIn Mexico, allies of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have\u00a0deployed swarms of Twitter bots\u00a0to overwhelm and effectively shut down online debates. Journalists in the U.S. experienced a similar flood during the 2016 election from pro-Trump, neo-Nazi sock-puppet accounts posting anti-Semitic death threats. Often instead of suppressing speech it doesn\u2019t like, the Chinese government these days\u00a0drowns it\u00a0on local social media platforms with a flood of pro-government content. University of North Carolina scholar Zeynep Tufecki has labeled this tactic\u00a0a new form of censorship.\n\n\nWhat the automated accounts deployed by Albright\u2019s unnamed client did was similar.\n\n\nOver the course of the last year or so, Albright was their favorite account to retweet\u00a0\u2015 almost always as a group. The fake accounts also retweeted people who responded to Albright\u2019s tweets \u2015 again, usually as a group, and often while in a debate with other users.\n\n\nThe writers at Shareblue, a pro-Democratic Party news site that supported Clinton in the primary and general elections, were also frequently retweeted by the network of fake accounts, particularly when the Shareblue folks had something negative to say about Sanders.\u00a0A spokeswoman for Shareblue told HuffPost that the company does not create sock-puppet accounts and has never worked with Albright.\n\n\nThese accounts also liked #resistance celebrities like liberal conspiracy theorist Eric Garland (\u201cTime for some game theory\u201d) and Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. And they were often deployed in intra-Democratic Party battles.\n\n\nWhen Albright led a Twitter campaign to attack a 2017 women\u2019s conference for inviting Sanders to speak \u2015 after Clinton, Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) and Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0(D-N.Y.) had turned them down \u2015 the automated account network deployed to retweet her and any positive responses to her tweets.\n\n\nAlbright probably didn\u2019t need those retweets, as there were actual people opposing the conference\u2019s decision. Still, someone questioned her campaign to block Sanders from speaking,\u00a0describing it as similar to \u201cRussian division strategy.\u201d\u00a0She wrote back, \u201cNyet. I am not Russian.\u201d\n\n\nThen over a dozen fake accounts retweeted her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this pro-Albright Twitter force, many of the accounts have taken on false personas with stolen photographs \u2015 just like the Russian trolls that tried to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\n\nThe account named for Iris Winter, which is temporarily suspended, uses a picture of Spanish ice dancer Sara Hurtado. Minnie Casera\u2019s supposed picture comes from the Facebook account of\u00a0Martina Painter, an Alaskan who died on Jan. 11, 2017. The picture used by Georgia Miles is actually\u00a0Deja Farrior-Quinones, a New Jersey woman who was killed in September 2016 by a car involved in a high-speed police chase. Maggie Campell\u2019s picture is one of\u00a0Deb Solsrud, a Florida woman who died in a plane crash in December 2016. Madeleine Ware\u2019s photo is really Mary Knowlton, a retired librarian who was\u00a0killed in August 2016 by a police officer in a practice drill.\n\n\nAllison Rowe\u2019s account uses the picture of Dr. Roberta Guilizzoni, an Italian physicist who works at the National Physical Laboratory in London. Baylee Allmon\u2019s picture is actually the Bosnian model Nejla Hadzic. The account of\u00a0Callie Calloway\u00a0uses a picture of\u00a0Kelsey Lundy, a lobbyist in Arizona for Compass Strategies. Cameron Gibson\u00a0offers an image of the freelance travel writer Sarah Gordon that appeared in the Daily Mail.\u00a0Francie McCormack has taken her picture from the Twitter account of\u00a0Callie Maries. The photo of Lena Robinson\u00a0is actually Ashlynn Sparks, an Alabama teenager who was shot to death in 2016.\n\n\nThe account of Gwen Barstow is temporarily restricted, probably because it used an image of Meaghan Delcourt, an Ottawa woman who was\u00a0in the local news in 2015 after her apartment balcony collapsed underneath her.\n\n\nCheryl Montgomery\u2019s account @cherry_mgm was suspended in February after Catherine Simpson, a public relations professional in Vancouver, Canada, alerted Twitter that it was using her picture.\u00a0The theft of Simpson\u2019s photo to create this fake account was previously reported by the Canadian\u00a0Global News.\u00a0\n\n\nAlbright admitted to HuffPost that she had handed over a number of accounts to that unnamed client that had been connected to previous projects of hers and that were no longer in use.\u00a0She also said that she changed the pictures for some of them.\n\n\nOne of the Albright-linked  to have a picture of an actual person named Kirby Manning. But the Manning photo has been taken from someone else and appropriated for this account. The real person is\u00a0Brinkley Hutchings, a leadership coach and environmental activist in Alabama.\n\n\nOther accounts that Albright said she provided to her client\u2019s project included @PropagandaMnstr, @DruidCityMedia, @VotrProtection, @BucksPocket, @Sallying and @SocialCapitol. Each of these accounts was connected to a website domain that had been purchased by Albright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accounts that link directly to websites owned by Albright and those pretending to be people they are not exhibit similar patterns of behavior. They retweet Albright and other accounts with similar messages at an extremely high rate. Each account has made tens of thousands of tweets, almost all of which are retweets.\u00a0And they all almost exclusively\u00a0post using an application called Buffer.\n\n\nBuffer, a social media management application with more than 2 million users, allows an individual to schedule tweets, retweets and likes; to schedule posts on other social media sites; and to control multiple accounts at once. It provides a limited free service for ordinary users and more extensive paid services for businesses and social media professionals.\n\n\nIn March 2017, Albright\u00a0tweeted a complaint at Buffer about a problem she was having with a recent update. In one tweet in that conversation,\u00a0she posted a screenshot of her Buffer account. That screenshot showed a number of profile pictures from Twitter accounts under her control through Buffer.\n\n\nAmong the pictures were those of @PropagandaMnstr, @CapWaterfront and @BucksPocket, all accounts known to be linked to her. There were also profile pictures for accounts that Trevor had listed in his original expos\u00e9 of potentially fake accounts, including @FactoryofTruth, @_Stacey_Eff, @FordColvin, @GatsbyGirl, @PoliticalSavvy, @WTHisBill and @__SallyForth.\n\n\nAlbright told HuffPost that this screenshot was \u201creally old\u201d and that she no longer had access to the Buffer account controlling those accounts.\n\n\nWhile it is still not known what organization was actually behind these automated accounts, most of them ceased operations after they were spotted by Trevor.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Albright, who said she is no longer connected to the unknown project, concedes that this kind of automation may be problematic.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see it as the same thing as the Russian accounts, but I guess since you\u2019re calling me about it, I guess that means that it\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t think that it was \u2015 if that makes sense,\u201d Albright said. \u201cPeople seem

it found no \u201cclear and convincing evidence of bias.\u201d\nPersky has defended his action in the case. \u201cCalifornia law requires every judge to consider rehabilitation and probation for first-time offenders,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not always popular, but it\u2019s the law, and I took an oath to follow it without regard to public opinion or any personal opinions I might have as a former prosecutor.\u201d\nBut many advocates were outraged over what they felt to be an overly lenient verdict granted to Turner, in part based on his privilege as a white male and a star athlete.\n\u201cThis historic campaign is part of a national social movement to end impunity for athletes and other privileged perpetrators of sexual assault and violence against women,\u201d Dauber said.\nIn a\u00a0devastating statement\u00a0read out loud by the victim in court and published online on media outlets, the 23-year-old woman, referred to\u00a0\u201cEmily Doe\u201d in news reports, described waking up in the hospital and being told she was a \u201crape victim.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0\nDuring the trial, she said, Turner\u2019s attorneys asked her questions like, \u201cWhat were you wearing\u201d and \u201cHow much did you drink?\u201d\nOpponents of the recall effort, however, say Turner received a fair trial and that letting voters decide Persky\u2019s fate would undermine the judicial system.\nThe Santa Clara County Bar Association opposes the proposed recall and has urged residents to vote \u201cno\u201d in June.\nIn a January op-ed for\u00a0The Sacramento Bee, University of California, Berkeley\u2019s law school dean Erwin Chemerinsky called the recall campaign \u201ca threat to judicial independence.\u201d\n\u201cJustice, and all of us, will suffer when judges base their decisions on what will satisfy the voters,\u201d he wrote.\nBut Dauber disagreed, noting that Persky holds an elected position and stands for re-election every six years.\n\u201cThis recall simply moves the date of his election from 2022 to 2018,\u201d she said. \u201cJudges at his level are not fully independent like federal judges.

And it certainly didn\u2019t mean that Democrats were going to dominate at the polls in November.\n\n\nAll it means, at least according to these strategists, is that their candidate running in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District sucked. State Rep. Rick Saccone was horrible, and it\u2019s his fault the GOP was embarrassed nationally.\n\n\n\u201cHe came across as establishment. And I think that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former aide to Trump\u2019s campaign, in a CNN interview Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Statehouse. He very much sounds like he\u2019s already part of Washington. You flip on the TV there ... and a lot of it looks really cookie-cutter, like, we\u2019re Washington, and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d\n\n\nBut other Republicans thought he could have used a bit more polish. \n\n\n\u201cThis may not be nice to say: The fact is that the Saccone campaign was a joke. If we had a candidate who could walk and chew gum at the same time, we would have [easily] won the race,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, in a statement. \n\n\nAn anonymous Pennsylvania GOP strategist told The Washington Examiner they had a very specific complaint about Saccone: His moustache was disgusting.\n\n\n\u2033It\u2019s a porn stache,\u201d the strategist said. \u00a0\n\n\nSaccone was overwhelmingly favored to win the race. The district was so solidly Republican that Democrats didn\u2019t even field a congressional candidate here in 2014 and 2016. GOP groups dumped nearly $11 million into the campaign on advertising and media messaging \u2015 an astounding amount for a district that will not exist due to redistricting next year.\n\n\nBut instead, Democrat Conor Lamb gained momentum. The 33-year-old political novice left his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh to run in the special election, and he significantly outpaced Saccone in fundraising throughout the race \u2015 another mark against the GOP candidate.\n\n\n\u201cWhen candidates don\u2019t raise as much in hard dollars, it\u2019s very difficult to run these things from afar,\u201d Mike DeVanney, a Pittsburgh-based Republican political consultant told HuffPost. \n\n\n\u201cCandidates and campaigns matter, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a race,\u201d said a national Republican operative active in the race who asked not to be named. \u201cYou have one candidate that\u2019s out of central casting, Conor Lamb, and then you have a candidate on the Republican side who, it was expected, would be lackluster in fundraising.\u201d\n\n\nMany of Saccone\u2019s supporters who came to his election party in the Youghiogheny Country Club on Tuesday night were close friends from Elizabeth Township. Saccone grew up there and now lives there with his family.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of them said they were frustrated that the national Republican Party chose to spend almost all of its resources on negative ads rather than ads highlighting the character traits of the humble and generous man they say they know from their neighborhood. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI feel like when the national party got involved and they put out the advertising and everything, it doesn\u2019t focus on Rick. Rick is freaking amazing,\u201d said Lesa DeMaio, 52, who runs a tutoring business in town. \n\n\nShar Tibbitt, 56, Saccone\u2019s office manager at the state House, provided a similar assessment. She teared up recounting the moment she told Saccone that she had undergone a double mastectomy to remove breast cancer. Saccone broke down crying and then prayed with her. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know Rep. Saccone doesn\u2019t like to do attack ads. I wish [the national groups] would have promoted Rick more and stopped attacking the opponent,\u201d Tibbitt said. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhen these same Saccone partisans were asked what they then made of Republican operatives blaming Saccone and his campaign for the close nature of the race, they were very frustrated. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. I don\u2019t understand how they can blame him. They\u2019re the ones who made the ads,\u201d Tibbitt said.\n\n\nBut Bryer Cochenour, an 18-year-old student at Westminster College who cast the first vote of his life for Saccone, was not particularly ruffled by GOP criticism of Saccone. He saw it as the typical behavior of political operatives in both parties trying to pass the buck.\n\n\n\u201cThey threw Hillary under the bus,\u201d he said of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cAnyone who sees that a race might be close or might not be in their favor, they throw them under the bus.\u201d\n\n\nTrump made a last-minute campaign appearance for Saccone, although he spent very little time actually talking about the race itself. The president has reportedly trashed Saccone in private, considering him a \u201dweak\u2033 candidate.\n\n\nBut there was far more going on than just whether or not Saccone was a strong candidate. Nationwide, Democrats have dominated at the ballot box since Trump took office, flipping 39 state legislative seats from red to blue \u2015 along with the governor\u2019s mansion in New Jersey and a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Republicans, meanwhile, have taken over just four state legislative seats previously held by Democrats.\u00a0\n\n\nA number of voters who backed Trump but decided to support Lamb said they did so not because Saccone was an unpolished or incompetent candidate but simply because they didn\u2019t like his policy views on issues like labor rights \u2015 a major factor in this union-heavy district. \n\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 marquee legislative achievement just didn\u2019t play well here either. The GOP intended to make passage of the tax cut law the centerpiece of its strategy in the 2018 midterms. But Republican groups stopped airing ads mentioning tax cuts toward the end of the Pennsylvania race after realizing the issue wasn\u2019t moving voters. \n\n\nAnd, of course, there was that much-mentioned energy that has been fueling the Democratic side and grassroots groups in the age of Trump. Stunned by losses in 2016, the left has mobilized in a way that even Republicans acknowledge could portend a blue wave in November. \n\n\nAlthough Trump likes to boast that his supporters will never desert him, results like the Pennsylvania special election show that his appeal is limited. At least some members of his base have no problem rejecting Republican candidates \u2015 even ones he supports.\n\n\nAmanda Terkel and Igor Bobic reported from Washington.

They have remained empty despite a state law requiring that special elections be called as promptly as possible when a seat becomes vacant before the second Tuesday in May in a regularly scheduled election year.\n\n\nWalker decided instead to let the new legislators be chosen in November \u2015 because he said it would save the state money and the legislature wouldn\u2019t be in session in any case. His lawyers also said that he didn\u2019t have to call special elections sooner because the vacancies occurred in late 2017 and not in 2018, the year of the next regularly scheduled elections.

Young", "body": "In commenting on his decision to remove Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from his position last week, President\u00a0Donald Trump explained to reporters at the White House, \u201cWe were not really thinking the same. Really, it was a different mindset, a different thinking.\u201d \n\n\nThat different way of thinking had been apparent from the start of Tillerson\u2019s stint at State, visible not only in the secretary\u2019s disagreement with Trump on how best to handle North Korea, but also in the pettier matters that have come to define this pitiful presidency. Tillerson, a former Eagle Scout, reportedly objected to Trump\u2019s gross politicization of his visit to the Boy Scout Jamboree over the summer. And he found the president\u2019s ability to command basic facts so unimpressive that he reportedly referred to Trump as a moron\u00a0in front of other administration officials.\n\n\nWhile the coming negotiations with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un provided a useful cover for Trump\u2019s hasty actions, Tillerson\u2019s exit really owed to his failure to fall in line with the president, something Trump assured reporters would not be a problem with his new appointee to State, Mike Pompeo. \u201cWe\u2019re always on the same wavelength,\u201d Trump said of Pompeo. \n\n\nPerhaps anticipating more criticism of the continually revolving door that is the White House these days, Trump defended his move. \u201cI\u2019m really at a point where we\u2019re getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things I want,\u201d Trump explained, as if the West Wing\u2019s constant turnover was some refining process of personnel rather than a crisis of presidential leadership. \n\n\nOn Thursday, Trump continued his staffing shuffle, naming John Bolton as his new national security adviser in place of H.R. McMaster. Trump\u2019s selection of Bolton, the warmongering U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under George W. Bush, is a chilling prospect for those who hoped Trump\u2019s saber-rattling with North Korea might be tempered by cooler heads inside the White House. Bolton is an aggressive hawk who is certain to cheerlead Trump\u2019s worst impulses. \n\n\nAll of these moves undercut Trump\u2019s businessman boasts that he would bring only the \u201cbest people\u201d to Washington, of course. But they also make plain that the real business of this administration is to serve Trump\u2019s ego rather than the nation. In cutting out dissenters or even strong counterweights in his administration for the steady stream of sycophants and, let\u2019s not forget, fawning family members he has gathered around him, Trump has ensured his White House will never be mistaken for Abraham Lincoln\u2019s \u201cteam of rivals.\u201d Instead, Trump is assembling a cabal of cronies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early American administrations, presidential Cabinets often included fractious elements who battled with each other and their president over what the young nation\u2019s course should be. But Lincoln\u2019s decision to appoint the three men he had defeated for the Republican nomination in 1860 \u2013 William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates \u2013 along with three former Democrats to his Cabinet established the adversarial model that subsequent presidents would follow. \n\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt may have best continued the tradition. Faced with the challenges of leading the country through the Great Depression and up against a Republican Party that wanted him to fail, FDR might have chosen a Cabinet that affirmed his every step. Instead, Roosevelt selected a team of advisers notorious for arguing and rarely in agreement. Believing the best ideas would arise out of this maelstrom, FDR understood that he would have to first take on counterarguments inside his own ranks if he hoped to bring about the large-scale changes he desired for the country. \n\n\nOther presidents followed suit. John F. Kennedy chose two Republicans to fill spots in his Cabinet, a move he hoped demonstrated a bipartisan spirit after a razor-thin win over Richard Nixon in 1960. Just as FDR had wanted his staff to challenge his ideas on how to deal with the nation\u2019s economic crisis, JFK purposefully sought voices of disagreement as he determined how to handle the escalating tensions with the Soviet Union. The strategy paid off during the Cuban missile crisis. \n\n\nMore recently, George W. Bush assembled a Cabinet that included powerful, qualified officials, including Robert Gates and Colin Powell, to fill in the spots where his inexperience would show. (Trump has shown no similar thoughtfulness about how a carefully selected Cabinet could help cover up his glaring inadequacies as chief executive.)\n\n\nBarack Obama frequently cited Lincoln\u2019s \u201cteam of rivals\u201d style of leadership as the reason for stocking his administration with his former competitors for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, and picking three Republicans for his Cabinet. (One of those, Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, withdrew from consideration before he was confirmed as secretary of commerce, however.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is no student of history, certainly, and his leadership style veers more to the impulsive than the pragmatic. Still, it\u2019s worth taking stock of the personality cult Trump has built for himself inside the White House, and what it means for the nation that he is using the presidency as his personal form of therapy.\n\n\nStaff members provide Trump with folders twice a day filled with favorable news articles, flattering tweets, and even pictures of the president for him to pore over. This for a man who can\u2019t be bothered to read national security briefings, we might remember.\n\n\nRecall also the Cabinet meetings that have begun with Trump calling on each member to praise him and express appreciation for working for him. Other presidents usually prefer hearing updates about the work those secretaries\u2019 departments are carrying out, but Trump has made clear to those around him that what he most wants to hear is how well they think he is doing. The nation can take care of itself. \n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no pushback. But Tillerson\u2019s experience shows what a self-defeating approach that voicing dissent can be in this White House. Jeff Sessions may be the next to learn the lesson. Although one of Trump\u2019s first and most enthusiastic backers, Sessions now finds himself on the outs with the president and possibly next in the firing line due to his refusal to follow some of Trump\u2019s ideas about how to use the Justice Department.\n\n\nWhether Sessions stays or goes, Trump will continue to use the threat of expulsion to draw out unquestioning adherence and unwavering loyalty \u2013 his favorite word \u2013 from those around him. But most of that effort will be merely for show. Trump consults few of his advisers, in fact, and relies mostly on his own flawed and impetuous judgment. In the end, this emperor has no close associates. \n\n\nFrighteningly, Trump\u2019s tendencies for isolation and self-direction will only increase in whatever time he has left in office. As The New York Times reported\u00a0 this week, Trump, having grown confident in the role of president, now feels \u201cnewly emboldened\u201d to ignore the advice of those around him and follow only his own instincts. \n\n\nAfter more than a year in office, Trump may have finally found his sea legs. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s captaining the Titanic while his obsequious lackeys in the White House quietly rearrange the deck chairs.\n\n\nNeil J.

And Trump himself\u00a0tweeted\u00a0later that night: \u201cGot $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.\u201d\n\n\nBut Democrats pointed out that only $641 million of that money is designated for 33 miles of \u201cnew fencing or levees\u201d \u2015 specifically not a concrete wall. The rest of the money is for repairing or replacing existing fencing or border security technology.\n\n\nThe White House press office did not respond to a HuffPost query regarding the lack of wall money in the omnibus bill. Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement generally praising the spending plan that had still not been finalized.\n\n\nTrump promised from the day he began his campaign in June 2015 that he would build a \u201cgreat wall\u201d to keep out illegal immigrants from Mexico.\n\n\n\u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d Trump boasted during his Trump Tower announcement speech. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\u201d\n\n\nOver the next 17 months, he promised hundreds of times that he would build the wall quickly, and at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Trump explained that his wall would be at least 30 feet tall and extend deep underground to prevent tunneling. At a December 2015 visit to Manassas, Virginia, Trump even went into construction details.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be made of hardened concrete, and it\u2019s going to be made out of rebar. That\u2019s steel,\u201d Trump said in response to a boy\u2019s question. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to set (the rebar) in nice, heavy foundations.\u201d\n\n\nBut having Mexico pay for a wall that that country does not even support was never a realistic possibility. A planned meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was recently canceled because Pe\u00f1a Nieto would not back away from his refusal to pay.\n\n\nGetting Congress to appropriate as much as $25 billion of American taxpayer money for Trump\u2019s project has also proved difficult. Democrats hold enough votes to block a spending bill, and they have refused to go along with Trump\u2019s wall unless he agrees to a bill that protects undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. They have been allowed to work in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created by former President Barack Obama. Trump canceled DACA last year, a decision that is now tied up in the courts.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, predicted during a February White House briefing that the border wall money was essentially contingent on Trump and Congress agreeing on a DACA fix. Without such a deal, he said, \u201cCongress will never give us the money.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kimberly Yam", "body": "Despite backlash from Asian-American civil rights groups, FBI chief Christopher Wray defended his previous portrayal of Chinese people in the U.S. as threats.\u00a0\n\n\nIn an interview with NBC News published on Wednesday, Wray addressed the controversial statements he made during a hearing with the Senate intelligence committee.\n\n\nAt the February hearing, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) had asked the FBI director about the \u201ccounterintelligence risk posed to U.S. national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in science and mathematics.\u201d\n\n\nWray responded by accusing Chinese individuals in academia, from professors to scientists to students, of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of and \u201cexploiting the very open research and development environment\u201d in the U.S.\n\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end,\u201d Wray said during the hearing. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us.\u201d\n\n\nWray\u2019s initial statement had garnered immense criticism from Asian-American civil rights groups, who wrote a letter demanding a meeting with the FBI chief. The coalition of 14 organizations who signed the note described the Chinese community\u2019s anger at being labeled a threat and warned that \u201cwell-intentioned public policies might nonetheless lead to troubling issues of potential bias, racial profiling, and wrongful prosecution.\u201d\n\n\nBut in speaking with NBC News, Wray only doubled down on his remarks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cBut when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.\u201d\n\n\nHe added that both the Chinese government and Chinese companies have been searching for trade secrets and have targeted U.S. companies across industries to acquire them.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Wray touched on his comments during the interview with NBC, he has yet to respond to the civil rights coalition\u2019s request for a meeting,\u00a0John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice \u2013 AAJC told HuffPost.\u00a0HuffPost reached out to the FBI,\u00a0but the agency has yet to comment on the status of the meeting.\n\n\nYang mentioned that Wray\u2019s rejection of race-based open investigations was a \u201cuseful clarification, but it is inadequate.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince the 1800s, Asians and Asian-Americans have been characterized as inherently disloyal by the U.S. government; that trend continues to this day.\nChristina Sinha, Asian-Americans Advancing Justice - Asian Law Caucus\n\n\nWray\u2019s initial statement suggests that Americans should be concerned about Chinese academics and students, Yang said \u2015 a sentiment he labeled as \u201cinflammatory and offensive.\u201d Given the FBI chief\u2019s concerns, Yang believes Wray should consult Asian-American civil rights groups on how best to conduct investigations of national security threats to ensure the efforts aren\u2019t biased or based on stereotypes.\u00a0\n\n\nStereotypes have reportedly already affected Asians and Asian-Americans in espionage cases. A white paper published by the nonpartisan Chinese-American organization Committee of 100\u00a0in June revealed that Asians\u00a0were more likely to be charged with economic espionage than any other group. They were also found innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals of any other race.\u00a0But when they were convicted, those with Asian-sounding names were given sentences twice as long than those with Western-sounding names.\n\n\nXiaoxing Xi, a Chinese-American professor, sued FBI agents who stormed his house in 2015, rounded up his family at gunpoint and arrested him. Xi was threatened with up to 80 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million. Though the charges were abruptly dropped with little explanation, the professor had already lost his position as the interim chairman of the physics department at Temple University and was put on administrative leave for a period of time.\u00a0\n\n\nHydrologist Sherry Chen, who\u2019s also Chinese-American, was also prosecuted on espionage-related charges. However, just a week before her March 2015 trial, the case collapsed. A slew of other\u00a0scientists\u00a0of Asian descent\u00a0have been wrongfully accused of espionage-related crimes.\n\n\nConsidering racist policies like the\u00a0Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which put an absolute moratorium on Chinese labor immigration, and the forced incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the wrongful accusations against Asian-American academics reflect a disturbing tradition, Christina Sinha,\u00a0who leads the National Security  Civil Rights Program at civil rights organization Asian-Americans Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, previously told HuffPost.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSince the 1800s, Asians and Asian-Americans have been characterized as inherently disloyal by the U.S. government; that trend continues to this day,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cOur government has been stuck in a pattern of repeatedly scapegoating immigrant communities and treating them as threats to our nation\u2019s security.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Bendery", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Oregon Gov.

Justice Max Baer (D), who also voted to strike down the map, but said it could remain in place until 2020, wasn\u2019t mentioned in the impeachment resolutions.\n\n\nThe legislation comes a little more than a month after state Rep. Cris Dush (R)\u00a0urged impeachment of the Democratic justices. The state Supreme Court ruled in January 5-2, along party lines, that congressional districts drawn in 2011 were so lopsided to benefit Republicans that they violated the guarantee of free and equal elections. The court gave lawmakers three weeks to draw a new map with Gov. Tom Wolf (D), but imposed its own plan once they failed to reach an agreement. Two Republican appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court and a federal lawsuit\u00a0have been unsuccessful\u00a0in blocking the new map.\n\n\nDush, who did not immediately return a request for comment, said in February that the state Supreme Court had violated the legislative process.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017\n\n\nTillerson\u2019s days as secretary of state seemed numbered from the start.\u00a0\n\n\nA government outsider lacking diplomatic experience, he\u00a0arrived at Foggy Bottom after decades at Exxon Mobil Corp., rising from engineer in 1975 to chairman and CEO in 2006, overseeing vast expansion of the company\u2019s operations worldwide.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump picked\u00a0Tillerson for the State Department job after a lengthy public vetting of prominent candidates, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\n\nTillerson faced opposition during his Senate confirmation process, with lawmakers expressing concerns over his lack of experience in government and diplomacy, and strong ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin from years of business in the country. \u00a0\n\n\nEven Tillerson himself had been reluctant to accept the position. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this job. I didn\u2019t seek this job,\u201d he admitted to the conservative news outlet Independent Journal Review in March.\n\n\n\u201cMy wife told me I\u2019m supposed to do this,\u201d he responded when an aide asked him why he accepted the position anyway.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce in office, Tillerson sought to reorganize the State Department and prioritize its activities toward business and security. He publicly illustrated the pivot after weeks on the job, opting to skip the presentation\u00a0of the department\u2019s annual human rights report.\n\n\nDuring his tenure, the department faced drastic budget cuts and a crucial leadership vacuum. Amid massive international challenges like North Korea\u2019s nuclear arms race and the war in Syria, Trump proposed cutting the State Department budget by nearly one-third.\u00a0Dozens of vacancies remained unfilled, including top deputies, because of White House refusal to accept Tillerson\u2019s picks.\u00a0\n\n\nTillerson and the White House also clashed on policy and messaging. \u00a0\n\n\nAs a diplomatic crisis in Qatar unfolded, Trump directly undermined Tillerson\u2019s calls for calm,\u00a0expressing support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic and diplomatic blockade of the Gulf state, and accusing Qatar of funding terrorism.\n\n\nIn an August interview, Tillerson declined to defend Trump\u2019s support for \u201cAmerica\u2019s values,\u201d telling Fox News that \u201cthe president speaks for himself.\u201d The questioning arose during a conversation about Trump\u2019s much criticized response to\u00a0violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u00a0earlier that month, when counterprotesters clashed with hate groups protesting the planned removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\n\nFrom the White House, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, often ran a parallel track of diplomacy \u2015 traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories to explore ways to revive peace talks, and interacting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\u00a0\n\n\nSources told CNN in July that Tillerson was becoming increasingly frustrated with the White House. In late August, Axios reported that Trump was losing patience with his secretary of state, in part because key roles at the department still remained unfilled more than eight months into Trump\u2019s presidency. A State Department spokesperson told Axios that Tillerson was working to fill the vacancies but that the White House was effectively sitting on his recommendations.\u00a0\n\n\nNauert had repeatedly insisted\u00a0Tillerson was not considering resignation. Asked if a July vacation indicated Tillerson wanted to step away from the spotlight, Nauert said the secretary was \u201cjust taking a little time off\u201d after that month\u2019s G-20 summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTillerson, like Trump, wasn\u2019t a fan of reporters\u2019 questions, doing away with the State Department\u2019s daily briefing and limiting media access during his foreign travels.\u00a0\n\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t \u201ca big media press-access person,\u201d when he allowed just one journalist \u2015 a reporter from the Independent Journal Review \u2015 to accompany him on a visit to South Korea. The move backfired. American journalists were unable to challenge an embarrassing\u00a0report\u00a0in the Korea Herald that the secretary\u00a0had canceled\u00a0a dinner with South Korean officials because he was fatigued.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTillerson is just the latest to step down in the Trump administration. In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign, after he used taxpayer-funded private jets on numerous occasions.\n\n\nNational security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to step down in February\u00a0 following revelations that he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country\u2019s ambassador before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0\n\n\nOn May 9, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey,\u00a0who had been leading an investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the presidential election.\n\n\nMike Dubke, White House communications director, resigned\u00a0later in May after months of chaos in the press shop. Press secretary Sean Spicer quit\u00a0in July,\u00a0after the president appointed Anthony Scaramucci as the new communications director.

The state House and Senate both passed the measure on Thursday.\n\n\n\u201cWhile Delta\u2019s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,\u201d Bastian wrote. \u201cOur decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale.\u201d\n\n\nThe CEO noted that Delta is also in the process of ending discounts \u201cfor any group of a politically divisive nature.\u201d\n\n\nRead Bastian\u2019s full statement below:\n\n\n\nThis week, you have likely seen Delta in coverage of the national debate over gun control and security in U.S. schools. I want to take the opportunity to update you on how we got here and where we stand.\n\nOn Saturday, Delta rescinded a one-time group travel discount for the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting, and asked the organization to remove our name and logo from their website. This decision followed the NRA\u2019s controversial statements after the recent school shootings in Florida. Our discounted travel benefit for NRA members could be seen as Delta implicitly endorsing the NRA. That is not the case.\n\nI have heard from many of you over the last few days. Our people and our customers have a wide range of views on how to increase safety in our schools and public places, and we are not taking sides. Our objective in removing any implied affiliation with the NRA was to remove Delta from this debate.\n\nWhile Delta\u2019s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course. Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale. We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.\n\nNone of this changes the fact that our home is Atlanta and we are proud and honored to locate our headquarters here. And we are supporters of the 2nd Amendment, just as we embrace the entire Constitution of the United States.\n\nI have tremendous respect and admiration for Governor Nathan Deal, and thank him for the work he has done on the jet fuel tax exemption. He is a great friend to Delta. I know this action by the state legislature troubled him as it does all of us.\n\nI know it is not comfortable to be caught in a highly emotional debate, and many of you have received questions from customers. We are at our best when we bring our customers and our world closer together. Hopefully, our decisions this week will serve this ultimate cause.\n\nI want to thank every one of you for your professionalism and continued focus on taking care of our customers every day.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Reuters", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A military parade requested by President Donald Trump will take place in November on Veterans Day in Washington D.C., but to minimize damage to roads it will not include tanks, a Pentagon memo released on Friday said.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ed Mazza", "body": "CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper wants to know why President Donald Trump keeps giving Russian President Vladimir Putin a free pass.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump to this day has said nastier things publicly about me, Don Lemon, Chuck Todd, Meryl Streep and the cast of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 than he has of former KGB operative and current human rights repressor Vladimir Putin,\u201d Tapper said.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump earlier this week was reportedly given an all-caps note saying \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d\u00a0before a phone call with Putin after the Russian leader won a re-election many dismissed as a sham.\u00a0\n\n\nHe congratulated him anyway.\n\n\nTrump is reportedly angry over that detail leaking out of the West Wing.\u00a0\n\n\nBut Tapper wondered if Trump is missing the big picture.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBy all means, be outraged by the leaking and the inability of a president to fully trust his team,\u201d Tapper said, then added:\n\n\n\n\u201cBut also ask yourself, when it comes to this story\u00a0\u2015 when it comes to Russian behavior and U.S.-Russian relations, and Russian cyberattacks against the American people and the inability of the millions of the Russian people to have free and fair elections, or the attempted murder of a Putin critic on British soil\u00a0\u2015 is the leaking really the most offensive thing going on here?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nSee his full segment in the clip above.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "S.v.

Reilly", "body": "WICHITA, Kan. \u2015 Whenever a white non-Muslim man commits an act of mass violence \u2015 not an infrequent occurrence in recent history \u2015 the online debate begins. Why aren\u2019t authorities calling this terrorism?\n\n\nThe debate broke out once again Wednesday morning after the news broke that the bomber behind a string of deadly attacks in Austin, Texas, was a 23-year-old white Christian male.\n\n\nMedia coverage often grants white non-Muslim perpetrators a level of humanity not typically seen in coverage of other attackers, and \u201cterrorism\u201d can often be used simply as a stand-in for \u201cMuslim.\u201d But it\u2019s more than just politics and privilege that makes authorities \u2015 and in turn, the media \u2015 shy about calling terrorism by its name.\n\n\nThe United States has no federal law criminalizing acts of domestic terrorism. That\u2019s something the FBI Agents Association, an organization that represents more than 14,000 current and former FBI special agents, would like to see changed.\n\n\n\u201cCalling it what it is is something that I believe is important,\u201d Thomas O\u2019Connor, a current FBI agent who has worked on domestic terrorism investigations, said in an interview earlier this year. O\u2019Connor, speaking to HuffPost in his capacity as head of the FBI Agents Association, said that the lack of a federal charge has broad implications for how the American public thinks about the threat of domestic terrorism.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to wrap their heads around someone coming in with an internationally based ideology and committing a crime,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cBut when it\u2019s a domestic terrorist, because there\u2019s no charge, we can\u2019t get our head wrapped around it.\u201d\n\n\nWhile the U.S. code defines domestic terrorism, there\u2019s no broad criminal statute that outlaws such acts. As HuffPost previously explained, the lack of a criminal domestic terrorism statute makes the federal government extremely cautious about using the term \u201cterrorism\u201d when there\u2019s no link to a group the United States has officially designated as an international terrorist organization. In practical terms, that means the government doesn\u2019t call white, non-Muslim terrorists what they are.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not really an excuse in the case of Mark Conditt, the young man behind the Austin attacks. Because Conditt is dead, there\u2019s no future trial to be concerned about.\n\n\nConditt\u2019s precise motive is not entirely clear.\u00a0Austin Police Chief Brian Manley received a lot of backlash Wednesday evening for describing a 25-minute tape Conditt recorded as an \u201coutcry by a very challenged young man\u201d and noting that it \u201cdoes not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate.\u201d Nevertheless, the federal government would have been able to charge Conditt with a terrorism-related crime had he lived: His package bombs would count as weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Connor says that doesn\u2019t make much sense and that the federal government needs to be able to charge domestic terrorists with domestic terrorism regardless of their weapon of choice.\n\n\n\u201cThe weapon itself shouldn\u2019t be the determining factor on when someone is committing an act of domestic terror,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\u00a0\u201cCall it what it is. If you have an incident that takes place, and the person uses a firearm, a car, a knife \u2015 if that crime of force or violence is done to forward a social or political agenda, then that person fits the elements of domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\n\nO\u2019Connor points to the Family Research Council shooting in Washington, D.C., in 2012, when a man shot a security guard because of the organization\u2019s opposition to gay marriage. It was clearly an act of terrorism. But because the terrorist used a gun, there was no federal terrorism-related federal statute under which he could\u2019ve been charged. The only reason he faced a terrorism charge was that the District of Columbia has its own terrorism statute, which federal prosecutors were able to use because they handle criminal cases in the nation\u2019s capital. \n\n\n\nThis week here in Wichita, three white men from rural Kansas are facing trial, accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex occupied by Muslim refugees they considered \u201ccockroaches.\u201d If the defendants did what the government says they did, they\u2019re domestic terrorists. But the only reason they\u2019re facing terrorism-related charges is because their alleged plot involved bombs. Had they decided to go door to door shooting Muslims living in an apartment complex in Garden City, as they are accused of discussing on audiotapes, there would be no basis for a terrorism-related charge and they\u2019d likely be facing only civil rights charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs HuffPost first reported\u00a0last summer, there has been an internal debate at the Justice Department about whether the executive branch should lobby Congress to create an actual criminal statute that would outlaw acts of domestic terrorism. Thomas Brzozowski, the Justice Department\u2019s top authority on domestic terrorism, said in January that the Justice Department was \u201ccontinuing to look at that very closely\u201d and getting input from multiple agencies. O\u2019Connor\u2019s group has been lobbying for such a plan, but the effort hasn\u2019t gained much traction on Capitol Hill.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not only a question of fairness, says O\u2019Connor. It\u2019s also about measuring the extent of the problem of domestic terrorism in the United States. Since there\u2019s no central domestic terrorism charge, the federal government doesn\u2019t keep track of cases that qualify as domestic terrorism.\n\n\n\u201cIf you look up domestic terrorism in general and try to figure out the numbers of domestic terrorism incidents that have taken place in the United States over the past 20 years, you\u2019re never going to come up with an accurate number because people haven\u2019t been charged with domestic terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\n\n\n\u201cIt comes down to transparency,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWhen there is an incident and it\u2019s not called that, then it gets lost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost\u2019s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

It\u2019s illegal to use foreign funds to influence federal elections.\n\n\nThe U.S. Federal Election Commission launched a similar probe to determine if the NRA was acting as a conduit for illegal\u00a0Trump campaign funds, Politico reported.\n\n\nTorshin, who served as the deputy speaker of Russia\u2019s Parliament for more than a decade and was on Russia\u2019s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, reached out to\u00a0members of the Trump campaign\u00a0through the NRA, according to McClatchy.\u00a0He also hosted dinners for NRA executives during their trip to Moscow in 2015.\n\n\nThe NRA spent a record amount on 2016 elections, including $21 million to back Trump and $14 million to attack his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nTorshin helped create the NRA\u2019s Russian equivalent, The Right to Bear Arms, which sponsored the Bolton video. The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations urged the Russian government to change its constitution to allow gun rights similar to those in America.\n\n\nA source close to Bolton told NPR that he was originally asked to record the video by then-NRA President David Keene.\u00a0At the time,\u00a0Bolton was a member of the NRA\u2019s international affairs subcommittee, according to NPR.\n\n\nOn the video, Bolton praises a \u201cnew era of freedom\u201d in Russia on the 20th anniversary of the adoption of its constitution.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWere the Russian national government to grant a broader right to bear arms to its people, it would be creating a partnership with its citizens that would better allow for the protection of mothers, children and families without in any way compromising the integrity of the Russian state,\u201d Bolton says on the video. \u201cThat is my wish and my advice to your great people.\u201d\n\n\nBolton appeared in the video shortly after a Right to Bear Arms conference was held in Moscow.

He promised a wall along the Mexican border so many times over the course of his presidential campaign that failing to deliver would be disastrous \u2015 in the November midterms and then in his presidential re-election campaign.\n\n\nAlthough his base has been patient so far, the thinking goes, that could evaporate instantly if Trump signs the $1.3 trillion spending bill that does not make good on the wall promise. The Senate faces a midnight Friday deadline to pass the bill, which cleared the House on Thursday.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou could key yourself up to lose 50 seats if you fuck around with this thing,\u201d one Republican close to Trump said on the condition of anonymity. \u201cHe ought to shut down the government if he doesn\u2019t get the money to start building the wall,\u201d the Republican added.\n\n\nAt a White House press briefing, Mulvaney assured that Trump would not be doing that. \u201cLet\u2019s cut right to the chase: Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,\u201d he said.\n\n\nMulvaney blamed Senate rules that require 60 votes to move most legislation \u2015 including appropriations bills \u2015 to a final vote. This allows Democrats to extract \u201ctheir pound of flesh\u201d in the spending package, he said.\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t control all of the government,\u201d Mulvaney said, even though Republicans hold the White House and control both chambers of Congress. \u201cWe do not control the Senate, under the current rules. Therefore we have to give the Democrats something.\u201d\n\n\nYet, in this case, Trump was unable to get the wall money he wanted because he was unwilling to give Democrats what he has claimed he also wants: a permanent answer for the undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children, often called the Dreamers.\n\n\nTrump tried to end protection from deportation for nearly 700,000 of those immigrants by rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September. Two courts temporarily have blocked Trump and forced him to reopen the program to current applicants, who can continue to renew their two-year work permits and deportation relief.\n\n\nTrump has nonetheless insisted since he ended DACA that he is the champion of DACA recipients and that it is the Democrats who do not care about them.\n\n\n\u201cDemocrats refused to take care of DACA,\u201d Trump tweeted Friday evening. \u201cWould have been so easy, but they just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Michael Short said Trump offered Democrats three years of wall funding for three years of DACA protections but that Democrats rejected it. Short said the White House was willing to negotiate but Democrats were not.\n\n\n\u201cThe Democrats in the House and the Senate have made it clear they think they\u2019re winning in the courts and they do not want to fix this legislatively,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\n\nBut Democrats point out that they offered to support the full $25 billion to build Trump\u2019s wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers. The White House rejected that offer, said Matt House, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\n\nOutside of the recent spending bill negotiations, Democrats have also proposed a number of bills to protect DACA recipients and other Dreamers, some of them with Republican support. They argue any solution should be permanent \u2015 not renewable permits but a path to citizenship.\n\n\nThe White House worked to sink two of those bipartisan proposals in February while pushing its preferred plan to give a path to citizenship for Dreamers in exchange for wall funding, cuts to legal immigration and changes in asylum policies. That plan received only 39 votes on the Senate floor last month, while one of the bipartisan measures his administration successfully undermined had received 54 votes.\n\n\nThe failure to resolve DACA, however, has left Trump unable to deliver on one of his signature campaign promises.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump promised from the day he began his campaign in June 2015 that he would build a \u201cgreat wall\u201d to end illegal immigration from Mexico.\n\n\n\u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d Trump said in his Trump Tower announcement. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\u201d\n\n\nOver the coming 17 months, Trump promised many hundreds of times that he would build the wall quickly and at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Trump said that his wall would be at least 30 feet tall and extend deep underground to prevent people from tunneling beneath it. At a December 2015 visit to Manassas, Virginia, Trump even went into construction details.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be made of hardened concrete, and it\u2019s going to be made out of rebar. That\u2019s steel,\u201d Trump said to a question from a young boy in the audience. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to set [the rebar] in nice, heavy foundations.\u201d\n\n\nBut having Mexico pay for a wall that country does not at all support has proved unrealistic. A planned meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was recently canceled because Pe\u00f1a Nieto would not back away from his refusal to pay.\n\n\nIn the new \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill, a grand total of 33 miles of the border between Mexico and the United States that is currently unsecured will get fencing, with 25 miles of that going atop new levees along the Rio Grande. A total of 14 miles of modern \u201cwall,\u201d such as the examples Trump recently visited in San Diego, will be built, Mulvaney said, but it will be on the U.S. side of an existing barrier in Southern California. In all, $1.6 billion was appropriated for border security enhancements, of which only $641 million are for the new fencing.\n\n\n\u201cWe want the whole wall funded. You\u2019ve heard the president say he wants $25 billion to finish the wall,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cCongress will not give us that without a DACA fix.\u201d\n\n\nTrump\u2019s base of supporters, though, will not be interested in excuses, his Republican adviser warned, and Trump risks losing them by not following through. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing in there for the wall, it\u2019s not going to fly. The wall is a big deal. The wall is a huge deal,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cNo wall?

Trump\u2019s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGun control advocates say these grants have been \u201ccritical funding sources\u201d for states trying to routinely submit comprehensive records to the national background check database.\n\u201cPresident Trump claims that he wants to build \u2018a safe, strong, and proud America\u2019 but his actions do not live up to his words,\u201d said Robin Lloyd of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep.\u00a0Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011.\n\u201cInstead of strengthening the nation\u2019s background check system to make sure it effectively keeps guns out of dangerous hands, he slashed funding to this critically important system, which will significantly undermine its effectiveness,\u201d Lloyd said.\nThere are\u00a0about 30 million reasons\u00a0why Trump would want to weaken gun safety measures. That\u2019s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.\nThe president\u2019s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump\u2019s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.\nTrump\u2019s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national\u00a0criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.\nMass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country \u2015 and so is Congress\u2019 inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018. Republican leaders in Congress routinely offer \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d\u00a0in response to each shooting but don\u2019t follow up with any policy changes aimed at stemming gun violence.\nAnother mass shooting took place as this article was being written Wednesday.

The so-called Dickey Amendment, named after former Rep.

Instead, the bill clarifies the amendment\u2019s language so that it would no longer prohibit the research into gun violence.\n\n\nIn exchange, Democrats assented to several other modest proposals authored by Republicans that would boost the FBI\u2019s beleaguered background-check system and increase funds to schools in order to improve campus safety.\u00a0Democrats previously argued the budget deal ought to include broader gun control measures like universal background checks.\n\n\nThe government is currently funded through Friday.

Lynch\u2019s recommendation can still be reviewed by a district court judge.\n\n\nFor almost a year, Anglin has been on the lam in an attempt to avoid responsibility for urging his readers to direct a \u201ctroll storm\u201d of abuse at Tanya Gersh,\u00a0a Jewish real estate agent in Whitefish, Montana, who had become embroiled in a feud with the mother of Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist. Gersh and her family ultimately received more than 700 threatening and harassing communications. With the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, she sued Anglin last April for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of \u201cemotional distress\u201d and violating a Montana anti-intimidation law.\n\n\nAnglin went into hiding and evaded process servers trying to give him notice of the litigation. On his website and through his lawyer, Marc Randazza, he threw out feints about his location. First, it was Nigeria. Then Russia, the Philippines, Greece and Cambodia.\u00a0Randazza, who also represents far-right propagandist and smear artist Mike Cernovich, used the misdirection to argue that Anglin had permanently established himself overseas in an undisclosed location and, therefore, existed beyond the reach of the federal courts as a \u201cstateless\u201d person, an unusual legal category that applies to American citizens who live abroad with the intent to remain there indefinitely. For that reason, the lawsuit should be dismissed, Randazza contended.\n\n\nBut he and Anglin offered no real evidence to support this argument. In January, Anglin submitted a sworn declaration that included photos of his passport adorned with tourist visa stamps. He claimed to have worked as a tour guide in Athens without offering any proof. He said he lived in a hotel in Cambodia and bought a motorcycle there. Again, he offered no proof. He stated that he\u2019d left Ohio and the United States in July 2013 \u201cfor the last time,\u201d never to return, despite having admitted on his website to being in his hometown of Columbus as recently as February 2017 for a court hearing in another matter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN MY HUNT FOR ANDREW ANGLIN\n\n\n\n\nLynch on Wednesday found Anglin\u2019s domicile argument unpersuasive and recommended it be denied.\u00a0The judge described Anglin\u2019s declaration as mostly a \u201cseries of subjective statements\u201d\u00a0that were insufficient to demonstrate, for legal purposes, that\u00a0Anglin had set himself up abroad permanently.\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t win em all,\u201d Anglin\u2019s lawyer Randazza tweeted late Tuesday night.\n\n\nThe judge also determined that Gersh had presented ample evidence to establish a legal presence for Anglin in Ohio, where the neo-Nazi is registered to vote and maintains a mailing address. Both of Anglin\u2019s active businesses \u2015 Moonbase Holdings, LLC and Daily Stormer\u00a0\u2014 are registered with the Ohio Secretary of State. He collects money in Ohio.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Anglin\u2019s travels around the globe do not absolve him of responsibility for the harm he caused in the United States,\u201d said David Dinielli, one of Gersh\u2019s attorneys from the SPLC.\n\n\nDinielli added that Gersh\u2019s legal team is seeking to do discovery in the case to \u201dsee if there were additional parties who may have played a role in the planning and implementation of the troll storm against our client\u201d and whether the complaint needs to be amended with the names of other defendants. Gersh\u2019s lawyers want to know, for example, if Richard Spencer had a hand in the harassment.\n\n\nAnglin\u2019s legal predicament should come into better focus on April 3 during a hearing in Missoula on a second argument Anglin put forward in his motion to dismiss Gersh\u2019s suit. That argument asserts that the case should be tossed on First Amendment grounds. Essentially, Anglin is arguing that anything he writes on a website that stops short of \u201cfighting words,\u201d a true threat or incitement \u2015 even when his intent might be to incite an online mob to cyberbully a target \u2015 is protected speech.\n\n\nA serial harasser and slanderer, Anglin has advocated violence against minorities, women, journalists and other groups.\u00a0Last week,\u00a0he bragged on The Daily Stormer about his influence on Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynch\u2019s determination this week is just one of several developments that puts Anglin in an increasingly precarious position,\u00a0both legally and personally.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the past months, Anglin has lost support in the \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacist movement, for which he has served as an important ringleader and its chief propagandist. His writings about beating and caging women revolt even deeply misogynistic members of the white power scene.\n\n\nA keyboard warrior, Anglin has also alienated alt-right extremists who endorse real-world activism. This rift widened after anti-fascists delivered a humiliating beatdown to the\u00a0Traditionalist Worker Party, a prominent neo-Nazi group, in Lansing, Michigan, in early March, prompting Anglin to slam the organizers for being ineffective.\u00a0They fiercely attacked him back, accusing him of being a \u201crace-mixer\u201d who targets young girls for sex and is too cowardly to show his face at far-right rallies.\n\n\nOn Gab, a far-right social media platform popular with racists and fascists, alt-right members tore into Anglin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglin even caught flak on his own website\u2019s forum and had to ban several mouthy dissenters. It was an embarrassing twist of fate for a troll whose sense of self-worth has long depended on how many racist simpletons he can delude.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Anglin\u2019s old foes have only drawn closer. Jeff Cremeans, a process server hired by the SPLC to find Anglin in Columbus, is still on the hunt and told HuffPost that his colleagues around the country have called to offer assistance. \n\n\n\u201cWe all stick together, we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Cremeans said. \u201cWhen they heard about my situation, they said if you ever need help, send us the papers and we\u2019ll get him for you. I\u2019ve got complete backing not just locally but nationally.\u201d\n\n\nWhat might that mean for Anglin?\n\n\n\u201cI think he becomes even more paranoid, if that\u2019s even possible,\u201d Cremeans said.\n\n\nDo you have information on the whereabouts of Anglin?

One small item in that mammoth bill bans federal funds from being spent to support a group called the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN. \n\n\nRepublicans loathed the group. They accused it \u2015 baselessly \u2015 of engineering a campaign of mass voter fraud and thus rigging the 2008 election in favor of then-candidate Barack Obama. Republicans hated ACORN so much that they effectively killed it all the way back in 2009 by blocking federal funding to the organization, which helped poor people register to vote and advocated for social services like affordable housing.

It was the result of deliberate efforts by the Russian government to hurt Clinton and help Donald Trump win the presidency \u2015 efforts that included the targeting of young African-Americans like Bentley\u2019s son.\n\n\n\u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators began to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate,\u201d\u00a0according to a Feb. 16 grand jury indictment obtained by Mueller.\n\n\nIn fact, the day before Obama visited Jacksonville, Florida, to support Clinton, Russians purchased an ad for the Instagram account of a fake group called Blacktivist. It urged African-Americans to vote for a third-party candidate. \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote,\u201d the ad read, according to Mueller\u2019s indictment.\n\n\nIt is impossible to know precisely how many voters nationally stayed home or voted for a third-party candidate because of the Russians\u2019 social media campaign. Nevertheless, the details from the indictment raise new questions about the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no question that it mattered. There\u2019s no question that they thought it mattered.\nDemocratic pollster Mark Mellman\n\n\nWhile Trump maintains there is no proof that the Russian assistance affected the election, the contours of that final month of campaigning and the closeness of the tally suggest that the opposite is true: that it is highly unlikely the Russian efforts did not affect the outcome.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it mattered,\u201d said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that they thought it mattered. There\u2019s no question that the Hillary Clinton folks thought it mattered.\u201d\n\n\nOver the entire final month of the race, Trump essentially centered his campaign on talking about the emails stolen by Russian intelligence and then released through its allied group WikiLeaks. The messages, which were sent to and from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, cast Clinton in a bad light. \u201cWe love WikiLeaks!\u201d Trump would tell his rally crowds and live TV audiences, urging them to go to the website and read the emails for themselves. \u201cBoy, do we love WikiLeaks.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDemocrats and even some Republican consultants said the Trump campaign would not have based its closing strategy on that theme if it were not working.\n\n\n\u201cYou clearly wouldn\u2019t do that if you didn\u2019t think that was effective,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a GOP consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign during the primaries.\n\n\nAlthough Trump lost the popular tally by nearly 3 million votes nationally, he won three states that most observers expected to go to Clinton by a total margin of 77,744. Were the Russian efforts enough to have moved 77,744 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania?\n\n\nClinton supporters argue that when an election is that close, every factor is potentially a game-changer. For example, shifts in polling numbers suggest that former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s letters reopening, and then reclosing, the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state could also have cost her the election \u2015 an argument Clinton herself has made.\n\n\nOne Republican-leaning pollster, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the question is impossible to quantify with any certainty. To move that many votes in those three states, the pollster said, would mean moving about 600,000 votes nationally \u2015 or about half a percentage point. That said, he added that Trump\u2019s success in using WikiLeaks to hammer on about emails and thereby remind voters of Clinton\u2019s biggest vulnerability \u2015 the FBI probe into her emails \u2015 clearly makes that kind of vote shift plausible.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much more open to the notion that it mattered,\u201d he said.\n\n\nExit polling suggests that voters\u2019 concern about Clinton and emails \u2014 and Trump\u2019s pounding on that theme with the help of WikiLeaks in the final weeks \u2014 indeed made a difference.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Michigan, for instance, 60 percent of the electorate was bothered by the email issue, and 75 percent of those voters supported Trump. Relatedly, a quarter of Michigan voters settled on a candidate in the final month. That group broke for Trump 52 to 37 percent, while those who decided earlier voted for Clinton 50 to 47 percent.\n\n\n\nThey engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's indictment against multiple Russians\n\n\nTrump has been deeply sensitive to the appearance that he did not earn the presidency on his own. That\u2019s one of the reasons,\u00a0according to those close to him, why he has repeatedly pushed the false claim that he lost the popular vote because \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants supposedly cast ballots for Clinton. It is also why Trump has resisted admitting that Russians interfered in the election at all, let alone tried to boost his candidacy, sources close to him told HuffPost on condition of anonymity.\n\n\nThe fact of Russian interference in the election and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s preference for Trump was detailed in a Jan. 6, 2017, report released by the U.S. intelligence agencies. That conclusion was reinforced by Mueller\u2019s Feb. 16, 2018, indictment.\n\n\n\u201cThey engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment states.\n\n\nFor over a year, Trump questioned the conclusion of U.S. intelligence, as he continued to play up the possibility that the culprit in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails was someone other than Russia. At various times,\u00a0he suggested it might have been China, a 400-pound guy in his bed or someone from New Jersey.\n\n\nAt last, he appears to have abandoned that argument in the wake of Mueller\u2019s indictment against 13 actual Russians and a Russian government-run group that employs hundreds of internet \u201ctrolls\u201d who create and disseminate propaganda to influence foreign elections. Instead,\u00a0the president turned to claiming that the Russian assistance did not have any effect.\n\n\n\u201cThe results of the election were not impacted,\u201d Trump wrote the afternoon the indictment was released.\n\n\nThe following day, he chided his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, for not making that assertion at a conference in Europe where McMaster acknowledged that it was now \u201cincontrovertible\u201d that Russia had interfered in the election. \u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians,\u201d Trump tweeted\u00a0\u2015 and then proceeded to cite a string of conspiracy theories promoted by Fox News that he believed McMaster also should have mentioned.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t say that what you were doing was effective, but what the Russians were doing wasn\u2019t effective.\nRepublican consultant Rick Tyler\n\n\nSome Trump supporters argue that the value of the ads the Russians bought on Facebook and other social media platforms was a pittance compared to the total amount of money spent on the race, so they couldn\u2019t have mattered at all.

That\u2019s virtually nothing compared to the millions of votes cast in Kansas over the last two decades and the 1.8 million voters currently registered there.\n\n\nKobach likes to call those 129 cases just the \u201ctip of the iceberg.\u201d It\u2019s a remarkably powerful metaphor \u2015 a way to pivot around a seemingly insignificant statistic and instead draw concern from the uncertainty of what we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the kind of thinking he used in 2011 to persuade Kansas lawmakers to pass a law requiring people to bring a document proving their citizenship when they go to register to vote.\n\n\nOver the course of an eight-day trial this month, Kobach had the floor in a Kansas City federal courtroom to show just how deep that iceberg was. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing him over the Secure And Fair Elections Act, or SAFE Act.\u00a0The civil rights group says that it is needlessly restrictive and has impacted 35,000 voters. To uphold the Kansas statute, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told Kobach he had to show that noncitizen voter registration was a widespread issue and that nothing short of Kansas\u2019 proof of citizenship law could stop the problem.\n\n\nAs the trial progressed, it became clear that the case was about much more than the Kansas law and Kobach. It began to revolve around a deeper question: Is the evidence that supports the idea of widespread voter fraud credible at all? For the ACLU, the trial offered a unique chance to get a judge to assess the reliability of experts whose research is used to justify claims about voter fraud across the country; even though several studies and investigations have shown it is not a widespread problem.\n\n\nThe ACLU repeatedly got Kobach\u2019s experts to concede their work was not always subject to peer review and highlighted flaws in their methodology. In doing so, the ACLU sought to deal a more devastating blow to claims about voter fraud, creating a court record anyone can point to in the future to question claims about illegal voting.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU repeatedly got Kobach\u2019s experts to concede their work was not always subject to peer review and highlighted flaws in their methodology.\n\n\nThe most tense moments of the trial came when ACLU cross-examined the experts whose research Kobach relied on to say noncitizen voter registration was a substantial problem. One of those witnesses was Jesse Richman, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, who did an analysis of Kansas voter registration that showed as many as 18,000 noncitizens could be on the rolls in Kansas. Kobach has also relied on Richman\u2019s work to estimate that more than 3 million noncitizens could have voted in the 2016 election, a figure that would be greater than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s margin of victory in the popular vote. President Donald Trump has said he believes he only lost the popular vote because of illegal votes.\n\n\nBut when Richman was on the stand, Dale Ho, the director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project, got him to concede that he did not believe noncitizens voting changed the outcome of the popular vote. It was a significant victory for the ACLU because it provided an unequivocal challenge to the basis of Trump and Kobach\u2019s claims about voter fraud.\n\n\nHo also questioned Richman\u2019s methodology and led him into a trap. When Richman was looking at Kansas voter roll data and DMV records to identify potential noncitizens, one factor he took into account was how \u201cforeign-sounding\u201d a name was. Even though it was just one factor in Richman\u2019s analysis, the ACLU recognized it was a chance to show his analysis was unscientific. Ho asked Richman if he would consider the name Carlos Murguia to be a foreign sounding one. When Richman said he would, Ho informed him that Murguia was a federal judge who sat in the courthouse where the trial was being conducted.\n\n\n\nWhen Richman was looking at Kansas voter roll data and DMV records to identify potential noncitizens, one factor he took into account was how \u201cforeign-sounding\u201d a name was.\n\n\nHo launched a similar attack on the credibility of Hans von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department official and member of Trump\u2019s now-defunct Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Von Spakovsky, another one of Kobach\u2019s witnesses testified that he believed voter fraud to be a problem both in Kansas and nationally. But pressed by Ho, von Spakovsky admitted that his understanding of voter fraud in Kansas was based entirely on a list of around 30 voters that Kobach\u2019s office had provided to him and that he was not familiar with any of the particular circumstances. He was also forced to admit that some of the research on noncitizen voting he had prepared in the case contained incomplete information that could make it look like there were more noncitizens trying to register to vote than there actually were. Most significantly, von Spakovsky conceded he could not name of a single election in which the outcome was swayed by noncitizens.\n\n\nThe concessions from von Spakovsky and Richman produced answers that critics can point to qualify any of their future claims about noncitizen voting, making it more difficult for anyone to rely on their expertise to back up claims.\n\n\nBeyond attacking the credibility of voter fraud experts, the ACLU also sought to show how incidents that look like fraud can often turn out to be mistakes. A key piece of Kobach\u2019s evidence of voter fraud was a spreadsheet his office had filed of 38 incidences of noncitizens \u00a0from 1999 until 2017 in Sedgwick County, Kansas. The ACLU highlighted that in several of those examples, people had checked they wanted to register to vote but not that they were citizens (though they did sign an affirmation indicating they were a citizen). After some people got a notification in the mail that they needed to prove they were citizens, they contacted their election office to cancel their registrations. The ACLU used the stories to break down how incidents that seem like nefarious voter fraud can just be mistakes.\n\n\nNow it\u2019s up to U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, to ultimately decide whether Kobach gave her enough evidence that noncitizen voter registration in Kansas is a substantial problem. But regardless of what Robinson ultimately rules, the ACLU was able to dive under Kobach\u2019s iceberg and show\u00a0there wasn\u2019t\u00a0much underneath.\n\n\nDuring his closing statement in the case, Ho made this clear.\n\n\n\u201cThe iceberg, on close inspection your honor, is more of an ice cube,\u201d\u00a0he said.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sam Levine", "body": "When Thomas Hofeller travelled across the country at the beginning of the decade to talk to lawmakers about the redistricting process,\u00a0he brought a warning: \u201cDon\u2019t get cute.\u201d \n\n\nRepublicans were fresh off a remarkably successful effort to take control of state legislatures so they could control the redistricting process \u2015 a significant victory, because redistricting is only done every 10 years. Hofeller, a veteran Republican redistricting consultant and mapmaker,\u00a0cautioned lawmakers against drawing \u201cstupid irregularities\u201d in boundaries obviously contorted to include voters likely to support them,\u00a0The Atlantic reported.\n\n\nBut in 2011, Republicans were focused on maximizing every possible advantage they could squeeze out of the redistricting project, and saw an opportunity to entrench their control of at least 20 seats in the U.S. House. They took it.\n\n\nRepublicans have since enjoyed considerable advantage from those maps. According to an estimate by the Brennan Center for Justice, Republican gerrymandering accounts for 16 or 17 GOP seats in the current Congress that the party may not otherwise control.\n\n\nBut now, that gerrymandering greed of Republicans is coming back to haunt them.\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January struck down the congressional map state Republicans drew, saying it was so partisan that it violated the state constitution. That same month, a panel of three federal judges struck down North Carolina\u2019s congressional map. In October, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in a Wisconsin case may set a standard for defining unconstitutional gerrymandering on partisan grounds.\u00a0(The court also will consider a case challenging a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland at the end of March.)\n\n\nAs these legal contests settle out, it\u2019s worth looking back on how the GOP got here.\n\n\nThe reckoning Republicans are seeing now is one that could have been avoided, lawyers and redistricting experts say, had the GOP not been so ruthless.\n\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have gerrymandered in the past to their advantage, but Republicans took it to a new level in 2011. In an amicus brief to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, political science professors Keith Gaddie and Bernard Grofman wrote that there was as much as three times more partisan bias in congressional maps this decade than in ones drawn in 2000. Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor at the University of Chicago helping challenge a Wisconsin map, said a \u201cdramatic number\u201d of the worst gerrymanders of the last half-century have occurred since 2010.\n\n\nUntil the courts began stepping in, Republican gerrymandering paid off. From 2012 to 2016, the GOP won 13 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18 congressional seats, even though the party\u2019s candidates only got around half of the vote. In Ohio, the party consistently won 12 of 16 congressional seats, but 50 percent of the statewide vote. In Wisconsin, they won at least\u00a060 of 99 state assembly seats, with about half of the popular vote.\n\n\nAs a lawyer, Stephanopoulos said the clear egregiousness of the Republican redistricting made it easier to show something was amiss. It would have been harder to make a case, he said, if Republicans had only been winning slim majorities.\n\n\n\u201cIn Wisconsin, if Republicans had been winning a narrow majority of the statehouse with roughly a tied election, Democrats would have been upset by that, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have risen to a major constitutional challenge,\u201d Stephanopoulos said.\n\n\nRepublican mapmakers in 2011 may have been emboldened by a 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case in which justices declined to strike down Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional plan on partisan grounds.\u00a0\n\n\nRepublicans could have been cautious. They could have drawn maps that benefitted their party, but at the same time were fairer, compact and contiguous, said Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues. The Constitution gives state lawmakers the broad responsibility of drawing electoral districts, and the GOP maps would have stood up better against judicial scrutiny had lawmakers offered public justification in their legislatures for the boundaries, Wice added.\n\n\n\u201cYou can draw a plan to benefit a party, but do so in a fair way through a more transparent, objective process that follows criteria,\u201d Wice said. \u201cIf politicians weren\u2019t as greedy and secretive, then we wouldn\u2019t be seeing as many challenges to plans for the egregious overreaching in the last round.\u201d\n\n\nIn many cases, Republicans didn\u2019t offer a defensible justification. In North Carolina, a Republican said his party\u2019s lawmakers drew a map that gave Republicans a 10-3 advantage because he didn\u2019t see a way to draw one that was 11-2. In Wisconsin, GOP lawmakers sought to avoid scrutiny by hiring a law firm to draw the maps, hoping the work would be hidden by attorney-client privilege.\n\n\nWithout a public explanation for the redrawn boundaries, it\u2019s easier for those challenging the maps to claim Republicans intended to dilute Democratic votes.\n\n\nMichael Li, redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center, pointed to the GOP-drawn congressional map in Pennsylvania as a good example of a brazen Republican attempt to maximize control. The districts were clearly contorted into odd-looking shapes, and there was no attempt to explain why \u2015 other than partisan advantage.\n\n\n\u201cThe 2011 map in Pennsylvania resulted in such contorted districts, it was hard to explain away as product of neutral decisions, such as about keeping towns or counties together. It just was so nakedly partisan,\u201d Li said in an email. \u201dThat\u2019s not to say a map that was less contorted couldn\u2019t have been challenged if it also produced durable bias in favor of a party. But at least there would be a colorable defense that a court would have to take seriously.\u201d\n\n\nSuch strong evidence also could make it more palatable for courts to wade into political redistricting \u2015 a topic the judiciary had long avoided.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe courts are going to police outlier cases, rather than trying to wade into each and every one,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cThe same principle\u2019s true in any kind of discrimination: The more blatant, the easier it is to establish, and the more likely the courts are to call it out.\u201d\n\n\nEven if the Supreme Court does decide Republicans went too far with gerrymandering, its anticipated ruling in the spring would likely come too late to affect this year\u2019s congressional elections, and wouldn\u2019t have an impact on maps until at least 2020. Even if Republicans lose the ability to gerrymander in the future, their ruthlessness will have helped them for nearly an entire decade.\n\n\nEd Gillespie, the former Republican National Committee chair who oversaw the party\u2019s effort to target state legislatures, envisioned that kind of success. In 2011 talking points, obtained by journalist David Daley, Gillespie thanked donors who had given to the party\u2019s effort to make gains in state legislatures. He said Republicans hadn\u2019t waste a \u201cdrop\u201d of their money on state races, and had made \u201cmaximum impact.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Amanda Terkel", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2015 When John Kelly took over as President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff last July, many in the Washington establishment breathed a sigh of relief.

One article noted his \u201csquare-jawed\u201d features and said he would be \u201can imposing and strait-laced figure.\u201d\n\n\nBut there\u2019s still been plenty of drama over the past eight months.

(President Barack Obama once joked about how his first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, lost a middle finger while working at Arby\u2019s, which \u201crendered him practically mute.\u201d)\u00a0\n\n\nRex Tillerson faced a fair amount of humiliation last week when he learned Trump had fired him by reading the news on Twitter. But Kelly decided to make Tillerson\u2019s week even shittier: He told reporters that he had informed Tillerson he would soon be fired at a time when the secretary of state, who was suffering through a stomach bug, was sitting on the toilet.\n\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that journalists who were in the off-the-record briefing with the White House chief of staff were \u201cstunned\u201d that this mature adult would share such a personal,\u00a0embarrassing detail about a man who had just been ousted so unceremoniously.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe Kelly just thought it was a funny anecdote. He once made a joke about how Trump should use a sword on the press. Ha. Ha.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly also created a significant scandal for Trump when he protected then-White House aide Rob Porter in the face of domestic violence accusations \u2015\u00a0with\u00a0photographic evidence \u2015\u00a0made by his ex-wives. Kelly tried to spin his own involvement, claiming that he and other top White House officials didn\u2019t know about the physical abuse allegations and took immediate action when they found out. But other White House aides disputed his characterization, saying Kelly looked the other way on Porter, another official who was supposed to be one of the grown-ups in the room.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump reportedly blamed not Kelly, but White House communications director Hope Hicks, who was dating Porter at the time. The president believed Hicks put her personal feelings over his best interests.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Kelly, according to a new New York Magazine story, had trouble dealing with Hicks because she was a woman in power.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe was extraordinarily dismissive of her. He would refer to her as \u2018the high-schooler,\u2019 he would joke about\u00a0how she was inexperienced, she was in over her head, she was immature,\u201d a former senior White House said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like a woman that potentially has some position of power over him. He thinks women should be subservient to him. If you look at his relationship with Ivanka or Hope \u2014 women who aren\u2019t subservient to him \u2014 he has problems with those people.\u201d\n\n\nThis description fits perfectly with what Kelly himself has said about women \u2015 that they should be \u201csacred,\u201d like they were in the good old days. In the past, of course,\u00a0there were fewer women in positions of power in places like the government.\n\n\nLast October, Kelly had another run-in with a powerful woman. When Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.)\u00a0revealed the callous comments that Trump had made to the family of a fallen U.S. service member, Kelly publicly criticized her and told reporters about past comments from the congresswoman that made her seem selfish and self-glorifying. Video of Wilson\u2019s remarks revealed that Kelly had completely misrepresented\u00a0them, yet like his boss, he refused to apologize and retract his claims.\n\n\nKelly has also asserted that the Civil War was caused by \u201cthe lack of ability to compromise.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what compromise on the central issue of the war \u2015 slavery \u2015 Kelly would like to have seen.\u00a0\n\n\nHuffPost reached out to a number of former White House chiefs of staff to ask about Kelly and his conduct.\u00a0They all either didn\u2019t respond or didn\u2019t want to comment for this article.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Peck", "body": "It\u2019s tempting to get swept up in the salacious details of President Donald Trump\u2019s (alleged) sexual antics. \n\n\nThe possibility of a sex tape or, God forbid, Trump nudity\u00a0isn\u2019t actually what matters about his (alleged) extramarital affairs with former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and former model Karen McDougal. Those affairs (allegedly) took place over a decade ago, when Trump was simply a reality TV star. Adultery is not a crime; nor is it surprising, given what we know about the president.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is the way Trump and his circle of enablers went about trying to cover up these (alleged) affairs, while Trump himself was seeking the top political office in the country. \n\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer and his allies at the National Enquirer used nondisclosure agreements to silence these women, taking a page from the corporate playbook.\n\n\nNDAs are already far too common in the business world, used to paper over a host of misdeeds, most crucially sexual harassment and discrimination. Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is perhaps the most egregious abuser of NDAs, which allowed him to harass and assault women for decades. \n\n\nTo be clear, Clifford and McDougal both say they had consensual relationships with Trump.\n\n\n\u201cHe always told me he loved me,\u201d McDougal told Anderson Cooper in a nearly hourlong interview Thursday.\u00a0Clifford is set to appear in her own interview with Cooper on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday.\n\n\nBut with Trump, the stakes are even higher. \u201cThe entire country pays the cost of not knowing things about the president,\u201d said David Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who specializes in contracts and psychology. \n\n\nBoth payouts happened when Trump was the Republican nominee for president and are already the subject\u00a0of federal complaints for possibly violating election laws.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is acting like he personally owns this information, as though he can act like a king and take any measures to control the way people talk about him.\nHeidi Kitrosser, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School\n\n\nTrump\u2019s use of these agreements is even more critical now because he is reportedly wielding NDAs in the White House \u2015 an unprecedented act\u00a0\u2015 in an attempt to silence his staffers, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\nMost First Amendment lawyers think those agreements would not be enforceable in court. However, the contracts do serve to intimidate and chill speech about public matters \u2015 essentially how the government runs. Stories about the president, from staffers, are critical to understanding history.\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is acting like he personally owns this information, as though he can act like a king and take any measures to control the way people talk about him,\u201d said Heidi Kitrosser, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re acting with the power of the federal government.\u201d\n\n\nThe public rarely finds out about NDAs. But thanks to lawsuits filed by McDougal and Clifford, their contracts are now publicly available. \n\n\nThe women are both suing to break free of their contracts and talk about Trump; he\u2019s pushing back hard. The White House denies that he ever had an affair with McDougal. Though she\u2019s recently started talking to the media, McDougal said she fears legal repercussions.\n\n\n\u201cThere could be financial ruin,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cDo I feel threatened? Absolutely.\u201d\n\n\nSeparately, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has filed suit against Clifford seeking $20 million because he claims she violated their agreement. Lawyers say Cohen is mainly trying to intimidate Clifford and stop her from talking. Previously, he admitted to paying her $130,000 out of his own pocket, but denies Trump was involved. \u00a0\n\n\nBoth women argue in their suits that there is a public policy interest in their stories \u2015 meaning that because they have information about the president of the United States, Americans have a right to know what happened.\n\n\n\u201cWhen we have a public figure \u2015 the most public figure, the president of the U.S. \u2015 the details are something that the public needs to know,\u201d said Orly Lobel, a labor law professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who\u2019s written extensively about the societal dangers of NDAs.\n\n\nBut there\u2019s little precedent for that argument in court, contract lawyers told HuffPost. None could think of any other instance in which a president was fighting to silence private citizens in this way.\n\n\n\u201cTrump is sui generis in a lot of ways,\u201d Hoffman said, echoing many of the lawyers who spoke with HuffPost, who agreed Trump is in a class all to himself.\n\n\nIf these women win in court, it will likely be because of the way their contracts were negotiated \u2015 particularly Clifford\u2019s, which was written with pseudonyms. Clifford is referred to as Peggy Peterson (PP) and Trump as David Dennison (DD). DD never signed the thing, which is the primary argument Clifford is using to try to invalidate the contract.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird document,\u201d said Greg Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, noting the pseudonyms and a few other factors that are out of the ordinary about the deal. He also said that Cohen\u2019s explanation for the deal \u2015 he paid Clifford $130,000 with his own money and claims that Trump was unaware \u2015 makes no sense. \n\n\n\u201cThe lawyer saying he\u2019s acting on Trump\u2019s behalf but didn\u2019t tell him,\u201d Germain said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he thinks that\u2019s going.\u201d\n\n\nHoffman said the Clifford agreement is the hot topic among contract lawyers at the moment. \n\n\n\u201cYou just never see this stuff,\u201d he said, referring to NDAs. \u201cIt never emerges from the swamp. It was never supposed to be tested in the light of a thousand suns.\u201d\n\n\nMcDougal\u2019s case is perhaps the stronger of the two, lawyers told HuffPost, because according to the suit she was misled into silence.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very straightforward application of longstanding contract principals,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cif you\u2019re lied to in making a contract, then the contract is not valid.\u201d \n\n\nMcDougal\u2019s story may be the more troubling one. She appears to have been manipulated in a manner reminiscent of so many sexual harassment cases. For her silence, she was promised career opportunities. \n\n\nAmerican Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story (her lawyer took nearly half) and assured her she would be able to write fitness columns for two years. AMI also said she would land on the cover of several of the company\u2019s publications, including Star magazine, Radar Online and Men\u2019s Fitness, where she had appeared in 1998. In pushing her to sign the deal, the men at AMI emphasized McDougal\u2019s age, telling her that since she was an \u201colder model,\u201d the deal would be very important, according to the suit.\n\n\nMcDougal was excited about the opportunity, she told Cooper. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want this work?\u201d she said.\n\n\nShe signed the agreement in August 2016, shortly after Trump won the Republican nomination. (Clifford signed her deal about a week before the presidential election.)\n\n\n\u201cThey wanted to squash the story,\u201d McDougal told Cooper \u2015 presumably to protect Trump, she added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to hurt him.\u201d\n\n\nAMI is now saying McDougal can discuss her alleged affair, but says it still owns the life rights to her story.\n\n\n\u201cI almost feel violated in that I didn\u2019t know what was happening behind the scenes. I\u2019m angry,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my life rights back. I want to share my truth. Everyone else is talking about it. I\u2019m standing up for myself.\u201d\n\n\nOf course, these aren\u2019t the quotes that got picked up from McDougal\u2019s CNN interview. Most outlets focused on her claim that Trump tried to pay her for sex and that he compared her with his elder daughter, Ivanka.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Robert Kuttner", "body": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is methodically, brilliantly filling in pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When complete, the puzzle will depict a president who is ripe \u2015 overripe \u2015 for impeachment.\nMueller\u2019s indictment on Friday of Russia\u2019s cyberwarfare against the 2016 election was a tactical and investigative masterstroke. President Donald Trump is now cornered. Mueller\u2019s report makes a total liar out of Trump for his\u00a0repeated claims that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin when Putin says Russia had nothing to do it, that the hacking could have been \u201csome guy in New Jersey.\u201d\nThe indictments do not quite connect the Russian operation to Putin personally, but that\u2019s beside the point. No serious person believes that an operation as sensitive as deliberate disruption of the U.S. election could go forward without Putin\u2019s full knowledge and support in a state as authoritarian as his.\nTrump, having repeatedly denied Russian involvement, has now shifted gears and is insisting that the proper test of wrongdoing is \u201ccollusion.\u201d But this is a straw man.\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly and publicly urged the Russians to come forward with dirt on Hillary Clinton. His top advisers met with Russian operatives to see what they had. That part of Mueller\u2019s investigation is still open.\nWhat we already know is plenty damning. A conspiracy of interest does not have to include an explicit tit-for-tat deal. It can be based on signaling.\nIn this case, Trump and his family relied on massive bailouts of his failing business enterprises from Russian oligarchs close to the Kremlin. When he became a presidential candidate, the Russians treated him as an asset \u2015 a useful idiot, as Stalinists used to put it. And when the campaign finalists turned out to be Trump versus the hard-line Clinton, the Russians sought to destroy her and elect Trump. Trump, meanwhile, became the most pro-Russia president in U.S. history, refusing to breathe a word of criticism of Putin, behaving like the head of a client state. This much of the story is hidden in plain view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details \u2015 of Russian financing of Trump\u2019s businesses, and of more campaign contacts \u2015 are likely to be spelled out in further indictments, almost surely including members of Trump\u2019s family, and in Mueller\u2019s final report, which will look very much like a bill of impeachment.\nWhat\u2019s astonishing \u2015 and devastating \u2015 is that this detailed report on Russian manipulation of a U.S. presidential election had to come from a special counsel. Under a normal administration, evidence of a foreign power meddling in a U.S. election would have prompted a presidential order for a full investigation. Instead, Trump mocked the whole idea and used his influence to block such inquiries by House and Senate panels.\nRather than looking deeply into Russian interference,\u00a0the president appointed a commission on election integrity, headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state best known for voter suppression, based on the premise that massive voter fraud by immigrants and others not qualified to vote had helped Clinton win the national popular vote. This was so preposterous that the commission collapsed of its own weight.\nSo where does Mueller\u2019s latest set of indictments leave us?\u00a0\nFirst, these disclosures end Trump\u2019s intermittent efforts to fire Mueller. If he were to try that now, it would be an open-and-shut case of obstruction of justice. Congressional Republicans would have no choice but to begin the impeachment process.\nSecond, they drive a further wedge between Trump and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. All key Republicans, whatever their marriage of convenience with Trump on other issues, have expressed outrage at the Russian operations and praised Mueller. Trump, by contrast, has only proclaimed his own lack of complicity, and has said nothing about what documented Russian interference means for American democracy, much less vowed to resist it and punish Putin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also see a further wedge between Trump and the entire intelligence community. Last week, on the eve of the Mueller indictments, the leaders of every major intelligence agency, including Trump appointees, testified unanimously before Congress that there was no doubt that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Unlike Trump, they are alarmed that Putin tipped a U.S. election to a pro-Kremlin stooge.\nOne question is the degree to which Mueller\u2019s 37-page indictment relied on materials from those U.S. intelligence agencies, and what else the government has that it isn\u2019t revealing out of concern for disclosing \u201csources and methods.\u201d Mueller\u2019s indictment goes into far more detail than anything else that has been made public.\nTwo other questions remain. First is Mueller\u2019s timing. When will other indictments come? He could wrap things up in a matter of weeks, or the investigation could drag out beyond November\u2019s midterm elections.\nSecond is how the U.S. should punish and deter Russia. The Russian actions to undermine American democracy and tip the election amounted to an act of war. And if those actions were as effective as much reporting and now Mueller\u2019s indictments have suggested they were, it means Trump literally became president in a Russia-sponsored coup d\u2019etat.\nThe U.S. and the Russians surely have the capacity to knock out each other\u2019s vital defense and infrastructure systems that rely on the internet. But unlike the nuclear deterrence of Mutually Assured Destruction, there are no bright lines when it comes to self-restraint in cyberwar. If there were, Russia surely crossed one in 2015 and 2016.\nWhat sort of retaliation makes sense? Mutually assured cyberdestruction would be a catastrophe; that\u2019s why Russia gets away with these incursions. But slaps on the wrist like banning the travel or freezing the bank accounts of a few Russian individuals just makes America look pitiful.\nThis is the serious question America needs to take up, once Trump is gone. Thanks to Mueller\u2019s latest revelations and those still to come, that day may not be far off.\nRobert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a professor at Brandeis University\u2019s Heller School.

Several studies and investigations have shown it is not.\n\n\nThe back-and-forth between the two men in U.S. District Court ostensibly was about Kansas law (von Spakovsky is serving as an expert witness for Kobach). But Ho\u2019s cross-examination had deeper significance in the national debate over voting restrictions because he was able to show that allegations of widespread voter fraud can often be based on incomplete information derived using unscientific methods.\n\n\nVon Spakovsky has said that voter fraud is a serious problem both in Kansas and nationally. Questioned by Kobach in court on Friday, he pointed to a handful of cases in Kansas and hundreds of allegations of noncitizens on the voter rolls that date back to the 1980s.\n\n\nBut Ho noted that von Spakovsky had donated to defendant Kobach\u2019s campaign in 2010 and had voiced support for the idea that being born in the United States doesn\u2019t guarantee U.S. citizenship. Ho intended to show that von Spakovsky had formed an opinion about the Kansas law before he knew much about it and had written an expert report based on unreliable information.\n\n\nVon Spakovsky admitted that he was not aware of a single election in which noncitizen votes determined the outcome. He also conceded that his research into voter fraud had not been subjected to the same kind of rigorous peer review that academic work would face.\n\n\nHo noted that von Spakovsky\u2019s expert report in the case contained incomplete information that allowed him to inflate the likelihood of noncitizens getting on the rolls. In one example, von Spakovsky pointed to a NBC News story that said 100 registered voters had returned jury duty questionnaires indicating they were not U.S. citizens. Von Spakovsky failed to note in his report, however, that NBC followed up with those voters and that about a third actually were citizens.\n\n\nUnder Ho\u2019s questioning, von Spakovsky also admitted that his entire understanding of voter fraud in Kansas was based on a spreadsheet prepared by Kobach\u2019s office of about 30 noncitizens who attempted to get on the voter rolls in one county in the state over the course of 18 years. Pressed if he knew the circumstances behind any of the cases, such as if any of reports were caused by an administrative error or confusion, von Spakovsky said he did not.\n\n\nVon Spakovsky\u2019s testimony is crucial to Kobach\u2019s defense of the Kansas law.\u00a0 Kobach, who was also on the voter fraud commission with von Spakovsky, has to show that noncitizens getting on the voter rolls is a substantial problem and that nothing short of asking people to provide proof of citizenship can prevent it.\n\n\nHo had not spoken much during the trial since the opening arguments on Tuesday, but it was clear he had been waiting for an opportunity to question von Spakovsky. As he questioned him, Ho was icy. His questions were short and rapid, and he often raised his voice as he asked them, while von Spakovsky mostly answered quietly. At one point he turned his back to von Spakovsky. Kobach objected throughout that Ho was harassing the witness, and U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson admonished Ho to dial down his theatrics.\n\n\nRobinson also questioned von Spakovsky\u2019s understanding of voter fraud. In his Friday testimony, von Spakovsky said that any ineligible voter who cast a ballot was committing voter fraud because they were diluting the vote of a legitimate citizen. Robinson wanted to know if he believed it would also be voter fraud if thousands of legitimate voters were blocked from casting ballots because of a voting restriction (the ACLU estimates the Kansas law affected more than 35,000 people). Von Spakovsky said that he didn\u2019t consider it to be fraud because every voter had an opportunity to obtain the necessary documents to register.\n\n\nPressed later by Ho, he was unable to name any voting restriction in the United States that he believed to be a burden to voters.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ryan J.

Just one black individual, the daughter of refugees from Eritrea, made the final panel of 40 potential jurors.

It was just a way of describing a group of people who have \u201coverrun\u201d an area, he said.\n\n\nHe also objected to labeling Trump\u2019s travel ban as a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, that\u2019s just what they put out there,\u201d he said, but he insisted religion wasn\u2019t really the focus of Trump\u2019s effort. He didn\u2019t make the final jury.\n\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi, a Kansas-based prosecutor with a high-and-tight haircut and an affinity for American flag socks, is leading the prosecution of the case alongside two attorneys from the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division based out of the nation\u2019s capital. Mattivi made sure the potential jurors knew he wasn\u2019t an out-of-towner. \u201cMy office is in Topeka, and I live in Topeka with my family,\u201d he told one group.\n\n\nMattivi also told the jurors that it was his job to make sure the trial was fair. He asked whether there was anyone who believed the government had no role in protecting civil rights. He asked if anyone had been bullied before. He asked them about their views on immigration and whether they thought the government should take religion into account when deciding who was admitted to the U.S. He asked what American values meant to them.\n\n\nMany of the potential jurors with the most interesting views didn\u2019t make the cut. The final jury does include a woman who had great concerns about immigration policy, a strong Second Amendment supporter with a Muslim friend, a man with a son-in-law who just immigrated to the United States, another Second Amendment supporter who advocated for gun rights on Facebook but said he\u2019s not a fanatic, and a man who wrote his congressman recently hoping to do something about AR-15s.\n\n\nHuffPost is covering the trial from Wichita this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost\u2019s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

The stance echoed a speech he gave in Congress last Thursday, when he declared that \u201cif someone has decided \u2018I\u2019m going to commit this crime,\u2019 they will find a way to get the gun to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSen.

Date", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign last year spent over a half-million dollars for Trump Tower offices\u00a0\u2015 a choice that put donors\u2019 money into the president\u2019s pocket, but provided workspace for at most a handful of staff.\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to a HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission filings,\u00a0the monthly rent was more than what candidate Trump had been charging from June 2015 to March 2016, back when he was largely self-funding his campaign and when there were, on average, several dozen employees in the midtown Manhattan office.\n\n\nAnd while it is unclear why Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has rented so much room for so few people, its decision to do so has helped fill office space that appears to have become much more difficult to rent out since Trump won the presidency.\n\n\nNeither the campaign nor the Trump Organization would say how many square feet the campaign is currently leasing or what it is paying per square foot. On the commercial market, however, the building has been forced to drop its prices dramatically.\n\n\nTrump Tower had been charging $120 per square foot per year in 2016 \u2013 about 50 percent more than the going rate in midtown Manhattan. Today, the asking price is down to $80 a square foot, according to a New York City real estate broker, and there is plenty of space available, including the entire 14th floor where Trump had his campaign headquarters for the 2016 general election.\n\n\n\u201cHe is really unpopular,\u201d said the broker, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nobody there. It\u2019s like two guys. There is no campaign. There is no operation. It\u2019s just a joke.\nA Republican consultant\n\n\nOne Republican consultant close to the White House who is familiar with the office and its workload laughed when asked about the expense.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody there. It\u2019s like two guys,\u201d the consultant said on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering the leader of his party. \u201cThere is no campaign. There is no operation. It\u2019s just a joke.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to those FEC filings, Trump\u2019s campaign sent paychecks to a total of 21 people over the course of last year. Ten left at the end of January 2017. Two more received their last paycheck in mid-March. Only six collected a paycheck at the end of December, and one of those now has an auto-response email stating that she left the campaign this January.\n\n\nNo one on the campaign staff at year\u2019s end responded to HuffPost emails. The campaign\u2019s phone number provided an email address for media inquiries, but emails sent there were returned as undeliverable. A security guard in the Trump Tower lobby turned away a HuffPost reporter who tried to visit the campaign office on Tuesday. Eventually, a public relations business owner in Northern Virginia replied to a query that had been sent to newly named campaign manager Brad Parscale\u2019s social media and data analytics firm in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n\n\u201cBrad is not currently available for interviews,\u201d wrote Mark Serrano of ProActive Communications. \u201cHe is working with the campaign leadership team to develop plans to engage in the 2018 midterm elections, providing support and endorsements for candidates, and engaging Trump supporters in districts and states throughout the country to support and vote for GOP candidates.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s What You Signed Up For\u2019\n\nTrump opened his re-election campaign account on the day of his inauguration last year, which enabled him to continue using donor money to rent space in his own building. No other presidential victor has kept his campaign alive in this fashion. Barack Obama did not start his re-election campaign until April 2011. George W. Bush did not start his until May of 2003.\n\n\nStuart Stevens, a GOP consultant who worked on the campaign of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, said donors should not be shocked that Trump is spending their money this way. \u201cThis is the least surprising president in history. He\u2019s exactly the same person he was in the campaign,\u201d\u00a0Stevens said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you signed up for.\u201d\n\n\nTrump made a practice of spending donor money at properties that he owned from the time he locked up the GOP nomination in the spring of 2016. The rent on the Trump Tower offices\u00a0nearly quintupled, from $35,458 to $169,758 a month by July 2016, even though the number of campaign staff remained about the same. Trump also spent hundreds of thousands of donated dollars at his hotels and golf clubs, where he hosted fundraisers for himself and the party.\n\n\nThat habit continued into the first year of his presidency. With control of the Republican National Committee\u2019s purse strings, Trump started to personally profit from contributions to that group as well.\n\n\nIn 2017, the RNC spent $232,042 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, $3,000 at Trump\u2019s golf club in Miami and $1,228 at Trump Caf\u00e9 in Trump Tower. The RNC also took over the monthly $37,542 rent payment for the re-election campaign\u2019s space at Trump Tower in mid-autumn, spending a total of $150,169 by the end of the year. In the same period, it began paying the salary for campaign staffer John Pence, nephew to Vice President Mike Pence,\u00a0which amounted to $28,412 by year\u2019s end.\n\n\nThe RNC did not respond to questions about why it took over the latter expenses. The move did coincide with the party\u2019s decision to no longer pay the president\u2019s legal expenses incurred as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia (the timing was\u00a0first noted by CNBC).\n\n\nTrump Likes To Pay Trump\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has been even more generous at his properties in 2017 than the RNC. It spent $473,371 for rent at Trump Tower before that cost was shifted to the party, although about $150,000 of that was likely for the month immediately after his election, when the campaign was occupying more space in the building. The campaign also spent $58,686 at Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, and $14,860 at his hotel in Las Vegas. In all, the Trump campaign spent\u00a0$774,163 in donor money at Trump-branded businesses last year.\n\n\nWhat exactly the campaign has done to work toward Trump\u2019s re-election is less clear. It staged several rallies in states that the president had won in 2016, including one in Melbourne, Florida, not even a month after he took office. It continued to pay Parscale\u2019s firm an average of $474,000 a month.\n\n\nThe GOP consultant who believes there are only a few campaign staffers working at the Trump Tower headquarters said that Parscale was named to his new job last week only because the president hoped to draw attention away from the news that son-in-law Jared Kushner had lost his top-secret security clearance.\n\n\n\u201cThey knew the bad stuff was coming. It was a media spin play,\u201d the consultant said, adding that Parscale would certainly be replaced by someone else following the midterm elections this fall. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. But he doesn\u2019t know anything about politics. He knows about digital marketing.\u201d\n\n\nHuffPost reporter Nina Golgowski contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sebastian Murdock", "body": "Russia flexed its muscles Thursday when it unveiled new \u201cinvincible\u201d nuclear weapons.

Lamb eked out the victory with a narrow 627-vote lead, according to both the New York Times and NBC.\u00a0There are still 500 outstanding provisional, military and absentee ballots to be cast between the four countries in the district, but it appeared unlikely that the election results could change absent further unexpected developments.\n\n\nThe win is a massive upset for Democrats reflecting the heightened enthusiasm of the party\u2019s liberal base and the general dissatisfaction of many voters with the Trump presidency.\n\n\nThe party now has the wind at its back ahead of the midterm elections in November when Democrats hope to wrest control of Congress from the GOP.\n\n\n\u201cThe congressional map for potentially competitive races has just gotten a whole hell of a lot bigger,\u201d said Mike Mikus, a western Pennsylvania-based Democratic consultant. \u201cIf I\u2019m the Republicans, I\u2019m terrified. If I\u2019m the Democrats, I\u2019m very energized looking toward November.\u201d\n\n\nRepublicans have downplayed the broader significance of the race, arguing that it could be explained almost entirely by Saccone\u2019s flaws as a candidate, or more recently, Lamb\u2019s alleged willingness to run a Republican-lite campaign.\n\n\nBut the election results show that the GOP needs to do more to appeal to moderate suburban voters, regardless of who the candidate is, said Mark Harris, a Pittsburgh-based Republican strategist.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to run better campaigns that have messages that are going to resonate with voters regardless of their opinion of the  18th Congressional District opened up in October when eight-term incumbent Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned under pressure. Murphy, who publicly opposed abortion rights, was caught encouraging a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to get an abortion during a pregnancy scare.\n\n\nMurphy enjoyed a virtually unshakable hold on the southwestern Pennsylvania district, running unopposed in the two previous elections. \n\n\nThe district, which was heavily gerrymandered in 2011 to favor Republicans, covers a vast swath of southwestern Pennsylvania. It reaches across four counties and includes the affluent, center-left suburbs of Pittsburgh in the north, the solidly Republican bedroom communities to the east,\u00a0and the increasingly conservative coal towns by the West Virginia border.\n\n\nBut Democrats hoped that in a year marked by liberal fury with Trump, the right candidate could at least be competitive in a special election where turnout was bound to be lower than normal.\n\n\nLamb, 33, a square-jawed Marine veteran who resigned his assistant U.S. attorney post to run for office, fit the bill like a charm. In addition to his military service, Lamb\u2019s devout Catholic faith and more conservative stances on guns, coal and fracking made him the kind of Democrat that blue-collar voters in the district\u2019s union strongholds would at least be open to supporting. \n\n\nSaccone, a 60-year-old state representative, political science professor and former Air Force counterintelligence officer, is a staunch Tea Party conservative famous for sponsoring a bill that would permit public schools to display the motto\u00a0\u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d After beating three Republican competitors for the party nomination at a closed convention in November \u2015 including state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler, a younger and more moderate up-and-comer \u2015 Saccone made clear that his strategy would be to focus almost exclusively on turning out the right-wing GOP base. \u201cI was Trump before Trump was Trump,\u201d he declared.\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s redrawing of the congressional district boundaries in February lowered the immediate stakes of the special election. The 18th District will only exist in its current form until the end of year. Lamb\u2019s hometown of Mt. Lebanon has been moved into the new 17th District, enabling him to subsequently run again in November a place where Trump would have won by just 3 percentage points.\n\n\nBut given the symbolic power that a loss in such red territory would have, the official national GOP organs and aligned super PACs poured over $10.7 million into the district to help Saccone win.\n\n\nInitially, those groups blasted Lamb for his opposition to the Republican tax cuts. \n\n\n\nRepublicans have said the tax issue is gonna be what propels them to victory in November and Lamb showed Democrats how to combat that.\nMike Mikus, Democratic strategist\n\n\nBut Lamb argued in a February debate that he had \u201calways been for middle-class tax cuts,\u201d he simply opposed the GOP legislation because the vast majority of the savings would accrue to the rich and corporations, all while adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt.\n\n\nIn apparent recognition that the tax cut line of attack was not working, Republicans began cycling ads about the issue off of the airwaves by the end of February.\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have said the tax issue is gonna be what propels them to victory in November and Lamb showed Democrats how to combat that,\u201d Mikus said.\n\n\nRepublicans also struggled to pin Lamb as a liberal stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2015 who is unpopular in the district \u2015 despite featuring her in virtually every attack ad against Lamb.\n\n\nLamb neutralized the claim by promising in January that he would not vote for Pelosi as leader.\n\n\n\u201cMy opponent wants you to believe that the biggest issue in this race is Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Lamb said in a 30-second television ad. \u201cIt\u2019s all a big lie.\u201d\n\n\nDistancing himself from Pelosi was one of several ways that Lamb ran as a moderate unafraid to be independent from the national party. When the federal government briefly shut down in January over a dispute about the status of undocumented immigrants, Lamb broke with Senate Democrats to oppose the impasse, insisting that his experience as a Marine would help him build bridges with his Republican colleagues.\n\n\nLamb occasionally faltered in his attempts to balance the priorities of his liberal base and the swing voters he needed to win. Following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Lamb sparked progressive ire with what sounded like Republican talking points. He warned that the \u201cemotions that a lot of us are feeling right now\u201d were not a good reason to adopt new gun restrictions. He favors expanded background checks, but not an assault weapons ban and other more stringent measures.\n\n\nAt the same time, Lamb ran as a pro-union economic progressive, promising to protect Social Security and Medicare, shore up coal miners\u2019 distressed pensions and defend collective bargaining rights. Lamb told the progressive Social Security Works PAC that he supported expanding Social Security and Medicare. And while he stopped short of endorsing single-payer health care, Lamb supports empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.\n\n\nLamb likewise stuck to his support for abortion rights, despite his personal view that life begins at conception and the district\u2019s large Catholic community.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a population that is 93 percent white, Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th is not representative of the country, let alone the districts in which Democrats must generally compete.\n\n\nBut in the larger national debate over Democrats\u2019 best routes to victory, Lamb\u2019s win has a little something to offer multiple sides.\u00a0Like most of the victorious Democratic candidates in recent elections in Virginia and Alabama,\u00a0Lamb\u2019s base of support is in the educated and affluent suburbs, a locus of Democratic activists and moderate Republicans disgusted with Trump. Yet he also won back some of the working-class voters in outlying counties who historically voted for Democrats, but turned out in droves for Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\nIn the latter task, Lamb relied heavily on the region\u2019s mighty labor unions, which claim nearly a quarter of the district\u2019s voters as their members.\n\n\nAlthough former Rep. Murphy had a strong working relationship with unions, backing enough of their priorities to elicit their periodic support, Saccone established himself as a major foe of organized labor while serving in the state capitol. He is a supporter of anti-union\u00a0right-to-work\u00a0laws and had not made clear whether he would join bipartisan legislation to shore up the troubled union mine workers\u2019 pension fund.\n\n\nUnions mobilized their voter education and turnout machine to inform members and retirees that Saccone was not the kind of Republican they should back. In conversations across the district, union members who voted for Trump and Murphy cited appeals from their unions as a reason why they planned to vote for Lamb.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t cut my own throat,\u201d said Dwight Harris, a 40-year-old Republican coal miner who was voting for Lamb out of concern for his pension.\n\n\nRecognizing that a loss for Saccone would reflect poorly on his political coattails, Trump held a packed rally for the Republican candidate at the Pittsburgh airport on Saturday night. In a speech that focused mostly on his own policy priorities, Trump made the case that he needed Saccone to enact his agenda.\n\n\n\u201cI need people who can help me and this guy can really help me,\u201d he said.\n\n\nBut not enough Trump voters saw a vote for Lamb as a betrayal of Trump. Lamb\u2019s lead grew in the final days after enthusiasm for Saccone dropped, according to a Republican official familiar with the polling data.\n\n\nAnd while Saccone fashioned himself as a copy of Trump, he both lacked the president\u2019s bombastic oratory and ideological flexibility on contentious right-wing social causes.\n\n\nAt a Monday rally at a VFW Hall with Donald Trump Jr., Saccone launched into an inflammatory rant against the political left, which he said has a \u201chatred for our country\u201d and a \u201chatred for God.\u201d\n\n\nBut during a Lamb rally at the Greene County fairgrounds on Sunday deep in coal country, Lars Lange, a 64-year-old miner-turned-attorney, thought Lamb was the candidate in the race who most approximated Trump\u2019s political nack for showering attention on economically neglected areas.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming down to these areas where nobody thinks a Democrat is gonna get supporters and he\u2019s getting all these big crowds,\u201d Lange said. \u201cThat he might have taken from Trump\u2019s playbook.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Reuters", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave the green light to two class-action lawsuits filed by residents of Flint, Michigan who are pursuing civil rights claims against local and state officials over lead contamination in the city\u2019s water supply.\n\n\nThe justices left in place a July 2017 ruling by the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that revived the litigation after the lawsuits were thrown out by a lower court.\n\n\nThe high court rejected separate appeals filed by the city of Flint, Genesee County\u2019s drainage commissioner and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality officials.\n\n\nThe 6th Circuit decided that the civil rights claims brought by the plaintiffs under federal law could proceed, ruling they were not precluded by a statute that sets the standards for drinking water, the Safe Drinking Water Act. That law has its own provisions for people to file suit over unsafe water, although they cannot seek monetary damages like those available under civil rights law.\n\n\nFlint, a predominantly black city, switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in a cost-cutting move in April 2014. The polluted river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Lead poisoning stunts children\u2019s cognitive development. No level of exposure is considered safe.\n\n\nThe city switched back to Lake Huron water in October 2015, but lead levels remained above federal standards until early 2017.\n\n\nThe crisis prompted several lawsuits against the city, state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and several individual city and state officials. Two of those suits were the subject of the Supreme Court appeals.\n\n\nIn one, Melissa Mays and several other Flint-based parents sued in November 2015 on behalf of themselves and their children. In the other, Flint residents Beatrice Boler, Edwin Anderson and others sued in January 2016 on behalf of Flint residents and businesses.\n\n\nJulie Hurwitz and Bill Goodman, lawyers representing Mays, praised Monday\u2019s action by the justices, saying in a statement that it \u201csignals that the State of Michigan and all of its cronies are reaching the end of the line in their ongoing efforts to avoid being held accountable.\u201d\n\n\nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality declined comment.

They proceeded to blockade the small, natural gas-rich nation, ostensibly in retaliation for Qatar\u2019s support of islamist movements abroad and cordial relationship with Iran. The blockade remains in effect.\n\n\nTrump surprised many in the diplomatic community by initially backing the Saudis and Emiratis so whole-heartedly.

In addition to Qatari representatives, Kushner met with figures from Turkey, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to the report.\n\n\nThe potentially damaging revelations about Kushner surfaced during an already punishing week for the Trump relative and confidant.

The White House\u2019s decision not to grant him a permanent security clearance likely sprang from intelligence agencies\u2019 concerns that foreign governments have tried to influence him and that he initially failed to report his meetings with officials from those governments.\n\n\nAlso speaking on \u201cThis Week,\u201d former New Jersey Gov.

She\u2019s running for Congress.\n\n\nA single mom based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Haaland isn\u2019t new to politics. She chaired the state\u2019s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2017, and was the Native American vote director for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012. That\u2019s in addition to nearly two decades of volunteering on Democratic campaigns, and a failed bid for lieutenant governor in 2014.\n\n\nBut if she wins her race, it will be her first time in the House and the House\u2019s first time having someone like her. An enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, Haaland would be the first Native American woman to serve in Congress.\n\n\n\u201cCrazy, right?\u201d\u00a0she said during a recent sit-down with HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s 2018.\u201d\n\n\nShe could end up sharing the historic distinction with Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation,\u00a0who is also running for Congress this year.\u00a0Davids, a Democrat, is taking on Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kansas).\n\n\nHaaland said the last thing she could do in Congress is speak on behalf of any tribes. But she does understand what life is like for native people living on reservations or in rural areas, and said they deserve a voice at the table when policy issues are being debated. She noted, for example, that tribes didn\u2019t get to weigh in at all on the GOP\u2019s massive tax reform bill that became law late last year.\u00a0It\u00a0does nothing\u00a0to address economic development disparities affecting Indian Country.\n\n\nShe also knows what it\u2019s like to be poor.\u00a0Haaland\u00a0describes a childhood of used clothes, working at a bakery for $1.95 an hour and later in life being denied food stamps for Thanksgiving. She didn\u2019t go to\u00a0college until she was 28 because she didn\u2019t know she was supposed to go. Neither of her parents, who were both in the military, went to college. Haaland ended up getting a degree in English, and later a law degree.\n\n\nMost members of Congress can\u2019t relate to people who grew up in poverty, she said, and Trump definitely can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re insulated by private schools and money and everything you could ever dream of, it\u2019s hard to put yourself in the position of an everyday American.\u00a0He\u2019s too selfish,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cHe\u2019s never had to struggle.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked how her friends and family in tribal communities are feeling about Trump\u2019s presidency, Haaland laughed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe is not liked,\u201d she finally said.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the president would be unpopular in Indian Country.\u00a0Never mind Trump\u2019s\u00a0plans to shrink national monuments that Native Americans consider sacred land, or his budget\u2019s massive proposed cuts to job training programs that directly help Native Americans. He straight-up insults them frequently.\n\n\nTrump routinely mocks Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d referring to her contested claims of Native American ancestry. He even made the crack at a White House event honoring Native American war heroes. Attendees responded with silence.\u00a0It didn\u2019t help that Trump held the event in front of a portrait of President Andrew Jackson, a man nicknamed \u201cIndian Killer\u201d for being a forceful proponent of Indian removal.\n\n\nTribal communities are \u201cabsolutely\u201d paying attention to slights like this, said Haaland. \u201cAndrew Jackson is the worst Indian hater we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\n\nShe has been going after Trump ever since he became a presidential candidate. As state Democratic Party chairwoman,\u00a0Haaland held multiple press conferences denouncing his rhetoric and wrote a scathing May 2016 op-ed\u00a0about his\u00a0\u201cdisrespectful\u201d use of Pocahontas\u2019 name in his attacks on Warren.\n\n\n\u201cMy point in defending Elizabeth Warren is it\u2019s not up to him. It\u2019s not up to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to decide who is Indian and who is not Indian.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to decide who is Indian and who is not Indian.\nDeb Haaland on Trump\n\n\nHaaland is vying for the seat currently held by Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D), who is running for governor. It\u2019s a safe Democratic seat, but because the incumbent is leaving, Haaland has stiff competition. Six Democrats are competing in the June 5 primary.\n\n\nShe\u2019s doing pretty well financially, having raised roughly\u00a0$385,000\u00a0as of Dec. 31 for her campaign, which is focused largely on clean energy and jobs.\u00a0But one of her opponents, Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, had raised about $505,000 by then. And both Lopez and another candidate, Damon Martinez, had more cash on hand than Haaland.\n\n\nMoney isn\u2019t everything, of course.\u00a0Haaland has endorsements from a dozen members of Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Organization for Women PAC. Nearly four dozen national and state tribes and pueblos are also behind her.\n\n\nShe points to her successes as chairwoman of the state Democratic Party as one thing that sets her apart in the race. On her watch, Democrats increased their seats in the state Senate, won two out of three statewide elections and made New Mexico one of just two states to flip its state House from GOP to Democratic control.\n\n\nBut clearly, it\u2019s her fight for Native American priorities that distinguishes her time in public office. As state party chair,\u00a0she traveled to Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota and joined people protesting the planned construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which threatens the region\u2019s clean water and ancient burial grounds. She also led an effort to divest the state\u2019s party from Wells Fargo over the bank\u2019s investments in the pipeline.\n\n\n\u201cIs there anyone in Congress who went to Standing Rock to stand up for Native folks? No,\u201d\u00a0Haaland said. \u201cI can tell you one thing.

Rick Saccone in Tuesday\u2019s election, although the margin was thin. It was a staggering show of Democratic strength in a deep-red Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by almost 20 points in 2016.\n\n\n\u201cThe young man last night that ran, he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.\u2019 He ran on that basis,\u201d Trump said at a fundraiser in Missouri on Wednesday, according The Atlantic. \u201cHe ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, \u2018Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nLamb, in fact, ran against the GOP-passed tax cut law. And even conservative groups realized that the signature achievement of the Republican Congress wasn\u2019t resonating with voters; they shifted away from that issue as the campaign went on. Saccone, however, tried to sell himself as a politician in the mold of Trump.\n\n\nJust last weekend,\u00a0Trump campaigned outside of Pittsburgh for GOP candidate Rick Saccone, a state senator whose message was built on support of Trump and his policies.\u00a0But what typically would have been an easy GOP victory on Tuesday evening became a narrow race between Saccone and Democratic opponent Conor Lamb that stretched into the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n\nLamb declared victory, leading by only a few hundred votes. By Wednesday evening, he was projected to win as the remaining absentee, provisional and military ballots would not have been enough for Saccone to surpass Lamb.\n\n\nTrump claimed Wednesday that he \u201clifted [Saccone]\u00a07 points up,\u201d although it\u2019s not clear how he came up with that number.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually interesting, because it\u2019s only a congressman for five months,\u201d Trump added, downplaying the results.\u00a0Because of redistricting, the 18th District will exist in its current form only until the end of the year. Lamb\u2019s hometown will be shifted into a new district, an area where Trump would have won by just 3 percentage points.\n\n\nSaccone\u2019s projected loss would add to a string of embarrassing Republican performances in special elections as the 2018 midterm primaries loom. Trump has distanced himself from previous GOP special election losers, including\u00a0Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was upset by Democrat Doug Jones.\n\n\nThe southwestern Pennsylvania congressional district, a traditional GOP bastion that includes the affluent south suburbs of Pittsburgh and rural towns in former coal country, became vacant late last year, when former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) resigned after pressuring a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion.\n\n\nRepublicans had invested vast time and energy trying to prevent a close race against Lamb, who gained support in part by distancing himself from national Democrats and staking out more conservative positions.\n\n\nIn addition to Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and two of Trump\u2019s children, Donald Trump Jr. and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, had visited the area in recent weeks to drum up support for Saccone.\n\n\nBy Tuesday night, as a closer-than-expected race appeared likely, Republicans were already coming up with various reasons to blame Saccone and downplay the results,\u00a0with one GOP strategist complaining about the candidate\u2019s facial hair.\n\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Raj Shah suggested to reporters Wednesday that Trump should take credit for helping Saccone \u2015 a message similar to what the president said at the fundraiser later that night.\n\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s engagement in the race turned what was a deficit for the Republican candidate to what is essentially a tie,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\n\nBut Saccone was widely predicted to win the traditionally GOP district.\n\n\nShah also claimed that Lamb won because he\u00a0\u201creally embraced the president\u2019s policies and his vision.\u201d\n\n\nUnder Pennsylvania law,\u00a0this congressional election does not automatically trigger a recount.

It\u2019s not too far from what some U.S. political consultants are doing themselves.\n\n\nTake Sally Albright, a\u00a0Democratic Party communications consultant who backed presidential candidate\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016. Unsurprisingly, Albright is vocally opposed to President\u00a0Donald Trump and a big supporter of the resistance to his administration. She is also one of the loudest, most divisive voices attacking Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton\u2019s onetime Democratic primary opponent, and his left-wing supporters.\n\n\nWell after the primary, Albright continues to claim that Sanders is a fraud, a liar, racist and corrupt, among many other things. In one instance she declared that the policy idea of free college, as promoted by Sanders, was racist. This provoked Sanders supporters to argue back.\n\n\nTrevor, a Sanders supporter who declined to provide his last name for fear of being doxxed, but goes by @likingonline on Twitter, noticed a strange pattern of behavior when Albright responded to him. Her tweets addressing him were rapidly retweeted by the same series of accounts. This created a barrage of notifications making it look as though there was an avalanche of opposition to everything he said.\n\n\nBut as Trevor discovered, after an extensive amount of research that he posted online, these were not normal accounts. They appeared to be bots \u2015 automated accounts masked as real people being used to amplify a particular political message. Who is really pulling the strings, however, remains a mystery.\n\n\nAlbright told HuffPost that the accounts were voluntarily handed over by their original users to an unnamed client of hers to be automated in \u201can analytics program.\u201d She said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement and could not disclose who was collecting and automating these accounts or for what purpose.\n\n\nBut like her, these accounts were all pro-Clinton, anti-Trump and anti-Sanders.\n\n\nDoes \"free college\" specifically benefit women and minorities? Does it benefit anyone who isn't already going to college and just doesn't want to pay? Reinforcing the status quo is racist.\n\u2014 Sally Albright (@SallyAlbright) January 17, 2018\n\n\n\nTwitter allows users to automate their accounts, including\u00a0setting up automatic retweeting and liking of other accounts. This increases activity on the platform, something Twitter obviously wants to do, and allows busy users to promote messages or businesses that they support. Presumably Twitter did not anticipate that users would simply hand their accounts over to another person or campaign to artificially spread the latter\u2019s tweets.\n\n\nThe ability to swamp a debate with automated messages is a problem for political discourse around the world. Twitter is a vital platform for political debate. Automating Twitter accounts to retweet or otherwise promote specific messages thus becomes a tactic to silence political debate and squelch free speech.\n\n\nIn Mexico, allies of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have\u00a0deployed swarms of Twitter bots\u00a0to overwhelm and effectively shut down online debates. Journalists in the U.S. experienced a similar flood during the 2016 election from pro-Trump, neo-Nazi sock-puppet accounts posting anti-Semitic death threats. Often instead of suppressing speech it doesn\u2019t like, the Chinese government these days\u00a0drowns it\u00a0on local social media platforms with a flood of pro-government content. University of North Carolina scholar Zeynep Tufecki has labeled this tactic\u00a0a new form of censorship.\n\n\nWhat the automated accounts deployed by Albright\u2019s unnamed client did was similar.\n\n\nOver the course of the last year or so, Albright was their favorite account to retweet\u00a0\u2015 almost always as a group. The fake accounts also retweeted people who responded to Albright\u2019s tweets \u2015 again, usually as a group, and often while in a debate with other users.\n\n\nThe writers at Shareblue, a pro-Democratic Party news site that supported Clinton in the primary and general elections, were also frequently retweeted by the network of fake accounts, particularly when the Shareblue folks had something negative to say about Sanders.\u00a0A spokeswoman for Shareblue told HuffPost that the company does not create sock-puppet accounts and has never worked with Albright.\n\n\nThese accounts also liked #resistance celebrities like liberal conspiracy theorist Eric Garland (\u201cTime for some game theory\u201d) and Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. And they were often deployed in intra-Democratic Party battles.\n\n\nWhen Albright led a Twitter campaign to attack a 2017 women\u2019s conference for inviting Sanders to speak \u2015 after Clinton, Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) and Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0(D-N.Y.) had turned them down \u2015 the automated account network deployed to retweet her and any positive responses to her tweets.\n\n\nAlbright probably didn\u2019t need those retweets, as there were actual people opposing the conference\u2019s decision. Still, someone questioned her campaign to block Sanders from speaking,\u00a0describing it as similar to \u201cRussian division strategy.\u201d\u00a0She wrote back, \u201cNyet. I am not Russian.\u201d\n\n\nThen over a dozen fake accounts retweeted her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this pro-Albright Twitter force, many of the accounts have taken on false personas with stolen photographs \u2015 just like the Russian trolls that tried to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\n\nThe account named for Iris Winter, which is temporarily suspended, uses a picture of Spanish ice dancer Sara Hurtado. Minnie Casera\u2019s supposed picture comes from the Facebook account of\u00a0Martina Painter, an Alaskan who died on Jan. 11, 2017. The picture used by Georgia Miles is actually\u00a0Deja Farrior-Quinones, a New Jersey woman who was killed in September 2016 by a car involved in a high-speed police chase. Maggie Campell\u2019s picture is one of\u00a0Deb Solsrud, a Florida woman who died in a plane crash in December 2016. Madeleine Ware\u2019s photo is really Mary Knowlton, a retired librarian who was\u00a0killed in August 2016 by a police officer in a practice drill.\n\n\nAllison Rowe\u2019s account uses the picture of Dr. Roberta Guilizzoni, an Italian physicist who works at the National Physical Laboratory in London. Baylee Allmon\u2019s picture is actually the Bosnian model Nejla Hadzic. The account of\u00a0Callie Calloway\u00a0uses a picture of\u00a0Kelsey Lundy, a lobbyist in Arizona for Compass Strategies. Cameron Gibson\u00a0offers an image of the freelance travel writer Sarah Gordon that appeared in the Daily Mail.\u00a0Francie McCormack has taken her picture from the Twitter account of\u00a0Callie Maries. The photo of Lena Robinson\u00a0is actually Ashlynn Sparks, an Alabama teenager who was shot to death in 2016.\n\n\nThe account of Gwen Barstow is temporarily restricted, probably because it used an image of Meaghan Delcourt, an Ottawa woman who was\u00a0in the local news in 2015 after her apartment balcony collapsed underneath her.\n\n\nCheryl Montgomery\u2019s account @cherry_mgm was suspended in February after Catherine Simpson, a public relations professional in Vancouver, Canada, alerted Twitter that it was using her picture.\u00a0The theft of Simpson\u2019s photo to create this fake account was previously reported by the Canadian\u00a0Global News.\u00a0\n\n\nAlbright admitted to HuffPost that she had handed over a number of accounts to that unnamed client that had been connected to previous projects of hers and that were no longer in use.\u00a0She also said that she changed the pictures for some of them.\n\n\nOne of the Albright-linked  to have a picture of an actual person named Kirby Manning. But the Manning photo has been taken from someone else and appropriated for this account. The real person is\u00a0Brinkley Hutchings, a leadership coach and environmental activist in Alabama.\n\n\nOther accounts that Albright said she provided to her client\u2019s project included @PropagandaMnstr, @DruidCityMedia, @VotrProtection, @BucksPocket, @Sallying and @SocialCapitol. Each of these accounts was connected to a website domain that had been purchased by Albright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accounts that link directly to websites owned by Albright and those pretending to be people they are not exhibit similar patterns of behavior. They retweet Albright and other accounts with similar messages at an extremely high rate. Each account has made tens of thousands of tweets, almost all of which are retweets.\u00a0And they all almost exclusively\u00a0post using an application called Buffer.\n\n\nBuffer, a social media management application with more than 2 million users, allows an individual to schedule tweets, retweets and likes; to schedule posts on other social media sites; and to control multiple accounts at once. It provides a limited free service for ordinary users and more extensive paid services for businesses and social media professionals.\n\n\nIn March 2017, Albright\u00a0tweeted a complaint at Buffer about a problem she was having with a recent update. In one tweet in that conversation,\u00a0she posted a screenshot of her Buffer account. That screenshot showed a number of profile pictures from Twitter accounts under her control through Buffer.\n\n\nAmong the pictures were those of @PropagandaMnstr, @CapWaterfront and @BucksPocket, all accounts known to be linked to her. There were also profile pictures for accounts that Trevor had listed in his original expos\u00e9 of potentially fake accounts, including @FactoryofTruth, @_Stacey_Eff, @FordColvin, @GatsbyGirl, @PoliticalSavvy, @WTHisBill and @__SallyForth.\n\n\nAlbright told HuffPost that this screenshot was \u201creally old\u201d and that she no longer had access to the Buffer account controlling those accounts.\n\n\nWhile it is still not known what organization was actually behind these automated accounts, most of them ceased operations after they were spotted by Trevor.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Albright, who said she is no longer connected to the unknown project, concedes that this kind of automation may be problematic.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see it as the same thing as the Russian accounts, but I guess since you\u2019re calling me about it, I guess that means that it\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t think that it was \u2015 if that makes sense,\u201d Albright said. \u201cPeople seem

Turner, who was a freshman at Stanford University when he was accused of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster on campus in 2015.\nTurner faced up to 14 years in prison, but Persky sentenced him to six months in a county jail and three years of probation.\u00a0He was released after just three months and was also required to register as a sex offender.\nTurner filed an appeal to his sexual assault conviction in December.\nThe California Commission on Judicial Performance conducted an inquiry into possible misconduct by Persky following Turner\u2019s trial and said it found no \u201cclear and convincing evidence of bias.\u201d\nPersky has defended his action in the case. \u201cCalifornia law requires every judge to consider rehabilitation and probation for first-time offenders,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not always popular, but it\u2019s the law, and I took an oath to follow it without regard to public opinion or any personal opinions I might have as a former prosecutor.\u201d\nBut many advocates were outraged over what they felt to be an overly lenient verdict granted to Turner, in part based on his privilege as a white male and a star athlete.\n\u201cThis historic campaign is part of a national social movement to end impunity for athletes and other privileged perpetrators of sexual assault and violence against women,\u201d Dauber said.\nIn a\u00a0devastating statement\u00a0read out loud by the victim in court and published online on media outlets, the 23-year-old woman, referred to\u00a0\u201cEmily Doe\u201d in news

\u201cHow much did you drink?\u201d\nOpponents of the recall effort, however, say Turner received a fair trial and that letting voters decide Persky\u2019s fate would undermine the judicial

There\u2019s not much political support within the Republican Party, and certainly not within the NRA.\n\n\nThe Fox News host suggested the president was pandering to the NRA instead of keeping his promise to students of Parkland, Florida, who survived a deadly mass shooting at their high school last month.\n\n\n\u201cThe president told the kids at Parkland, \u2018I\u2019ll go strong on this, I\u2019ll work on this age thing,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Smith said. \u201cHe came up to the general public and said to the Congress, \u2018Oh, the NRA has a lot of pressure on you, has a lot of affect on you, but not on me so much.\u2019 And then he met with the NRA.\u201d\n\n\nCheck out Smith\u2019s response in the video above.", "link": null, "source": "Huffington Post US", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Amanda Terkel", "body": "ELIZABETH TOWNSHIP, Pa. \u2015 A special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District was still too close to call Tuesday night, although the fact that it was this close at all was bad news for Republicans.\u00a0It was a district that Donald Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016, and the GOP should have easily held on to it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to some Republicans, the fact that they were on the verge of losing wasn\u2019t because their messaging was weak or the president had created an incredible backlash effect. And it certainly didn\u2019t mean that Democrats were going to dominate at the polls in November.\n\n\nAll it means, at least according to these strategists, is that their candidate running in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District sucked. State Rep. Rick Saccone was horrible, and it\u2019s his fault the GOP was embarrassed nationally.\n\n\n\u201cHe came across as establishment. And I think that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former aide to Trump\u2019s campaign, in a CNN interview Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Statehouse. He very much sounds like he\u2019s already part of Washington. You flip on the TV there ... and a lot of it looks really cookie-cutter, like, we\u2019re Washington, and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d\n\n\nBut other Republicans thought he could have used a bit more polish. \n\n\n\u201cThis may not be nice to say: The fact is that the Saccone campaign was a joke. If we had a candidate who could walk and chew gum at the same time, we would have [easily] won the race,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, in a statement. \n\n\nAn anonymous Pennsylvania GOP strategist told The Washington Examiner they had a very specific complaint about Saccone: His moustache was disgusting.\n\n\n\u2033It\u2019s a porn stache,\u201d the strategist said. \u00a0\n\n\nSaccone was overwhelmingly favored to win the race. The district was so solidly Republican that Democrats didn\u2019t even field a congressional candidate here in 2014 and 2016. GOP groups dumped nearly $11 million into the campaign on advertising and media messaging \u2015 an astounding amount for a district that will not exist due to redistricting next year.\n\n\nBut instead, Democrat Conor Lamb gained momentum. The 33-year-old political novice left his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh to run in the special election, and he significantly outpaced Saccone in fundraising throughout the race \u2015 another mark against the GOP candidate.\n\n\n\u201cWhen candidates don\u2019t raise as much in hard dollars, it\u2019s very difficult to run these things from afar,\u201d Mike DeVanney, a Pittsburgh-based Republican political consultant told HuffPost. \n\n\n\u201cCandidates and campaigns matter, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a race,\u201d said a national Republican operative active in the race who asked not to be named. \u201cYou have one candidate that\u2019s out of central casting, Conor Lamb, and then you have a candidate on the Republican side who, it was expected, would be lackluster in fundraising.\u201d\n\n\nMany of Saccone\u2019s supporters who came to his election party in the Youghiogheny Country Club on Tuesday night were close friends from Elizabeth Township. Saccone grew up there and now lives there with his family.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of them said they were frustrated that the national Republican Party chose to spend almost all of its resources on negative ads rather than ads highlighting the character traits of the humble and generous man they say they know from their neighborhood. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI feel like when the national party got involved and they put out the advertising and everything, it doesn\u2019t focus on Rick. Rick is freaking amazing,\u201d said Lesa DeMaio, 52, who runs a tutoring business in town. \n\n\nShar Tibbitt, 56, Saccone\u2019s office manager at the state House, provided a similar assessment. She teared up recounting the moment she told Saccone that she had undergone a double mastectomy to remove breast cancer. Saccone broke down crying and then prayed with her. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know Rep. Saccone doesn\u2019t like to do attack ads. I wish [the national groups] would have promoted Rick more and stopped attacking the opponent,\u201d Tibbitt said. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhen these same Saccone partisans were asked what they then made of Republican operatives blaming Saccone and his campaign for the close nature of the race, they were very frustrated. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. I don\u2019t understand how they can blame him. They\u2019re the ones who made the ads,\u201d Tibbitt said.\n\n\nBut Bryer Cochenour, an 18-year-old student at Westminster College who cast the first vote of his life for Saccone, was not particularly ruffled by GOP criticism of Saccone. He saw it as the typical behavior of political operatives in both parties trying to pass the buck.\n\n\n\u201cThey threw Hillary under the bus,\u201d he said of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cAnyone who sees that a race might be close or might not be in their favor, they throw them under the bus.\u201d\n\n\nTrump made a last-minute campaign appearance for Saccone, although he spent very little time actually talking about the race itself. The president has reportedly trashed Saccone in private, considering him a \u201dweak\u2033 candidate.\n\n\nBut there was far more going on than just whether or not Saccone was a strong candidate. Nationwide, Democrats have dominated at the ballot box since Trump took office, flipping 39 state legislative seats from red to blue \u2015 along with the governor\u2019s mansion in New Jersey and a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Republicans, meanwhile, have taken over just four state legislative seats previously held by Democrats.\u00a0\n\n\nA number of voters who backed Trump but decided to support Lamb said they did so not because Saccone was an unpolished or incompetent candidate but simply because they didn\u2019t like his policy views on issues like labor rights \u2015 a major factor in this union-heavy district. \n\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 marquee legislative achievement just didn\u2019t play well here either. The GOP intended to make passage of the tax cut law the centerpiece of its strategy in the 2018 midterms. But Republican groups stopped airing ads mentioning tax cuts toward the end of the Pennsylvania race after realizing the issue wasn\u2019t moving voters. \n\n\nAnd, of course, there was that much-mentioned energy that has been fueling the Democratic side and grassroots groups in the age of Trump. Stunned by losses in 2016, the left has mobilized in a way that even Republicans acknowledge could portend a blue wave in November. \n\n\nAlthough Trump likes to boast that his supporters will never desert him, results like the Pennsylvania special election show that his appeal is limited. At least some members of his base have no problem rejecting Republican candidates \u2015 even ones he supports.\n\n\nAmanda Terkel and Igor Bobic reported from Washington.
