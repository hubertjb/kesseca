[{"author": "Lorie Johnson", "body": "The state of Kansas is standing firm on its refusal to give Medicaid money to America's biggest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn fact, Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer is taking the matter to the highest court in the country. Colyer, a Catholic and a surgeon, maintains a vigorous pro-life stance.\n\n\"A Kansas Court issued a ruling which argues the framers of the Kansas Constitution imagined abortion as a separate constitutional right. This is violence against basic facts. This cannot stand. We are a pro-life state. On the issue of life, the stakes are so high, the issue is so foundational,\" he said in a February speech.\n\nThe state of Kansas filed a petition Thursday asking the US Supreme Court to review a lower court's decision that prevented Kansas from ending its Medicaid contract with Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe issue dates back to 2016 when then-Gov. Sam Brownback stripped Planned Parenthood of its Medicaid funding. \u00a0Medicaid is taxpayer money used to pay for medical services provided to people who are needy or disabled.\n\nTwo Planned Parenthood affiliates in Kansas had been receiving up to $50,000 from Medicaid. Although Planned Parenthood provides abortions, they contend Medicaid dollars are used to pay for health care services such as birth control and cancer screenings.\n\nCBN News contacted Planned Parenthood for a comment. Earlier, they said the state had no right to take away their Medicaid funding because they say patients who are eligible for Medicaid have the right to choose for themselves their medical providers and the state is not allowed to deprive the patients the services provided by Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe 10th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Last month they ruled that Kansas lacked the authority to block dollars from going to a medical provider \"for any reason they see fit, especially when that reason is unrelated to the provider's competence and the quality of the health care it provides.\"\n\nHowever, Gov. Colyer fired back saying, \"Kansas is a Pro-Life state and Kansans don't want state dollars being used to support abortion providers.\"\n\n\"The medical needs of Kansas women will continue to be met by other providers in the Medicaid and KanCare network. We want the Supreme Court to weigh in on this issue and we look forward to the outcome,\" he said.\n\nInterestingly, the newest Supreme Court Justice, conservative-leaning Neil Gorsuch, was a judge on the 10th Circuit when this case was originally argued before that court.\n\nFor that reason, Gorsuch may have to recuse himself from further proceedings regarding this case. That leaves eight justices on the high court to decide whether to hear the matter. Those eight appear to be evenly split on the issue of abortion. Five are needed to agree to consider the Kansas case.", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Ben.gill", "body": "The new US Embassy in Jerusalem will open much earlier than some had predicted.\n\nThe Trump administration is working to make the move by May 2018 in celebration of Israel's 70th anniversary.\n\nSpeaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Friday, President Trump said, \"We officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\"\n\n\"Every president campaigned on, 'We're gonna move the embassy,' then they never pulled it off,\" he continued. \"It's the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe State Department notified Congress on Friday that the Jerusalem embassy will open in May.

His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and three federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n \u00a0\n\n \"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards - including those regarding the use of medical drugs - equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\n \u00a0\n\n The new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are.

The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Earlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\n \u00a0\n\n The issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Under guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\n \u00a0\n\n The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass.

He opposed sweeping new gun regulations and supported Trump's steel tariffs, but he is a fierce critic of Republicans' tax cuts and their economic and health care policies.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Saccone, 60, adhered to Republican orthodoxy and openly embraced Trump, who tweeted many times on his behalf and campaigned in person twice, including a raucous rally the Saturday before voters cast ballots.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Outside Republican groups spent more than $10 million - about seven times as much as outside groups spent for Lamb - with much of it attacking Lamb as a stooge for national Democrats, particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Lamb, however, distanced himself from Pelosi and held national Democrats at arm's length while he easily outraised Saccone in campaign cash.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The state of Texas recently passed a law that allows them to use volunteers as security guards.\n\nThe law went into effect in September, a little more than two months before the Sutherland Springs tragedy. Texas State Representative Matt Rinaldi, R-District 115, sponsored the law.\n\n\"It's tragic that churches that are supposed to be our sanctuaries are now so dangerous we need to have security teams sometimes armed,\" Rinaldi told CBN News. \"But it's important we do; it's important we defend them.\"\n\n\"Churches are increasingly targets now in today's culture, unfortunately,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem with Texas law was that we actually passed an occupational licensing law prohibiting churches from doing security functions unless they paid somebody who is licensed to do it,\" he said.\n\n\"It was senseless, and I think a lot of churches in the state of Texas were actually violating the law unknowingly,\" Rinaldi continued.\n\nThe new law repeals that requirement, and Rinaldi believes it could be allowed across the country unless a state has passed a law banning church volunteers from serving as security.\n\n\"If you have a small church, especially that can't afford private security, you should be able to defend yourself,\" he said.\n\nRinaldi tells CBN News that, in addition to using volunteers as security, the law allows churches to set up active shooter plans, patrol their campuses and train concealed handgun license holders. The Texas lawmaker adds the law does not require training for these volunteers.\n\n\"But it's smart to do so,\" he said. \"Actually, what this law allows the churches to do is to coordinate training for these individuals where it was previously prohibited.\"\n\n\"So we're allowing them to be trained by passing this law, which is very important,\" he continued.\n\nNot Everyone on Board\n\nBut not everyone believes Rinaldi's law is the best way to fortify a church.

There's no level of skill required. My understanding, the way the law is written now, anyone can be that,\" he continued.\n\nNews reports sparked controversy, pointing out that the law did not require church volunteers to undergo the licensing, training and background checks required of \u00a0professional security officers.\n\n\"But the reality is most people who have a concealed carry license in the state of Texas have never shot their weapon, certainly in a defensive mode,\" Wingfield said. \"So they have no experience on that.\"\n\n\"That's very different than having an off-duty police officer or someone who's ex-military or ex-police or someone with some other level of training,\" he continued.\n\n'Some is Better than None'\n\nWingfield helps pastor a large church with professional security guards. He tells CBN News that some volunteers also provide some security and admits there is some good to the new law.\n\n\"I think in some cases it would work, and I'm not going to say it would never work,\" he said. \"I would hope that all churches would be discerning about how they do that.\"\n\n\"There are some people who are very wise and experienced gun owners and users, and there are some people who are novices,\" he added.\n\nRinaldi says some is better than none.\n\n\"I would say it's better to have individuals providing security than not, especially in an armed situation,\" he said. \"It didn't change the laws on who can enter a church with a handgun; what it did was change the law on how the church can train these individuals so they could do it more safely.\"\n\nThe state lawmaker now advises congregations to take that next step.\n\n\"The law's in place; I would encourage churches to take note of it and to come up with a plan on how to deal with these situations,\" he said. \"Sutherland Springs was a tragedy; we're still healing as a state; we'll be healing for some time now.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Associated Press", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) - The office of special counsel Robert Mueller says a grand jury has charged 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities.\n\n \u00a0\n\n The defendants are accused of violating U.S. criminal laws to interfere with American elections and the political process.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Charges include conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Crystal Woodall", "body": "In a blow to Republicans, the US Supreme Court has refused to take up the party's challenge to block a newly drawn map they say is more favorable to Democrats.\n\nLikewise, on the same day, federal courts dismissed a lawsuit by GOP congressmen to challenge the new map.\n\nIt's a double blow that increases the Democratic Party's chances of retaking control of the US House of Representatives in this fall's midterm elections.\n\n\"I'm sure we'll review options, but I think we're accepting the decision,\" the Philadelphia Inquirer quoted state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R-Centre), one of the lawmakers who brought the US District Court challenge. \"(We) don't like it, but that's life and we move on.\"\n\nBack in 2011, Republicans drew up a gerrymandered map that gave them a 13-5 edge in the state's congressional delegation for the three elections in which it was used.\n\nBut Monday's rulings now give the Democrats the upper hand.

This effectively makes Mr. Kudlow the nation's chief economist.\n\nIt would be hard for Trump to have made a better choice. Kudlow, who has graced these pages with his commentaries over the years, was a Reagan-era White House appointee who worked on the Reagan budgets and his Economic Recovery and Tax Act - the tax bill that rebuilt the American economy and inspired the just-recently passed Trump tax cut.\n\nHe later became one of the most respected economists on Wall Street before joining up as a host of CNBC's Kudlow and Company TV show.\n\nMr. Kudlow, who served as a senior economic advisor to candidate Trump, helped design the Trump tax cut and then market it to Republicans on Capitol Hill. \u200e Kudlow is a good salesman: he helped Trump corral every Republican in the Senate to vote for it.\n\nThe economy is now soaring - as the latest jobs report of some 350,000 new jobs (including upward revisions), and a record 155 million Americans employed - confirms. The Trump deregulation agenda has also pulled the government monkey off the back of businesses, which helps explain the investment and hiring boom and the complaints of an \"overheating economy.\"\n\nWhere Trump has fallen short is in relating this good news to average voters and linking it to Trump's pro-growth policies. A president with a booming economy and nearly the lowest unemployment since the Beatles were still playing together, should have an approval rating well above 40 percent. He doesn't in no small part because the message of Trump's accomplishments hasn't always gotten through the media filter of negativity.\n\nKudlow's all too rare gift is explaining jobs, the economy and the stock market in ways that don't make one's eyes glaze over.\u00a0 \u200e\"If you tax something,\" he likes to say and write, \"you get less of it. If you tax something less, you get more of it.\n\nHe makes the dismal science, not so dismal.\n\nMeanwhile, the expert Ph.D. economists from Harvard and Yale, who said that the Obama years garnered $830 billion are too busy counting the number of angels dancing at the tip of a pin to make economics sensible.\n\nKudlow must take on the role of White House salesman for the president's mostly sound economic ideas. \u200eWe hope that he can also steer Trump away from his darker instincts on Tariffs and trade protectionism.

He also has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix the American immigration system so that it is aimed at attracting maximum talents and skills to help grow the economy.\n\nTo get that agenda passed, the White House's new economist in chief will have to help persuade members of Congress, the business community, and voters that the Kudlow creed is as true today as ever: \"the best path to prosperity is free market capitalism.\"\u200e\n\nStephen Moore is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation.", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Mark Martin", "body": "American pastor Andrew Brunson has been locked up in a Turkish prison for 500 days.

Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. \u00a0African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history,\" the president said.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \"Small business confidence is at an all-time high. \u00a0The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. \u00a0That is great news for Americans' 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts,\" he continued.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \"And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history,\" the president said.\n\nIn going over his list of accomplishments, Trump pointed out to the audience that the core of Obamacare is now through.\n\n\"We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone,\" the president said.\n\nTalking about the success of American businesses, Trump spoke about what he called \" The New American Moment.\"\n\n\"This is our new American moment. \u00a0There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream,\" he said. \"So to every citizen watching at home tonight -- no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. \u00a0If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.\"\n\nThe 45th President of the United States also brought up American patriotism.\n\n\"We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag,\" he said. \"Together, we are rediscovering the American way.\"\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \"In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. \u00a0Our motto is \"in God we trust,\" he said.\n\nThe president also introduced 12-year-old Preston Sharp, who has now placed 40,000 flags on veterans graves.\n\n\"Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. \u00a0Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem,\" he said.\n\nTrump also spoke on the continuing need to honor America's military veterans.\n\n\"I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey,\" he said.\n\nThe president said he has ended the war on American energy and the war on clean coal and has helped the car makers in Detroit to rev their engines once again.\n\n\"Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we have not seen for decades,\" he explained. \"Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.\n\n\"Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. \u00a0This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing -- for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. \u00a0But now they are coming back,\" Trump continued.\n\nThe president said one of his priorities for the year is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.\n\n\"n many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. \u00a0That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. \u00a0Prices will come down,\" he promised.\n\nTrump also announced to the chamber that the era of economic surrender is over.\n\n\"From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal,\" he said. \"We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.\"\n\n\"And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules,\" the president added.\n\nTrump also said it's time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\"America is a nation of builders. \u00a0We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year -- is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\" he asked. \"I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\"\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \"Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need,\" the president said. \"We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. \u00a0And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.\"\n\nThe president also mentioned the need for workforce development and job training. \u00a0The need for vocation schools so future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.\n\n\"And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave,\" he said to a round of applause from the chamber.\n\nThe president also introduced Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens, whose two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were brutally murdered by six members of the savage gang MS-13.\n\n\"Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: \u00a0Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. \u00a0Everyone in America is grieving for you. \u00a0And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. \u00a0We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain,\" the president said.\n\n\"Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country,\" he said. \"We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents so that this cannot ever happen again.\"\n\nThe president also made it a point to reach across the aisle to work with him to defend all Americans.\n\n\"I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. \u00a0My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. \u00a0Because Americans are dreamers too,\" he noted.\n\nOn immigration reform, the president touched on four points of his plan.\n\n\"The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. \u00a0Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the president, the second pillar of the plan fully secures the border.\n\n\"That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. \u00a0Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country -- and it finally ends the dangerous practice of \"catch and release,\" he explained.\n\n\"The third pillar ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. \u00a0It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration,\" he listed. \u00a0\"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. \u00a0Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. \u00a0This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\"\n\nTrump said it is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally, bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\n\n\"These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system,\" he said.\n\n\"Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. \u00a0So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done,\" \u00a0the president continued.\n\nTrump pointed out that in 2016, 64,000 Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses, roughly 174 deaths per day.\n\n\"We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\" he said.\n\nThe president then introduced Ryan Holets, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department, who along with his wife adopted a baby whose parents suffered from opioid addiction.\n\nOn the subject of defense, Trump asked Congress to fully fund the military.\n\n\"As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression,\" he said.\n\nThe president also gave an update on the war against ISIS.\n\n\"Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. \u00a0One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. \u00a0But there is much more work to be done. \u00a0We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president also introduced Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck, who saved the life of Kenton Stacy while the pair were on a mission to clear buildings in Raqqa last November. \u00a0Trump noted the sergeant was wearing his new Bronze Star with a \"V\" for valor.\n\nTrump also said he was keeping another promise to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\n\n\"Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. \u00a0Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans,\" the president said.\n\nThe president also mentioned his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this recognition. \u00a0American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year,\" he said. \u00a0\"That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interest and only go to America's friends.\"\n\nTrump also took a moment to address the people of Iran.\n\n\"When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. \u00a0America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom,\" he said.\n\nOn the subject of North Korea, the president said his administration a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent the country's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles that could threaten our homeland.\n\nTrump told the story of Otto Warmbier and how he was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. \u00a0After a trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June -- horribly injured and on the verge of death. \u00a0He passed away just days after his return.\n\nThe president then introduced Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier and pledged to honor Otto's memory with American resolve.\n\nThe president also took a moment to Mr. Ji Seong-ho. \u00a0Seong-ho lost his legs to a train after passing out on its tracks while trying to steal food. He traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.\n\n\"Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom,\" he said.\n\nTrump concluded his address by recognizing the heroes that live among us.\n\n\"They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines,\" he said. \"But above all else, they are Americans. \u00a0And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.\"\n\nThe president also reminded his audience of the American dream.\n\n\"Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. \u00a0And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: \u00a0The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. \u00a0And it is the people who are making America great again,\" he said.\u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \"As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. Our families will thrive,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free,\" he said. \"Thank you and God Bless America.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Tzippe Barrow", "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 More than a decade after Israeli pilots destroyed a Korean-built nuclear reactor in Syria, Israel declassified top secret documents Wednesday detailing the operation.\n\nAfter failing to convince former US President George Bush and his administration of the danger posed by the Syrian nuclear plant, Israel decided to act on its own.\n\nShortly before midnight on September 5, 2007, the Israel Air Force deployed eight jet fighters to take out the reactor.\n\nThe mission was successful, the facility destroyed and the pilots returned safely to their base.\n\nDr. Ronen Bergman, author of \"Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations,\" told journalists in a conference call organized by The Israel Project that despite their close relationship, Mossad chief Meir Dagan was unable to convince his US counterpart, CIA chief Michael Hayden, to strike the nuclear facility.\n\nDagan was convinced that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not retaliate \u2013 as long as he wasn't publicly humiliated. The CIA argued he would call for all-out war.\n\nDagan's assessment proved right and the CIA's wrong.\n\nBergman explained that Israeli Intelligence officials convinced then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni that if Israel did not take responsibility for the strike or publicize it \u2013 a move that would have humiliated Assad before his Middle Eastern counterparts and forced him to react, he would not. That proved to be true.\n\nAsked why Israel finally decided to lift the gag order on the operation, Bergman cited two main reasons.\n\nFirst because most of the details were already known outside of Israel there was no longer any need to keep it secret.\n\nSecond declassifying the information would send an important message: \"That when Israel is left alone, it reacts, and with extreme force.\"\n\nBergman agrees there are similarities between what happened then and Iran's attempts today to embed its forces in Syria.\n\nIn 2007, Israel asked the US to fulfill its commitment to Israel's security by striking the reactor. Today, Israel is asking the US to exercise its leverage on Russia to convince Iran to back off in Syria. Israel sees an Iranian presence in Syria as its main strategic threat today.\n\nAccording to Bergman, Israeli officials are \"extremely frustrated\" by the Trump administration's lack of engagement. He says for all intents and purposes, \"the US has evacuated the Middle East.\"\n\nBut the bottom line, Bergman stressed, is that Israel will always do what it has to do.\n\n\"The message is that when Israel is left alone, it would react and as it reacted and used force 11 years ago and destroyed the North Korean facility in Syria, it would do so again today and destroy any Iranian attempt to further deploy military forces, guerilla forces [and] Hezbollah forces in Syria.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Cbn News", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Speaking before an audience in Ohio, President Donald Trump touted the benefits of his recently-passed tax overhaul, noting that Americans' taxes \"are going way down\" while US \"factories are coming back.\"\n\n\"At the center of America's resurgence are the massive tax cuts.

This is not a path to citizenship.\u00a0 It's not a permanent fix,\u201d President Obama said in 2012.\n\nWhen President Trump rescinded DACA last fall, that protection became uncertain.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t they done the work to change their status?\n\nAccording to Immigration Attorney and Consultant Jose Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, obtaining that legal status is a lot more difficult than people realize.\n\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, generally, there is no line for undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States to get in to in order to apply for a green card,\u201d said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado.\n\nEvery undocumented immigrant has a different story - how they got here, who they know in the US and when they found out they were here illegally.\n\nAnd Salgado says that backstory can make individual cases tricky.\n\nSo what are the options?\n\nUndocumented immigrants can have a family member sponsor their green card.\n\nThat\u00a0sponsor has to be US citizen and be a member of their immediate family\u00a0or a spouse.\n\nBut even that has a few obstacles.\n\n\u201cThe problem is in many cases, because of the nuance of our immigration laws, oftentimes an individual can have someone that can sponsor them,\u201d said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, but he added that even in this situation, US laws can put up other barriers.\n\n\u201cConcepts such as the three and ten year bars\u00a0which make it so that someone has to leave the country and prohibits them from coming back for ten years,\u201d\u00a0he explained.\n\nIn other words,\u00a0even if someone in the US\u00a0illegally does get a sponsor, he or she\u00a0must return to their\u00a0home country to apply for a green card. But that creates a problem itself, because\u00a0in most cases it triggers an automatic ban from returning to the US for a certain period of time- often three or ten years.\n\nBut if an\u00a0individual doesn\u2019t have a spouse or family member who is also a citizen in the first place, that\u2019s a dead end anyway.\n\nEmployers\u00a0may feel their employee is worth the investment and sponsor legal status but it\u2019s a costly and complicated process.\n\nAn advance parole is a permit that lets non-citizens re-enter the US after traveling internationally.\n\nAccording to Factcheck.org with advance parole, an illegal immigrant can leave the US for humanitarian work or for employment purposes.

Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain will consider next steps in the coming days alongside its allies.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry ordered the 23 diplomats to leave within a week. It also said in a statement that it is ordering the closure of the British Council, a government-backed organization for cultural and scientific cooperation, and that it is ending an agreement to reopen the British consulate in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe announcement followed on the heels of Britain\u2019s order this week for 23 Russian diplomats to leave the U.K. because Russia was not cooperating in the case of the Skripals, both found March 4 poisoned by a nerve agent that British officials say was developed in Russia. The Skripals remain in critical condition.\n\nBritain\u2019s foreign secretary accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of personally ordering the poisoning of the Skripals. Putin\u2019s spokesman denounced the claim.\n\nThe Russian statement said the government could take further measures if Britain takes any more \u201cunfriendly\u201d moves toward Russia. British Ambassador Laurie Bristow was called to the Foreign Ministry Saturday to be informed of the moves.\n\n\u201cWe will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves, our allies and our values against an attack of this sort, which is an attack not only on the United Kingdom, but upon the international rules-based system on which all countries, including Russia, depend for their safety and security,\u201d Bristow told reporters after being informed of the expulsions.\n\n\u201cThis crisis has arisen as a result of an appalling attack in the United Kingdom, the attempted murder of two people, using a chemical weapon developed in Russia and not declared by Russia at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as Russia was and is obliged to do under the Chemical Weapons Convention,\u201d he added.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Saturday denied that Russia or the Soviet Union had ever developed the nerve agent Novichok that Britain said was used to poison the Skripals.\n\nA Russian scientist disclosed details of the secret program in the 1990s, and later published the formula for Novichok. But Russia maintains it has never made them.\n\nSpeaking on Russia-24 television, Zakharova said Britain\u2019s angry reaction is connected to the war in Syria. She said Britain is taking a tough line because of frustration at recent advances of Russian-backed Syrian government forces against Western-backed rebels.\n\nRussia argues that it has turned the tide of the international fight against Islamic State extremists by lending military backing to Syria\u2019s government.

The organization has been operating in Russia ever since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that when political or diplomatic relations become difficult, cultural relations and educational opportunities are vital to maintain on-going dialogue between people and institutions,\u201d it said.\n\nBritish police appealed Saturday for witnesses who can help investigators reconstruct the Skripals\u2019 movements in the crucial hours before they were found unconscious.\n\nWestern powers see the attack as the latest sign of alleged Russian meddling abroad.

British police said Friday that he died from compression to the neck and opened a murder investigation.\n\nRussia also suspects foul play in Glushkov\u2019s death and opened its own inquiry Friday.\n\nBritish police said there is no apparent link between the attack on Glushkov and the poisoning of the Skripals, but both have raised alarm in the West at a time when Russia is increasingly assertive on the global stage and facing investigations over alleged interference in the Donald Trump\u2019s election as U.S. president.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Supporters of the measures, deemed \u201cred flag laws\u201d or gun violence restraining orders, say they can save lives by stopping some shootings and suicides.\n\nFlorida, where Cruz is accused of using an AR-15 rifle to kill 17 people at his former high school, does not have such a law. He was able to legally own the semi-automatic rifle even though his mother, classmates, and teachers had at times described him as dangerous and threatening.\n\nRed flag legislation was introduced last fall in Florida by Democratic lawmakers, but its fate is uncertain in a state Legislature controlled by Republicans who generally favor expanding gun rights. After Wednesday\u2019s shooting at a high school in Parkland, a suburb north of Miami, Republican Gov. Rick Scott said he will work to make sure people with mental illnesses don\u2019t have access to guns but offered no specifics.\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state to let family members ask a judge to remove firearms from a relative who appears to pose a threat. It was passed after a mentally ill man, Elliot Rodger, killed six University of California, Santa Barbara, students and wounded 13 other people near the campus before killing himself.\n\nThe law also allows police to petition for the protective orders, which can require firearms to be removed for up to one year. Connecticut, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington are the other states with some version of a red flag law.\n\nMore than a dozen others, including Hawaii, New Jersey, and Missouri, are considering bills that would allow family members or police to petition the courts if they want weapons taken from an individual showing signs of mental distress or violence.\n\nThe Florida shooting also has revived the debate about whether teachers and school administrators should have that authority as well, given that people at Cruz\u2019s high school witnessed much of his erratic behavior.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers voted to expand their law in 2016 so that high school and college personnel, co-workers and mental health professionals can seek the restraining orders, but Gov. Jerry Brown called the effort premature and vetoed it.\n\nState Assemblyman Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat, said he plans to reintroduce the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that when people see signs, they have every ability to do something about getting guns out of the hands of mentally ill and dangerous people,\u201d Ting told The Associated Press.\n\nCircumstances similar to those in Florida played out seven years ago in the shooting of an Arizona congresswoman. Jared Loughner had become increasingly disruptive and erratic at his community college in the months leading up to the shooting, frightening students and causing teachers to request campus police officers be on hand during his classes. Eventually, the school threatened him with suspension.\n\nSoon after, he went to a gun store and legally bought the weapon he used in the attack outside a grocery store where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was meeting constituents. Loughner shot Giffords in the head and killed six people.\n\nIn the absence of red flag laws, the main recourse available to family members is to have their troubled loved one committed to a psychiatric institution. Federal law permanently bans anyone who has been involuntarily committed from owning guns, but such actions are more difficult to carry out than red flag laws, which are intended to be quick and temporary and have a lower standard of proof.\n\nWithout a commitment, formal adjudication of serious mental illness or a felony conviction, many people can pass background checks and possess guns they already own.\n\nThe red flag laws act as a sort of timeout so someone in psychological distress can get counseling while their fitness to possess a gun is evaluated, said Laura Cutilletta, legal director of the Giffords Law Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to allow for temporary removal of firearms in a situation just like this: where somebody has made threats, where they have been expelled from school because of those threats, they\u2019re in counseling, and parents or the school or whoever it is understood that this person poses a threat,\u201d she said.\n\nMany gun-rights activists oppose the laws. They say they can be used to unfairly take away rights from people who have not been convicted of crimes or professionally evaluated for mental illness.\n\nThe National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm has said such laws allow courts to remove Second Amendment rights \u201cbased on third-party allegations and evidentiary standards\u201d that are lower than what\u2019s required in criminal proceedings.\n\nConnecticut led the way with a 1999 law, passed after an employee shot and killed four executives at the state Lottery headquarters. It allows police to remove guns based on probable cause that a person poses a \u201crisk of imminent personal injury.\u201d\n\nIn a study published last year, researchers at Duke, Yale, Connecticut, and Virginia estimated that dozens of suicides have been prevented by the law, roughly one for every 10 gun seizures carried out. They said such laws \u201ccould significantly mitigate the risk\u201d posed by the small number of legal gun owners who might suddenly pose a significant danger.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I just want fairness.\"\n\nThe president indicated Canada and Mexico's treatment would be connected to the ongoing NAFTA talks, which are expected to resume in early April.\n\nThe process of announcing the penalties has been the subject of an intense debate and chaotic exchanges within the White House, pitting hard-liners against free trade advocates such as outgoing economic adviser Gary Cohn aiming to add more flexibility for U.S. trading partners.\n\nThe fight over tariffs comes amid intense turmoil in the West Wing, which has seen waves of departures and negative news stories that have left Trump increasingly isolated in the Oval Office, according to two senior officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

According to international estimates, one third of Syria's housing has been destroyed.\n\nInstead of sitting down with organizers of the demonstrations to resolve the issues, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad responded by killing, imprisoning and torturing anyone connected with the protests, irrespective of their age.\n\nDemonstrations in Syria followed similar events in Egypt and Tunisia. Tunisian President Abidine Ben Ali fled the country in January 2011. In Egypt, thousands of protesters rallied against Hosni Mubarak, eventually forcing him to step down, face trial and imprisonment.\n\nSocial uprisings spread to Oman, Yemen, Jordan, Libya and Morocco. In Libya, demonstrations against Muammar Gaddafi also turned into a civil war. In Jordan, King Abdullah II managed to calm the situation by meeting with protesters and responding to their issues.\n\nWhile the Arab Spring saw the overthrow of several regimes, the results rarely turned dictatorships into democracies.\n\nFor seven years, Assad has managed to hang on to power \u2013 with the help of the Hezbollah terror organization in neighboring Lebanon, which sent thousands of fighters to undergird the regime's military. And Assad can count on Russia and China to veto UN Security Council resolutions against his regime.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin visibly entered the fray in 2015, though years before he worked a deal to establish a naval base at Syria's Black Sea port of Tartus.

Lamb, who struck a moderate tone during the race and was backed by the district's influential labor unions, beat Saccone, a state lawmaker who had compiled one of the most conservative voting records in the state Legislature.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Lamb also benefited from what Pittsburgh-area Democrats called the party's most energized electorate they had ever seen, driven by an anti-Trump fervor.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n On Twitter, Lamb said he had just gotten off the phone with Saccone and congratulated him \"for a close, hard-fought race.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Republicans considered seeking a recount request or a lawsuit to contest the result, even as vote-counting over the past week continued to pad Lamb's lead.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n The seat became open in October when eight-term Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned amid a sex scandal.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Locally, the outcome has a short-term effect.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n The district is dissolving under a court-ordered redraw of Pennsylvania's 18 congressional districts, leaving Lamb to seek the nomination to challenge three-term Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in a newly drawn district west of Pittsburgh that is considered a toss-up. Saccone is running in a new, more Republican district in Pennsylvania's southwest corner that retains much of the territory he and Lamb campaigned in for the last four months.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Nationally, Lamb's win highlights the Democratic potential and Republican vulnerabilities ahead of the fall campaign with the GOP trying to defend its majorities in Congress. Democrats are now 23 seats shy of the majority - though it effectively stays at 24 because Lamb is pursuing Rothfus' seat.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n In the race, Lamb downplayed opposition to Trump, who remains more popular in the district than nationally. He opposed sweeping new gun regulations and supported Trump's steel tariffs, but he is a fierce critic of Republicans' tax cuts and their economic and health care policies.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Saccone, 60, adhered to Republican orthodoxy and openly embraced Trump, who tweeted many times on his behalf and campaigned in person twice, including a raucous rally the Saturday before voters cast ballots.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\n\n Outside Republican groups spent more than $10 million - about seven times as much as outside groups spent for Lamb - with much of it attacking Lamb as a stooge for national Democrats, particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Lamb, however, distanced himself from Pelosi and held national Democrats at arm's length while he easily outraised Saccone in campaign cash.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

These are fine people. These are all fine people,\" one church member overcome by emotion told CBN News.\n\nThen there's the September shooting last year near Nashville, Tennessee, where a gunman took the life of one person and injured more than half a dozen.\n\nEven more recently, a mass shooting took place at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In November, a gunman walked among the pews, killing 26 people ranging in age from 18 months to 77-years-old.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n The Texas-based church security organization known as \"Sheepdog Seminars\" reports a record number of 114 violent deaths happened on faith-based property nationwide in 2017 alone.\n\nSo how should churches protect themselves? The state of Texas recently passed a law that allows them to use volunteers as security guards.\n\nThe law went into effect in September, a little more than two months before the Sutherland Springs tragedy. Texas State Representative Matt Rinaldi, R-District 115, sponsored the law.\n\n\"It's tragic that churches that are supposed to be our sanctuaries are now so dangerous we need to have security teams sometimes armed,\" Rinaldi told CBN News. \"But it's important we do; it's important we defend them.\"\n\n\"Churches are increasingly targets now in today's culture, unfortunately,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem with Texas law was that we actually passed an occupational licensing law prohibiting churches from doing security functions unless they paid somebody who is licensed to do it,\" he said.\n\n\"It was senseless, and I think a lot of churches in the state of Texas were actually violating the law unknowingly,\" Rinaldi continued.\n\nThe new law repeals that requirement, and Rinaldi believes it could be allowed across the country unless a state has passed a law banning church volunteers from serving as security.\n\n\"If you have a small church, especially that can't afford private security, you should be able to defend yourself,\" he said.\n\nRinaldi tells CBN News that, in addition to using volunteers as security, the law allows churches to set up active shooter plans, patrol their campuses and train concealed handgun license holders. The Texas lawmaker adds the law does not require training for these volunteers.\n\n\"But it's smart to do so,\" he said. \"Actually, what this law allows the churches to do is to coordinate training for these individuals where it was previously prohibited.\"\n\n\"So we're allowing them to be trained by passing this law, which is very important,\" he continued.\n\nNot Everyone on Board\n\nBut not everyone believes Rinaldi's law is the best way to fortify a church. The associate pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas has reservations about the new legislation.\n\n\"Maybe there are some churches that are better equipped to have access to trained lay security than other places,\" Mark Wingfield told CBN News. \"And that would be a different factor.\"\n\n\"But there's no training required. There's no level of skill required. My understanding, the way the law is written now, anyone can be that,\" he continued.\n\nNews reports sparked controversy, pointing out that the law did not require church volunteers to undergo the licensing, training and background checks required of \u00a0professional security officers.\n\n\"But the reality is most people who have a concealed carry license in the state of Texas have never shot their weapon, certainly in a defensive mode,\" Wingfield said. \"So they have no experience on that.\"\n\n\"That's very different than having an off-duty police officer or someone who's ex-military or ex-police or someone with some other level of training,\" he continued.\n\n'Some is Better than None'\n\nWingfield helps pastor a large church with professional security guards. He tells CBN News that some volunteers also provide some security and admits there is some good to the new law.\n\n\"I think in some cases it would work, and I'm not going to say it would never work,\" he said. \"I would hope that all churches would be discerning about how they do that.\"\n\n\"There are some people who are very wise and experienced gun owners and users, and there are some people who are novices,\" he added.\n\nRinaldi says some is better than none.\n\n\"I would say it's better to have individuals providing security than not, especially in an armed situation,\" he said. \"It didn't change the laws on who can enter a church with a handgun; what it did was change the law on how the church can train these individuals so they could do it more safely.\"\n\nThe state lawmaker now advises congregations to take that next step.\n\n\"The law's in place; I would encourage churches to take note of it and to come up with a plan on how to deal with these situations,\" he said. \"Sutherland Springs was a tragedy; we're still healing as a state; we'll be healing for some time now.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Associated Press", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) - The office of special counsel Robert Mueller says a grand jury has charged 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities.\n\n \u00a0\n\n The defendants are accused of violating U.S. criminal laws to interfere with American elections and the political process.\n\n \u00a0\n\n Charges include conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Crystal Woodall", "body": "In a blow to Republicans, the US Supreme Court has refused to take up the party's challenge to block a newly drawn map they say is more favorable to Democrats.\n\nLikewise, on the same day, federal courts dismissed a lawsuit by GOP congressmen to challenge the new map.\n\nIt's a double blow that increases the Democratic Party's chances of retaking control of the US House of Representatives in this fall's midterm elections.\n\n\"I'm sure we'll review options, but I think we're accepting the decision,\" the Philadelphia Inquirer quoted state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R-Centre), one of the lawmakers who brought the US District Court challenge. \"(We) don't like it, but that's life and we move on.\"\n\nBack in 2011, Republicans drew up a gerrymandered map that gave them a 13-5 edge in the state's congressional delegation for the three elections in which it was used.\n\nBut Monday's rulings now give the Democrats the upper hand.

Last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seemed to indicate that the pastor will only be released when Washington gives Turkey a Muslim cleric living in the US who is Erdogan's rival.\n\n\"..they (the US) get up and say... 'Give us so and so cleric,'\" Erdogan said at a police academy graduation ceremony in Ankara in September, referring to Brunson.\n\nErdogan then brought up Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, saying, \"You have a cleric there.

for you. \u00a0We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain,\" the president said.\n\n\"Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country,\" he said. \"We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents so that this cannot ever happen again.\"\n\nThe president also made it a point to reach across the aisle to work with him to defend all Americans.\n\n\"I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. \u00a0My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. \u00a0Because Americans are dreamers too,\" he noted.\n\nOn immigration reform, the president touched on four points of his plan.\n\n\"The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. \u00a0Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the president, the second pillar of the plan fully secures the border.\n\n\"That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. \u00a0Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country -- and it finally ends the dangerous practice of \"catch and release,\" he explained.\n\n\"The third pillar ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. \u00a0It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration,\" he listed. \u00a0\"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. \u00a0Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. \u00a0This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\"\n\nTrump said it is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally, bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\n\n\"These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system,\" he said.\n\n\"Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. \u00a0So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done,\" \u00a0the president continued.\n\nTrump pointed out that in 2016, 64,000 Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses, roughly 174 deaths per day.\n\n\"We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\" he said.\n\nThe president then introduced Ryan Holets, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department, who along with his wife adopted a baby whose parents suffered from opioid addiction.\n\nOn the subject of defense, Trump asked Congress to fully fund the military.\n\n\"As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression,\" he said.\n\nThe president also gave an update on the war against ISIS.\n\n\"Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. \u00a0One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. \u00a0But there is much more work to be done. \u00a0We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president also introduced Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck, who saved the life of Kenton Stacy while the pair were on a mission to clear buildings in Raqqa last November. \u00a0Trump noted the sergeant was wearing his new Bronze Star with a \"V\" for valor.\n\nTrump also said he was keeping another promise to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\n\n\"Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. \u00a0Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans,\" the president said.\n\nThe president also mentioned his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this recognition. \u00a0American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year,\" he said. \u00a0\"That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interest and only go to America's friends.\"\n\nTrump also took a moment to address the people of Iran.\n\n\"When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. \u00a0America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom,\" he said.\n\nOn the subject of North Korea, the president said his administration a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent the country's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles that could threaten our homeland.\n\nTrump told the story of Otto Warmbier and how he was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. \u00a0After a trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June -- horribly injured and on the verge of death. \u00a0He passed away just days after his return.\n\nThe president then introduced Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier and pledged to honor Otto's memory with American resolve.\n\nThe president also took a moment to Mr. Ji Seong-ho. \u00a0Seong-ho lost his legs to a train after passing out on its tracks while trying to steal food. He traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.\n\n\"Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom,\" he said.\n\nTrump concluded his address by recognizing the heroes that live among us.\n\n\"They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines,\" he said. \"But above all else, they are Americans. \u00a0And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.\"\n\nThe president also reminded his audience of the American dream.\n\n\"Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. \u00a0And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: \u00a0The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. \u00a0And it is the people who are making America great again,\" he said.\u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \"As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. Our families will thrive,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free,\" he said. \"Thank you and God Bless America.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Tzippe Barrow", "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 More than a decade after Israeli pilots destroyed a Korean-built nuclear reactor in Syria, Israel declassified top secret documents Wednesday detailing the operation.\n\nAfter failing to convince former US President George Bush and his administration of the danger posed by the Syrian nuclear plant, Israel decided to act on its own.\n\nShortly before midnight on September 5, 2007, the Israel Air Force deployed eight jet fighters to take out the reactor.\n\nThe mission was successful, the facility destroyed and the pilots returned safely to their base.\n\nDr. Ronen Bergman, author of \"Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations,\" told journalists in a conference call organized by The Israel Project that despite their close relationship, Mossad chief Meir Dagan was unable to convince his US counterpart, CIA chief Michael Hayden, to strike the nuclear facility.\n\nDagan was convinced that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not retaliate \u2013 as long as he wasn't publicly humiliated. The CIA argued he would call for all-out war.\n\nDagan's assessment proved right and the CIA's wrong.\n\nBergman explained that Israeli Intelligence officials convinced then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni that if Israel did not take responsibility for the strike or publicize it \u2013 a move that would have humiliated Assad before his Middle Eastern counterparts and forced him to react, he would not. That proved to be true.\n\nAsked why Israel finally decided to lift the gag order on the operation, Bergman cited two main reasons.\n\nFirst because most of the details were already known outside of Israel there was no longer any need to keep it secret.\n\nSecond declassifying the information would send an important message: \"That when Israel is left alone, it reacts, and with extreme force.\"\n\nBergman agrees there are similarities between what happened then and Iran's attempts today to embed its forces in Syria.\n\nIn 2007, Israel asked the US to fulfill its commitment to Israel's security by striking the reactor.

This is not a path to citizenship.\u00a0 It's not a permanent fix,\u201d President Obama said in 2012.\n\nWhen President Trump rescinded DACA last fall, that protection became uncertain.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t they done the work to change their status?\n\nAccording to Immigration Attorney and Consultant Jose Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, obtaining that legal status is a lot more difficult than people realize.\n\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, generally, there is no line for undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States to get in to in order to apply for a green card,\u201d said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado.\n\nEvery undocumented immigrant has a different story - how they got here, who they know in the US and when they found out they were here illegally.\n\nAnd Salgado says that backstory can make individual cases tricky.\n\nSo what are the options?\n\nUndocumented immigrants can have a family member sponsor their green card.\n\nThat\u00a0sponsor has to be US citizen and be a member of their immediate family\u00a0or a spouse.\n\nBut even that has a few obstacles.\n\n\u201cThe problem is in many cases, because of the nuance of our immigration laws, oftentimes an individual can have someone that can sponsor them,\u201d said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, but he added that even in this situation, US laws can put up other barriers.\n\n\u201cConcepts such as the three and ten year bars\u00a0which make it so that someone has to leave the country and prohibits them from coming back for ten years,\u201d\u00a0he explained.\n\nIn other words,\u00a0even if someone in the US\u00a0illegally does get a sponsor, he or she\u00a0must return to their\u00a0home country to apply for a green card. But that creates a problem itself, because\u00a0in most cases it triggers an automatic ban from returning to the US for a certain period of time- often three or ten years.\n\nBut if an\u00a0individual doesn\u2019t have a spouse or family member who is also a citizen in the first place, that\u2019s a dead end anyway.\n\nEmployers\u00a0may feel their employee is worth the investment and sponsor legal status but it\u2019s a costly and complicated process.\n\nAn advance parole is a permit that lets non-citizens re-enter the US after traveling internationally.\n\nAccording to Factcheck.org with advance parole, an illegal immigrant can leave the US for humanitarian work or for employment purposes. The fee is $575.\n\nWhen they return they are technically re-entering legally, which is good as far as the green card process is concerned.\u00a0 But they still need one of the aforementioned sponsors.\n\nThink of it as more of a bonus than a golden ticket.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is if you are an individual who is able to travel on advance parole and also collaterally have someone who can sponsor you, you can potentially apply to get a green card,\u201d explained Maga\u00f1a-Salgado.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a series of catch-22s that make it hard to get their green cards,\u201d said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado.\n\nThe immigration issue goes beyond DACA; a comprehensive\u00a0overhaul has long been discussed, but never accomplished.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to see an end to chain migration\u00a0and the visa lottery program.\n\nIt's something the president mentioned again in his weekly address.\n\nThe Congressional battle is sure to wage for weeks, as lawmakers begin the lengthy process of fixing a complicated immigration system and showing \u201cheart\u201d to the \u201cDreamers\u201d as President Trump promised.", "link": null, "source": "CBN News", "location": []}, {"author": "Cbn News", "body": "British Prime Minister Theresa May is convening a meeting of the National Security Council Wednesday to discuss economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia in response to last week's chemical attack on a former Russian spy, his daughter and a police officer.\n\nMay announced that 23 Russian diplomats will be expelled over the incident, the biggest such expulsion since the Cold War.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry vigorously denied involvement in the attack that hospitalized former spy Sergei Skripal, his daughter, Yulia, and a police officer.

Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain will consider next steps in the coming days alongside its allies.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry ordered the 23 diplomats to leave within a week.

(AP) \u2014 The warnings around Nikolas Cruz seemed to flash like neon signs: expelled from school, fighting with classmates, a fascination with weapons and hurting animals, disturbing images, and comments posted to social media, previous mental health treatment.\n\nIn Florida, that wasn\u2019t enough for relatives, authorities or his school to request a judicial order barring him from possessing guns.\n\nOnly five states have laws allowing family members, guardians or police to ask judges to temporarily strip gun rights from people who show warning signs of violence. Supporters of the measures, deemed \u201cred flag laws\u201d or gun violence restraining orders, say they can save lives by stopping some shootings and suicides.\n\nFlorida, where Cruz is accused of using an AR-15 rifle to kill 17 people at his former high school, does not have such a law. He was able to legally own the semi-automatic rifle even though his mother, classmates, and teachers had at times described him as dangerous and threatening.\n\nRed flag legislation was introduced last fall in Florida by Democratic lawmakers, but its fate is uncertain in a state Legislature controlled by Republicans who generally favor expanding gun rights. After Wednesday\u2019s shooting at a high school in Parkland, a suburb north of Miami, Republican Gov. Rick Scott said he will work to make sure people with mental illnesses don\u2019t have access to guns but offered no specifics.\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state to let family members ask a judge to remove firearms from a relative who appears to pose a threat. It was passed after a mentally ill man, Elliot Rodger, killed six University of California, Santa Barbara, students and wounded 13 other people near the campus before killing himself.\n\nThe law also allows police to petition for the protective orders, which can require firearms to be removed for up to one year. Connecticut, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington are the other states with some version of a red flag law.\n\nMore than a dozen others, including Hawaii, New Jersey, and Missouri, are considering bills that would allow family members or police to petition the courts if they want weapons taken from an individual showing signs of mental distress or violence.\n\nThe Florida shooting also has revived the debate about whether teachers and school administrators should have that authority as well, given that people at Cruz\u2019s high school witnessed much of his erratic behavior.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers voted to expand their law in 2016 so that high school and college personnel, co-workers and mental health professionals can seek the restraining orders, but Gov. Jerry Brown called the effort premature and vetoed it.\n\nState Assemblyman Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat, said he plans to reintroduce the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that when people see signs, they have every ability to do something about getting guns out of the hands of mentally ill and dangerous people,\u201d Ting told The Associated Press.\n\nCircumstances similar to those in Florida played out seven years ago in the shooting of an Arizona congresswoman. Jared Loughner had become increasingly disruptive and erratic at his community college in the months leading up to the shooting, frightening students and causing teachers to request campus police officers be on hand during his classes. Eventually, the school threatened him with suspension.\n\nSoon after, he went to a gun store and legally bought the weapon he used in the attack outside a grocery store where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was meeting constituents. Loughner shot Giffords in the head and killed six people.\n\nIn the absence of red flag laws, the main recourse available to family members is to have their troubled loved one committed to a psychiatric institution. Federal law permanently bans anyone who has been involuntarily committed from owning guns, but such actions are more difficult to carry out than red flag laws, which are intended to be quick and temporary and have a lower standard of proof.\n\nWithout a commitment, formal adjudication of serious mental illness or a felony conviction, many people can pass background checks and possess guns they already own.\n\nThe red flag laws act as a sort of timeout so someone in psychological distress can get counseling while their fitness to possess a gun is evaluated, said Laura Cutilletta, legal director of the Giffords Law Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to allow for temporary removal of firearms in a situation just like this: where somebody has made threats, where they have been expelled from school because of those threats, they\u2019re in counseling, and parents or the school or whoever it is understood that this person poses a threat,\u201d she said.\n\nMany gun-rights activists oppose the laws. They say they can be used to unfairly take away rights from people who have not been convicted of crimes or professionally evaluated for mental illness.\n\nThe National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm has said such laws allow courts to remove Second Amendment rights \u201cbased on third-party allegations and evidentiary standards\u201d that are lower than what\u2019s required in criminal proceedings.\n\nConnecticut led the way with a 1999 law, passed after an employee shot and killed four executives at the state Lottery headquarters. It allows police to remove guns based on probable cause that a person poses a \u201crisk of imminent personal injury.\u201d\n\nIn a study published last year, researchers at Duke, Yale, Connecticut, and Virginia estimated that dozens of suicides have been prevented by the law, roughly one for every 10 gun seizures carried out. They said such laws \u201ccould significantly mitigate the risk\u201d posed by the small number of legal gun owners who might suddenly pose a significant danger.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
