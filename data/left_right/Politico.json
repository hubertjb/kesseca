[{"author": "David Siders", "body": "LOS ANGELES\u2014On the day this week that he released a photograph of Stormy Daniels, his porn-star client, taking a polygraph, Michael Avenatti was pressed on CNN to explain the significance of a test that typically is inadmissible in court. \u201cDoes it help your legal case, actually?\u201d Anderson Cooper asked.\n\nAvenatti, a racecar-driving lawyer from California, met the question with a shrug. While it was unclear to Cooper, the audience in Stormy Daniels v. Donald J. Trump is sometimes not a judge or jury, but viewers at home.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that it helps our legal case,\u201d Avenatti said, appearing on a split screen beside the grainy, years-old image of Daniels. \u201cBut we want the public to have as many facts as possible at their disposal.\u201d\n\nEver since Daniels sued President Donald Trump this month\u2014claiming she had an intimate affair with him in 2006 and 2007 and that a nondisclosure agreement created before the 2016 election is invalid\u2014Avenatti has tormented the administration with a steady drip of half-revelations about Daniels\u2019 relationship with the president, usually with an appeal to tune in for his client\u2019s 60 Minutes interview on Sunday to hear more. Late Thursday night, he tweeted an image of a DVD and hinted that it contained information damaging to the president. He wrote, \u201cIf \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words,\u2019 how many words is this worth?????\u201d The first hashtag: #60minutes.\n\nElaborating on CNN the next day, Avenatti called the tweet a \"warning shot,\" telling Wolf Blitzer the disc contained \"evidence substantiating the relationship.\" He added, \"If people think I'm bluffing, they should ask the opponents in countless cases I've had over the last 15 years if I'm generally a guy that bluffs.\"\n\nAvenatti is as much as Daniels\u2019 pitchman as her lawyer. And in the public relations war that he is waging, he has, in many ways, already won. In less than three weeks, Avenatti has transformed Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, from a tabloid curiosity into a sympathetic figure and cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Her interview on 60 Minutes is so highly anticipated that a movie theater in Oakland proposed charging admission to a screening.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played a pretty good hand in terms of cat-and-mouse,\u201d says John Burris, the civil rights attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s put his client in a high-visibility position, and himself as well.\u201d\n\nAvenatti says Daniels came to him for representation, though he won\u2019t say how. And he won\u2019t say how he is being paid. In a telephone call, he rejected mundane questions about his personal life before volunteering, spontaneously, that he\u2019s single.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a common question I\u2019m getting these days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very flattering.\u201d\n\nLawyers who have opposed Avenatti describe him as a talented litigator who is aggressive, prickly and confrontational. In 2014, he reached an $80.5 million settlement with a Los Angeles cemetery over claims the company dumped human remains, including those of a baby, to make room for new burials. Last year, he capitalized on the Ebola scare to win a $454 million jury verdict against Kimberly-Clark Corp. \u2014 maker of Huggies diapers and Scott toilet paper \u2014 after raising questions about the safety of the company\u2019s surgical gowns. It was the largest verdict in California last year.\n\nThose cases were turned into 60 Minutes features, too. But it took Daniels to catapult him into stardom. On the day in March when he filed her lawsuit, Avenatti had about 500 Twitter followers, he says. Now he\u2019s pushing 100,000. Earlier this week, Sports Illustrated took a special interest in his racing career. Avenatti has competed at Le Mans, a 24-hour endurance event in France where his teammates included Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud.\n\nBut he\u2019s a better lawyer than driver. \u201cThe last person you want to pick a fight with in court is an adrenaline junkie,\u201d says George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who knew Avenatti as a student and keeps in touch. \u201cHe does his best work under pressure. That\u2019s always a dangerous type of opponent to have.\u201d\n\nNow 47, Avenatti attended high school in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, the first person in his family to earn a college degree. During college and at George Washington Law School, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1999, Avenatti worked at an opposition research group run by Rahm Emanuel, who would later become President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff and is now mayor of Chicago. In recent days, Republicans have seized on the affiliation to suggest a political motive.\n\n\u201cWe ended up doing work not just for Democrats but also for Republicans\u201d at the firm, Avenatti says, adding that the last time he saw Emanuel was January 3, 2007. He says he\u2019s sure of the date because he checked his passport. They ran into each other at a Buenos Aires airport.\n\nAvenatti said he is registered to vote as an independent. He last donated to a political candidate in 2007, when he gave $1,000 to former Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Trump hater,\u201d Avenatti says. \u201cSome of the things he\u2019s done, such as rolling back some regulations, have been helpful to the economy and job creation. I agree with some of his tax policies.\u201d\n\nOn the Daniels case, Avenatti has proved unrelenting. He accused Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, of \u201cthuggish behavior\u201d on CNN this week, then pulled out an enormous picture of Cohen and appeared to challenge him to a Crossfire-style TV debate. \u201cWhere is this guy?\u201d Avenatti said.\n\nDavid Schwartz, a friend and representative of Cohen, scolded Avenatti, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go down in flames.\u201d Avenatti wagged his finger at Schwartz and asked, about Daniels, \u201cWhy not just let her talk? \u2026 Why is it so important to your friend and the president of the United States to keep this woman under wraps, to keep her under the thumb, to shut her up?\u201d\n\nBaiting the Trump administration to engage publicly in the controversy, Avenatti said on MSNBC this week, \u201cTo the extent that Mr. Cohen or the president have a counter-narrative or a different version of the facts, they should go on a show, have a press conference, they could have a White House briefing, they could do any number of things, and explain their version of events.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is all about Mr. Avenatti. It\u2019s not about his client. It\u2019s about him and getting himself out there,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cHis court is not the court of law. It\u2019s the court of public opinion. This is all about trying to use this against the president.\u201d\n\nUntil last week, Avenatti\u2019s main opposition in the Daniels case was Cohen, the president\u2019s personal fix-it man who might have made Avenatti\u2019s job easier by talking about the $130,000 payment he has said he made to Daniels from his personal funds as part of the nondisclosure agreement. But on March 16, Trump brought in a more formidable lawyer, Charles Harder, whose clients include Melania Trump and Hulk Hogan. Harder won a $140 million judgment that forced Gawker Media into bankruptcy for publishing a story that included a clip from a sex tape starring the professional wrestler.\n\n\u201cA face-off between Avenatti and Harder may be an example of the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object,\u201d Turley says. \u201cThese are two very good attorneys who are known to be very aggressive.\u201d\n\nHarder and Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. Avenatti appeared unflappable.\n\n\u201cIt is very rare that I draw an opponent who is not at the very top of the legal profession,\u201d he said. \u201cI would prefer to litigate against high-quality lawyers as opposed to low-quality lawyers.\u201d\n\nAsked if Cohen is a low-quality lawyer, the line fell silent. Ten seconds ticked by. Fifteen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d he said. Then, finally: \u201cNo comment.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Susan B.

Trump gleefully tweeted the news out, in all capital letters in case the point wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nBut the timing seemed terrible. The sudden end to the House probe came the very same week the president himself\u2014while stepping up his attacks on special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d\u2014finally and belatedly authorized new sanctions to respond to the Russian hacking. Newspaper editorialists, angry Democrats and even a few Republicans had a field day; the Daily Beast summed up the mocking coverage by calling the Republican report the equivalent of a \u201chalf-researched term paper.\u201d\n\nThe backlash was such that even on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace seemed to eviscerate the House exercise as little more than a coverup for Trump, pointing out that the committee had never heard from key witnesses ranging from former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadapoulos. \u201cYour conclusion is not conclusive,\u201d he said to one of the Republican members, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC).\n\nGowdy\u2014who, it must be noted, is planning to retire after his term is up at the end of the year\u2014seemed to agree, essentially responding: Pay attention to Mueller\u2019s probe and ignore this House report. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cExecutive branch investigations have more credibility, they have more tools, and that\u2019s what I think what my fellow citizens ought to be waiting for and have confidence in. Not congressional investigations that are run by guys running for the Senate in California who never met a camera they didn\u2019t fall in love with.\u201d\n\nThe TV-loving Californian Gowdy couldn\u2019t resist bashing is Rep. Adam Schiff, the panel\u2019s top Democrat and, over the last year, a reliably omnipresent public scourge of Trump and his Republican defenders on Capitol Hill on the subject of the Russiagate allegations. Schiff, a little-known former prosecutor before his committee began investigating Trump, is not running for Senate, but he is mentioned as a possible candidate for speaker if Democrats take back the House this fall, and he is now a favorite Twitter target of the embattled president, who loves to deride him as \u201cLittle Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nWhatever you call him, Schiff certainly was not in charge of the Republican-led House Intelligence investigation, but instead chief witness to its dysfunction. If you want to understand what a congressional committee gone \u201coff the rails\u201d (as one of its Republican members, Florida GOP Rep. Tom Rooney, called it) looks like, Schiff offered a compelling account in an interview for this week\u2019s Global Politico, recounting a committee process so broken that last week\u2019s follies seemed the logical culmination of a \u201cfundamentally unserious\u201d House Intelligence investigation. Schiff argued that the probe, as incomplete as it was, in fact did turn up \u201cample evidence\u201d of Trump\u2019s collusion both with the Russians and with the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Devin Nunes.\n\n\u201cThey announced their conclusions, which included among other things that the Russians had not intervened in the election to help Donald Trump. Now, that\u2019s at odds with what the intelligence community has found. It\u2019s at odds with what our committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what the Senate committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what Bob Mueller has found,\u201d Schiff pointed out to me. It was \u201ca political statement, not a finding,\u201d which is why, as comments like Gowdy\u2019s on Sunday suggest, \u201cwhen they were forced to defend it\u2026 they couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, the sense of a Republican investigation shut down so quickly its members hardly had a sense of what they had decided to put out was underscored watching Gowdy and Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican ostensibly leading the probe on Nunes\u2019 behalf, stumble through interviews on the Sunday talk shows.\n\nDid he really mean it when he said the Russian goal wasn\u2019t necessarily to elect Trump, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd pressed Conaway. \u201cI got us off on the wrong track quite frankly,\u201d Conaway responded.\n\nIronically, Schiff told me he and Conaway had worked well together in the investigation, blaming most of the breakdown on the committee chairman, Nunes, who said he would recuse himself after an early incident last year of coordinating with the Trump White House (\u201cthe midnight run,\u201d Schiff termed it). Instead, Schiff said, Nunes had continued to run the show \u2013 and seemed to be openly coordinating with the Trump White House about it.\n\n\u201cHad Mr. Conaway and I been really given the latitude to run the investigation, it would have been a very different investigation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cChairman Nunes, even when he said he was stepping aside after the midnight run, never did, and continued to make all the key decisions\u2014which witnesses would come in; when they would come; and what open hearings we would have; what open hearings we wouldn\u2019t have; what subpoenas would go out; what subpoenas wouldn\u2019t go out\u2014all of these sideshow investigations of FISA abuse and Uranium One and all that\u2014those were all decisions made by Chairman Nunes, not by Mike Conaway.\u201d\n\nSchiff and the Democrats issued their own 21-page memo days after being surprised by the Republican shutdown, offering a long list of witnesses never called and revealing avenues of investigation they were pursuing, including tantalizing hints about a potential NRA-Russia connection and \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of Trump having engaged in money laundering on behalf of Russian \u201coligarchs, criminals, and regime cronies.\u201d Schiff said he would pursue those if Democrats take the House this fall and he returns as the committee\u2019s chairman. (Interestingly, Schiff did not deny reports he might be a candidate for speaker if the Democrats win, telling me only that it was his \u201chope\u201d that the current Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi will run again. When I said that sounded like a non-denial denial, he replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what my future holds.\u201d)\n\nMeantime, Schiff was left marveling over a partisan spectacle that seemed to confirm, if nothing else, how committed House Republicans remain to President Trump, despite his historically high disapproval ratings for so early in a presidency and the discomfiting facts that have piled up about the Russian plot to help boost Trump\u2019s campaign. That includes, Schiff pointed out, House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom he called \u201ccomplicit in all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think one of the really sad realizations over the last year is not what kind of a president Donald Trump turns out to be\u2014I think it was all too predictable\u2014but rather, how many members of Congress would be unwilling to stand up to him, and more than that, would be completely willing to carry water for him. That is a very sad realization,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI did not expect that. I thought there would be more Jeff Flakes, more John McCains, more Bob Corkers\u2014people who would defend our system of checks and balances, would speak out for decency, who would defend the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nWe met for the interview in Schiff\u2019s Capitol Hill office on Friday, before Trump spent the weekend tweeting thinly veiled threats against Mueller\u2019s investigation. But Schiff\u2019s observation still applies \u2013 few Republicans aside from the small handful who\u2019ve made it their practice to challenge the president had anything to say about those presidential threats to Mueller this weekend. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of those who has spoken out, warned that if the president does in fact move to shut down the Mueller investigation, it would be \u201cthe beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d But I\u2019m not so sure; if Trump really does ax Mueller, will there be a real outcry among the Republicans who run the House of Representatives?\n\nLast week\u2019s circus in the House Intelligence Committee suggests the sound may be a lot less than deafening.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kyle Cheney", "body": "Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    House intelligence panel votes to release Trump-Russia report\n                        \n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n\n        \n            By KYLE CHENEY\n\n    03/22/2018 10:53 AM EDT\n\n                    \n\n\n        \n\nThe House Intelligence Committee on Thursday voted along party lines to formally end its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and issue a report that says the lawmakers found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s associates and the Kremlin.\n\nThe GOP-authored report must be reviewed by the intelligence community to redact classified information before it can be released.

Hey! Shoulder to shoulder! Don\u2019t take a step back! Y\u2019all deserve it!\u201d\n\nAs he tried to make his way through the pulsing crowd, another teacher stopped him, asking him to sign with a Sharpie the chest of her shirt that had on it a picture of him looking stalwart and stern in his military fatigues.\n\nThe people chanted his name.\n\nRichard Ojeda, hard j, is a first-term lawmaker from southern West Virginia. He\u2019s 47 years old, a husband and a father of two, and he\u2019s won exactly one general election in his life. He is running now for the open seat in West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which seems like a monumentally precocious act for somebody who has served slightly more than a year in any elected office at all. But Ojeda has made his mark on the volatile politics in this state with a stunning suddenness. Though he is a Democrat in a legislature in which his party is outnumbered almost 2-to-1, he spearheaded in his freshman session the passage of a bill legalizing medical marijuana. Then, this January, he stood on the Senate floor and argued in fiery speeches that energy companies should pony up more taxes so teachers could get better benefits and pay. A strike, he warned, was not out of the question. A month later, teachers from all 55 counties walked off the job\u2014a first in the history of the state\u2014instantly making Ojeda the father of one of the region\u2019s largest labor actions of the past 30 years.\n\nIn hard red, Donald Trump-loving West Virginia, Ojeda has become a kind of one-man blue wave, threatening to defy a conventional belief that the only kind of Democrat that can win big races here\u2014or anywhere, for that matter, in Appalachia or the industrial Midwest\u2014is somebody like Joe Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the United States Senate, a pragmatic, pro-business social conservative. Because here is Ojeda, a pro-labor, twang-talking, plainspoken populist, scrambling the state\u2019s recent rightward shift by harkening back to a deeper, more radical vein of its rich political history. In the early 20th century, miners fought and died for higher wages and safer working conditions while wearing red bandanas and carrying Winchester rifles. Now, teachers are the new miners; in fact, in a place all but defined by its coal heritage, there are some 20,000 teachers and fewer than 12,000 miners, making the teachers\u2014plus the 13,000 staff who walked off the job with them\u2014by far the largest union in the state. And here, as I hustled after Ojeda into the bustling Capitol, the striking school employees weren\u2019t armed\u2014but many were dressed in red. And some of them had knotted around their necks those bandanas.\n\nTheir songs of unrest ricocheted off the marble of the rotunda inside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna take it \u2026 we\u2019re not gonna take it \u2026 we\u2019re not gonna take it anymooooooore!\u201d\n\nWith me and Ojeda in this crush of energy was Krystal Ball, the former MSNBC host who\u2019s the president of the People\u2019s House Project, a PAC that has endorsed Ojeda\u2019s congressional candidacy. In the middle of the maelstrom, Ball had to shout to be heard. \u201cHe\u2019s going to win!\u201d she announced. She said this with a certainty that startled me. I had to lean in to make out her words. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be an instant national story! And Richard is going to be an instant national figure and face of the Democrats!\u201d\n\nI gave Ball a skeptical look. West Virginia, after all, voted overwhelmingly for Trump, and the 3rd District was the most pro-Trump district. The Cook Political Report doesn\u2019t even label the district as \u201ccompetitive.\u201d Evan Jenkins, the current GOP representative, won so decisively in 2016, he decided to run for the right to run against Manchin for Senate. And in Logan County, where Ojeda grew up and still lives, just shy of 80 percent of voters chose Trump\u2014and one of them was Ojeda himself. He\u2019s not on Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton\u2019s tally of veterans he has endorsed, and he\u2019s not on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d list, either. He\u2019s been a mostly limited fundraiser, too, in part because he takes no money from anybody except individual donors and labor unions. There is next to no standard reason to think Ojeda could win\u2014except for the visceral evidence that was swirling around us. The more than 5,000 teachers screaming his name. Ball looked at me and laughed.\n\nBy this time, we had lost him. When I spotted his skin-shorn flattop sticking out of the crowd, Ojeda was surrounded by a rapt half-moon of teachers. His eyes were wide, and he was jabbing the air with a finger. \u201cWe are on the next Saudi Arabia!\u201d he was hollering. \u201cThey\u2019ve said that\u2014the energy people said that! So, if we\u2019re on the next Saudi Arabia, obviously they want it to be just like Saudi Arabia, where you have about 10 people driving around in Lamborghinis and everybody else eatin\u2019 sand sandwiches! That\u2019s what they want. Guess what? No!\u201d He told them the people who give him money are regular folks. Labor unions. That\u2019s it. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Big Energy!\u201d he yelled. They erupted again in applause.\n\nOver the course of the next two days, the first two days of the West Virginia teachers\u2019 strike that remained unresolved as of Thursday, I saw signs that read: \u201cOVER WORKED UNDER PAID\u201d and \u201cTEACHERS ARE WORTH MORE.\u201d One just said, \u201cHelp Us Ojeda. You\u2019re our Only Hope!\u201d I heard people ask him to run for governor, so they could vote for him, too, even if they lived in the northern two-thirds of the state. I heard him described as a \u201crock star\u201d and a \u201cfolk hero.\u201d I even watched one teacher propose to him. Literally get down on one knee and ask him to marry her. It was the only time I saw him (a little) flustered and (very briefly) speechless. \u201cI\u2019m married!\u201d he finally blurted out. And everywhere I went with him, it was never too long before that chant started up again.\n\nAll of this has made Ojeda as confident about his prospects as Ball. \u201cI\u2019m going to blow through my primary,\u201d he matter-of-factly told me in his office. That\u2019s in May. And in the general election come November? His campaign manager is an over-the-road truck driver, his communications director is a single mother who lives in Mingo County with her parents and her 5-year-old son, and most of his unlikely, ragtag campaign staff isn\u2019t being paid\u2014and yet, fresh internal polling Ojeda shared with me shows he\u2019s not only projected to win the race, but he\u2019s beating his two likeliest GOP opponents among GOP voters. \u201cI\u2019m kicking the shit out of the Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nI first got interested in Ojeda late last year after I watched the launch video for his congressional campaign. It was unlike any campaign video I\u2019d ever seen. Shots of him toughing out pullups and bench press reps. A picture of his battered, bloodied head after he suffered facial fractures in a brass-knuckles attack at a campaign picnic before his primary in 2016\u2014an attack Ojeda believes was politically motivated. Anybody who\u2019s not out to help \u201cthe people,\u201d he says into the camera, somewhat menacingly, \u201cthey need not darken my doorstep.\u201d It was the creation, I would learn later, of a young man named J.D. Belcher, a former coal miner who taught himself filmmaking after taking a liking to The Walking Dead TV series and who used to be a member of a heavy metal band called Keep the Victim Warm. In the video, Ojeda also gave out the number to his cellphone. A few weeks ago, I called it.\n\nAfter I introduced myself, Ojeda uncorked a nearly unbroken, 13-minute tirade in which he called lobbyists \u201cthe absolute scum of the earth,\u201d said they should have to wear body cameras in the Capitol, said they shouldn\u2019t even be allowed \u201cin the damn Capitol,\u201d and told me one of the first things he did as a state legislator was give energy industry lobbyists a tongue-lashing. \u201cI threw Big Energy out of my office!\u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, is there anything we can do to change your mind?\u2019 I said, \u2018You can get yo\u2019 ass out of my office.\u2019\u201d He continued by scorching lawmakers for making decisions based on corporate campaign contributions instead of the interests of their constituents.\n\n\u201cBootlickers!\u201d he screamed into the phone.\n\nI asked when I could come visit him.\n\nHe picked me up at my hotel in Logan early in the morning on the first day of the strike. The back of his Jeep was covered with stickers. \u201cAFGHANISTAN I SERVED,\u201d said one. \u201cIRAQ I SERVED,\u201d said another. \u201cIT\u2019S NOT THAT I AND OTHERS ,\u201d said a third. \u201cBUT I WILL AND OTHERS WON\u2019T.\u201d\n\nAs we raced toward Charleston, Ojeda railing away about lobbyists and \u201cbought-and-paid-for politicians\u201d and Big Pharma and Big Energy while taking the curves in the four-lane highway so fast it felt at times like we were riding on just two wheels, it was hard not to consider his improbable path to this juncture.\n\nHis grandfather was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who came to this part of West Virginia because coal was booming and he could make a living. His father was a nurse. Ojeda graduated from Logan High in 1988. \u201cWhere I come from, when you graduate high school, there\u2019s only three choices\u2014dig coal, sell dope, or join the Army. And I chose the military.\u201d He served 24 years. He went to Korea and Honduras and Jordan and Haiti. Afghanistan. Iraq. He almost died five times, by his count, an IED blast, a couple of dud mortars, the Taliban. He earned two Bronze Stars and retired as Major Ojeda. \u201cI\u2019m a combat soldier,\u201d he told me. He wants his ashes spread on Sicily Drop Zone at North Carolina\u2019s Fort Bragg, the paratroopers\u2019 training facility, which he considers \u201challowed ground.\u201d\n\nToward the end of his time in the Army, he helped start a Junior ROTC program at an area high school and established a nonprofit organization called the Logan Empowerment Action and Development that did community cleanup projects and Christmas toy drives and served meals to the poor and the elderly and raised money for new shoes for kids. He began writing long letters to the editor to the Logan Banner. They always signed off the same way: \u201cSappers Clear The Way! Airborne All The Way!\u201d It all somehow led to an invite to the 2013 State of the Union as the guest of Manchin. The senator and his staff at the time were not expecting Ojeda to run for office. \u201cHe was just excited to take a Capitol tour,\u201d said Mara Boggs, Manchin\u2019s state director, who served with Ojeda in the Army. \u201cAll I saw was the passion,\u201d Manchin added. But after the speech that night, Ojeda heard Manchin talk about some \u201cmanufacturing hubs\u201d slated to come to West Virginia\u2014to the northern part of the state, though, not the southern part of the state that often feels even more overlooked and left behind. And he decided that was the fault of Nick Rahall, the Democrat who then represented the 3rd District. Rahall wasn\u2019t \u201cstanding on his desk,\u201d as Ojeda put it to me, doing his job. So he ran against him in a primary in 2014.\n\n\u201cI was unknown, and had no money, but I got 34 percent of the overall vote against Rahall,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cAnd I beat him like a drum in Logan County.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a thorn in our side,\u201d John Moffett told me. Moffett is the executive director of the People\u2019s House Project and an Ojeda booster now, but back then, he was a Rahall aide who developed a grudging respect for the novice challenger who got a third of the vote \u201cwith literally no campaign structure.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Ojeda ran for the state Senate and got attacked\u2014physically, brutally. The assailant, who had ties to Ojeda\u2019s opponent, later was sentenced to one to five years in prison\u2014bringing to a close the violent episode that elicited his first round of national news coverage, a trend that\u2019s continued. In 2016, though, even after the attack, Ojeda won, anyway, and then won in the general, and then went to Charleston, where he in no time was the lead sponsor of Senate Bill 386, Creating WV Medical Cannabis Act, which became law three months after he showed up at the Capitol and willed the legislation to the governor\u2019s desk. He saw it as a big win against Big Pharma.\n\nOjeda arrived in Charleston for his second legislative session, determined to take on the state\u2019s most powerful political force\u2014the energy companies that get rich off West Virginia\u2019s resources, he says, while leaving the state and the vast share of its people \u201cnone the better.\u201d A state with such wealth under the ground, he believes, shouldn\u2019t rank 48th out 50 states in teacher pay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not paying attention or speaking to the people that are on the ground and at the front lines of education,\u201d he warned last fall in an interview with the Huntington Herald-Dispatch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not listening to our teachers,\u201d he told his fellow senators in January.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting on a powder keg,\u201d he said.\n\nHis floor speeches got only so much reaction from many of his fellow legislators, but the teachers certainly were listening.\n\n\u201cThe spark that lit the match,\u201d Ball said.\n\nNow, pulling into Charleston, the gold dome shrouded in fog, hitting traffic, looking down from the interstate at a usually mostly empty parking lot filled with cars packed with sign-toting teachers, he dipped down onto surface streets, and the teachers saw his red Jeep and started waving and screaming, and he honked and pumped his fast before swinging into the Senate parking area.\n\n\u201cHooah,\u201d he said to the guard at the guard shack and then whipped into a reserved spot.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the sign that said ninja on it? Pay attention,\u201d he told me.\n\n\n\nOjeda is a new face in an old battle.\n\nThe fights of the future, same as the fights of the past, John Alexander Williams wrote in 1976 in West Virginia: A History, \u201care likely to pit weak and poorly organized coalitions of local reformers and interest groups against powerful and well-disciplined combinations of absentee owners and middlemen. If the past is any guide, there will always be plenty of middlemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of our workplaces are breeding growing dissatisfaction and insecurity,\u201d Robert Shogan wrote in 2004 in The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America\u2019s Largest Labor Uprising, \u201cour economy is producing increasing inequality and the labor laws put into place in the 1930s to prevent recurrences of what happened in Mingo County and many other places are no longer working very well to protect workers. There are no signs of bandana armies forming, of course \u2026\u201d\n\nFight? \u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d Ojeda said to a gaggle of teachers in his office when I was with him.\n\nWhen he was little, Ojeda was scrawny, but he could use his fists. \u201cIf I thought you was gonna try to come bully me,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was gonna get you.\u201d In Iraq, he built a boxing ring in a gravel pit. \u201cAnd we beat the shit out of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would come back from a mission, and we would fight.\u201d\n\nHis office at the Capitol, from what I could see, has two small pictures of a single politician\u2014John F. Kennedy, taped to the front of his desktop computer. On his desk, too, is \u201cA Coal Miner\u2019s Prayer.\u201d But almost all the other pieces of the d\u00e9cor, if that\u2019s even the right term, are Army flags, Army plaques, Army certificates, Army paraphernalia, the boots and fatigues of fallen friends. Now, he told the teachers that kept coming in, \u201cI fight like a daggone wild man for labor unions.\u201d And anybody who doesn\u2019t? \u201cI will make their life a living hell.\u201d\n\nThe state legislative session ends March 10. Already for the better part of a year, Ojeda has been hosting regular and energetic Facebook Live sessions and out and about campaigning\u2014clad in his typical garb of combat boots, Ripstop tactical pants and Grunt Style shirts. His bid to come to Washington is about to shift to full-fledged. His strategy? \u201cBoots on the ground, my man,\u201d he said. \u201cBoots on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have a very, very good shot of winning,\u201d David Graham, the truck driver who\u2019s the campaign manager, told me. He cited the recent internal polling that has Ojeda beating potential Republican opponent Conrad Lucas with Republican voters 24.3 percent to 23 percent (with 52.8 percent uncertain) and beating other potential Republican opponent Rupie Phillips with Republican voters 27.1 percent to 16.5 percent (with 56.4 percent uncertain). The overall numbers including all voters aren\u2019t even close. Ojeda\u2019s top foe in the primary, Huntington mayor Steve Williams, much more a Manchin-style Democrat and better-funded, dropped out of the race in January, saying it wasn\u2019t right to run for higher office given the severity of the drug problem in his city. Supporters of Ojeda wonder if the energy around their candidate had something to do with it, too. When I asked Manchin about Ojeda, his answer was brief. \u201cRich is a populist,\u201d Manchin told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a people\u2019s person\u201d\u2014as restrained an assessment of Ojeda as I\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cIf the election was tomorrow, he\u2019d win in a landslide,\u201d said Belcher, the miner turned videographer. \u201cHe\u2019s got the working class with him. If you\u2019ve got the working class in West Virginia, you\u2019re set.\u201d\n\nThe implications are compelling. \u201cIf Ojeda wins,\u201d said Moffett from People\u2019s House, \u201cit changes the entire conversation about how we run candidates, what type of candidates we run, and where.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s JFK with tattoos and a bench press,\u201d Randy Jones, his 25-year-old volunteer finance director from Huntington, told me.\n\n\u201cSomeone who sounds like you, talks like you, looks like you, struggled like you\u2014who\u2019s standing up and speaking truth to power,\u201d added Dennis White, 34, an Army veteran from West Virginia\u2019s Boone County who\u2019s a student at Connecticut\u2019s Wesleyan University and a remote-working jack-of-all-trades aide to Ojeda.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s a lesson for everybody, that these are the kinds of candidates that we need to recruit,\u201d Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan told me. Ryan plans on coming to West Virginia later this month or in early April to campaign with Ojeda. An Ojeda victory in November, he said, \u201ccould be a signal to the Republican Party that Democrats\u2014we\u2019re coming to your territory, we\u2019re not going to play this coastal game anymore. If we get candidates like him and have a strong economic message, there\u2019s not a state we can\u2019t win in.\u201d\n\nIn the red Jeep on the way back to Logan, I asked Ojeda about his vote for Trump, a fact that in another state could be seen as disqualifying for a Democrat.\n\n\u201cI voted for him because it was about family and friends,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else was saying anything. Hillary Clinton was coming here blowing smoke up everybody\u2019s ass. Hell, I wanted Bernie Sanders\u201d\u2014and he wasn\u2019t the only one, obviously, as Sanders beat Clinton in the primaries in all 55 counties\u2014\u201cbut once Bernie Sanders was screwed over by Hillary Clinton, by the way, you had no other option.\u201d\n\nHe regrets his vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cBecause he hasn\u2019t done shit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a friggin\u2019 circus for a solid year.\u201d Nothing\u2019s changed. So many people in southern West Virginia are still poor and need jobs. The opioid epidemic rages unabated. \u201cAll he\u2019s done,\u201d Ojeda said, \u201cis shown that he\u2019s taking care of the daggone people he\u2019s supposed to be getting rid of.\u201d\n\nAnd I asked him about 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kicking ass right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are winning this race. And we\u2019re winning it by a large margin. We did a scientific poll! And, oh, by the way, you show me one of my opponents that can walk anyplace right now and have 500 people screaming their name. And guess what? It\u2019s not just happening at the Capitol. This has been going on now for the last month. Everywhere I\u2019ve been going for the last month has always had between 250 and 500 people. And when I get there, I\u2019m the one they want to see. We\u2019re kicking ass. The polls? Kickin\u2019 ass!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not polished. I\u2019m sorry, but if you want a daggone, typical polished politician, vote for Conrad Lucas. But people are tired of that bullshit. People are tired of the same ol\u2019 garbage. They want people that are willing to speak out, speak up, be open and honest with them.\u201d\n\nKind of like \u2026 you know who.\n\n\u201cYou know, hey, here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ojeda told me. \u201cDonald Trump, Donald Trump, made everybody excited because he said shit nobody else has ever said. But the difference is, Donald Trump wins, and he ain\u2019t done jackshit to help us. Now let me tell you something about Ojeda. Ojeda won, and I\u2019m telling you right now: I guarantee you there\u2019s not one single freshman damn Democrat, there\u2019s not one freshman friggin\u2019 senator that\u2019s ever made more damn noise than I have and has done more than what I\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI get shit done!\u201d he said. \u201cI just started a friggin\u2019 movement!\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kyle Cheney", "body": "Congressional Republicans sounded alarm Sunday over President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing belligerence toward special counsel Robert Mueller, but they offered no hint about what actions they might take if Trump attempts to fire him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the House can do a lot,\u201d said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Gowdy urged the president to give Mueller the space and resources to finish his probe unimpeded, but he noted that the Senate has more leverage over Trump on this issue because it has a say in his senior administration appointments.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Trump had for months laid off Mueller, who is probing any criminal activity connected to Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 and whether any Trump associates aided the foreign plot. Though he\u2019s attacked senior leaders of the FBI and Justice Department for drawing out a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him, Trump has kept his criticism of Mueller\u2019s probe to a minimum, adopting a legal strategy that a public posture of cooperation with Mueller is the right course.\n\nBut that strategy shifted abruptly in the last few days, following news that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump organization for records. This weekend, Trump has tweeted that Mueller\u2019s investigation is unnecessary and is being run by \u201chardened Democrats.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n                            \n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n\nRepublicans who have helped run their own Russia investigations warned Trump against taking any action on Mueller but stopped short of proposing any efforts to block such a move. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said any decision by Trump to remove Mueller \u201cwould be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Mueller] is following the evidence where it takes him and I think it\u2019s very important he be allowed to do his job without interference,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd there are many Republicans who share my view.\u201d\n\nBut bipartisan legislation intended to block a unilateral move by Trump to remove Mueller has stalled in Congress for months, as Republicans and Democrats have worked to combine competing proposals, and even the sponsors of the legislation have described limited urgency to act. Until this weekend, they pointed to Trump\u2019s deference to Mueller and expressed confidence he wouldn\u2019t go after the veteran prosecutor.\n\nThat changed Saturday when Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called for Mueller to be shut down, arguing that it was contrived by former FBI Director James Comey and based on a dossier provided to the bureau by former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\n\u201cI pray that acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,\u201d Dowd said.\n\n(The FBI\u2019s investigation began several months before the bureau received Steele\u2019s dossier, according to Republican and Democratic House Intelligence Committee memos drawn from previously classified FBI documents.)\n\nTrump followed Dowd\u2019s comments with multiple attacks on Mueller\u2019s probe as well.\n\n\u201c[D]oes anyone think this is fair?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAnd yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nA decision by Trump to fire Mueller could be complex. Technically, the decision falls to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's probe and he's repeatedly expressed confidence in Mueller. Only Rosenstein has the authority to end it, but Trump has the authority to remove Rosenstein in order to install a more pliant official willing to carry out the order, a move that Trump's detractors fear could come without warning. \n\nYet if the new tone toward Mueller is going to motivate Republican lawmakers\u2019 to protect the investigation, there were few indications over the weekend. Leaders of the committees charged with overseeing the Justice Department offered no immediate response to Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nOn behalf of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), AshLee Strong merely said: : \u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\u201d\n\nTheir limited responses came despite renewed Democratic pleas for a bipartisan pledge to undo any actions Trump may take against Mueller.\n\n\u201cI would hope that that would be the result that we would affirm our system of checks and balances and appoint an independent counsel,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a statement.\n\nBut rather than endorse a specific response, several Republican lawmakers with a history of challenging Trump on Russia-related matters fanned out across the Sunday national news shows and pleaded broadly with Trump to back off Mueller.\n\n\u201cI mean, talking to my colleagues all along, it was, you know, once he goes after Mueller, then we will take action,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI think that people see that as a massive red line that can't be crossed. So, I hope that that's the case. And I would just hope that enough people would prevail on the president now: \u2018Don't go there.\u2018\u201d\n\nIn his tirades against the investigations, Trump has latched onto a recent finding by House Intelligence Committee Republicans that they found no evidence that Trump\u2019s campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the election.\n\n\u201cAs the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign,\u201d he tweeted Saturday.\n\nBut two prominent members of the committee contradicted this assessment Sunday, noting that some of the central figures in the investigation have been off-limits to the committee because they\u2019re entangled in Mueller\u2019s probe. Those witnesses include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his deputy Rick Gates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with a Russian-linked professor helped launch the FBI\u2019s initial Russia probe.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGowdy emphasized that the panel\u2019s conclusion was only limited to the 70-plus witnesses they were able to reach. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\" he said.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who ran the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, emphasized that the committee didn\u2019t conclude there was no collusion.\n\n\"What we said is that we found no evidence of it,\u201d he clarified. \u201cThat's a different statement.\"\n\nOthers pleaded with the president to recognize that Mueller\u2019s probe goes beyond questions about collusion and to the heart of Russia\u2019s larger, widely accepted plot to influence the election.\n\n\u201cIt is not a collusion probe. It is much broader than that,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \u201cNow, obviously, once you open that up and you start looking you can go in one direction or another. You go where the evidence takes you and that's what I support.\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

He said he had more than 2,000 pages of the 2,200-page bill left to get through before he\u2019ll decide how to proceed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on page 56 right now, and so I\u2019ve got a few more pages to read.

John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, said of Paul. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows and I don\u2019t think his staff knows \u2026 it\u2019s his right and his prerogative if he wants to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s fine to make a statement,\u201d said Sen.

The latter protest, against a bipartisan spending deal that dramatically increased spending, caused a government shutdown for several hours. \n\nHe's also irked GOP leaders by opposing President Donald Trump's nominees to lead the State Department and CIA this spring. That stand could allow Democrats to block the president\u2019s picks.\n\nBeyond simply annoying other senators, another protest by Paul could disrupt trips some of them who are planning to take overseas as part of congressional delegations. There are multiple so-called \u201cCODELs\u201c scheduled to leave on Thursday night, and they are making contingency plans now in case Paul forces the Senate to stay in on Friday, according to a Republican senator. \n\n\u201cI would hope that he can vote against what he doesn\u2019t like. That\u2019s what I do,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the soon-to-be Appropriations Committee chairman. \u201cI\u2019m sure he sees a purpose, an outlier, a protest. But there are a lot of ways to manifest that.\u201d\n\nThere was no concerted effort at the Republican lunch Thursday to persuade Paul to back down, attendees said. Instead GOP senators concentrated on paying tribute to retiring Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).\n\nSome Republicans hope reporters can shame Paul into giving in. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving that to y\u2019all,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters. \u201cWhatever rights he has, he will decide what\u2019s the best use of them. I know how the movie ends. No matter what he does we\u2019re going to pass this bill and the military is going to get a pay raise.\u201d\n\nSome senators believe that Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) also must be convinced to allow a quick vote. Kennedy is among a bloc of conservatives who loathe the closed process used to write the bill in leaders\u2019 offices, as well as the increase in spending that will increase the deficit.\n\nBut in an interview, he sounded less dug-in than Paul.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably not,\u201d Kennedy said, when asked whether he will hold up the bill. \u201cThey probably have the votes [to pass it]. But I can tell you this: This is the best effort of Congress to borrow and spend us into prosperity. And I\u2019m not going to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nGOP leaders are hoping that the looming recess \u2014 and certainty that the bill will pass, it\u2019s just a matter of when \u2014 will be enough to get Paul not to gum up the works again.\n\n\u201cThere are some unhappy folks, understandably. And they should be, the way this stuff gets done,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut in the end you realize we\u2019ve got to fund the government and it\u2019s kind of an inevitability.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Conservatives have slammed him as tainted with bias. And on Friday night, the Department of Justice fired Andrew McCabe a little more than 24 hours before his scheduled retirement.\n\nThe dismissal from his decades-long home at the department marks an ignominious end to a once-storied career for McCabe, who stepped aside as FBI deputy director in January. That departure came ahead of an inspector general\u2019s inquiry that\u2019s expected to criticize his handling of an October 2016 media report on his wife\u2019s failed run for the Virginia State Senate and his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n But McCabe sees bigger forces at work in the Justice Department inspector general\u2019s inquiry \u2014 which he views as part of a broader campaign to impugn him for his role in handling the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation and his ties to special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s personally devastating. It\u2019s so tough on my family,\u201d he told POLITICO during a wide-ranging interview conducted earlier this month, before his firing.\n\n\u201cBut at some point, this has to be seen in the larger context,\u201d said McCabe, 49, who says he has voted for every Republican presidential nominee until he sat out the 2016 contest entirely. \u201cAnd I firmly believe that this is an ongoing effort to undermine my credibility because of the work that I did on the Russia case, because of the investigations that I oversaw and impacted that target this administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have every reason to believe that I could end up being a significant witness in whatever the special counsel comes up with, and so they are trying to create this counter-narrative that I am not someone who can be believed or trusted,\u201d McCabe added. \u201cAnd as someone who has been believed and trusted by really good people for 21 years, it\u2019s just infuriating to me.\u201d\n\nWhile McCabe has been accused of a lack of candor during the inspector general\u2019s review, it is still unclear exactly what led the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility to recommended his firing.\n\nDuring an hourlong conversation, McCabe declined to comment or elaborate on the accusations against him. He also declined to allege any direct undue influence by President Donald Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the investigation into Russian electoral meddling, which is now helmed by Mueller. But he recalled making what he described as significant moves to bolster the investigation during the tumultuous six weeks between Sessions\u2019 recusal and the May 2017 appointment of Mueller, a former FBI chief who helped McCabe rise through the Justice Department ranks.\n\nMcCabe said that when he was tapped as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey on May 9, 2017, he also learned that \u201cI might not be in the position for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally walked into the building every day expecting that I would be removed from my position before the end of the day,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if that happened, I didn\u2019t want anyone to be able to just walk away from the work that we had done\u201d on the Russia investigation.\n\nOne step McCabe said he took then: pressing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for a special counsel. Another step: briefing congressional leaders in both parties, who get highly classified briefings as the so-called Gang of Eight, about what he was doing.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general was already conducting a sweeping inquiry into the FBI\u2019s decision-making process in closing its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, then disclosing the discovery of new Clinton emails in a message to Congress in late October 2016.\n\nThat inquiry includes a deeper look at the propriety of McCabe\u2019s pre-election actions, and is the biggest of several unanswered questions raised by critics who say his bias should have disqualified him from playing such a central role in politically volatile investigations. In addition to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, McCabe faces an Office of Special Counsel review into whether he violated a law prohibiting government officials from engaging in campaign activity.\n\nAmong the issues under the inspector general\u2019s purview was whether McCabe himself \u201cshould have been recused from participating in certain matters.\u201d Fuel for that political conflagration, which ultimately snuffed out McCabe\u2019s career and now threatens his full pension, stems from Wall Street Journal reports in October 2016 that raised questions about $467,500 in contributions that his wife\u2019s state Senate campaign received in 2015 from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally.\n\nRepublicans have cited the six-figure donation as proof of a pro-Clinton bias by McCabe and the FBI more broadly. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for one state Senate seat,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said last year during an FBI oversight hearing, warning that \u201ca cloud of doubt hangs over the FBI\u2019s objectivity.\u201d\n\nBut McCabe\u2019s most powerful foe may reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d the president tweeted in December. (Trump\u2019s $700,000 number rounds up after adding more than $200,000 that Jill McCabe received from Virginia\u2019s state Democratic Party.)\n\nSome in the GOP got more alarmed when McCabe showed up in politically charged text messages between FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok and bureau attorney Lisa Page, who began a romantic affair before the election and while both were working on issues that included the Russia and Clinton investigations. Mueller later fired Strzok from his team after learning of the texts and another Justice Department inspector general inquiry into them.\n\nIn one text message to Page, Strzok says that \u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s office \u2014 that there\u2019s no way [Trump] gets elected \u2014 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was among those seeing further proof of McCabe\u2019s entanglement in pro-Clinton bias. \n\n\u201cThat sounds very worrisome to the American people that high-ranking FBI agents were actually conspiring to try to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president,\u201d Paul told MSNBC in January.\n\nBut when it came to his wife\u2019s campaign, McCabe went into painstaking detail trying to dispel the notion of impropriety that Trump has burnished into Washington\u2019s consciousness.\n\nJill McCabe had voted for Republicans and Democrats, as her husband tells it, before getting approached about a state Senate bid after giving a quote to The Washington Post for a story about McAuliffe\u2019s tour of the pediatric emergency room she helped run. McCabe told a Post reporter that day in 2014 that the Democratic governor\u2019s pitch to expand Medicaid under Obamacare \u201chas to be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nAfter his wife decided to run, according to McCabe, he \u201cimmediately got counsel from my attorneys, ethics professionals at the bureau,\u201d to determine how to construct a firewall between his FBI work and her campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife has never met Hillary Clinton. Neither of us have ever met any Clinton, for that matter. She was supported by the governor of our state, who happened to be the leader of the Democratic Party in that state.\u201d\n\nBut when a Wall Street Journal reporter called in late October 2016 \u2014 nearly a year after Jill McCabe\u2019s election loss \u2014 to ask about the propriety of his supervising the Clinton email investigation given his wife\u2019s campaign donations, the deputy director authorized the FBI\u2019s then-chief public affairs official to engage with the reporter.\n\nSuch a practice, empowering the sharing of background information that can\u2019t be directly cited, is relatively routine at federal agencies when reporters dig into complex stories. McCabe said he was \u201cone of only three people in the FBI\u201d empowered to approve the sharing of information with the press.\n\nWhen the reporter called the FBI again, asking about allegations circulating around the bureau that McCabe had bowed to Justice Department pressure to wind down a probe of the Clinton Foundation, McCabe said he again authorized the disclosure of more details in order to reorient the story in what he believed was a more accurate direction.\n\nThe prospect that the Journal reporter \u201cwould put this incorrect narrative into his story, I thought, would be very damaging,\u201d McCabe said. He acknowledged the obvious \u2014 \u201cIt would be damaging to me personally\u201d \u2014 adding that \u201cthe more important factor is that it would be damaging to the FBI.\u201d\n\nThat decision to share information about an open investigation, and McCabe\u2019s later handling of inspector general inquiries concerning his actions, forms the bulk of the critical report that propelled his firing on Friday. McCabe had long planned to retire on his 50th birthday, which is Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always imagined this was the point where I could kind of go out proud of things I\u2019ve done and the sacrifices I\u2019ve made and ways I\u2019ve tried to protect this country,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cTo think that my reputation has now been, or will be, eroded by this \u2014 it\u2019s just, it\u2019s mind-boggling. It\u2019s been devastating.\u201d\n\nWhat he wonders about now is the chain of events that began after he testified behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee on Dec. 19. \u201cWithin hours,\u201d as McCabe put it, leaks to the press revealed that he had told lawmakers he could corroborate Comey\u2019s recounting of conversations with Trump before the president fired his FBI director.\n\nAnd soon after that, as McCabe tells it, he heard that the Justice Department inspector general would expedite the portion of its long-planned report on the Clinton investigation that related to him. \u201cFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits,\u201d Trump tweeted on Dec. 23. \u201c90 days to go?!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone from the White House or within the Department influenced the IG,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a striking coincidence. One that can\u2019t be seen outside the context of the president\u2019s own public communications.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report has yet to be released, but McCabe was feeling its black mark on his future even before his firing. When it finally does come out, he predicted, it will attempt to bolster the claim by Trump allies that previous FBI leadership \u201cwas corrupt, was politically biased, politically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201c[For] some people, like the president and others who are intent on undermining me for the reasons I\u2019ve stated, it will be very satisfying,\u201d McCabe said.\n\n\u201cI think most people will be like, \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Mattis spoke first.\n\n\u201cThe postwar, rules-based international order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation,\u201d Mattis told the president, according to two meeting attendees. The secretary of defense walked the president through the complex fabric of trade deals, military agreements and international alliances that make up the global system the victors established after World War II, touching off what one attendee described as a \u201cfood fight\u201d and a \u201cfree for all\u201d with the president and the rest of the group. Trump punctuated the session by loudly telling his secretaries of state and defense, at several points during the meeting, \u201cI don\u2019t agree!\u201d The meeting culminated with Tillerson, his now ousted secretary of state, fatefully complaining after the president left the room, that Trump was \u201ca fucking moron.\u201d\n\nTrump is said to divide the members of his Cabinet into first-tier \u201ckillers\u201d and second-tier \u201cwinners.\u201d Mattis is indisputably a killer, but he\u2019s also something rarer: a sometime loser \u2014 of policy arguments, that is \u2014 who manages to disagree with the president without squandering his clout or getting under Trump\u2019s skin. He opposed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord, decertify the Iran deal, slap tariffs on steel and aluminum, and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He opposes the president\u2019s proposed ban on transgender service members and has reportedly ignored requests from the White House to see plans for a military strike against North Korea.\n\nYet Mattis has been able to present the president with views he doesn\u2019t like without bearing the brunt of his frustration. The departure of H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, was announced Thursday amid rumors that the president is poised to fire beleaguered Cabinet secretaries like David Shulkin of Veterans Affairs and Ben Carson of Housing and Urban Development, and is agonizing over whether to dismiss John Kelly, his chief of staff. Mattis\u2019 name has been conspicuously absent. One senior administration official called him \u201cbulletproof.\u201d\n\nOf the Cabinet selections and staff picks cheered by Trump critics, including McMaster, Kelly and former chairman of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, Mattis is the only one who seems to still have job security. Trump remains as enthused about Mattis, one of his first Cabinet picks, as he was when he tapped him for the job in December 2016, according to several White House aides.\n\nEven his detractors on the right are reluctant to criticize Mattis, a retired Marine general who fought in both Gulf wars and Afghanistan, on the record, either because they are looking to join the administration or because, despite their disagreements, they are happy he\u2019s there. Those critics say privately that Mattis is too cautious and conventional in his thinking, and that he doesn\u2019t sufficiently appreciate the political nature of his current job. But \u201cthey regard him as better than the likely alternatives,\u201d one such critic told me, and consider him \u201ca restraining hand on an otherwise unpredictable and impulsive president.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president sense that on a subset of important issues, he will defer to Mattis, who represents an institution, the military, that the president venerates, and whose status as a combat veteran has earned him Trump\u2019s respect. In contrast with, say, Cohn, who had to contend with the fact that Trump considers himself a business expert, Mattis benefits from serving a president who has never claimed to understand the military or international affairs. White House aides say Trump is cowed and intimidated by Mattis, who peppers his comments with aphorisms and historical arcana gleaned from his extraordinary personal library.\n\nJohn Bolton\u2019s arrival in April as the president's new national security adviser will give Mattis a more ardent and skillful adversary at the National Security Council. Mattis outranked McMaster in military terms and always considered him his junior, even though Mattis is retired. He likely won\u2019t view Bolton that way, and Bolton prizes his ability to corral the bureaucracy for his purposes.\n\nMattis, who was pushed out of the military by President Barack Obama because of his hawkish views on Iran, also sees eye to eye with Trump on plenty of policy matters, chief among them the importance of rebuilding the military. So the secretary of defense has, for example, stayed quiet about the president\u2019s request for a costly military parade, tentatively set for November, but has secured a 10 percent budget increase for the Pentagon. Both White House and Pentagon aides say Mattis has also been more discreet than some of his colleagues when he disagrees with the president, never undermining him publicly except in congressional testimony. \u201cHe makes his recommendations, gives his advice, and it\u2019s up to the president to decide,\u201d says Dana White, Mattis\u2019 Pentagon spokeswoman.\n\nThe president goes gaga for the sort of tough talk Mattis dished out on the battlefield. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than getting shot at and missed,\u201d Mattis has said. He doesn\u2019t run the Pentagon like \u201cMad Dog\u201d the Marine, but White House aides say he has endeared himself to President Trump by continuing to play the part in front of him \u2014 never showing weakness and maintaining the aura of invincibility with which he entered the job.\n\n\u201cMattis has figured out how to play Trump perfectly. He keeps his head down and keeps his face out of the news,\u201d says Tom Ricks, a columnist for the military news site Task & Purpose and the author of several books on military affairs. Mattis, said Ricks, is a \u201cnatural-born killer,\u201d and \u201cTrump, just like dogs smell fear, I think somebody like Trump who has very little natural courage, just smells it.\u201d\n\nMattis has told friends he doesn\u2019t like the nickname he acquired as a battlefield commander, but the fact that he rose to prominence as \u201cMad Dog\u201d made him a subject of immediate fascination for a president-elect whose concept of military valor was shaped largely by the movie \u201cPatton.\u201d (Some might say Mattis bears a passing resemblance to a younger George C. Scott, who played the hard-charging Gen. George Patton in the 1970 film, a Trump favorite.)\n\n\u201cThe secretary of defense is not simply \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis the Marine; he\u2019s really a thoughtful guy,\u201d says Mark Perry, the author of \u201cThe Pentagon\u2019s Wars.\u201d Perry says Mattis possesses a chameleon-like quality that allows him to be the Platonic ideal of a warrior at one turn, and a monkish scholar at another.\n\nAppearing on Face the Nation last May, Mattis played the warrior when CBS News\u2019 John Dickerson asked him, \u201cWhat keeps you awake at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mattis told him. \u201cI keep other people awake at night.\u201d The response delighted the president, who told several White House aides how much he liked it. In private, Mattis talks with the president the same way. \u201cHe\u2019s said similar things several times,\u201d said a former White House aide. \u201cTrump loves it.\u201d\n\nMattis channeled the same sentiment when he was asked, in early February, whether he had any misgivings about the president\u2019s plans for a military parade. \u201cI\u2019m not paid for my feelings,\u201d he replied. \u201cI save those for my girlfriend.\u201d\n\nThe president talks about Mattis in public and behind closed doors like he is still a battlefield commander. Trump asked top-dollar Republican donors last September, for example, what they thought of Mattis and bragged, \u201cThe guy never loses a battle, never loses. Winning record.\u201d\n\nThe irony of all of this is that, by all accounts, Mattis is deeply committed to protecting the military from politics. Some describe him as a conservative Democrat, but he has taken great care to keep his political views private and has been open about his belief that national security should be a bipartisan matter. That said, he has clashed behind the scenes not only with the president but also with some of his closest advisers, from McMaster and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley to Jared Kushner and, before them, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and McMaster predecessor Michael Flynn.\n\nMattis worked from the outset to make diplomatic overtures to presidential aides, including Bannon and Kushner, but also Cohn, Flynn and Flynn\u2019s deputy, K.T. McFarland, all of who could have thwarted his personnel preferences and policy preferences. Mattis\u2019 senior adviser, Sally Donnelly, who left the Pentagon last month, led these diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe work began immediately, on December 7, on the plane to North Carolina, when Mattis formally accepted the president\u2019s nomination as secretary of defense. On the plane ride to the event, Mattis and Donnelly joined the president-elect \u2014 along with Bannon, Kushner, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 and they began a discussion about how Mattis would staff the Pentagon.\n\nDonnelly\u2019s first request was that they be allowed to retain a handful of senior Obama administration officials at the Pentagon, including Bob Work, the Defense Department\u2019s No. 2. The White House acceded. Mattis personally spoke with Bannon about his desire to bring on Michele Flournoy, who was the leading candidate to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s secretary of defense, as his deputy to replace Work \u2014 a move that raised hackles among conservatives both in and out of government. Although Flournoy ultimately withdrew herself from consideration, it was not because of White House objections to her nomination. Likewise, Mattis\u2019 pick to run the Pentagon\u2019s policy shop, retired diplomat Anne Patterson, was pulled from consideration not over White House objections, but because Republicans on Capitol Hill threatened to veto her nomination.\n\n\u201cOn all of the appointments, they were fully open in coming to me and saying, \u2018Hey, these are the guys we think are the best team,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Fine,\u2019\u201d Bannon says. \u201cAnd Trump told me, \u2018Get the general the guys he thinks are the best team.\u2019 They played totally straight with that.\u201d\n\nVisiting Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the second weekend after he was elected, Mattis and the president-elect discussed how to conduct a war against ISIS, which Mattis made clear would \u201cnot be a war of attrition, it\u2019s going to be a war of annihilation,\u201d according to a source familiar with the discussion. \u201cTrump couldn\u2019t get enough of it,\u201d this person says.\n\nAt the same time, Mattis told Trump he disagreed with his views on torture \u2014 Trump had said he was strongly in favor of it \u2014 and, by the time the meeting ended, he seemed to have chastened the soon-to-be commander in chief.\n\n\u201c\u2018He said, \u2018I've never found it to be useful,\u2019\u201d Trump recounted after the meeting. He went on to say that Mattis told him he found it more useful to build trust with terror suspects. \u201cI was very impressed by that answer,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe goodwill Mattis engendered with the White House has given him freedom not only to disagree with the president when he sees fit, but also to run the Pentagon without political interference from the White House \u2014 much to the chagrin, at times, of the National Security Council and others close to the president.\n\nThe Trump administration and the president himself say they are decentralizing what was, in the Obama era, a defense policy run largely out of the West Wing. The president and his advisers have worked to devolve decision-making to Mattis and the combatant commanders who report to him. They have left the American military\u2019s war against ISIS, for example, largely in his hands. After making the decision to strike Syria in April 2017, Trump delegated to Mattis how and when carry out the strikes.\n\nWhen the White House does make requests, national security aides express frustration that their demands often go unanswered. According to two National Security Council officials, Mattis has ignored McMaster\u2019s requests for military options that would have allowed the U.S. to strike Eastern Gouta, in Syria, as well as requests to see plans on North Korea, and two requests for options to strike Iran\u2014one in response to a scenario in which the country sank an American ship in the Persian Gulf, another to the possibility that Iranian-funded Houthi missiles coming out of Yemen could strike the Riyadh airport in Saudi Arabia or the Saudi Aramco oil refinery.\n\n\u201cMattis and Tillerson routinely ignored NSC requests on all sorts of things,\u201d says a second former White House official.\n\nThe Pentagon denies that Mattis has slow-walked any requests for military options. \u201cSecretary Mattis is committed to ensuring our diplomats always operate from a position of strength and options equal strength,\u201d White says.\n\nWhatever tough talk Mattis dispenses to the president is measured and intentional. People close to him say he spends a lot of time thinking about how to communicate effectively, that he is always aware of his audience and that he often asks aides for a pithy quote to drive home a point. Friends and former colleagues say he was well aware of the position in which he entered the administration, uniquely admired by the news media. In contrast with his close friend and White House colleague John Kelly, he has been careful not to tarnish his reputation with inaccurate or ill-advised comments to the news media. He has steered clear of high-profile interviews and avoided making the sorts of off-the-record remarks that have, in some cases, cost his colleagues their jobs.\n\nAccording to a former senior White House official, the president once complained to Tillerson about his news coverage, asking him, \u201cHow come you only get bad stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cMattis only gets good stories,\u201d the former White House official says. \u201cThe progressive media loves him, and it\u2019s one of the reasons Trump loves him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a skill Mattis learned partly from watching his former colleague, then-Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, lose his job eight years ago after mocking President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in what he thought were off-the-record remarks to a Rolling Stone reporter. Before that, Mattis had his own unpleasant collision with the news media when he told a group of Marines at a 2005 event that it was, at times, \u201ca hell of a lot of fun\u201d to shoot people. Unbeknownst to him, cameras were rolling.\n\n\u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cYou know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\u201d The February 4, 2005, broadcast of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show led with the video, with Katie Couric declaring: \u201cFighting words. A decorated Marine Corps general raises eyebrows with these comments.\u201d\n\nThe Marine Corps brass at the time dismissed calls for Mattis\u2019 firing, and Mattis never formally apologized for the comment. But friends say the furor his remarks occasioned was enough to prompt some private reflection. For a Marine who likes to trade barbs, he learned that civilians have different sensitivities and that the news media will play up statements that have been made in jest. He began to choose his words more carefully.\n\nIn the Trump administration, where the president judges his Cabinet officials in large part based on the coverage they generate on television, Mattis has navigated the news media more deftly. He has appeared on just one Sunday morning news show during his time in office and rarely appears behind the lectern at the Pentagon. He seems to take pains never to overshadow the president.\n\nThose close to him dismiss the idea that Mattis has undertaken any sort of conscious strategy to enchant the president. Rather, they say, he is not a politician and simply isn\u2019t interested in publicity \u2014 something, they note, that is hard for many Washingtonians to understand. He has fended off White House requests that he appear on Fox News, and his friends say that\u2019s not out of a concern for self-preservation but because he\u2019s just not interested in being on TV.\n\n\u201cSecretary Mattis doesn't change who he is for anyone, but he is a battle-hardened Marine, who can talk about Thucydides and Chesty Puller in the same breath,\u201d White says.\n\nReporters travel with Mattis as he jets from one foreign capital to another \u2014 Tillerson generated a slew of negative headlines for abandoning this tradition at State \u2014 but he is pointed in his refusal to answer questions that he considers \u201cout of his lane.\u201d That includes the events leading up to a potential meeting between the president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, about which Mattis told reporters, \u201cWhat I want you to understand is that right now every word is going to be nuanced and parsed apart across different cultures, at different times of the day, in different contexts, and right now I want a very straight line from those actually responsible, not from those of us in a supporting or background role.\u201d\n\nMcMaster, in contrast, said last month in Munich that the evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was \u201cincontrovertible,\u201d prompting Trump to slap him down on Twitter.\n\nRunning Central Command under Obama, Mattis learned that presidents are particularly sensitive to what military leaders say about them. If watching McChrystal defenestrated didn\u2019t drive that home, his own experience did when, in 2013, he was ousted by the president for what the White House perceived as his outspoken hostility to the administration\u2019s diplomatic overtures to Iran. Mattis\u2019 frank remarks cost him access and, ultimately, his job.\n\n\u201cHe was shut out of certain discussions at certain points,\u201d a former senior military commander said of Mattis\u2019 experience in the Obama administration. \u201cThey sort of knew what they wanted to do, and they didn\u2019t want to hear what they didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d The commander added, \u201cThey told him, \u2018Thank you, we\u2019ve heard your views on Iran, now go sit under a tree.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was useful preparation for his current role, working for a notoriously sensitive and temperamental commander in chief who has discarded advisers, including Tillerson, for disparaging him privately. Trump never forgave Tillerson for the NBC News report that the former secretary of state called him a moron.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t ever hear Mattis quoted off the record saying Trump is dumb or an idiot \u2014 he\u2019s careful,\u201d said Perry, the military historian.\n\nHis survival in the administration may depend on it.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Elana Schor", "body": "The sanctions call for the Trump administration to produce a list of oligarchs linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a report on the consequences of sanctioning Russia's sovereign debt. | Alexander Nemenov/Getty Images \n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now\n                        \n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n        \n            By ELANA SCHOR\n    01/29/2018 08:26 PM EST\n                    \n\n        \nThe Trump administration informed lawmakers Monday that new Russia sanctions called for in a bipartisan bill passed last year are not necessary yet because the measure is already \"serving as a deterrent.\" \nThe announcement came as lawmakers in both parties nudged the administration to implement a sanctions legislation that passed overwhelmingly in July \u2014 with only five no votes in both the House and Senate.

From that perspective, if the law is working, sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent.\"\nIn addition to the sanctions on entities doing business with Moscow's defense and intelligence sectors, the sanctions law also calls for the administration to produce by Monday a list of oligarchs linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a report on the consequences of sanctioning Russia's sovereign debt. The sanctions law was crafted partially in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nIt remains unclear whether the administration has already released or plans to release the oligarchs or sovereign debt reports that were due Monday, both of which are likely to contain classified information. The State Department spokesperson added: \"Further details are contained in a classified report we have submitted to Congress.\"\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nWhite House deputy press secretary Raj Shah signaled earlier Monday that the administration would take steps to implement the sanctions measure in a timely fashion, telling CNN that the Treasury Department was expected to \"take this process the next step forward.\"\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, declined to indicate the status of the sanctions bill's implementation, noting: \"I am not going to discuss the classified nature of these discussions\" conducted on Monday.\nBut Cardin suggested that he would expect continued communication with the administration on the progress of the legislation, vowing to \"continue to conduct rigorous oversight to ensure that the Russian government\u2019s ability to conduct this trade is significantly impeded.\"\n\"The U.S. should be prepared to impose sanctions when the law is clearly violated,\" Cardin said in a statement. \"The administration should not rest in these efforts and I expect a frequent and regular dialogue on this issue.\"\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Trump will be front and center in every state that helped elect the president, according to GOP senators and strategists, making the case that Democrats are hindering his agenda.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a race in a state like Missouri or North Dakota \u2014 or any of these states \u2014 he\u2019ll be very involved,\u201d said Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the GOP\u2019s campaign arm, who speaks with Trump about political strategy regularly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be actively campaigning for a Senate majority.

But they say they will also deploy Trump in the next tier of swing states that Trump won more narrowly: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. And they expect him to help preserve GOP seats in Nevada, where he narrowly lost, and in Arizona.\n\nIn fact, despite his unpopularity on the national level, Republicans insist there isn\u2019t a state on the Senate map where they are nervous about deploying Trump. Republicans reason that opposition to Trump is already baked into the Democratic electorate. They figure Democrats will be motivated to vote whether Trump shows up or not, so they might as well use him to fire up their base, too. \n\nRepublicans have \u201cgot to have some intensity in our base,\u201d as Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) put it.\n\n\u201cBase mobilization is absolutely essential for victory, and there is absolutely no one better at energizing the GOP base than President Donald Trump,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe president can also help raise gobs of money for candidates, Republicans say. \n\nThere might be a difference between what Republicans say now and what Trump actually does on the campaign trail come September. No one knows where all the controversies swirling around him will end up.\n\nYet even if the GOP does follow through on its full Trump deployment plan, Democrats argue that the president\u2019s personality and popularity among some voters is neither transferable to other Republicans nor enough to put their candidates over the top. Just look at the two latest examples, they say: Trump went all in for Rick Saccone in last week\u2019s Pennsylvania special House election, and before that for Roy Moore\u2019s Senate bid in Alabama.\n\nBoth lost.\n\n\u201cThe pattern here is every time he goes in, they lose,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nStill, Democrats are gearing up what are sure to be personal and vicious battles with the president, and some are already making their case to Trump voters. Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester\u2019s first ad highlighted 13 bills he sponsored that Trump signed into law, even though Tester opposed Trump\u2019s tax bill as well as the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and his attempt to repeal Obamacare.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) similarly has noted 23 bills she has been involved with this Congress that Trump signed. But she doesn\u2019t expect that to spare her from Trump\u2019s scorched-earth campaign tactics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to trash me. Have you met him? His method in campaigns is to trash, in fact, do character assaults on opponents,\u201d McCaskill said. Still, she noted there is an upside: \u201cNothing motivates our base more than Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSeven of the 10 most vulnerable Senate Democrats said in interviews that they were prepared for Trump to come to their states and make a spectacle of them. Few said they expected it to change the trajectory of their race.\n\n\u201cIf it were Ronald Reagan? Yes.\u201d But Trump\u2019s effect is \u201cTBD,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is expected to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott this fall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he will persuade many people. He barely won in Michigan. And frankly [it was] because 51,000 people voted for Jill Stein,\u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.).\n\n    \n\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                             \u201cI don\u2019t think he will persuade many people. He barely won in Michigan,\u201d Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow said of President Donald Trump\u2019s influence on the 2018 campaign trail. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo\n\n                    \n                \n        \n\n\n    \n\nIf there is a wild card to the GOP\u2019s Trump strategy, it\u2019s whether the president can actually focus on promoting their candidates or going after Democrats. At the most recent Saccone rally, the president spent far more of the time talking about himself than the Republican hopeful.\n\nAnother factor: Trump enjoys warm relationships with some Senate Democrats, most notably Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \n\n\u201cHe does like Sen. Manchin,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). \u201cSo it\u2019ll be interesting to see when he does come \u2014 because I know he will \u2014 how he approaches\u201d it.\n\nRepublicans predicted that Trump will be plenty motivated to take on those Democrats because they have opposed so much of his agenda. There was scant Democratic support for Trump\u2019s most controversial nominees and his rollbacks of Obama-era regulations, and none for the president\u2019s tax cuts and Obamacare repeal push.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s learned his lesson. Trump thought there was going to be bipartisan support? Not happening. Supreme Court, [deregulation], circuit judges, tax bill \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty long list,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). \n\nRepublican Senate candidates have already given Trump a bear hug. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) has gone from \u201c99 percent\u201d against Trump to claiming that everything Trump has touched has been \u201cincredible.\"\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) chose to retire rather than try to run as an anti-Trump Republican in Arizona, which is trending away from Republicans. The hopeful to replace him, establishment pick Rep. Martha McSally, has been using Trump in ads.\n\nIn Missouri, a state where Trump received a higher percentage of the vote than any GOP presidential candidate this century, Attorney General Josh Hawley said in his Senate campaign kickoff speech he hopes Trump comes to Missouri \u201coften.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the president's popularity there in those states relative to his national popularity,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) of the top-tier races. \u201cHe\u2019s doing much better.\u201d\n\nEven in Michigan, a state Trump won by less than a quarter of a percentage point, the campaign of John James, an Iraq War veteran who is challenging Stabenow, said he hopes to campaign with the president.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThough Trump may be a major drag on endangered House Republicans from the suburbs, who have to appeal to a concentrated set of moderate voters, statewide races in rural places like North Dakota and West Virginia are a far different story. So top GOP operatives see bringing Trump out to the states as a way to alleviate one of their biggest fears for 2018: that a depressed base will allow Democrats to run roughshod over them even in heavily conservative areas.\n\n\u201cThere are some dangers in running away from the president of your own party,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy it, and you risk alienating your own base.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also said Trump could help Republicans close the fundraising gap plaguing many of their candidates, which is forcing them to rely on outside groups for television ads.\n\nBut the biggest contribution he can provide is the attention that comes with a presidential visit and nonstop news coverage.\n\nIf there is an upside for Democrats in having the president campaign against them in their backyards, it\u2019s that Trump\u2019s presence also brings a reminder that Democratic moderates will be a more effective check on the president than a Republican who would replace them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no mystery that if you want someone who\u2019s going to vote with the president 100 percent of the time and do whatever the president wants you to do \u2026 then I am probably not someone you should elect in North Dakota,\u201d Heitkamp said. That independence, she added, \u201cis not what the president expects from Congressman [Kevin] Cramer,\u201d her opponent.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Ben Sasse tore into President Donald Trump Wednesday for making a congratulatory call to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it \"terribly ill-advised\" and urging staffers who leaked Trump's briefing materials to resign.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican, in a speech on the Senate floor, called Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' refusal to condemn Putin's \"sham\" election this week \"very foolhardy\" \u2014 among the strongest statements made by a member of Trump's own party in the aftermath of Trump's call to the Russian president.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Sasse even turned Trump's signature campaign phrase against him, condemning a \"Russian despot that aims to make Soviet tyranny great again.\"\n\n\"The president of the United States was wrong to congratulate him, and the White House press secretary was wrong to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's reelection was free and fair. It was not. The American people know that, the Russian people know that and the world knows that,\" Sasse said. \"The White House refused to speak directly and clearly about this matter; we were weakened as a nation and a tyrant was strengthened.\"\n\nTrump has hit back amid the mounting criticism.\n\n\"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. \"Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\nSasse never supported Trump's presidential campaign, though he kept a relatively low-profile during the first year of Trump's presidency. Lately, however, Sasse has felt compelled to speak out against Trump's new tariffs, his comments about due process and on Wednesday, about his foreign policy.\n\nOther Senate Republicans have also criticized Trump's call to Putin on Tuesday, notably John McCain of Arizona. But Sasse's comments stand out given his past opposition to Trump and the venue of the Senate floor.\n\n\"The moral responsibilities of the office of the presidency matter. And when we don't affirm these basic truths, it is a failure to who we are. It is a failure to do what we do, and it is a betrayal. Not just to the millions of people who are denied free and fair elections in Russia this week, but it is a failure to people all across the globe who are struggling in darkness against tyrants,\" Sasse said. \n\nSeveral media outlets reported that Trump's briefing materials included a directive not to congratulate Putin, which Trump ignored.

That would give Trump his full wall funding request in the must-pass spending bill and still give him leverage over the DACA program heading into his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nBut Democrats balked, demanding instead that the White House provide a pathway to citizenship to 1.8 million young immigrants eligible under the DACA program, those sources said. The White House might have been open to negotiating further, but Democrats were only willing to entertain the massive wall funding figure in exchange for helping the same number of immigrants that Trump embraced in a proposal earlier this year.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

So the White House is willing to drop its insistence that any immigration deal include major cuts to legal immigration. In the administration\u2018s view, Democrats are being unreasonable in the face of Trump\u2019s flexibility.\n\n\u201cWe sent the minority leaders\u2019 offices a proposal that is pretty fair,\u201d said a White House official. \u201cIt seems like Democrats don\u2019t want to take yes for an answer.\u201d\n\nDemocrats rejected that characterization.\n\n\u201cThe White House proposal gave them everything they asked for while leaving Dreamers in limbo, said a senior Democratic aide. \u201cOur counter offer lined up perfectly with what the president had proposed but of course, he said no to his own deal. Again.\u201d\n\nThere is little incentive for Democrats to give in to Trump\u2019s full border funding request without permanent protections for Dreamers. Their counteroffer was similar to a bipartisan bill that Republicans rejected last month under heavy pressure from Trump and White House officials.\n\nAnd now there is little chance that the outstanding DACA issue will be resolved this week as part of a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Trump\u2019s plan to rescind DACA protections is still tied up in the courts, and with no deadline facing Congress, action this year appears less likely by the day.\n\nRachael Bade, Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

McMaster with the fiery John Bolton as national security adviser, President Donald Trump is freeing himself of the last encumbrances on his increasingly strident unilateralism in world affairs. And the effects of this dramatic change are likely to go well beyond the renewed possibility of U.S. military attacks on both Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs, which Bolton has forcefully advocated. The blunt-spoken Bolton is a Yale-trained expert in international law who has spent a career seeking, ironically, to delegitimize the very idea of international law, and of multilateral action and organizations. Bolton can thus be expected to provide the president with just the intellectual gasoline he needs to ignite new hostilities on any number of global fronts, including an escalated trade war.\n\nDuring his decades in Washington, Bolton has earned a reputation as an uncompromising nationalist hawk. What is less understood is that Bolton arrived at these positions carefully, thoughtfully and consistently, as a militant libertarian thinker who has believed passionately that the United States has surrendered its sovereignty for far too long to multilateral treaties and organizations of all kinds, including the United Nations. In articles and speeches, he has gone so far to as to question whether \u201cglobalism\u201d or international law have any legitimacy under the U.S. Constitution. In a 2000 essay in the Chicago Journal of International Law titled \u201cShould We Take Global Governance Seriously?\u201d Bolton cast the U.S. political debate as a clash between two \u201cparties\u201d\u2014what he called the \u201cAmericanists\u201d versus the \u201cGlobalists\u201d\u2014and that he, as a \u201cconvinced Americanist,\u201d was engaged in a losing battle for America\u2019s very soul. \u201cAmericanists find themselves surrounded by small armies of Globalists, each tightly clutching a favorite new treaty or multilateralist proposal,\u201d Bolton wrote.\n\nBolton then proceeded to attack nearly every major multilateral convention, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming, the Land Mines Convention in Ottawa and the International Criminal Court. Over the years, he also has taken on the Biological Weapons Convention and the World Trade Organization, among other multilateral treaties, and continues to do so. Trump\u2019s new unilateral trade tariffs against China will likely meet with his incoming national security adviser\u2019s approval.\n\nIn what has since become his mantra, Bolton wrote back then that globalism \u201crepresents a kind of worldwide cartelization of governments and interest groups,\u201d and \u201cthe costs to the United States\u2014reduced constitutional autonomy, impaired popular sovereignty, reduction of our international power, and limitations on our domestic and foreign policy options and solutions\u2014are far too great.\u201d This puts him at odds with the 70-odd year consensus that has guided U.S. foreign policy since World War II: that a world of rule-based cooperation rather than atavistic competition is ultimately in American interests, too.\n\nWhat lies behind Bolton\u2019s current stance against any deal with North Korea and the nuclear treaty with Iran is a long and embattled history of infighting that harks back to his unwavering determination to put his theoretical unilateralism into action. Because North Korea is an \u201cimminent threat,\u201d he wrote last month in a Wall Street Journal piece titled \u201cThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First,\u201d \u201cit is perfectly legitimate\u201d for the U.S. to strike without having to worry about any multilateral say-so. Similarly on Iran, Bolton wrote that the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and approved by the U.N. Security Council was a \u201cdiplomatic Waterloo.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure as George W. Bush\u2019s under secretary of state for arms control, and later as a recess-appointed U.N. ambassador, Bolton often enraged U.S. allies with his recalcitrance to the point where both Secretary of State Colin Powell and his successor, Condoleezza Rice, sought to get rid of him. At a meeting in London in November 2003, Powell\u2019s counterpart, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, complained to the secretary of state that Bolton\u2019s belligerence was making it impossible to reach allied agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Powell turned to an aide and said, \u201cGet a different view,\u201d according to a government source at the time. Unbeknownst to Bolton, the aide then interviewed experts in Bolton\u2019s own Nonproliferation Bureau. The issue was resolved only after Powell adopted softer language recommended by these experts on how and when Iran might be referred to the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThat same year, British officials persuaded the White House to keep Bolton off the team negotiating with Libya to surrender its nuclear program. A crucial issue, according to sources involved in the affair, was the dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi\u2019s demand that if Libya abandoned its WMD program, the U.S. in turn would drop its goal of regime change. Bolton was unwilling to support this compromise, and the White House finally agreed to keep him \u201cout of the loop,\u201d as one source put it to my then-Newsweek colleague John Barry at the time. A deal was finally struck without him.\n\nIf nothing else, Bolton has proved unerringly true to his philosophical views. During his tension-filled career at the U.N. and State Department (he once told me in a 2002 interview that he felt surrounded by \u201cenemies\u201d at State), he consistently brooked no interference from allies and fulminated at interference from anyone, especially U.N. \u201ccivil servants.\u201d Before he became U.N. ambassador\u2014in a recess appointment because even many Senate Republicans would not back him\u2014Bolton infamously proposed that if the U.N. Secretariat in New York \u201clost 10 stories, it wouldn\u2019t make a bit of difference.\u201d When the No. 2 official at the U.N., Mark Malloch Brown, suggested that Americans were acting against their own interests when they bashed the world body, Bolton exploded. Malloch Brown, in a speech, warned Americans they could \u201close\u201d the organization if they continued \u201cthe prevailing practice of seeking to use the U.N. almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics.\u201d In response, Bolton declared that Malloch Brown, as a mere \u201cinternational civil servant\u201d rather than a representative of an individual country, had no right to say such things. \u201cIt\u2019s just illegitimate,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nArriving at a time when Trump appears to be giving voice more to his own anti-globalist and unilateralist instincts, Bolton will no doubt encourage these tendencies with a kind of career-vindicating glee. He will lend eager validation to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d views that Trump has embraced since his presidential campaign: that the United States can and should act alone as it pleases. \u201cWe will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism,\u201d Trump said in his defining foreign-policy speech as a candidate in the spring of 2016. \u201cThe nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down.\u201d The language of Trump\u2019s in-your-face inaugural address echoed these views: \u201cFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America First,\u201d he said.\n\nBolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R McMaster, an Army lieutenant general, was no soft-hearted globalist, but he was known to urge the president to be cautious in moving away from multilateral cooperation. Both McMaster and recently ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly were in favor of finding ways to maintain the Iran nuclear treaty, and both their policy views and their occasional differences in style were said to rankle the president. But in John Bolton\u2014and in the incoming secretary of state, the hawkish Mike Pompeo\u2014Donald Trump is likely getting a pair of full-throated cheerleaders.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Edward-isaac Dovere", "body": "Bernie Sanders on Wednesday blamed Hillary Clinton for not doing more to stop the Russian attack on the last presidential election.

But Weaver later acknowledged that the Vermont senator had no firsthand knowledge that this had happened. Weaver said Sanders based his remark on an article published by NBC\u2019s San Diego affiliate over the weekend about a campaign volunteer who claimed to have conducted his own investigation and brought the findings to the Clinton campaign in September \u2014 an assertion flatly denied by a former Clinton campaign aide. \n\n\"A guy who was on my staff \u2026 checked it out and he went to the Clinton campaign, and he said, \u2018You know what? I think these guys are Russians,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. Weaver said Sanders had not verified the information in the article himself before stating it as fact.\n\nThe Sanders statement issued late Wednesday attributed to \u201can aide to Sen. Sanders\u201d added \u201che was using the word \u2018campaign\u2019 expansively to include not only the formal, institutional campaign, but also the broader network of volunteers and supporters of Bernie 2016 across the country.\u201d \n\nSanders went on to indicate that he was at least vaguely aware of the operation that Mueller detailed in his indictment of 13 Russian nationals last week: \u201cWhat Mueller reported, he had more specificity than we\u2019d seen before. Not exactly new.\u201d\n\nA former Clinton campaign staffer said it was nonsense that Sanders' campaign had reached out to Clinton's about potential Russian interference. \"No one from the Sanders campaign ever contacted us about this\u201d \u2014 not in September, and not in \u201cApril and May.\u201d Sanders said in the radio interview that he noticed \"lots of strange things\" during those months in 2016.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cThey were supporting my campaign? No. They were attacking Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and using my supporters against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Sanders said in the radio interview.\n\nAsked why Sanders would blame Clinton for not intervening, Weaver said, \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. They [Clinton's campaign] did have more information.\u201d\n\nAs for Sanders\u2019 claims of having gone to Clinton\u2019s campaign about possible Russian meddling, Weaver said Sanders was \u201cspeaking broadly.\"\n\n\u201cWhat he knows is all from published news reports,\u201d Weaver said. \n\nThe Vermont senator was adamant that he did not benefit from Russian bots urging voters to support him. \u201cI did not know that Russian bots were promoting my campaign. Russian bots were not promoting my campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders has repeatedly condemned President Donald Trump for not acknowledging the Russian attack on the 2016 election alleged in the Mueller indictment and being investigated by congressional committees. But he has refused to say that his campaign benefited from the activities. \n\nMueller\u2019s indictment states that the 13 Russians indicted \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\u201d \n\nAmong the evidence the indictment cites is a message from the day after Sanders and Trump won their New Hampshire primaries. \"Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on \u2018politics in the USA\u2019 and to \u2018use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2014 we support them.),\u201d the document read.\n\nWeaver, who is one of the senator\u2019s closest aides, said repeatedly he wasn\u2019t sure if he should believe the charges.\n\n\u201cThe factual underpinning of that in the indictment is what? Zero,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI have not seen any evidence of support for Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nKenneth Pennington, the campaign\u2019s digital director, said in an MSNBC appearance after the Mueller indictments were issued that he knew nothing of Russian support for the campaign, and Weaver said in the interview he didn\u2019t either. \n\n\u201cTwo dudes sitting in a hole somewhere support Bernie Sanders \u2014 tell me what they did to support Bernie Sanders,\u201d Weaver added later. \n\nSanders\u2019 and Weaver's argument mirrors that of Trump, who has argued in a days-long series of tweets that the Russians were not supporting him. The president has blamed his nemesis, Barack Obama, for not doing enough to stop Russian disruption in the campaign. \n\n\u201cIf all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren\u2019t they the subject of the investigation?\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. He earlier said that \"some 400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer\" could have been responsible for the activities attributed to Russians.\n\nSanders repeatedly refused to say why he didn\u2019t call out Russian involvement during the campaign. Clinton's campaign regularly raised suspicions of Kremlin-backed activity during the home stretch of the race.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSanders said the key point was that he was campaigning hard for Clinton after losing the nomination to her, and \u201cat this point we were working with them.\u201d\n\nSanders has faced questions since Friday about why he has not more strongly condemned the Russian actions that benefited his campaign. On Wednesday, liberal writer Joan Walsh of The Nation tweeted in response to Sanders\u2019 comments about Clinton: \u201cSeriously, this could be the end of Sanders 2020. Someone who cares about him ought to tell him how badly he stepped in it today.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Sanders repeatedly said that the attention should be on Trump\u2019s denials of Russian activity \u2014 an assertion he's made repeatedly since Friday's indictment.\n\nBut in doing so, he floated his own conspiracy theory. \n\n\u201cYou have a president of the United States not saying that [Russians meddled in the election]. What exactly is going on? And you have speculation: \u2018Do the Russians really own him?\u2019\u201d Sanders said. When pressed by the host if he believed that the Russians do have something compromising on the president, Sanders said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But something [is] very weird.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sanders took to Twitter with additional statements. \n\n\"Mueller's indictment provides further evidence that the Russian government interfered in 2016. It also shows that they tried to turn my supporters against Hillary Clinton in the primary and general election. I unequivocally condemn such interference,\" he wrote. \n\nA Sanders spokesman declined to explain the senator's apparent change of heart over the course of the day. \n\n\n                                    \n                                        CLARIFICATION:   An earlier version of this story did not include Bernie Sanders' statement that his own campaign needs to be among those that condemn Russian activity. \n\n                                        \n                                \n\n                            \n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Beyond Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman reiterating on Sunday that Mueller\u2019s investigators should \u201cbe able to do their job,\u201d Republican leaders have remained silent as Trump escalated his attacks on the Russia investigation. The issue didn't even surface at a House Republican Conference meeting or the Senate GOP leadership huddle on Monday evening. \n\nAnd the leaders are expected to refrain from criticizing the president at Tuesday press conferences, even as they say they support an independent probe.\n\nThe muted reaction showed yet again that if Trump is trying to test the boundaries of his opposition to the Russia probe \u2014 some critics fretted during Trump\u2019s weekend tweetstorm that a Saturday Night Massacre-like housecleaning might be in the offing \u2014 he\u2019s unlikely to get much resistance from congressional Republicans until the deed is done.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Cornyn said leaders have sent a back-channel message to the White House that Trump must not fire Mueller. But he seemed resigned to Trump\u2019s deepening attacks on the special counsel: \u201cI can\u2019t control that. That\u2019s his decision. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201c[GOP leaders] probably feel like they don\u2019t need to say it,\u201d added Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has been among the strongest Republicans in pushing back against Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cYou spend your capital on issues where you think you get the best return. And I don\u2019t think anybody in our conference thinks Mueller is going to be fired. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly surprising that Republican leaders are once again shying from a conflict with the president. Ryan once fashioned himself as the moral compass of the Republican Party, but has tamped down his criticism of Trump since the election. His deputy, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), often makes the case that private conversations with Trump have a much better chance of persuading him than any public dispute.\n\nMcConnell, on the other hand, has always shied from publicly criticizing the president \u2014 and doesn\u2019t appear poised to break that tradition now. He's said nothing about Trump's attack on Mueller over the weekend. \n\n\"I don\u2019t know if they know what to say. What do you say? \u2018Stop it\u2019?' said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). \u201cTrump is going to do what he\u2019s going to do.\"\n\nGOP leadership allies argue they\u2019ll gain nothing by rebuking Trump publicly and predict they\u2019d probably only make him angrier and the situation worse if they spoke out against him. They say they\u2019re confident that Trump will not sack Mueller and have reassurances from the White House that they\u2019ll leave him alone.\n\n\"I would certainly hope that the president doesn't intervene in any way or make it difficult for Mueller to complete his work,\" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader. \"I've made no secret of the fact that I'm not a fan of when the president tweets. In this case I'm sure he's venting some frustration. But I don't think it's constructive.\"\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThat\u2019s not going to be enough for Democrats. Some of them want Congress to immediately take up legislation to protect Mueller. Indeed, the party spent the entire weekend and Monday calling on Republicans to, essentially, grow a spine.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan needs to be stronger and so does Mitch McConnell,\u201d said House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) \u201cThe president is testing the waters and\u2026 a muted reaction to what could be another Saturday night massacre is only an encouragement\u201d to fire Mueller.\n\nSome Republicans took to the Sunday morning TV shows to push back on Trump. Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) suggested on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that if the president was innocent he and his lawyer needed to act like it instead of attacking the special counsel like they have something to hide.\n\nBut most of the Republicans who criticized the president were the usual Trump critics, including Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is not running for reelection, and Graham, who warned Trump that firing Mueller would be the end of his presidency.\n\nIndeed, many House Republicans don't want Ryan to criticize Trump. Even Rep. Brian Mast, a vulnerable Republican from Florida, said his leadership didn't need to be more vocal about protecting the Mueller probe. \"Nah, I think we've got enough work around here,\" he said.\n\nTrump in recent months has ignored the advice of some allies suggesting he take a more aggressive stand against Mueller, listening instead to GOP lawmakers and lawyers advising that he not go after the special counsel. But that changed over the weekend, when Trump took to Twitter to accuse Mueller of filling his \u201cteam\u201d with \u201chardened Democrats\u201d and \u201csome big Crooked Hillary supporters.\u201d \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nAnd on Monday, Trump hired prominent Washington attorney Joe DiGenova, who has accused the FBI of trying to frame Trump. \n\n\u201cA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning.\n\nThose comments came after another Trump lawyer, John Dowd, suggested Friday that Mueller end his investigation. The White House distanced itself from Dowd\u2019s comments, but many in Washington viewed his remarks as a trial balloon to gauge how far Republicans would allow Trump to go in taking on Mueller.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee member, said \"I would hope that the president would stop commenting and tweeting on Mr. Mueller.\u201d \n\nBut Collins said she didn\u2019t believe Trump would move to fire Mueller because the probe is overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 who has pledged to protect the investigation absent any evidence of improper conduct. But Democrats warn that Trump could fire Rosenstein, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that Ryan says, \u2018Don\u2019t fire the special counsel.\u2019 But \u2026 they\u2019re almost encouraging\u201d Trump, said House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not discouraging.\"\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

According to excerpts of his prepared remarks shared with POLITICO, Ryan will argue that \u201cwe have up-ended the status quo and are actually improving things for our constituents.\u201d\n \n \u201cA year ago, we came together and talked about all the great things that this new, unified, Republican government was going to be able to do on behalf of the American people,\u201d Ryan will say. \u201cWell, we got to work and we are delivering on that promise. As we advance our agenda and help more Americans reach new heights, you can feel a sense of pride and confidence working its way back into our country.\u201d\n \n That sums up Republicans\u2019 2018 campaign message: that Republicans are better for Americans\u2019 bottom-line than Democrats. They\u2019ll play up tax reform, which has slowly increased in popularity in recent months. And they\u2019ll point to the economy and booming stock market to argue the economy is growing while also touting a recent influx in military spending aimed at protecting the nation.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

He brought in $44 million last year and as of March 1 had transferred $38 million to the NRCC, a new record.\n \n Of course, that\u2019s not the full story of the GOP-led Congress. Republicans were unable to pass a repeal of Obamacare \u2014 something they campaigned on for years. And they\u2019ve also struggled to deliver on Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico, though the latter was never a huge priority for most congressional Republicans. In order to deliver on their budget boost for the Pentagon, they\u2019ve also have to fund Democratic priorities that will increase the national debt, not exactly the hallmark of conservative orthodoxy.\n \n But Ryan \u2014 who has raised more money for the NRCC than anyone else by a long shot \u2014 will zero in on the boxes they\u2019ve checked on Tuesday evening. And his campaign team has expressed confidence that focusing on their economic message is a winning strategy.\n \n \u201cWe need to line up the choice for our constituents and make it clear for them: if you re-elect us, we\u2019ll continue to push this economy higher, we\u2019ll take control from Washington and return it to the states, and we\u2019ll empower people with the freedom and ability to reach their full potential,\u201d Ryan will say. \u201cI know we can tell this story in our districts.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n The message is typical Ryan, who\u2019s known for tuning out Trump\u2019s drama and sticking to policy in his public remarks. He and his team have been encouraging their members to do the same and will soon start traveling to vulnerable districts to help them sell that message.\n \n Ryan on Tuesday night will introduce the president, who raised $30 million at the 2017 annual dinner. This year\u2019s event is expected to shatter that record, per several GOP sources.\n\n With Republicans facing an increasingly daunting task of keeping the House, that payday can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

He had shared a table Saturday night with the world\u2019s wealthiest man, Jeff Bezos, at the annual dinner of Washington\u2019s Alfalfa Club, the ultra-exclusive gathering of the political and financial elite that began as a celebration of Confederate General Robert E. Lee\u2019s birthday. Now, it\u2019s Monday morning and the junior senator from South Carolina is back home, in one of this challenged city\u2019s most challenging neighborhoods, to get a haircut. The dramatic change of scenery doesn\u2019t faze Scott, a man who straddles disparate universes with unusual ease. But he is not without powers of observation. As conspicuous as he was at the Alfalfa dinner\u2014one of the few black faces in the Capital Hilton ballroom\u2014I am all the more so here. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, leaning in, \u201cyou\u2019re about to be like the third white dude ever inside this place.\u201d\n\nThe Quick Service Barber Shop is the aesthetic pinnacle of Forest Avenue; its cream-colored exterior is dressed in red and blue paint announcing the proprietors and proclaiming Hebrews 12:14: \u201cStrive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\u201d That\u2019s easier said than done around these parts. There was a shooting inside the shop a few months back, Scott tells me; his friends urged him to find a new barber. The senator wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Scott got his very first haircut here a half-century ago, courtesy of Charles Swint. His son, Charles Swint Jr.\u2014a minister who took over the family business\u2014is the only person Scott trusts with a pair of clippers. When his white Cadillac Escalade finally pulls up, Swint Jr., a small, salt-and-pepper-haired man wearing a dark three-piece suit, jumps out and grins at Scott: \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d\n\nThe old friends hug and we head inside. A pillar of the area\u2019s African-American community, the shop features aging walls covered in photos, news clippings and other paraphernalia. Two individuals in particular are lionized: Barack Obama, the country\u2019s first black president; and Scott, the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction\u2014and the only African-American ever to serve in both chambers of Congress. Both are children of single mothers, but politically, the pair have little in common: Obama, a liberal Democrat raised primarily by well-off whites in Hawaii before adopting Chicago\u2019s impoverished South Side as his political base; Scott, a conservative Republican who grew up poor in North Charleston, and whose initial ticket to D.C. was punched by affluent voters in the state\u2019s three-quarters-white 1st Congressional District. Still, they are members of a small fraternity\u2014two of just 10 African-Americans ever to serve in the Senate\u2014and both are an immeasurable source of pride for the barber shop and its customers.\n\n\u201cHe took this haircut,\u201d Swint Jr. says, running his fingers over Scott\u2019s newly sheened, oval-shaped head, \u201call the way from Quick Service Barber Shop to the White House.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the senator has spent plenty of time lately at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. When the unified Republican government made tax reform its top priority\u2014after failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act\u2014he emerged as a star player, one of four senators who crafted the legislation and worked alongside the administration to win over holdouts. Scott\u2019s repeat visits to the White House were punctuated by a victory lap on the South Lawn after Congress passed the GOP tax plan. It should have been a crowning moment in his career\u2014not only for the role he played in writing and passing the law, but because he had triumphed in securing bipartisan language in the final product that accomplished a longtime goal: creating \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d across America, with tax incentives offered for investing in poor communities. (He makes a point of noting that both urban and rural areas will benefit.) When Scott took his place at the ceremony on the afternoon of December 20\u2014flanking President Donald Trump, right next to Speaker Paul Ryan\u2014the extent of his influence was on full display.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what everyone saw. Just minutes before Trump invited Scott to speak at the lectern, Andy Ostroy, a HuffPost blogger, tweeted: \u201cWhat a shocker \u2026 there\u2019s ONE black person there and sure enough they have him standing right next to the mic like a manipulated prop. Way to go @SenatorTimScott.\u201d When the event ended, Scott opened Twitter and spotted the comment. He responded: \u201cUh probably because I helped write the bill for the past year, have multiple provisions included, got multiple Senators on board over the last week and have worked on tax reform my entire time in Congress. But if you\u2019d rather just see my skin color, pls feel free.\u201d\n\nThe exchange crystallized the central dilemma of Scott\u2019s political existence. Concerned about narrowing his brand, the senator long has tried to downplay his ethnic exceptionalism and avoid the role of race-relations ambassador for the GOP. And yet Scott, now more than ever, cannot seem to escape being perceived as such. He is not just a generic black Republican in a generic period of history; he is the most powerful and prominent black elected official in America, serving at a time of heightened racial tension and widespread accusations of xenophobia against his own party and the president who leads it. This ensures that Scott wears a target on his back regardless of the issue or crisis at hand. When race is involved, the stakes are even higher, forcing upon him decisions of personal and political identity: Scott can choose to stay silent and be accused of selling out his heritage, or speak out and be defined by his blackness.\n\n\u201cGod made me black on purpose. For a specific reason. It has helped me to help others who have been locked out of opportunity in many ways,\u201d Scott tells me over lunch at a Subway sandwich shop near his home, after the barber visit and a game of pickup basketball. \u201cI am not pretending that this characteristic, this Earth suit that I\u2019m in\u201d\u2014he pinches the skin of his arm\u2014\u201cisn\u2019t being evaluated. It requires a response, or a reaction, to the situations at my level of government. I am fully aware of that. I just don\u2019t want to play a game with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are fixated on my color,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI\u2019m just not.\u201d\n\nYet in the age of Trump, he is coming to terms with an uncomfortable truth: The fixation on his color is a feature, not a bug. No matter his achievements or aspirations, Tim Scott is sentenced to exist in America\u2019s collective political subconscious as a black man first and everything else second.\n\n\n\nUnlike most members of Congress, who rise early, Scott is a creature of the night. A teetotaling bachelor at age 52, he follows an unorthodox schedule: sleeping in as late as possible, then staying up into the wee hours of the morning. He reads, prays, works out, watches movies. But his favorite post-midnight pastime is writing. Scott, a successful businessman and politician in Charleston before coming to Congress in the Tea Party insurgency of 2010, has spent his adult years putting life on pen and pad: his plans for the coming days and weeks; goals for the years ahead; visions of how problems big and small will be resolved and what the future will look like.\n\nScott\u2019s friends universally describe him as cerebral and calculating, someone who speaks very little until he is convinced there is something specific to say. This is particularly true concerning matters of race. Scott mostly kept his head down after first arriving in the Senate in 2013, but has used his megaphone with greater frequency the past two years. One such instance was in July 2016, when he delivered a historic speech from the Senate floor describing being profiled by law enforcement. Another came in February 2017, when Scott took to the floor again, this time to read racially charged tweets sent by liberals attacking him for supporting Jeff Sessions\u2019 confirmation as attorney general. The most recent example was when, after Trump equivocated in his response to the August 2017 white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, Scott said the president\u2019s \u201cmoral authority is compromised.\u201d\n\nThat earned Scott a different sort of invitation to the White House. Reached on his cellphone by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the senator agreed to sit down with the president and explain his displeasure. What ensued was a lengthy, Scott-led seminar on systemic discrimination. He recalls doing most of the talking; the White House released a photo of Trump listening intently to a senator identified as \u201cTom Scott.\u201d When I ask whether he got through to Trump, Scott does not hesitate. \u201cYes. I have no question that I got through to him,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the question is, [does] getting through lead to immediate transformation or change? Or maybe instantly the light comes on, but that doesn\u2019t mean it stays on. Because he\u2019s, what, 71 years old? I don\u2019t think anybody at that age changes in a single conversation, save for one with the good Lord.\u201d\n\nWhen I list Trump\u2019s history of race-based controversies\u2014housing discrimination suits, the Central Park Five, lying about Obama\u2019s birthplace, Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d the Muslim ban\u2014Scott bobs his head up and down: \u201cI am not unaware of the president\u2019s past,\u201d he tells me. A long pause. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s a racist?\u201d I ask. Scott shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t,\u201d he replies. \u201cIs he racially insensitive? Yes. But is he a racist? No.\u201d\n\nEvery Republican lawmaker is on a tightrope these days, forced to weigh his or her moral and philosophical objections to Trump\u2019s presidency against fears of losing influence in Washington and support back home. In Scott\u2019s case, he is suspended above a pit of vipers. Any rebuke of the president exposes him to more lunacy from the right; the senator is a frequent target of menacing calls and messages, and last fall a Georgia man was arrested for threatening to kill him. (\u201cHe said he wanted to be the next Dylann Roof,\u201d Scott tells me, referring to the white supremacist who murdered eight parishioners and their pastor at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston.) Meanwhile, biting his tongue when it comes to Trump\u2019s behavior has opened Scott to unyielding vitriol from the left, with accusations of being an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d or worse. He invariably handles such attacks with elegance and humor: When one Twitter user called Scott a \u201chouse n----\u201d last year, after his vote to confirm Sessions, he tweeted back a one-word reply: \u201cSenate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt weighs on him,\u201d says Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina congressman and Scott\u2019s closest friend in Washington. \u201cThat man goes through things\u201d\u2014his voice cracks\u2014\u201cthe rest of us will never, ever have to go through. And he does it with grace. And he does it with class. And he does it with dignity.\u201d Gowdy apologizes for getting emotional, then continues: \u201cYes, Tim is an African-American who happens to be a Republican. But he\u2019s a lot deeper than a spokesperson on racial issues. ... People want to drag him in when there\u2019s a Charlottesville. And they want to drag him in when the president is alleged to say something about African countries or Haiti. And there\u2019s an expectation that he\u2019s going to have to respond. And he does. But whatever response he gives, it\u2019s never enough for the left. And when he does speak from the heart \u2026 he\u2019s accused of not supporting the president. So he\u2019s in a no-win situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is, however, a silver lining to Scott\u2019s predicament. A deeply religious man who sees the Almighty\u2019s hands on the country, Scott does not believe that God \u201cchose\u201d Trump. But he does believe the \u201cAmerican family\u201d was long overdue for \u201cpainful, ugly, embarrassing\u201d conversations about race and other combustible subjects that have simmered for generations. We are now having them, he says, thanks to Trump and the unsettled national climate he exploited to win the presidency. \u201cI know what fear looks like. I think fear typically comes with anger and hostility. You\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re losing something, that you won\u2019t have something that you used to have,\u201d Scott tells me. \u201cI think people who march with torches\u2014who want to resurrect a thankfully dead part of who we were\u2014these are people who are afraid. Afraid of the changes happening in the country. Afraid of the other man who doesn\u2019t look like them.\u201d He adds: \u201cAnd it\u2019s permanent. That\u2019s why the fear. Something is permanently changing.\u201d\n\nSurveying this societal upheaval, Scott sees \u201ca wave of negative hostility, and a wave of opportunity, all hidden in the same room.\u201d He finds himself hopeful of two things: first, that by virtue of his diverse experiences he is uniquely positioned to help broker a peace between the warring tribes; and second, that if successful, not only will today\u2019s tumult lead to \u201ca healthier country\u201d in the long run, but that those who follow in Scott\u2019s footsteps might be liberated from the racial paradigms he has struggled to transcend.\n\n\u201cAll of it hurts. All of it is painful. I\u2019m not impervious to pain, nor do I seek to be. I\u2019ve asked the good Lord to be able to feel that pain,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to remember what it feels like to be disrespected, to be disgusted with the treatment I\u2019ve received, so that I can make sure other people don\u2019t go through that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are two Tim Scotts. One is gregarious, outgoing, magnetic, confident\u2014the guy with the lightning-fast quips and crazy, colorful socks. But there is an alter ego: People close to the senator describe him as withdrawn and introverted and deeply private, someone more comfortable speaking to 500 people than five. When I ask about this, Scott, a physically imposing man with soft facial features and a barrel-sized chest, leans back in his chair and nods. \u201cI think I\u2019m still a shy kid in many ways,\u201d he says.\n\nScott was 7 years old and living on a Michigan Air Force base when his parents separated. He and his older brother were taken by their mother back to their native South Carolina. Moving in with her parents, Frances Scott and her boys shared a bedroom, and a bed, in the cramped, shack-style home off a dirt road in North Charleston. Scott is certain that he saw his father at least once in the two decades that followed but can\u2019t recall when or under what circumstance. It wasn\u2019t until his late 20s or early 30s, he tells me, that he opened himself to reconciling with Ben Scott Sr. They are \u201cdoing well now\u201d and talk once a month, the senator says, but the feelings of abandonment he felt shaped him in unmistakable ways. \u201cGetting over that takes, for me, so far, 45 years,\u201d Scott says, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cIt just takes time.\u201d\n\nLeft to raise Tim and Ben Jr. on her own, Frances pulled double shifts as a nursing assistant at a Charleston hospital: 7 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon, then 3:30 until 11 at night. Scott was deeply influenced by his grandfather, Artis Ware, who had left a segregated school in the 3rd grade to pick cotton in the fields of Charleston for 50 cents a day. Scott remembers his role model scouring the newspaper each morning, impressing upon his grandsons the importance of reading; it wasn\u2019t until years later that Scott realized his grandfather was illiterate.\n\nScott did not fall into the drug trade like two neighborhood friends who were shot and killed. But he rebelled in other ways. The future senator flunked his freshman year of high school, failing English, world geography, civics and Spanish. His options: repeat the grade or take summer school to pass the courses. Scott\u2019s mother told him he was going to summer school\u2014and finding work to pay the $265 fee himself. Failing the 9th grade was the first of several inflection points in Scott\u2019s young life. \u201cShe was working all the hours in the world to keep us off of welfare,\u201d Scott recalls, \u201cand I just knew I was blowing it.\u201d\n\nHis sophomore year showed improvement, but it was the summer after that changed everything. On break from his movie theater job, Scott walked into the nearby Chick-fil-A and requested his usual: waffle fries and water. The store\u2019s owner, John Moniz, asked about the order; Scott said it was all he could afford. The exchange sparked a mentoring relationship that transformed Scott\u2019s outlook on life. Having grown to a muscular 200 pounds, Scott, the varsity football team\u2019s star running back, had been plotting a path to the NFL so he could provide for his mother. \u201cHe said you can become a business owner, and you can do the exact same things you want to do for your mother through football,\u201d the senator recalls Moniz saying. \u201cHe was selling hope and opportunity\u2014all things are possible no matter where you\u2019re from.\u201d\n\nScott averaged 6\u00bd yards per carry his junior year, and big schools came calling to recruit him. But it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Weeks before his senior year began, after driving his mother to work early one morning, Scott fell asleep at the wheel of her Toyota hatchback, flipping the car, going through the windshield, and mangling his back and ankle. (The ankle still nags at him; Scott mostly hovers around the three-point arc during the hoops game.) He missed most of the season\u2014a source of sadness to this day\u2014and received offers from only a few smaller schools. Scott accepted an athletic scholarship from Presbyterian University in Clinton, South Carolina, where he experienced \u201cculture shock\u201d as one of roughly three dozen black students on a campus of 1,200. But Scott, who credits team sports and the military with doing more for race relations than any other institutions in America, adjusted rather quickly. \u201cThe thing I remember most about Tim was his smile. I would pop him good on the practice field, and he would come up grinning every time,\u201d says John Rickenbacker, the team\u2019s strong safety. \u201cIt would drive you crazy.\u201d Football wasn\u2019t the focus for long: That fall of his freshman year, Scott attended a Bible study on campus and prayed to accept Jesus. Suddenly, athletics were an afterthought. \u201cFootball was my god,\u201d he explains, \u201cand you can\u2019t have two of them.\u201d Scott quit the team after one season and visited Columbia Seminary, wanting to enter the clergy. But it wasn\u2019t the right fit. Instead, he transferred to Baptist College (now Charleston Southern) and moved back home.\n\nScott had caught the political bug in high school; somehow, the freshman flunky became student body vice president his junior year, went to Boys State that summer, and was elected student body president as a senior. Thanks to Moniz\u2019s mentoring, Scott had also developed a keen interest in business, and spent time studying finance and government in college. Tragedy struck during Scott\u2019s sophomore year: Moniz died of a pulmonary embolism at age 38. \u201cIt was pretty hard on Tim,\u201d recalls Brian Moniz, John\u2019s son, who was 14 at the time. \u201cDad had a mission statement that he wanted to have a positive influence on a million people. When he passed, Tim sat down and wrote his own mission statement. He wanted to influence a billion people.\u201d\n\nScott went into insurance sales after college, first with New York Life, then a smaller private company and finally with his own highly successful Allstate agency. All the while he had scanned for political opportunities, and in 1994, one came knocking: a vacancy on the Charleston County Council. Scott knew immediately he would run; what he didn\u2019t know was for which party. He was volunteering that year on the congressional campaign of a young man named Mark Sanford, attracted to his platform of fiscal discipline. But Scott wasn\u2019t sure he himself was a Republican. He visited the local Democratic Party headquarters to tell them he was interested in running for the open seat. \u201cThey told me to get in line,\u201d Scott laughs. He went straight to the GOP headquarters. \u201cThey said, \u2018You probably won\u2019t win, but heck we\u2019d love to see you run.\u2019\u201d And just like that, Scott was a Republican. \u201cAccess to opportunity is my No. 1 issue,\u201d he says by way of explanation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what your title is; your mission is the same.\u201d\n\nThe newcomer had a natural feel for politics. He wound up serving on the council for 13 years, including multiple stints as chairman, earning a reputation for his pro-business sensibilities and consensus-building style. \u201cIt was interesting that he was an African-American Republican, but you know, he didn\u2019t approach his job on the county council in a partisan manner,\u201d says former Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, a legendary Democrat who held office for 40 years. \u201cHe was very well-liked on the council and enormously popular in the community. He was easy to work with and easy to like. And it seemed we were usually on the same side of issues.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s promising career nearly ended before it began. While serving his first term on the council, he ran and lost a race for state Senate; a boilerplate Republican on most issues, he took the unpopular stance of removing the Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol. It was also during that campaign he began attending Seacoast Church in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy, overwhelmingly white suburb of Charleston. There he met Pastor Greg Surratt, who became Scott\u2019s close friend and spiritual adviser. Scott was reelected to the council, but confided to Surratt that he was losing interest in politics\u2014and wanted to go to seminary. Surratt allowed him to speak at the church soon afterward. Scott says he was \u201csweating up there, trying to do too much\u201d to impress the congregation. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you today that he applied and didn\u2019t get the job,\u201d Surratt laughs. \u201cBut I told him, \u2018I believe that you have a calling to politics, and that\u2019s where you can serve the best with your life.\u2019 As a pastor, I think he would have been very good. But as a politician, he is excellent.\u201d\n\nWalking away from the ministry for a second time, Scott renewed his focus on politics, building a sprawling base of support across the county over the ensuing decade. When he launched a second campaign for the Legislature, in 2008, he easily won a House seat in the affluent exurbs of Charleston. Even before his swearing-in, Scott began preparing a bid for lieutenant governor in 2010. He quickly became the favorite, raising nearly $300,000 for the race. But it wasn\u2019t a natural fit. Scott kept hammering national issues\u2014the debt and deficit, Obamacare, military readiness\u2014that weren\u2019t relevant to the office he sought. Friends urged Scott to run for Congress, but he refused; a GOP incumbent, Henry Brown, represented the 1st District.\n\nWhen Brown abruptly retired in January 2010, Scott\u2019s advisers told him to pounce. It was a no-brainer. But not to him. Scott admits to being a homebody; he doesn\u2019t like boarding weekly flights to D.C. Moreover, he recalls, \u201cThere were these behemoths in the race.\u201d The loaded field included Carroll Campbell III, son of the state\u2019s iconic former governor, and Paul Thurmond, son of the famous senator and segregationist Dixiecrat. Scott, a self-made insurance salesman from North Charleston, was fretful. He prayed and prayed, he says, but received no guidance. Yet for reasons he today cannot articulate\u2014other than pressure from friends\u2014Scott ultimately joined the race.\n\nIt took a toll on his personal life. \u201cAs a poor kid growing up, the most important thing for me to do was take care of my mom. And until I had that accomplished, starting a new family was just not an option for me,\u201d he explains. Finally, in his early 40s, Scott began looking to settle down. But just as things got serious with a girlfriend, the 1st District seat opened\u2014and it ultimately became clear that marriage and Congress would not mix. Scott, who is known to dote on the children of his colleagues and staffers\u2014and tells me he always wanted six of his own\u2014says he struggles with regrets at having prioritized politics over love. \u201cBut I think in the right time, I will meet Mrs. Right, and she\u2019ll want to have a couple kids,\u201d he smiles. \u201cOr she ain\u2019t Mrs. Right. Right?\u201d\n\nOther than the failed romance, everything worked out: Scott placed first in the nine-way primary but failed to hit 50 percent and wound up in a runoff with Thurmond. The headlines wrote themselves: Black Republican vs. Strom Thurmond\u2019s Son. But the candidates, former colleagues on the council, refused to engage in such narratives, even as the famously dirty and race-baiting South Carolina political underbelly demanded them. \u201cThe thing about Tim I\u2019ve always appreciated is it\u2019s never him trying to point out how unique he is as an African-American Republican. He didn\u2019t want to discuss that,\u201d Thurmond tells me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to monopolize or cash in on that.\u201d\n\nHe hardly needed to. Scott, reading the populist mood in 2010, built his candidacy around two Tea Party mandates\u2014eliminating earmarks and enforcing term limits\u2014and bludgeoned Thurmond for disagreeing. He received national endorsements from the Club for Growth and Sarah Palin, as well as conspicuous financial backing from two members of the House Republican leadership, Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy. Scott demolished Thurmond in the runoff and packed his bags for Washington.\n\n\n\nIf Scott is sensitive to allegations of being a political \u201cprop,\u201d it\u2019s because upon arriving on Capitol Hill he was sometimes treated like one. The freshman congressman was not naive; he recognized the yawning racial disparity in the GOP, and was warned to be wary of the support he\u2019d received from Cantor and McCarthy. For the same reason he declined to join the Congressional Black Caucus\u2014not wanting to be viewed through the prism of race\u2014Scott planned to keep a low profile in the GOP. \u201cTim was very careful. He didn\u2019t want to be used by the leadership,\u201d recalls Nick Muzin, Scott\u2019s then-chief of staff. \u201cHe wanted to speak up on things he cared about. He didn\u2019t want to be used as a spokesman for the party.\u201d\n\nThat proved difficult. \u201cTim was far and away the best-known member of that historically large class,\u201d says Gowdy, who arrived with Scott in January 2011, knowing him only as the guy who dropped out of the lieutenant governor\u2019s race. \u201cTim was like Elvis Presley. Leadership wanted him all the time to be the party\u2019s face on television. It was incredible pressure on someone brand new to Congress.\u201d One night as freshmen, Gowdy remembers, he met Scott\u2014still more of a colleague than a friend\u2014for dinner. He looked \u201cfrazzled\u201d and \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Gowdy could see the strain. \u201cYou have earned every bit of capital you have, politically,\u201d Gowdy told him. \u201cDo not let anyone else spend that capital.\u201d They were inseparable after that; the two men dine together every night Congress is in session, and they recently co-authored a book, Unified, that publishes in April.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just one party seizing on Scott\u2019s sudden prominence. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how the most racially insensitive people I have encountered are white liberals who are stunned and dismayed that there can be someone who looks like me who doesn\u2019t fit their mold,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Democrats want to use my color against the Republican Party. And the Republicans want to\u201d\u2014he breaks into a broad smile, cocking his head sideways\u2014\u201cemphasize my complexion in ways that say that we are not a party that is bigoted.\u201d\n\nAs Scott pulled back, sick of the unwanted attention, Muzin recalls a GOP lobbyist calling him to express concern. Allen West\u2014the other black Republican congressman in Scott\u2019s class, a loose cannon with a penchant for provocative commentary\u2014was becoming a fixture on Fox News. \u201cHe said, \u2018You guys are falling behind. Allen West is the black Republican,\u2019\u201d Muzin chuckles. \u201cAnd I remember thinking, \u2018Tim\u2019s trajectory is much longer than Allen\u2019s.\u2019\u201d Sure enough, West lost his reelection bid in November 2012. A month later, before Scott had even completed his first term in the House, he was appointed by Governor Nikki Haley to replace Senator Jim DeMint, who had resigned to become president of The Heritage Foundation.\n\nMuch ink was spilled on the symbolism: South Carolina\u2019s Indian-American governor bulldozing a major racial barrier on behalf of Scott, making him the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction. What received less attention was the reality that Scott, having held public office for more than 15 years and developed deep relationships and policy expertise, was considered on merit to be the obvious choice. \u201cIt is very important to me, as a minority female, that Congressman Scott earned this seat,\u201d Haley said when announcing his appointment. The five years since have done nothing to change that perception. \u201cHe\u2019s the perfect package,\u201d says Sanford, who was Haley\u2019s predecessor, and who ultimately won back the seat in his old congressional district that Scott vacated. \u201cHe's a breath of fresh air in a place that at times can be fairly dark. He\u2019s a person who in profound ways walks his faith. He\u2019s likable. He\u2019s affable. You get some people who are policy wonks but they frighten you or bore you; he does neither. He presents well on camera. There\u2019s incredible relatability to him. He\u2019s just as close to a god, politically, as you can get back home.\u201d\n\nOf course, Scott heard the whispers\u2014and in some quarters, the grumbling\u2014about his appointment being an affirmative action hire. It made him all the more determined not to give them ammunition. In the absence of words, Scott tried to lead with actions, assembling one of the most diverse offices on Capitol Hill, led by his black, single-mother chief of staff. He also poured time and resources into mentoring programs in distressed communities back home. But his silence on major cultural events grew more and more deafening. \u201cScott has said little on the racial controversies and civil rights issues of the last four years, from the killings of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis to the death of Michael Brown and the explosion of anger and rage in Ferguson,\u201d Jamelle Bouie wrote in Slate in November 2014. Soon enough, circumstances made the senator\u2019s reticence unsustainable.\n\nIn April 2015, Walter Scott\u2014no relation\u2014was fatally shot in the back by a policeman in North Charleston; the senator was shaken by the hometown incident and called for the officer\u2019s prosecution. (In 2017, Scott introduced the Walter Scott Notification Act, which would create a database of police shootings.) Ten weeks after Walter Scott\u2019s murder, Roof opened fire at Emanuel AME Church; the church's pastor and the senator\u2019s friend, Clementa Pinckney, was among those gunned down. Scott, who still keeps his final text message exchange with Pinckney, delivered an emotional address on the Senate floor. (\u201cGod cares for His people,\u201d Scott said, quoting the son of one of the victims he had spoken with. \u201cGod still lives.\u201d) The next summer, in July 2016, amid another rash of police shootings, Scott returned to the Senate floor to describe how he himself had been victimized by racial profiling\u2014being pulled over seven times in a single year as an elected official, and being forced to show identification to Capitol Police despite wearing his members-only Senate pin. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to sit back and deny these things are happening, until they\u2019re happening to you,\u201d says Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a close friend, who knew about the profiling incidents but never expected them to be shared from the Senate floor. \u201cAt the core of his argument, we have a significant percentage of people in this country who feel they\u2019re treated differently because of their background or their color. And we need to talk about it. No one else could have done that. No one else could have given that speech.\u201d\n\nUntil Trump arrived on the scene, Scott was content to pick and choose his spots, speaking on race authoritatively enough to command attention but infrequently enough to avoid being typecast. If threading that needle was difficult before, it now appears impossible. The question is no longer whether Scott is the GOP\u2019s dominant voice on race relations, but whether he can preserve credibility in both camps: engaging minority communities while simultaneously partnering with an administration they distrust, all in the pursuit of maintaining an influence over policies he believes will positively affect them. It might sound duplicitous, but Charlottesville offers a potential blueprint. If Trump was going to get a good photo-op out of their White House meeting, Scott, after skewering the president, was going to get something, too. When Trump asked what he could do to help the situation, the senator pitched his \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d idea, and the president instantly offered his support. That language, Scott tells me, probably would not have become law without the administration\u2019s backing.\n\nEven so, these dynamics are fragile and fluid. Many Republicans have spent the past year accommodating Trump at all costs to protect themselves back home. Scott\u2014who just won a six-year term in 2016, and has struggled to mask his irritation with the White House\u2014won\u2019t be one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough position to be in,\u201d Sanford tells me. \u201cBecause at some point, given the pattern, the president\u2019s going to say something so outlandish that it\u2019s going to force Tim to say, \u2018No more. I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe senator is running behind. It\u2019s a Wednesday morning in late January, and he is scheduled to join a colleague in addressing the United States Conference of Mayors. When Scott enters the room, searching for his seat at the roundtable, he stops to slap hands with Cory Booker. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the Big Bald Black Man Caucus of the United States Senate,\u201d his colleague from New Jersey announces. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a third!\u201d Scott bellows out, the room breaking up in laughter.\n\nThere is truth in jest: Despite ideological differences, Scott and Booker have become good friends in no small part due to shared expectations, if not shared experiences. (\u201cCory graduated cum laude,\u201d Scott tells the crowd of his Ivy-educated colleague. \u201cI graduated thank you law-dy!\u201d) Along with Democrat Kamala Harris of California, they are the only three African-Americans in the Senate, and feel the obligation of growing that number. The burden is especially heavy for Scott, given his party\u2019s dearth of nonwhite voters and the pressure on him to engage the black community without alienating the GOP\u2019s white base. \u201cI get fewer chances to mess up than other people,\u201d he tells me. \u201cTherefore, realizing that my reaction is something that will either create more opportunities for people like me or reduce opportunities for people like me, I have to be very aware of how [it] will be taken by a larger audience.\u201d\n\nThis is why, as much as Scott loathes being seen as the token black Republican, his only hope is serving well enough, long enough, to see the day reinforcements arrive and stereotypes fade. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the cutting edge of these things, you\u2019re going to be a prop. Now the question is, whether or not you conduct yourself in such a way that the guy or gal coming behind you won\u2019t be a prop,\u201d says Jim Clyburn, the longtime Democratic congressman and the only other African-American in South Carolina\u2019s delegation. Clyburn tells me, in a bit of serendipity, that just before our talk he was on the phone with Utah\u2019s Mia Love\u2014a black Republican elected in 2014\u2014planning an event with her in Salt Lake City. \u201cI think that she is much more comfortable being a Republican in the Congress because Tim handled being a prop in a way that makes it easier for her,\u201d Clyburn says. \u201cAnd she will make it easier for other people.\u201d\n\nScott likes to use the phrase \u201cfrom cotton to Congress,\u201d describing how his grandfather, a product of the Jim Crow South, lived long enough to see his grandson elected to federal office. \u201cI watched him eulogize his grandfather, and to see the tears running down his face\u2014there was a lot of sacrifice, tribulation, suffering that happened in his family,\u201d says Al Jenkins, a longtime friend who runs Scott\u2019s community outreach and mentoring programs in the Charleston region. \u201cHe\u2019s there on the shoulders of all of those generations of Scotts that sacrificed today so that maybe somebody will be able to break through tomorrow. And he carries that with him every day. He is constantly reminded, \u2018You are the one. You are the breakthrough.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the truth is, for all of his trailblazing, Tim Scott is also a living testament to a lack of progress. Breaking through isn\u2019t enough\u2014not for him. He sees minorities lagging on the socioeconomic spectrum. He sees that nativism and prejudice are alive and well. He sees entire communities undereducated and overincarcerated. He sees decades of momentum on race relations stalled. He sees people continuing to judge him by the color of his skin rather than the content of his character. Sometimes he struggles to hold back; all he wants to do is unleash a lifetime of exasperation and say what he really thinks\u2014about Trump, racism, law enforcement and the hypocrisy in both parties. The only thing holding him back is the feeling that now it\u2019s his turn to sacrifice.\n\n\u201cI've been frustrated. And angry. Man,\u201d Scott says, looking downward, his voice trembling with emotion. He looks up. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to be angry. And too natural. And also, too unproductive for me. But I get it. I get it. I\u2019m not at a point where my grandfather was. He could say nothing. He had to eat his anger. Or the next generation, who harnessed their anger and led to marches. I\u2019m on the inside track. I have a very different responsibility. It cannot be about me.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Nussbaum", "body": "Even among self-identified Republicans and conservatives, President Donald Trump came in 40th.\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    Trump comes in last in expert presidential rankings survey\t\t\n                        \n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n        \n            By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM\n    02/19/2018 12:52 PM EST\n                    \n\n        \nBarack Obama and Ronald Reagan are up, Bill Clinton is down and Donald Trump is off to a historically bad start \u2014 and the greats, meanwhile, remain the greats.\nThat was the finding of the 2018 Presidents  Executive Politics Presidential Greatness Survey, released Monday by professors Brandon Rottinghaus of the University of Houston and Justin S.

Bill Clinton, meanwhile, fell from 8th to 13th \u2014 perhaps as a result of heightened attention to sexual misconduct in the midst of the #MeToo movement. \nTrump came in dead last.\nThe top seven remained unchanged, with Abraham Lincoln holding the top spot, followed in order by George Washington, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower.\nEven among self-identified Republicans and conservatives, Trump came in 40th out of 44 (while Trump is officially the 45th president, the survey did not count Grover Cleveland\u2019s non-consecutive terms separately, so the ranking runs from 1-44). \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n                    \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Reagan, on the other hand, who ushered in the modern era of small-government conservatism, receives high ranks from conservatives and Republicans but falls in the teens for Democrats and liberals. Obama sees the reverse.\nTrump closely follows James Buchanan, America\u2019s 15th president, who presided over the increasingly explosive national debate over slavery, and who saw the Union split apart after the election of his successor, Lincoln.\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Mike Conaway (R-Texas), announced on Monday that last week\u2019s session with Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, was the final witness interview of the investigation. The investigation included an examination of whether associates of President Donald Trump assisted the Russian effort, but Republicans say they\u2019ve concluded that there was no cooperation.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n \u201cWe will now be moving into the next phase of this investigation, working with the minority on a report to give the American people answers to the questions they\u2019ve been asking for over a year,\u201d Conaway said in a statement. \u201cWith the 2018 primary elections already underway and just 238 days until the midterm elections in November, it\u2019s important that we give the American people the information they need to arm themselves against Russian attempts to influence our elections.\u201d\n\nThe Republican report \u2014 which has yet to be shared with Democrats on the committee \u2014 differs from the intelligence community\u2019s assessment last year that the Russian effort was intended to boost Trump\u2019s campaign and harm Hillary Clinton's.\n\nRather, the GOP\u2019s 150-page report finds that Russians intended to \u201csow discord,\u201d faulted a \u201clackluster\u201d effort by the Obama administration to combat Russian cyber activities, and raised questions about contacts between members of the intelligence community and the media.\n\nDemocrats have sharply disagreed with that suggestion, and they\u2019re expected to produce a report with a different conclusion in the coming weeks. All told, the committee\u2019s work is likely produce competing narratives that do little to resolve the white-hot worries about Russia\u2019s capacity to interfere in future elections. \n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Democrats, though, have insisted that Republicans failed to show even a remote interest in getting straight answers from top Trump allies, like the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and the president\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the panel, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and the rest of the committee Democrats have complained that committee Republicans have failed to force witnesses to answer questions, to subpoena documents or to even attempt to look into potential financial entanglements among Trump, his associates and Russia.\n \n \"By ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the president over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly,\" Schiff said on Monday. \n\n\"In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the special counsel, or continued investigative work by committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate,\" he continued. \"And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.\u201d\n\nIt also appears that Conaway ended the investigation without ever convening a meeting with Schiff and Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who head up the Senate panel looking into Russian interference. Though Conaway had suggested in December that he hoped to align his committee\u2019s factual findings with the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, a source familiar with the inquiries said no meetings had occurred.\n\nThe decision to end the House investigation essentially cedes central questions to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading a parallel probe on Russian interference. That investigation has already led to the indictment of another former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and former national security adviser Mike Flynn, as well as guilty pleas from two other campaign aides. \n\nConaway\u2019s decision comes despite recent reports suggesting that a new angle in Mueller\u2019s investigation had picked up steam: questions surrounding the January 2017 trip by Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Seychelles, where he met with the leader of a Russian-government-run investment fund. Reports suggest that investigators believe Prince was acting as a representative of the Trump transition team, but Prince told the House Intelligence Committee that wasn\u2019t true.\n\nThose entanglements have prevented House investigators from accessing Manafort, Flynn and other potentially pivotal witnesses to the activities of the campaign.\n\nBut the investigation had been marred from its early days by steadily rising hostility between Republicans and Democrats, a dynamic that grew into a crippling distraction. Members accused one another of leaking sensitive information from inside committee hearings, and the panel was sidetracked for weeks as Republicans took unprecedented steps to disclose classified information impugning the integrity of FBI agents involved in the early days of the Russia investigation.\n\nDemocrats have raised alarms in recent weeks amid indications that Republicans were moving quickly to curtail the inquiry. Schiff issued a list of subpoena requests Democrats had made that had gone ignored by Republicans on the committee. Among them: demanding more details from Donald Trump Jr. about the fallout from news that he\u2019d met with Kremlin-connected Russians in Trump Tower during the campaign; travel, phone and banking records from Cohen; and Hicks, who declined to discuss her time in the White House and certain elements of the transition period.\n\nRepublicans, though, have argued that Democrats are stringing the investigation along to generate harmful headlines about members of the Trump team amid accusations they courted Russian help during the campaign. GOP members say they\u2019ve seen no conclusive evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government.\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Though there have been the typical suggestions that she was \u201csimply following orders,\u201d Glenn Carle, a former CIA interrogator, has described her as \u201cone of the architects, designers, implementers and one of the top two managers of the [Enhanced Interrogation Techniques program] and a true believer, by all accounts, in the \u2018Global War in Terror\u2019 paradigm.\u201d\n\nThis does not sound like someone who was simply \u201cfollowing orders.\u201d This sounds like someone who was giving them, which I would argue is far worse.\n\nNor is it debatable that she was present in Thailand when Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was waterboarded three times in late 2002.\n\nFurther, multiple accounts have discussed her involvement in destroying video documentation of the torture program. Think about that for a moment.

But there was clear frustration with the U.S. president\u2019s evidently limited grasp of complex trade issues, his allegations of unfair practices (which the EU disputes) and the overall tumult and unpredictability emanating from Washington.\n\nThe EU has developed an arsenal of retaliatory measures targeting American goods in politically sensitive states.\n\nFollowing a pattern set by other disagreements with Trump \u2014 over his withdrawal from the Paris climate change accords; his criticism of the Iran nuclear deal; and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, which the EU opposed \u2014 European leaders tried to dial down the tension, and to avoid inciting the combustible American president.\n\nTrump upended the EU leaders\u2019 quarterly summit on Thursday with cryptic comments that left Brussels wondering if indeed it had been granted the promised exemption to his tariffs.\n\nDiscussion among the 28 leaders of a potential trade war \u2014 and the EU\u2019s battle plan for retaliation \u2014 was pushed back twice on the summit agenda, first from the Thursday afternoon to dinner, and then from Thursday evening to Friday, because of uncertainty in Washington. Trump held a news conference where he slapped new penalties on China \u2014 which sent U.S. markets into a tailspin \u2014 talked about \u201cnegotiations\u201d beginning with the EU and repeated his complaints about unfair trade practices by Europe. But he never made clear an exemption had been granted.\n\nThat clarity came shortly before midnight Brussels time and received a mixed reception. Officials were glad to be granted an exemption, meaning the EU fared better than other allies such as Japan, but European leaders interpreted the May 1 expiration date as a threat.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on the final day of the European Council leaders\u2019 summit | Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was the first to use the gunpoint imagery. \u201cThis is maybe also a way to exert a strong pressure on the European Union and to start a kind of negotiation with a type of revolver at our head,\u201d Michel said as he arrived at the summit Friday.\n\nIn the European Council\u2019s formal conclusions, leaders once again rebuked Trump over the tariffs, which they assert violate World Trade Organization rules and cannot be justified, as Trump has claimed, by national security imperatives.\n\n\u201cThe European Council regrets the decision by the United States to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum. These measures cannot be justified on the grounds of national security, and sector-wide protection in the U.S. is an inappropriate remedy for the real problems of overcapacity, on which the EU already has offered the U.S. its full cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe leaders also reiterated their right to respond if Trump ever imposes the tariffs. The EU has developed an arsenal of retaliatory measures targeting American goods in politically sensitive states, including Kentucky bourbon, made in the home state of the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Harley Davidson motor bikes, made in Wisconsin, the home of the Republican house speaker, Paul Ryan.\n\nAt the summit\u2019s closing news conference, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he was happy Trump finally seemed to understand that the EU negotiates trade policy as a 28-member\u00a0 bloc.\n\n\u201cWhat the president was saying yesterday is recognizing that the European Union is an entity,\u201d Juncker said, noting the granting of a temporary exemption. \u201cIt cannot be divided into 28 parts.

If this were a serious undertaking, congressional investigators would be collaborating with the Department of Justice, FBI and relevant Senate committees to save America from the threat within. But we\u2019re no longer dealing in the realm of facts and reason when it comes to grave matters of security and justice. We are, at Donald Trump\u2019s behest, fully engulfed in a narrative explicitly designed to impugn and destroy the credibility of the law enforcement agency tasked with investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe memo in question is one written by the staff of Republican Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes\u2014the same Nunes who recused himself from the Russia investigation last year amongst allegations that \u201che made unauthorized disclosures of classified information.\u201d Now, Nunes is at it again. This time with a four-page classified memo that, if you believe what those who have read it say, shows an Obama-era FBI rife with corruption and engaging in eye-popping abuses of power. The details of what the memo says have been kept private, because they are classified. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill and beyond from crowing about the allegedly shocking memo since mid-January, demanding it be released to the public and spawning a viral hashtag, now used by everyone from Donald Trump Jr. to Sean Hannity and Julian Assange. After the House voted on Monday to do so, House Speaker Paul Ryan made a statement in favor of the decision. Now, the matter is in the president\u2019s hands.\n\nBut really, at this point, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the memo says. Prompted by Trump, his allies on Capitol Hill and in the Trump-affirming media universe, millions of Americans have been led to brainstorm all the various ways faceless bureaucrats embedded in the government could be working to undermine Trump. The entire American political media complex is consumed with speculation about what may be in the memo\u2019s contents. We\u2019ve all been sucked into a story we know probably isn\u2019t true. And, there\u2019s not a thing we can do to stop it. The president has already claimed two scalps with his shameless bullying, rumor mongering and conspiracy peddling: Former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. And it\u2019s happening all over again. With #Releasethememo, the FBI has already been accused of a multitude of various crimes without ever being given the chance to answer or explain.\n\nThe #ReleasetheMemo campaign bears all the classic hallmarks of a uniquely Trumpian ruse. Throughout his career as a New York real estate mogul and media star Trump has stumbled upon a foolproof way of trapping people into his web of lies. He always begins by casting vague aspersions about his target, in this case, the law enforcement networks investigating him. Recall how news reports of the now well-known and controversial dossier prompted him to ask, \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d Or how he compared the surveillance of campaign associates, such as Paul Manafort and Carter Page, to \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and \u201cNixon/Watergate.\u201d Nevermind that his actions more closely resemble those of Nixon during Watergate than anything undertaken those investigating him. Trump wanted his followers to believe one thing and one thing only: A massive conspiracy was underfoot to undermine his presidency, and he\u2019s been peddling this particular theory for well over a year now.\n\nNext step: Rather than answer any questions directly about the matter, Trump advances his narrative, often while denying any responsibility for it. His statement to NBC\u2019s Lester Holt about firing Comey is a classic example. \u201cAnd, in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election they should have won,\u201d he said. In other words, he fired Comey because of the Russian investigation, but denied there was any wrong doing with Russia. This tactic has similarly played out with #ReleasetheMemo. Republicans have widely advanced the narrative that various abuses were committed, but denied naming anything specific, citing security concerns with releasing the material. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another Trumpian tactic: suspense building. When Trump tweeted that \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d people immediately started to question whether, a la Watergate, there was a secret taping system inside the Oval Office. They hoped there were tapes. Even Comey himself testified to Congress, \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d Weeks later, Trump admitted there were no tapes. Oftentimes Trump will, whether he has it or not, promise information will come out \u201csoon \u2026 perhaps in two weeks.\u201d This is the precise stage we find ourselves upon now with #ReleasetheMemo. At this moment, Trump is waiting to make a final decision to release the contents. We all have our countdown clocks on; Trump is in control of this story. Whatever happens next, rest assured, Trump will use the self-manufactured controversy Nunes created to discredit the Russian investigators.\n\nYou may think this all sounds silly and misleading; that this nonsense could never work. But when people see what\u2019s in the memo, it won\u2019t settle the debate. More likely than not, another round of gaslighting will begin to tip the debate in Trump\u2019s favor. Remember, Trump is the same guy who used the bogus birther theory to launch himself on the political stage. He is the same guy who used the National Enquirer to accuse Ted Cruz\u2019s father of being involved in the assassination of JFK. Don\u2019t laugh. The same week Trump started flacking the flabbergasting story, Cruz dropped out of the presidential election and Trump became the default GOP presidential nominee.\n\nAnd this time, Trump has an eager crop of Republicans on Capitol Hill eager to assist him and an entire government apparatus at his disposal in the form of bobble-headed Cabinet secretaries, press teams and even a vice president. As a result, everyone is talking about what could possibly be in the mysterious memo. Republicans are running to TV cameras hyping claims about improper surveillance, FISA court abuse and partisan rancor inside the FBI.\n\nWe are being gaslit into believing that, supposedly, those investigating Trump\u2019s ties to Russia are so biased and corrupt nothing they produce should be believed. Every once in a while, the true aims of this narrative are revealed. Rep. Matt Gaetz, the freshly-elected Republican congressman from Florida, let the truth slip. He told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in between his hits on InfoWars with Alex Jones, that there was \u201ctremendous bias that should stop this probe from going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop this probe from going forward.\u201d Alas, there is always a purpose to Trump\u2019s gaslighting. Trump\u2019s firemen on Capitol Hill know their mission. Whether they succeed or not depends on our ability to see through the smoke.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) opposing both nominees and Sen.

Democrats say Pompeo will fall far short of that \u2014 if he gets any Democratic support at all.\n\n\u201cBoth of them have serious questions to answer and neither confirmation is a sure thing,\u201d Schumer told POLITICO in a statement. \n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). \u201cSen. Schumer is pretty clear that he\u2019s trying to slow us down. And again, it may not be [over] the nominee themselves. It\u2019s purely a tactic to prevent us from doing our work here.\u201d\n\nUntil the Tillerson ouster, the calendar for 2018 appeared free of the type of divisive legislative fights over health care and taxes that defined Republicans\u2019 first year back in full control of the government.\n\nThe completion of an omnibus spending bill and a punt on the immigration status of Dreamers, the thinking went, would leave the White House free to focus its energies on the midterms and avoid any debilitating intraparty brawls.\n\nInstead, the White House is gearing up for a full-on push to keep the GOP in line behind two nominees known for defending torture techniques \u2014 and the prospect of additional confirmation fights if Trump shuffles other members of his Cabinet.\n\n\u201cI think we assume a tough fight on almost all of our nominations. I think that the obstruction has been historic. So we wouldn\u2019t expect anything different at this point,\u201d said White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. \u201cI\u2019m confident that they\u2019re both eminently qualified and have amazing stories to tell, and I think they\u2019ll generate a lot of confidence through the hearing process.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials say they\u2019re confident that they\u2019ll emerge victorious, in part because there are 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in states that Trump won in 2016, who will face pressure not to obstruct. \n\n\u201cI think Democrats make a show out of both of them,\u201d one White House official said, but predicted eventual confirmation, voicing particular confidence about Pompeo.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are well aware that they could get a much less agreeable appointee in the Trump administration, someone that doesn\u2019t have the credentials he does,\u201d the person said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to make a scene of it, but they\u2019re going to take him.\u201d\n\nThe White House is also hopeful that the looming prospect of talks with North Korea could put further pressure on Democrats to approve the nominees.\n\nHaspel and Pompeo each face a different set of challenges. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) voted in favor of Pompeo as CIA director last year, but could flip. With Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, already opposed, losing another Republican on the panel could be catastrophic, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could still bring Pompeo to the floor, regardless of his committee vote.\n\nRetiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who serves on the Foreign Relations panel, has been privately cited by Democrats as a potential flip vote on both Pompeo and Haspel. A vocal Trump critic, he said he\u2019s \u201clooking into\u201d Haspel\u2019s record and wants to hear willingness from Pompeo to break with Trump on Russia.\n\n\u201cWe need people who will stand up to the president, frankly, on some of these issues. I want to make sure he\u2019s willing to do that,\u201d Flake said in an interview. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nHaspel, whose current role did not require confirmation, is unlikely to face a no vote from a committee stacked with defense hawks. But she will face difficult questions from Democrats about her time overseeing a CIA prison in Thailand where suspects were interrogated with methods that many consider to constitute torture.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be hard-hitting hearings. So certainly, Democrats are very, very anxious to get some answers,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who serves on the Intelligence Committee and opposes both Pompeo and Haspel.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s demonstrated preference for unorthodox figures could leave some Democrats inclined to accept the pair, who few would label unqualified even if they disagree with them on policy.\n\nRepublicans also have the advantage of a cadre of Democratic senators facing reelection in 2018 in states Trump easily won: Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. All four voted to confirm Pompeo at the CIA.\n\nThe most conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, is not an automatic \u201cyes\u201d on either, despite his closeness to Trump.\n\n\u201cSen. Manchin looks forward to meeting with both nominees and evaluating their records of service,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nDemocrats have shown increased unity since the early months of the Trump administration. They held together to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act when they were joined by three Republicans. And they voted unanimously against Trump\u2019s signature tax cut bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible. At 51-49, what\u2019s the possibility that there will be some Republican opposition? I think it\u2019s fairly high,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). \u201cI think there will be drama.\u201d\n\nShort of blocking the picks altogether, Democrats could still cause serious headaches for the White House throughout the process.\n\n\u201cThe biggest danger for the White House is that both of these people are coming from inside the administration and are going to be asked to talk about what\u2019s happened inside the administration during their confirmation hearings,\u201d said Matthew Miller, who helped shepherd former Attorney General Eric Holder through his confirmation hearings and joined him at DOJ as a spokesman.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nHe pointed as an example to a Washington Post report from June 2017 that Trump complained to Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats early in his presidency about then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of the Russia probe.\n\nIf Pompeo refuses to address that conversation, Democrats could use that as justification for voting against him, Miller said, since such questions go to how Pompeo reacted to presidential pressure while leading the CIA.\n\n\u201cIf you invoke executive privilege at your oversight hearing, there\u2019s nothing the senators can do to you,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIn a confirmation hearing, you can lose votes over it.\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Glasser", "body": "Subscribe to The Global POLITICO on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.\n\n\n\nSusan Glasser: Hi, I\u2019m Susan Glasser and this is The Global Politico. Our guest this week is Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence Committee. Days ago, Republican abruptly shut down the committee\u2019s yearlong investigation of President Trump and the 2016 Russian election meddling \u2014 to the surprise of Schiff and the Democrats on the panel. Now even many Republicans are pointing fingers, and we\u2019ll hear from Congressman Schiff about how it all went down, what it\u2019s like when a congressional committee melts down and what he thinks comes next in the investigations of the president that are still ongoing.\n\nCongressman Schiff was one of our very first guests on the Global Politico a year ago at the very start of that investigation on the House Intelligence Committee, so it seemed appropriate to have him back as our very first repeat guest. Back then, we started our conversation by saying it was a very topsy turvy week in the Trump White House; the same could be said of this past week too\u2026\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif): It has, and we may be meeting on the eve of another national security advisor being pushed out the door. That\u2019s at least the speculation at the moment. And I understand that John Bolton is one of the potential candidates. And the pressing question here is, does that mean that the president has gotten a commitment that he\u2019ll shave the mustache? Because I understand that was an impediment to begin with.\n\nGlasser: Well, you know, if this is a reality show, we know that this is a president for whom appearances matter, so I\u2019m not sure if the contestants are being judged on that, but then again, maybe President Trump has learned. He thought that Rex Tillerson fit the suit\u2014right?\u2014that appearances seem to matter in the selection of that, but then he soured on him. So\u2026\n\nSchiff: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether if Pompeo is confirmed for that position, his proximity to the president and the favor that he holds with the president will allow him, or if he will even seek to restore the ranks of the State Department, which have been so badly depleted under Rex Tillerson. We can only hope so.\n\nIn many respects I think that role as a policymaker is a better fit for Mike Pompeo, but I hope that it will mean that the State Department will now get the attention and the resources that it really needs.\n\nGlasser: Just before we jump back to the investigation, former Congressman Pompeo obviously has a wide network here on the Hill, and you dealt with him also in your capacity on the Intelligence Committee. You\u2019re one of the eight members of Congress who receive briefings on classified information and sort of a key part of the leadership. What was your impression of him as the CIA director? He seemed to somewhat suit that workforce at a time when President Trump had assaulted them and their integrity.\n\nSchiff: Well, I think that his tenure at the CIA was one that the employees and career servants at the CIA welcomed. They wanted someone who would not be out of favor with the president, and subject the agency to further attacks by the president. I think he was a good manager of people. We\u2019ve had some very serious policy differences, both when he was in Congress and in the CIA, and I\u2019ve had some concerns at times about his willingness to stand up to the president.\n\nThere were a couple times where he diminished the significance of the Russian intervention in our election and perhaps\u2014\n\n Glasser: Publicly or privately?\n\nSchiff: Publicly. And even more seriously, made the statement which was a repeat of the president\u2019s talking points, but clearly untrue that the intelligence community had found that the Russian intervention in our election had not affected the outcome.\n\nNow, clearly, that\u2019s not at all what the intelligence community found, and they made it quite explicit in their unclassified assessment they were reaching no conclusion about that; that was beyond their purview. So, when I would hear him repeat talking points, or do the president\u2019s bidding that way in public, it certainly made me question whether he was willing to stand up to him in private.\n\nGlasser: Have you had any personal interaction with him as CIA director?\n\nSchiff: Certainly, frequent interaction, and on many things we\u2019ve had a real meeting of minds, and other times we\u2019ve had very, very serious differences.\n\nGlasser: Would you say those largely revolve around Russia, or other matters?\n\nSchiff: I can\u2019t get into specifics, but they\u2019re more of a policy nature than they are of an allocation of resources or whether we\u2019re developing the right skill sets at the agency.\n\nGlasser: You don\u2019t think he was tilting intelligence, do you?\n\nSchiff: No. No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any evidence that he was trying to skew the intelligence we were seeing. I hope that he will continue to try to shed some of the partisanship that he exhibited in Congress. I don\u2019t think that his positions on Iran as a member of Congress were in the national interest, and it does concern me that those positions he had then are all too much in alignment with the president\u2019s positions now. Certainly, that would be true if John Bolton became national security advisor.\n\nI don\u2019t see any of the critics of the Iran agreement offering a better solution, and if they take us out of this agreement, and we have another deadline coming up, then\u2014\n\nSchiff: Then, we end up isolated, not Iran. And Iran may be back on the path to its nuclear program, but free from the sanctions, at least vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world, and that would, to my point of view, be the worst of all outcomes.\n\nGlasser: You make the point about the intelligence and Russia, and your concern about the representations of it. My guess is that concern is magnified by many times over when it comes to your colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee, the Republicans who\u2019ve now abruptly put an end to your investigation. It seems like the most controversial aspect of that\u2014it\u2019s not really a surprise on some level that they were skeptics going into this case; they\u2019ve resisted you every step of the way. But, they seem to have gotten a lot of pushback coming out on a week when there\u2019s this nerve gas attack in the U.K., when actually even President Trump\u2019s administration has put out sanctions on Russia addressing the 2016 elections.\n\nTheir conclusion seems really at odds with the facts to say that the Russians were not intervening on behalf of Donald Trump. Was this a misfire? I think the headline today in POLITICO is \u201cRepublicans Fear They Botched Russia Report Rollout.\u201d Do you agree with that?\n\nSchiff: I do agree with that in many ways. They announced their conclusions, which included among other things that the Russians had not intervened in the election to help Donald Trump. Now, that\u2019s at odds with what the intelligence community has found. It\u2019s at odds with what our committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what the Senate committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what Bob Mueller has found.\n\nIt\u2019s a political statement, not a finding. And I think when they were forced to defend it, even within the last 24 to 48 hours, they couldn\u2019t. They acknowledged\u2014well, clearly, these ads and these other things that are in the public domain show that they were attacking Hillary. Doesn\u2019t that help Donald Trump? And they had no answer. And it demonstrates, I think, the problem that we\u2019ve had behind closed doors, which is they\u2019ve been fundamentally unserious about this investigation, and tragically, that started from a very early point.\n\nWe started out committed to a bipartisan, nonpartisan investigation, and a unified report at the end of it. But within days of the open hearing we had with James Comey, when he revealed the Trump campaign had been under a counterintelligence investigation, we had that midnight run by our chairman, in which he went to some undisclosed location and then went to the White House the following day and announced that he had received from a secret source documents he had to show the White House, which he wouldn\u2019t show even his own committee. Only to learn that he\u2019d got these documents from the White House. It was a charade.\n\nFrom that point on, the mission of the chairman was protecting the White House, protecting the president. And so, here we are, the Republicans say they\u2019re shutting down; they\u2019re not going to do any more. The Senate isn\u2019t shutting down. They recognize the importance of this. Bob Mueller certainly isn\u2019t shutting down; there are reports within the last 24 hours of subpoenas going out to the Trump Organization. And just within the last week we have seen now reports of witnesses contradicting the sworn testimony of people who came before our committee, like Erik Prince and Roger Stone.\n\nAnd the Republican members of our committee had just said they don\u2019t care; they\u2019d really rather not know.\n\nGlasser: Tell me a little bit\u2014there\u2019s so much to unpack here\u2014but, how did this happen? I mean, the end\u2014they didn\u2019t even tell you\u2014is that right\u2014that they were just going to end the investigation?\n\nSchiff: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. We would hear through sort of the rumor mill that\u2014and sometimes they would state publicly that they were under enormous pressure to shut it down. Certainly, the White House wanted it shut down. Certainly, Breitbart wanted it shut down, and the Sean Hannitys and the Fox echo chamber wanted it shut down. And they buckled. And it was just a question of how soon they were going to buckle.\n\nGlasser: Do you have any intelligence on how explicit the collusion was with the White House?\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t know, but we did ask the chairman when they put out that very partisan, misleading Nunes memo\u2014\n\nGlasser: Right. This was the headline news 24-hours-a-day, six weeks ago, and now is basically forgotten.\n\nSchiff: Yes. And it should be forgotten, except for the fact that it was a terrible chapter for our committee in which the chairman decided, with the acquiescence of his members, to cherry-pick intelligence and use a once\u2014never before used House rule to publish that in a way that was misleading and omitted key facts to attack the FBI and to attack the department and try to undermine Bob Mueller.\n\nAnd that will chill the willingness of the intelligence community to share information with our committee, to see it abused by our chairman that way. So, we asked the chairman, was this concocted with the White House, the way that midnight run was? Is this a sequel to the midnight run? And he refused to answer the question for days, and when he finally did answer the question, he read a very lawyerly statement of about one sentence that said the White House was not involved in its drafting. But, of course, that leaves open a whole lot of other coordination of that whole chapter.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a terrible tragedy, I think, for the public, because it means that, at least as far as the House is concerned, the public isn\u2019t going to get an accounting of what the Russians did and what the Trump campaign did, that too much of that work will be left to Bob Mueller. And this was not only the only authorized Russia investigation in the House\u2014it was really the only authorized investigation, period. The House is doing no oversight of this administration.\n\nCountless violations of the emoluments clause, and other elements of potentially corrupt behavior of the White House doing business deals out of the White House are going uninvestigated, and won\u2019t be, I think, as long as this crowd is in the majority.\n\nGlasser: Okay. So, a week ago, last Friday, did you know that on Monday they were going to shut down the investigation?\n\nSchiff: And, similarly, when they produced that Nunes memo, we found out about it when they announced it at our business meeting, and asked us to vote it out. They gave us about a minute or two to read it. I made a motion that we allow the members of the committee to actually read the underlying documents\u2014\n\nGlasser: If you are chairman next year, will you make a pledge not to do that to the Republican minority, if you get into the majority?\n\nSchiff: Absolutely. Absolutely. And indeed, up until this Russia chapter\u2014really up until the midnight run\u2014we had worked in a very bipartisan way, and in fact, even now, even through the worst of it, on our non-Russia business we continue to work in a bipartisan way. But yes, this is not way to conduct an investigation. It\u2019s certainly not the way I would do it.\n\nAnd I think, frankly, had Mr. Conaway and I been really given the latitude to run the investigation, it would have been a very different investigation.\n\nGlasser: So, you don\u2019t think this was really Congressman Conaway; you think this was Nunes who was really working with the White House?\n\nSchiff: Well, Chairman Nunes, even when he said he was stepping aside after the midnight run, never did, and continued to make all the key decisions\u2014which witnesses would come in; when they would come; and what open hearings we would have; what open hearings we wouldn\u2019t have; what subpoenas would go out; what subpoenas wouldn\u2019t go out\u2014all of these sideshow investigations of FISA abuse and Uranium One and all that\u2014those were all decisions made by Chairman Nunes, not by Mike Conaway.\n\nGlasser: Do you believe Speaker Ryan was involved in that, as well?\n\nSchiff: Of course. This was of such importance in the House and to the country, and the problems that we\u2019ve had with our chair were raised with the speaker, and the speaker made the decision to be complicit in all this and to acquiesce in all of this. There\u2019s no hiding responsibility for the Republican leadership.\n\nI think one of the really sad realizations over the last year is not what kind of a president Donald Trump turns out to be\u2014I think it was all too predictable\u2014but rather, how many members of Congress would be unwilling to stand up to him, and more than that, would be completely willing to carry water for him. That is a very sad realization.\n\nGlasser: So, you didn\u2019t expect that?\n\nSchiff: I did not expect that. I thought there would be more Jeff Flakes, more John McCains, more Bob Corkers\u2014people who would defend our system of checks and balances, would speak out for decency, who would defend the First Amendment. When the president suggested pulling the license of NBC because he didn\u2019t like what they had to say, the speaker was asked about this, and his comment was, \u201cI\u2019m a conservative constitutionalist and I support the First Amendment, and that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d That\u2019s not much of a defense of our First Amendment rights.\n\nI take it, by conservative constitutionalists what he meant was he\u2019s conservative in his support for the Constitution when it\u2019s not convenient. Those kind of things, the willingness to see the president attack the independence of the Justice Department, attack the judiciary and judges that rule against the president as being illegitimate\u2014to stand silent in the face of that is a real abdication of responsibility.\n\nGlasser: So, going forward, what do you see happening to the Russia investigation? Let\u2019s talk first about your conclusions. Had you known now what you know a year ago, would you have been shocked? I mean, there\u2019s really a lot more information on the record. I was struck by that, looking back at our first interview.\n\nSchiff: I would have been completely shocked, and I gave a very lengthy opening statement in that first hearing we had with James Comey where I tried to set out what was alleged at the time, and what was warranted in terms of investigation. We knew nothing at that time that we would later find out.\n\nIf I were giving that opening statement now, I would be saying that we have evidence that in April of 2016, before even the Clinton campaign knew, the Russians approached the Trump campaign through a foreign policy advisor named George Papadopoulos and told him that they had stolen Clinton emails, that they wanted a relationship with the campaign, that they previewed the dissemination of these stolen emails, that weeks later they would approach the highest levels of the campaign, that they would dispatch an attorney from Moscow with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton to a secret meeting in the Trump Tower\u2014something they described as part of the Russian government\u2019s effort to help the Trump campaign.\n\nSchiff: In writing. In writing. And the campaign\u2019s response to this Russian overture, this invitation to collusion, was, we would love it. And that the national security advisor would have secret conversations with the Russian ambassador designed to undermine the bipartisan policy of the United States to sanction Russia over its interference in our election, and then lie about it\u2014if I had suggested any of these things at the time, people would have said that, oh, you\u2019re smoking something. You\u2019ll never find evidence of that. And certainly, nobody would ever put that in writing.\n\nBut yet of course, we\u2019ve found evidence of all of that, and more. And so, we\u2019ve come a long way. But there\u2019s still a great many unanswered questions.\n\nGlasser: Right. And your Democrats on House Intelligence released a 21-page essentially roadmap to further lines of inquiry, things that you were pursuing at the time the investigation was shut down. Is it your view that there\u2019s an overall question mark on this evidence? You\u2019ve been publicly quoted as saying there already is \u201cample evidence of collusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Do you believe there is already sufficient basis to proceed either with further indictments, or with an impeachment case?\n\nSchiff: Well, there certainly is ample evidence of collusion, and the facts that I\u2019ve just set out are clear evidence of collusion. Now, whether they and other facts known to us and known to the special counsel amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a criminal conspiracy to violate a particular election code section\u2014that will be something Bob Mueller will have to decide.\n\nAnd he still knows a great deal more than we do. For example, what did George Papadopoulos tell the rest of the campaign? Who was knowing in the campaign of what the Russian early overture had been? Did that color the willingness of the president\u2019s son to take that meeting in Trump Tower? Why was the campaign manager and the president\u2019s son-in-law there? Why have three of the most senior campaign people in that meeting at a time when they\u2019re still fighting a contested convention about whether they\u2019ll be the nominee?\n\nThey clearly thought this was a key meeting. Why were they so disappointed in what they got at the meeting? Were they expecting something different? All these questions need answers, and the majority doesn\u2019t want to know. What about these communications between Roger Stone and efforts by Cambridge Analytica to get stolen information from Julian Assange?\n\nGlasser: Do you expect there will be\u2014as an informed observer only\u2014indictments related to the hacking part of it? We haven\u2019t seen that yet.\n\nSchiff: Yes. Yes. And that\u2019s a very good question. I fully expect that there will be. The only question is whether the indictment on the hacking and dumping of documents operation is Russian only, or it includes Americans. When I saw the indictment that Mueller returned, the grand jury returned, charging the 13 Russians with that ambitious social media campaign, that surreptitious\u2014\n\nGlasser: Right, this is the Internet Research Agency, St. Petersburg troll farm, basically?\n\nSchiff: Exactly. There were two things that leapt out at me. First, was the extraordinary level of detail that was included. You put that much detail about a Russian operation and you\u2019re potentially risking sources and methods, and the intelligence community must have signed off on that, which to me means that they felt that informing the public of this was sufficiently important to take that risk, and I think it\u2019s the right call.\n\nBut, the other thing that leapt out at me was, there\u2019s no mention of the hacking and dumping operation. Now, why is that? It\u2019s certainly not because the evidence wasn\u2019t there. Indeed, the evidence of that was more fully developed earlier than the evidence of the social media campaign.\n\nThe reason why you wouldn\u2019t include that\u2014speaking as a former prosecutor\u2014when it reinforces the conspiracy allegations against the Russians\u2014the reason you wouldn\u2019t include that is either that component involves Americans, or you\u2019re not finished investigating whether Americans should be included in that part of the indictment.\n\nGlasser: And, of course, that\u2019s the part of the investigation that could lead more directly to this question of whether the Trump campaign actually was involved or knew about or colluded with the release of those hacked emails.\n\nSchiff: Yes. What Mueller charged in that indictment\u2014the one that was released some weeks ago\u2014was a conspiracy to defraud the United States. That is a good blueprint for how the hacking and dumping operation might be described, along with other elements involving the violation of U.S. election laws. But, defrauding the American people, defrauding the U.S. government, defrauding the agencies that administer our election laws, that\u2019s the kind of conspiracy you would charge; that\u2019s what collusion would look like in legal terms. And the fact that that part of the Russian operation wasn\u2019t included tells me that he either has more work to do on the U.S. person part of it, or that the U.S. persons will be included in that, and\u2014but, that indictment is coming. The only question is whether it includes U.S. persons or not.\n\nGlasser: So, I found your document very interesting reading that suggests a lot of names and entities for possible further investigation that was shut down. The Daily Beast today, I think, said the Republican report was like a half-written term paper. Well, you\u2019ve offered a sort of list of what could have been in the other part of the term paper. There\u2019s a lot to digest in there. What are vtwo or three of what you thought were the most promising leads?\n\nSchiff: Well, there\u2019s a lot more work to do on fleshing out what we already know about the social media campaign of the Russians, about the hacking and dumping operation of the Russians\u2014you know, most of the areas, frankly though, where the Republicans shut us down were on the issues of collusion and obstruction of justice.\n\nSo, we would have witnesses come before the committee who would invoke very broad privileges, or even invoke no privilege and just say they didn\u2019t want to answer the questions. So, Steve Bannon comes in\u2014he\u2019s a perfect illustration\u2014really, the Bannon situation is a perfect illustration of all the problems with how the GOP conducted this investigation. You can look in microcosm.\n\nGlasser: Right. And this was right after he was fired, right?\n\nSchiff: Yes. No long after he was fired. But, in microcosm you can see in the Steve Bannon saga all of the problems with how the Republicans ran their investigation. So, first Bannon comes in as a voluntary witness, which is how we initially bring everyone in. He refuses to answer any question dealing with his time in the White House, his time in the transition, and most of his time even after he left the White House. He invokes no privilege; he simply says, I\u2019m instructed by the White House not to answer.\n\nNow, the Republicans, unlike other witnesses who refused to answer, expressed great umbrage at this. This is unheard of; you can\u2019t do this. If we allow you to stonewall this way, then what will it do to our investigation, and future investigations? They hand him a subpoena on the spot. \n\n Now, this was extraordinary, because other witnesses who stonewalled and we said they needed to subpoena, the majority said no. \n\n Glasser: No.\n\nSchiff: Now, why did they treat him differently? Because Steve Bannon was a man without a country\u2014neither beloved in the White House, nor beloved at Breitbart. So, they give him a subpoena. He comes back now under compulsion of the subpoena, and he\u2019s got 25 questions written out for him helpfully by the White House, which are the only questions he will answer. And the answer to each one of them is no.\n\nSo, one of the questions might be, did you meet with so-and-so? And the answer he tells us is no. Now, that would give you the impression that he had no communication with that person. So, I would ask, \u201cDid you speak with that person?\u201d and the answer was yes. And, what did you say? I am not answering that question.\n\nGlasser: So, he was making a distinction between meeting and speaking?\n\n\n\n Schiff: Yes. Well, and I\u2019m sure the White House didn\u2019t even want him to acknowledge that he had even spoken to the person, but the whole goal of the White House was to mislead us and to stonewall us. Now, the Republicans in that case, quite apart from other witnesses, again expressed great umbrage. How dare you come in here and to claim executive privilege\u2014which he was then doing\u2014in such a broad way is unsustainable, and blah, blah, blah. We\u2019re going to have to insist. We\u2019re going to have to initiate contempt proceedings. We can\u2019t stand for this. Well, that was over a month ago, and it\u2019s been radio silence since.\n\nNow, why did the Republicans never follow up? Two reasons why they didn\u2019t follow up. The first is, they soon realized after they did that, they couldn\u2019t defend their treatment of other witnesses like Hope Hicks and Cory Lewandowski, and others who similarly came in and stonewalled on key questions. So, that was a big problem.\n\nBut the second reason is, they didn\u2019t really want to know the answers. They wanted, I suppose, to punish Steve Bannon, but they didn\u2019t want to know the answers. And that\u2019s the more fundamental problem with how they conducted the investigation.\n\nGlasser: So, I know we\u2019re going to run out of time, but, what will you do differently if you\u2019re the chairman? Will you, first of all, will you just restart the investigation where it is right now? Would you release all these documents?\n\nSchiff: First of all, I think the Republicans did a real disservice in not bringing in the witnesses that we\u2019d been asking them for months to bring in. We could have moved this investigation much more expeditiously if they had done that. What we will do if we take over the majority is we will look at the work that\u2019s been done, the work that\u2019s been done by the Senate, the work that\u2019s been done by Bob Mueller\u2014and decide, did they do all the work? Did they finish the investigation, or are there parts of the investigation that were still left undone? So, we\u2019ll reserve judgment.\n\nOne of the issues that really concerns me, and it may go or it may not, to the reports of Mueller\u2019s subpoenaing the Trump Organization is, we were never allowed to investigate money laundering.\n\nGlasser: Right. So, you talked about this in your report\u2014Deutsche Bank and the like\u2014you wanted to go there and the majority said no.\n\nSchiff: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. And the reason why this is so significant\u2014when we began the investigation, the allegations that the Trump campaign had secret meetings with the Russians were nothing more than allegations. The allegations of money laundering were allegations.\n\nSome of the allegations we were allowed to investigate, and we found actually\u2014okay, this turned out to be very true; there were all these secret meetings with the Russians. We were never allowed to investigate whether the Russians are holding financial leverage over the president. That\u2019s a vulnerability for our country that could influence what the president\u2019s position is on sanctions over Ukraine or sanctions over election interference or why he seemingly is incapable of criticizing Vladimir Putin. Do they have a financial hammer over his head?\n\nIt\u2019s derelict for us not to find out, and we could find out, I think, in fairly short order. And the first place to stop would be Deutsche Bank. So, I hope that Bob Mueller has the license to do that; it\u2019s within the scope of his investigation, but we didn\u2019t have the chance, and neither does the Senate. The Senate is not authorized either to look at this, and someone in the public interest needs to find out whether the Russians are holding financial leverage over our president.\n\nGlasser: So, on Sunday there will be an election\u2014I\u2019m putting quotes around it\u2014in Russia, and Vladimir Putin, of course, is expected to win another six-year term in office. He\u2019s already the longest-serving Russian leader since Stalin. A lot of people here in the U.S., even liberals, are worried that our Russiagate obsession has both overshadowed and distorted the real challenge of what Putin\u2019s actually doing in the world. Is this a modern-day Red scare that we\u2019re having? And, have we become obsessed with 2016 at the expense of looking forward?\n\nYou\u2019ve been a leading proponent out there publicly all the time saying this Russia investigation is serious and it has to be taken seriously. Do you worry about that at all? That we\u2019ve sort of made Vladimir Putin a 10-foot-tall figure in our own politics?\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t worry that we have overstated the danger by Putin and Russia. What I do worry about, and this is something, and I\u2019m glad you asked this question\u2014but I always try to emphasize in talking about the Russia investigation and why people should care about it, is what the Russians did here, they\u2019ve been doing all over the world. It was only new to us. And what we see going on around the world is a real rise of authoritarianism.\n\nWe see autocrats on the rise in Hungary, in Poland, in the Philippines, in Turkey. We see the rise of far-right parties in Germany and in Austria and France. This is part of a global challenge to the very idea of democracy. America needs to push back and fight back and be the champion of democracy and a free press and a free society, and right now we are not. At least not in the White House.\n\nGlasser: So, you don\u2019t think those sanctions this week were a sufficient response to the Russian attack in the United States?\n\nSchiff: Not at all. I think the message they sent to Vladimir Putin was, this administration is going to do the absolute minimum. Many of the people on that list to be sanctioned were people that have already been sanctioned by Barack Obama. This is from the president who says he\u2019s so much tougher than Barack Obama.\n\nThe other people on the list, with only two exceptions, were people that Bob Mueller named, that this administration made no effort to identify; that was Bob Mueller\u2019s work. We\u2019re not likely to get those people here, and the economic impact of that very limited set of sanctions isn\u2019t going to make much difference to the Russians. So, I think they were really seriously inadequate and sent exactly the wrong message.\n\nGlasser: In the intelligence committee there was a public announcement the other day that even more cyberattacks from Russia had occurred, including on our power infrastructure, our nuclear power infrastructure. This started at the same time, really, as this election intervention in 2015. I thought that was a wow story.\n\nAre you aware in a broad sense that there are more things yet to become public about the components of this Russian campaign inside the United States, which seemed to have all ramped up after the 2014 intervention in Crimea?\n\nSchiff: Yeah, there was certainly a lot that I can\u2019t discuss that I would characterize as a broad-ranging threat from Russia.\n\nGlasser: So, it\u2019s not just internet trolls?\n\nSchiff: It\u2019s not just internet trolls. There is a broad ideological fight globally over the idea of democracy, that the Russians are trying to tear down. There are cyberattacks and infiltrations by the Russians into all kinds of systems.\n\nGlasser: Including things that are not pubic?\n\nSchiff: Yes. There are military threats posed by the Russians, and treaty violations by the Russians. There are, obviously, poisonings by the Russians around the world on foreign soil, political assassinations. Of course, the Russians invaded their neighbor; they propped up a regime that was gassing its own people in Syria. These are bad actors, and they\u2019re not our friend. They\u2019re not going to be our friend simply because the president says nice things about Putin or refrains from saying bad things about Putin.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to need to stand up to them, because the only thing the Russians respect is strength. They don\u2019t see that in this president; they see weakness. And they also see in this president someone they can manipulate just by saying flattering things. And that\u2019s a real danger to this country, and it\u2019s a danger to our allies, and we need to step up to this challenge.\n\nGlasser: But you don\u2019t worry that Putin\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re also playing into his hands, though, if he needed a war on the West in order to justify the legitimacy of his own election. We sort of handed him that, right?\n\nSchiff: Putin has viewed his ticket to the grand stage and Russia\u2019s resurrection as coming at the expense of the United States. We can wish it were otherwise; that was true before Donald Trump arrived on the scene. It will be true after Donald Trump leaves the scene. That\u2019s just the reality of who this KGB operative that\u2019s become the president of Russia. So, we have to deal with it. I don\u2019t think it plays into his hands; it\u2019s just a reality. I don\u2019t think we should make him 10 feet tall, and I think this poisoning in London was a tragic miscalculation on Putin\u2019s part. But, we need to recognize that Russia at the present is a malevolent force that needs to be pushed back.\n\nGlasser: So, Donald Trump has called you \u201cLittle Adam Schiff.\u201d Do you have a nickname for him? And do you think right now are you ready say he should be impeached?\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t have a nickname for him. You know, the first impulse\u2014and I\u2019ve been the subject of now many nicknames from the president\u2014you know, it\u2019s so absurd that you want to laugh. And then, it\u2019s such a diminishment of the Oval Office, it makes you want to cry.\n\nGlasser: Last week\u2019s guest on this show was Chuck Todd, who was called a sleepy-eyed son of a bitch by the president.\n\nSchiff: Yes. Well. You know, these are the kind of grade-school insults that you see lobbed from the White House. So, we don\u2019t want to get down in the sandbox with him. I think, frankly, the best way to respond to his Twitter insults is with humor and mockery. He makes himself a very easy target of being mocked, and so when he tweets at me early in the morning from watching Fox and getting all upset in his bathrobe\u2014we point out that clearly he\u2019s had a busy morning of \u201cexecutive time.\u201d I think that\u2019s the best way to respond. With this president, I think you need to push back hard, but you don\u2019t need to push back dirty; you don\u2019t need to get down to his level.\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t favor people talking about impeachment. I tried an impeachment case in the Senate some years ago involving a corrupt federal judge, and there\u2019s a legal standard, and what constitutes a high crime and misdemeanor, but there\u2019s a political standard, too. And I think the political standard is, if we give the country the impression this is something we are eager to embrace, even before the investigation is done\u2014now, the House may say their investigation is done, but the investigation isn\u2019t done, by any means.\n\nIf we give the country that impression, then if the evidence does warrant it, it\u2019s going to be a much harder case to make. So, let\u2019s finish our investigative work\u2014we\u2019re going to continue, as Democrats on the committee\u2014to do our investigative work. We\u2019re still learning more from the intelligence community. We still have witnesses who are willing to come in and talk with us, even if the Republicans aren\u2019t interested in listening.\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to continue to do our work, and Bob Mueller\u2019s going to continue to do his, and the Senate will do theirs, and when we\u2019re done, then we can decide does that rise to the level of a removal from office.\n\nGlasser: So, that\u2019s Congressman Adam Schiff, who is our guest, our only repeat guest so far on The Global POLITICO, coming full circle after the beginning of the House Intelligence Committee investigation, and now back to the end. One final question. You\u2019ve impressed many of your fellow Democrats in your very public and vocal communicating with people about this investigation. You\u2019re now even talked about as a potential successor to Nancy Pelosi, should the Democrats win the House. Would you consider running for speaker?\n\nSchiff: Well, I\u2019m for Nancy. I think she\u2019s the most talented person we have in the caucus and I don\u2019t think there is even a close second. So, my hope is that she stays and is our speaker if we take back the majority. What people don\u2019t realize, I think, is a couple of things. First, whoever has that job in the post-Newt Gingrich era is going to be shredded, going to be torn apart. And you won\u2019t recognize them after a certain of time.\n\nAnd the second thing is, we are a very difficult caucus to keep together. We\u2019re a very diverse caucus. Unlike the Republican Conference, we are very diverse, and you really need someone with the kind of skill set that she has to keep us together, and she does an extraordinary job of it.\n\nGlasser: So, that was sort of a non-denial denial.\n\nSchiff: Well, I hope she stays; I hope she becomes our speaker.\n\nGlasser: But you would not rule out seeking to follow her?\n\nSchiff: Well, I honestly don\u2019t know what my future holds in the sense that I had thought about running for the Senate if Senator Feinstein retired, and I told the senator I was a full supporter of hers. I hope she would run again, and if she did I would support her. And she has run again and is running again.\n\nSo, I hadn\u2019t thought about it much other than that, and haven\u2019t had much time to think about much other than what I\u2019m doing in the day job. Right now, what I am doing is traveling around the country, trying to help take back the House. And so, when I\u2019m not working on my day job, that\u2019s my night job.\n\nGlasser: All right. Well, stay tuned, folks. It sounds like there might be an interesting decision in your future. Congressman Adam Schiff, thank you so much for joining us on The Global POLITICO, and of course, thank you to our audience\u2014as always, the best audience on podcast, and you can email me or write any time at sglasser@politico.com, and you can listen to us on Apple podcasts.

I raised $43 million, and I needed another 20,\u201d said Wendy Davis, the former Democratic state senator who became a national cause in her 2014 run for Texas governor after mounting a headline-grabbing filibuster in an attempt to stop a law that would restrict abortion rights in the state.\n\nDavis lost by 21 points. She expects O\u2019Rourke will do \u201cfar better,\u201d in part because of the difference in the national political climate between 2014 and 2018\u2014and in part because she expects that the 43,000 people who\u2019ve chipped in a few dollars for O\u2019Rourke will be motivated to help push him to do more.\n\nO\u2019Rourke wants to be seen as a renegade, running against all the conventional wisdom and usual politicking. He claimed victory on primary night in an off-kilter webcam Facebook Live chat from the dining room table of the row house he shares with a few colleagues on Capitol Hill; he\u2019s planning to drive through all 254 counties in Texas (he\u2019s hit 226 so far); he\u2019s refusing to spend money on focus groups or pollsters; he casually curses in interviews\u2014and makes sure he\u2019s doing interviews all the time. He points out that he voted against Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader and insists he got in the race against Cruz without any commitment of help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nAll that can generate some eye rolls in Washington\u2014like from people who point out that the DSCC doesn\u2019t commit to help any nonincumbent a year out, or who laugh at how much press he does\u2014but it\u2019s also been generating hundreds of people showing up at events in parts of the state that haven\u2019t seen a candidate in years.\n\n\u201cI can understand how people think that this is crazy that I think that I\u2019m going to win. But so much of this is crazy. Right? Like, what is this guy doing from El Paso? El Paso has produced precisely zero statewide victories in the history of the state of Texas. Last time a Democrat won was in 1988, for U.S. Senate, Lloyd Bentsen. So why in the world, against Ted Cruz of all people? That guy almost won the Republican presidential nomination,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI think the confidence is borne not out of any kind of mental illness, but out of what I am seeing and hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a state like Texas, you\u2019re not going to win unless you\u2019re fearless. And Beto\u2019s fearless,\u201d said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, who predicted O\u2019Rourke is on his way to do better than any Democrat statewide since Ann Richards, Texas\u2019 charismatic late governor. \u201cHe still has a ways to go to catch up to Ted [Cruz], but he\u2019s a lot closer than anybody ever believed he\u2019d be at this point in the election.\u201d\n\nNational help isn\u2019t materializing for O\u2019Rourke, but that\u2019s the way he wants it. Ever since Georgia\u2019s special election for U.S. House last June\u2014when the Democratic candidate, an out-of-district documentary filmmaker, raised $23 million and still lost\u2014Democrats who\u2019ve avoided becoming national causes have been able to compete in elections with bigger impacts and closer numbers.\n\nOf celebrity support, O\u2019Rourke says, Alyssa Milano and others can keep their tweets.\n\n\u201cShe is, I am sure, a great person,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is going to be decided by Texas and by Texans.\u201d\n\nSo far, swearing off PAC money and relying on small donors, he\u2019s raised $8 million, including tripling Cruz\u2019s haul in the last quarter of 2017. Democrats got excited: What if Texas becomes the seat that tips them into the majority this year? (They\u2019re so excited, they\u2019re using math that assumes they\u2019ll hold every Senate seat in Trump country and have at least one other pickup.)\n\nThen again, Cruz already has more money on hand, has a national fundraising base from his presidential run to tap, and is assumed to be in line for as much outside money as he could possibly want. A spokesperson for Cruz didn\u2019t respond when asked to make the senator available for an interview.\n\nTo date, Cruz\u2019s response to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s primary victory in early March\u2014which he did with less than 62 percent of the vote, worrying Texas Democrats that he may not be able to unite the party in a way that matches his media appeal\u2014has been in the form of releasing a country jingle calling O\u2019Rourke a \u201cliberal man\u201d (in contrast to being a tough and honest Texan); mocking him for going by \u201cBeto,\u201d the nickname he\u2019s used since childhood; and declaring, \u201che wants those open borders and wants to take our guns.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded to the nickname jab by tweeting a photo of himself as a young child in a sweater with \u201cBeto\u201d on it. As for being a liberal, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I am on the spectrum,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says, though he\u2019s fine banning AR-15s, has sponsored only bipartisan bills in the House and was one of the two dozen Democrats who broke with the party to give Obama authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. As for not being tough, O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that stuff means.\u201d\n\nWhat he does see in Cruz is a person who\u2019s crumpled on many of his beliefs and principled stands in search of support for another presidential run.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how else to explain the turnabout from asking the delegates at the Republican National Convention to vote their conscience to the picture of him at a phone bank dialing for Donald Trump; from saying that \u2018I\u2019m not in the habit of endorsing people who malign my wife and my father,\u2019 to being his most full-throated supporter in the Senate right now,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else explains it.\u201d\n\nHe treasures the brief conversation he had with Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who sat in the row ahead of him at the State of the Union and leaned over to tell him, \u201cYou can do this.\u201d Trump won Alabama by 28 points and Texas by only 9, O\u2019Rourke noted, and Roy Moore was polling better in Alabama on the eve of that election than Cruz is in Texas today.\n\nAmong O\u2019Rourke\u2019s friends in Washington who let themselves believe, even for a second, that he might win, their brains start tap dancing to the next step. The vice presidential shortlist for sure, they say\u2014maybe even president, if he can take Texas with him.\n\nO\u2019Rourke pledges to serve his full six-year term if elected, and to limit himself to two terms, but loops that discussion right back to his big attack on Cruz, who, he complains, became so quickly consumed with running for president after winning (on the same day in 2012 that O\u2019Rourke was first elected to Congress himself) that they\u2019ve rarely talked about anything in six years serving together in the Texas delegation.\n\nThat\u2019s held since he announced his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can remember him saying is maybe the first time we saw each other after I announced, he said something like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be an interesting campaign,\u2019 or something. You know, nice, you know, a nice thing. And he had just, for the first time in the five years that he had been in the Senate, had just visited El Paso, which is the sixth-largest city,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Hey, heard you were in El Paso. We\u2014as an El Pasoan, as a constituent of yours\u2014are grateful that you showed up.

Though Sessions followed the advice of a nonpartisan Department of Justice review board, Trump has attacked McCabe for months. Republicans have largely defended Sessions, but lawmakers in both parties are eager to see the flap aired out in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   The Judiciary panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), this week said he would hold hearings on the still-unreleased DOJ inspector general\u2019s report, which underpinned Sessions' firing of McCabe. Although all 10 Democrats on the committee have urged Grassley to ask for \u201can advance and embargoed copy of\u201d the report and called on DOJ \u201cto explain the timing and manner of this firing,\u201d whether the GOP would insist on testimony from Sessions himself remains an open question.\n \n Democrats would welcome the chance to put Sessions back on the hot seat for the first time since last fall. And it\u2019s not just the McCabe firing that Democrats want to dig into. \n \n Should Sessions return to his former home in the Senate for the first time since two ex-Trump campaign aides pleaded guilty to lying to investigators, he can also expect sharp questions on his shifting statements about Trump campaign contacts with Russia.\n \n Sessions \u201ceither made a false statement or misled the committee\u201d in the past when discussing contacts with Russia, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in an interview. \u201cI think that that\u2019s not a question \u2014 that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n \n The attorney general told the Judiciary panel at his confirmation hearing last year that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians,\u201d only to later revise himself after reports of two meetings with the then-Russian ambassador. Sessions said he attended those meetings in his role as a senator, not a Trump campaign adviser, although media reports have suggested the two discussed campaign-related issues.\n \n McCabe himself authorized a criminal inquiry into Sessions' Senate testimony last year in response to a request from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), ABC reported Wednesday. That move is bound to raise further questions among Democrats already concerned about politicization driving Sessions' firing of McCabe less than two days before the former FBI No. 2's scheduled retirement.\n \n Sessions \u201cwasn\u2019t forthcoming with the truth,\u201d Booker said before ABC's report, adding that \u201cit sounds eerily familiar to what the IG\u2019s accusing McCabe about.\u201d \n \n The DOJ\u2019s inspector general has found that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to media about an ongoing investigation and then misled investigators about it \u2014 an allegation McCabe denies.\n \n A source close to Sessions said the attorney general was unaware of the probe McCabe opened when he decided on the firing. Chuck Cooper, Sessions' lawyer, said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is not currently investigating Sessions' congressional testimony.\n \n \"The special counsel's office has informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting additional investigation, the Attorney General is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,\" Cooper said in a statement.\n \n A DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Sessions would consider testifying in the Senate Judiciary Committee if asked. A spokesman for Grassley said that the panel first would \"need to review\" the inspector general's report and the recommendation for McCabe's firing from the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility before deciding on witnesses for a hearing.\n \n But several Democrats on the committee, including ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, made clear this week that they would want Sessions himself to discuss the unique circumstances behind McCabe\u2019s firing.\n \n It\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d for the attorney general to personally address the McCabe firing, Feinstein told reporters, adding that she has \"a lot of questions.\" Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) also issued a call for Sessions' testimony hours after McCabe's firing.\n \n Leahy and Franken sent three requests for an FBI inquiry into Sessions\u2019 communications with Russian officials last year, raising concerns about false statements \u2014 the first two to Comey, dinging Sessions for \"lack of candor,\" the same ethics breach that resulted in McCabe\u2019s dismissal.\n \n The Democrats\u2019 sent their third letter seeking a Sessions probe to McCabe, three days after McCabe became acting FBI director following Trump\u2019s firing of Comey. \n \n Another hot-button issue that Democrats want addressed: how Sessions' recusal from investigative matters related to Hillary Clinton's email server and family foundation squares with his decision to fire McCabe over the ex-FBI No. 2's disclosures to the media about its probe of the Clinton Foundation.\n \n \"I have concerns about his respect to the scope of his recusal,\" said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), another Judiciary Committee member. \"I also have concerns that the president is inappropriately influencing the leadership of the Department of Justice.\"\n \n DOJ points to existing internal regulations to note that, while Sessions is recused from investigative matters relating to the 2016 election, that recusal does not cover personnel or employee misconduct decisions such as McCabe\u2019s firing or last year's Comey firing.\n \n With the IG\u2019s report still under wraps and subject to potential delays, Democrats who challenged the timing of McCabe\u2019s termination face political pitfalls of their own in any effort to probe more deeply.\n \n Before seeing the results of the DOJ watchdog\u2019s probe, it\u2019s impossible for them to know whether McCabe\u2019s behavior documented within it undercuts his claim to be a target of Trump administration allies who want to \"undermine my credibility\" ahead of likely cooperation with Mueller.\n \n \"What\u2019s been widely reported, and I assume it\u2019s true, is Mr. McCabe leaked classified information and lied, including but not limited to lied under oath,\u201d another Judiciary panel Republican, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, said in an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a firing offense.\"\n \n Trump's GOP allies in the House have largely applauded Sessions' decision to fire McCabe, calling it a justified action after a year of questions about his role in both the Clinton investigation and Mueller's Russia probe.\n \n Senate Republicans on the Judiciary panel have offered more measured responses, welcoming the chance for a hearing on the inspector general's report while stopping short of passing judgment on conclusions they have yet to see.\n \n \"I want the country to understand what happened. Was it political reprisal or was it justified?\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \"I think it\u2019d be good for the country to understand the basis of the firing.\"\n \n Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) agreed with Grassley's camp that lawmakers should first get a complete look at the inspector general's and internal FBI recommendations.\n\n \"I'm sure the attorney general will be testifying\" at some point soon, Cornyn told reporters, as part of his periodic returns to the Hill. \"[S]o people will have their shot at him. But I'd like to get the facts first.\"\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Republicans, usually the champions of family values and small government, now want to restrict family reunification and give bureaucrats the power to screen people who want to enter the country. Democrats, traditionally the allies of the working class, want big business to select immigrants and have given scant attention to the legitimate interests of working-class natives.\n\nThe only way to end this politically charged debate is to think carefully about benefits and costs as well as politics and perceptions. We need a new immigration system that offers liberal admission policies but targets its benefits to native workers rather than corporations.\n\nEconomic research provides little doubt that immigration benefits our economy. Highly educated immigrants offer their skills, entrepreneurial drive and much-needed expertise for our most important industries. Low-skilled migrants are willing to do back-breaking but vitally important labor that most Americans refuse. Both types bring their purchasing power, which increases the demand for American services and American-made goods, and their cultural heritage, which enriches ours.\n\nThe problem posed by migration is that the benefits are not evenly distributed. They flow to the migrants themselves and the corporations that hire them. Consumers do receive better products and lower prices, but ordinary people don\u2019t really perceive these benefits. And working-class people may suffer a decline in their wages (some or many of them, depending on which economist you ask, but most agree the decline is not large), or (certainly, in most cases) believe that immigration undercuts their wages and threatens their cultural values.\n\nSo, immigration expands the economic pie but gives too meager a slice to ordinary people. The goal must be to retain, and in fact expand, immigration while ensuring that its benefits are distributed fairly. The current system does the opposite: channeling the benefits of migration to immigrants and domestic elites. Right now, special classes of citizens\u2014mostly corporations (and in practice, big corporations) and family members\u2014can sponsor temporary or permanent migrants, benefiting shareholders mainly, as well as ethnic enclaves.\n\nThis system should be wiped away and replaced with a system of citizenship sponsorship for immigrants that we call a Visas Between Individuals Program. Under this new system, all citizens would have the right to sponsor a migrant for economic purposes.\n\nHere\u2019s how the program would work: Imagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay.\n\nSofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nWhile the program might seem crazy at first, it would not be that different from the existing H1-B program, except that individuals like Mary rather than corporations like Google and Exxon would sponsor the workers. Second, the program is not that different from the au pair program run by the State Department, nominally under the J-1 cultural exchange visa program, but in reality a nanny migrant-labor program used by upper-middle class American families.\n\nA Visas Between Individuals Program would extend the benefits of these types of immigration programs to everyone, rather than just to corporations and the affluent. It would also achieve the goals of both sides of the immigration debate\u2014better than their own proposals do. Immigrants would no longer have special privileges to sponsor family members, while working-class voters would enjoy dramatic benefits.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a typical family of four could boost its income by $10,000 to 20,000 by hosting migrants. The reason is that migrants to the United States usually increase their wages many times, allowing them to pay as much as $6,000 to hosts for sponsorships (and our average family could sponsor up to four visas, one for each member).\n\nThis financial benefit for working families would be a larger increase in income than they have received over the last 40 years of economic growth. (Median household income in the United States was about $50,000 in 1977 and is roughly $59,000 today.) At the same time, a Visas Between Individuals Program would be true to Republican free-market and small-government principles by drastically reducing the role of government bureaucrats, who would merely run security checks on migrants rather than trying to evaluate their likely contributions to the economy.\n\nMany people will worry that the Sofias of the world would be exploited by their sponsors. But all health and safety laws would apply to them, and periodic inspections could be undertaken (as exist for the J-1 au pair program, where admittedly occasional exploitation also occurs). Yes, Mary would be able to pay Sofia less than the minimum wage, but even at $5 an hour, Sofia would earn many times what she earns on a farm in Paraguay. Sofia would be free to leave at any time if she did not like the conditions of her employment. Effectively, this system allows the benefits of exchange in international labor that are permitted by online labor markets like Fiverr and Amazon Mechanical Turk to extend to a much broader range of tasks that need to be done in person, from dog walking to construction work.\n\nWouldn\u2019t lower-income Americans oppose a Visas between Individuals Program because of fears that these immigrants would take away their jobs? At first, maybe. But they would soon realize that they can use the program to make money for themselves. Like Sofia, many Americans would like to start or expand small businesses. Others might try, in entrepreneurial fashion, to find foreign workers for American businesses\u2014which would not be allowed to sponsor migrants under our proposal\u2014taking a cut in the process. Google and Exxon would need to pay people like Mary to find migrants for their businesses. Other Americans would sponsor migrants for low-skilled agricultural work, or to work in factories that move back on shore to take advantage of newly available cheap labor, or to work in their own businesses. A great free market using migrant labor would flourish, creating new jobs for working class natives as supervisors and agents. (Wealthy families could sponsor migrants, too, but there are fewer of them, and they would likely find a $6,000 boost in income not worth the trouble\u2014while the money would be a tremendous gain for sponsors with more limited prospects.)\n\nOne of the most fascinating findings of social scientists is that the people who oppose immigration the most are not those who live among migrants. The fear of migrants is largely based on ignorance about who they are. That\u2019s why people who live among migrants tend to support immigration or not to oppose it too much. By making sponsorship accessible to all Americans, a Visas Between Individuals Program would spread migrants throughout the United States rather than concentrating them in Silicon Valley, the big cities, and certain agricultural areas near the southern border. Sponsors will normally want the migrants they sponsor to live near them. Or Americans might move to areas of high migrant demand to take advantage of the opportunity to sponsor migrants there. It is hard to demonize the person who lives in your basement, or the basement of your neighbor, and has increased your income greatly. Most migrants, even those who came here illegally, obey the law and work extremely hard, in ways that are hard not to admire.\n\nA Visas Between Individuals Program would offer advantages to working people, while preserving America\u2019s historic commitment to immigration. Democrats should understand that it would increase the wealth and well-being of low-income Americans and impoverished foreigners, while Republicans should appreciate how it would contribute to economic growth, which offers benefits to all. Moreover, a Visas Between Individuals Program does so in the spirit of the market, by allowing every citizen to choose how she uses her right to sponsor visas rather than allowing corporations or governments to manage migration. The program puts the burden of responsibility and choice as well as the freedom to profit on hard-working Americans who seek to better their lot.\n\nImmigration is just one of any number of social problems that can be solved with what we call \u201cradical markets.\u201d By exploiting the logic of the market in an area that is normally bureaucratized, we can advance equality as well as economic growth.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Shafer", "body": "For the longest time, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of the Russia mess looked like a backyard drainage ditch. Into it flowed a regular stream of witnesses, evidence and press speculation. But when was it ever going to amount to anything real? When was Mueller going to rent a hydraulic excavator and dig for real glory? After accepting the guilty pleas of Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, and spraying Paul Manafort with a few dozen indictments, the Mueller ditch had grown big enough to serve as a family plot. But dedicated followers of the scandal made no effort to hide their disappointment. Is this what prosecutorial dither looks like?\n\nThen, two weeks ago, Mueller\u2019s modest ditch opened like a sinkhole as he filed an indictment against 13 Russians and three Russian entities for monkeying with the 2016 election. Last week, the maw yawned a little wider as Manafort\u2019s former business partner Rick Gates pleaded guilty to many of the charges also filed against Manafort and agreed to turn on him. The question today is no longer: When will the Mueller machine get going? Now, it\u2019s: Who will escape Mueller\u2019s big dig?\n\nStanding at the hole\u2019s unstable rim and looking into the chasm is son-in-law Jared Kushner. He had a very bad week, suffering a humiliating downgrade from a top-secret clearance to one lower than the White House chief calligrapher. But that bad news wasn\u2019t the worst. Although still a free man with no charges filed against him, Kushner exudes legal liability, blithely mixing business interests with his role as an adviser to the president of the United States. Mueller will seize on Kushner\u2019s conflicts of interest like signposts to guide his investigative voyage.\n\nConflict No. 1: Kushner\u2019s family business accepted huge loans from two financial empires after he met with their executives in the White House. Were any laws or ethics boundaries violated? Conflict No. 2: In early 2017, he hit up Qatar\u2019s minister of finance for a loan and then a month later, with no loan forthcoming, he backed a blockade of the country. If it\u2019s a coincidence, it\u2019s a rotten one. Conflict No. 3: Officials from four countries\u2014UAE, China, Israel and Mexico\u2014think of Kushner as a sucker. They\u2019ve privately discussed using his financial weakness to manipulate him on matters of state. Conflict No. 4: What role did he play in his family\u2019s promotion of the foreign visa investment program, which has attracted the interest of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York?\n\nWill Kushner jump from the White House before Mueller pushes him into the sinkhole? Or will Kushner even get his chance to jump? White House staffers and the president are now thought to regard Kushner as a political liability, and the president has reportedly asked Chief of Staff John Kelly for help in elbowing both Jared and wife Ivanka Trump out of the White House.\n\nIvanka Trump might toss her husband a lifeline and plead with her daddy to keep them on. But she\u2019s in a precarious position, too. FBI scrutiny of a Trump Organization deal in Vancouver could block her application for a full security clearance as a presidential adviser and lend Kelly the oomph he needs to give her the full Omarosa and escort her out of the White House. Nobody is saying\u2014yet\u2014that the sinkhole will claim Ivanka. They\u2019re not saying that about her former employee, Hope Hicks, who functioned for three years as Trump\u2019s press go-between and portal to the real world. Hicks placed her big toe over the sinkhole\u2019s edge this week when she gave Capitol Hill testimony confessing to occasional white lies for her president. A communications director can\u2019t very well admit to lying and keep her job, so she resigned. Having established herself as a sometime prevaricator, Mueller will not leave her be until he unmasks the untruths he finds relevant to his investigation. If she knows anything valuable\u2014and how could she not, given that she appears to have played a role in drafting the inaccurate statement about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s notorious meeting with the Russians\u2014Mueller will extract it from her.\n\nThe Mueller machinations pointed this week to a new criminal case against the Russians suspected to have hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and distributed the emails via Wikileaks. According to NBC News, Mueller has asked witnesses how much Trump knew about the stolen emails before their theft became common knowledge, and what he did, if anything, to spur their release. Both Trump associate Roger Stone and Trump\u2019s eldest son Donald Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks. Stone appears to have foreshadowed the release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails with a tweet that said, \u201cit would soon [be] Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201d Several weeks later the stolen Podesta emails were released by WikiLeaks.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigators, who still want their interview with Trump, also want to know more about his Russophilia and his crush-like adoration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He may have already placed his staff in peril, Politico tells us, by defying his lawyers\u2019 orders not to talk to aides, including Hicks, about the Russia investigation. Current and former Trump staffers say he \u201coften fails to observe boundaries about the Russia probe and [he] calls staffers into his office and raises the subject without warning.\u201d\n\nTrump knows more about working on the edge than any politician not currently in jail. As a part-time Floridian, he should know plenty about sinkholes, too. But has he studied their geology? If the water table drops, sandy soil in the porous limestone yields and houses can disappear overnight. In 1981, a sinkhole in Winter Park, Fla., choked down a car dealership, two streets, an Olympic-sized swimming pool and a three-bedroom home. It\u2019s common for new sinkholes to pop up next to existing ones and become their partner in annihilation. As Trump would say, \u201cYuge.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m partial to tornadoes myself.

So now we\u2019ve made plans for dinner at his favorite Vietnamese spot near his Upper East Side apartment, but when he arrives 20 minutes late, Nunberg says he has already eaten at the same restaurant earlier in the day, and that he is having dinner with his mother later, so no food for him, just one Thai iced coffee after another that he cuts with water from his water glass.\n\nWords tumble out of Nunberg in a torrent, not always cohering into sentences, and occasionally contradicting something he said a few minutes ago. At our nondinner, he apologies for his ADD as he keeps going outside to vape.\n\nSam Nunberg was a name known only to a small coterie of political journalists until March 5, when it suddenly became inescapable. In a media barrage that will forever be known as The Full Nunberg, the former Donald Trump campaign aide streaked across the media landscape like a falling satellite. First he told The Washington Post that he had been subpoenaed by special counsel Robert Mueller but wouldn\u2019t show up. He then phoned in live to MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur, telling her that he thought it would be funny if Mueller arrested him for contempt of court and that \u201cTrump may very well have\u201d colluded with Russia during the election. Then he called CNN to assert that Trump didn\u2019t have anything to do with Russia, then CNN again and said that maybe Trump did, actually. He told POLITICO that Trump couldn\u2019t have colluded because he \u201ccan\u2019t keep his fucking mouth shut.\u201d It didn\u2019t end there. He repeated variations of his claims on the local news station NY1, then on MSNBC again, where a fellow panelist seemingly convinced him live on air that he would be looking at serious jail time if he didn\u2019t comply with the subpoena, and finally CNN again where host Erin Burnett asked point-blank if Nunberg was drunk. In the meantime, there were interviews with New York, The Atlantic, Vox, The Associated Press and The New York Times.\n\nPolitical Twitter went nuts. In newsrooms across America, Nunberg vanished from one screen in the TV bank only to reappear on another. Friends feared they were watching a spectacular flame-out, someone having a nervous breakdown in public and determined to go out in a blaze of glory. To Nunberg\u2014or at least to hear him tell it now\u2014it was all carefully choreographed. He was perfectly in control, seizing the chance for time in the spotlight, an out-in-the-cold political consultant cleverly leveraging the media\u2019s hunger for any inside dope about Trump.\n\nOur dinner ended up lasting nearly four hours, and at the end I\u2019m still not sure whether his accomplishment was a triumph or an embarrassment. And at a time when Trump is president\u2014a national spectacle that Nunberg himself helped engineer\u2014I\u2019m also not sure it matters anymore. There\u2019s no question, however, it was a perfect moment for our political-media age: Someone willing to bungee jump without making sure that the knot was tight enough, and a world thirsty to know what he knew about a similarly reckless administration. Was he a crazy man, or a chessmaster?\n\n\n\nEveryone who has encountered Sam Nunberg has a theory about him, and nobody is quite sure which theory is right, in part because Nunberg himself is as unreliable a narrator as you can find. He\u2019s known for making up stories to tell the press\u2014and then making up stories about those stories, so coverage turns into a hall of mirrors whose only occupant appears to be Nunberg, or (in better times) his political client.\n\nWhat drew Nunberg to politics, and to Trump, was Roy Cohn. The actual Cohn was a knife fighter of the legal world, a mentor to the young Trump who inspired the mogul\u2019s punch-back-harder, never-back-down political style. But Nunberg is talking about the Cohn of Angels in America, the one portrayed by Al Pacino, especially the part where he tells his young protege how he would have pulled the switch to execute Ethel Rosenberg himself if he could have\u2014how he leaned on the judge in her espionage case to put that \u201csweet unpreposessing woman, two kids, boo-hoo-hoo, reminded us all of our little Jewish mamas\u201d to death.\n\n\u201cWas it legal? Fuck legal,\u201d Nunberg says, jabbing his finger in the air and slowing down for a second in his best Pacino impression. \u201cAm I a nice man? Fuck nice! They say terrible things about me in The Nation? Fuck The Nation! You want to be nice or you want to be effective?! You want to make the law, or be subject to it? Choose!\u201d\n\nNunberg pauses, and resumes his own cadence. \u201cNow, is that good, is that bad, I don\u2019t know, whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me that just showed hard grit, tough, you can tell Roy Cohn, obviously Jewish, you know, tough guy, fighter, doesn\u2019t fuck around, was trying to work the system for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that that was depicted as being bad,\u201d he says, \u201cthat to me was ironic, because by the way, that\u2019s the way the sauce is made. It was like almost Machiavellian to me. But it\u2019s an out-front Machiavelli. He was open about it. On the one hand, you don\u2019t want your enemy to see you coming, but sometimes you want people to think of you as a crazy man.\u201d\n\nThe person sitting across from me appears to be the opposite of the diminutive, tightly focused Cohn. There\u2019s something hard to pin down about Nunberg. On one hand, he looks older than his 36 years, dark circles under his eyes suggesting sleepless nights, but on the other he can seem a bit like a child inflated to adult size. Cohn was a ruthlessly successful lawyer who divided his time between New York, Washington and a country house in Connecticut. Nunberg just moved out of his parents\u2019 house. Cohn was a killer; Nunberg, as former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo put it, \u201cis not a backstabbing soulless climber in an arena where that is almost required.\u201d (One friend of Nunberg\u2019s described him more as \u201ca yenta,\u201d someone who thrives on political gossip, true or not, calling friends in the political world dozens of times a day to find out the latest.) Cohn was tanned and dandyish, an aficionado of the plastic surgeon\u2019s scalpel; Nunberg is dressed plainly, in blue jeans and a sweater, though he does plan to stop by the tanning salon before it closes.\n\n\u201cI like to say I am only bad to three people in my life,\u201d Nunberg says. \u201cPeople that are disloyal to me, people that hurt my friends. Well, OK, four people. People that are disloyal to me, people that hurt my friends, people that hurt my clients, people that my clients hire me to hurt, and myself occasionally, unfortunately.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, so that\u2019s five. Those are the five people I am bad to.\u201d\n\n\n\nSam Nunberg first crossed paths with Donald Trump on April 2, 1989. It was WrestleMania V. Nunberg\u2019s father is an attorney, and worked with Gerald Schrager, Trump\u2019s longtime real estate attorney and adviser. They were sitting behind Donald and Ivana, and Donald moved the Nunbergs so he could get into a photo shot with some dignitary sitting on the other side of the ring. Nunberg was then a student at Ramaz, an elite private Jewish school on the Upper East Side that counts Michael Mukasey and Philippe Reines as alumni. His mother was a corporate attorney at the white-shoe law firm Wachtell, Lipton, and counted Bain Capital as one of her clients. They were Democrats until the Clinton era\u2014Nunberg interned with Upper West Side liberal lion Jerry Nadler\u2014when the household became, in Nunberg\u2019s words, \u201cClinton-haters.\u201d He started listening to Mark Levin on the radio.\n\nAfter college, inspired he said, by the movie Men in Black, Nunberg enrolled in Touro Law School, a fourth-tier, $40,000-a-year law school on Long Island. There he restarted the law school\u2019s Federalist Society, using it to build up a network in conservative politics. When the 2008 campaign rolled around, even though his father had done legal work for members of the Rudy Giuliani administration when they left City Hall, Nunberg volunteered for his rival in the Republican primary, Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cMitt was the most conservative candidate in the race. Frankly, he looked the best out of everybody,\u201d Nunberg says. \u201cAnd going to Touro Law School, if I went to go work for the Rudy campaign, I would be licking envelopes for the students at NYU Law School. I hate to be, but you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nHe traveled to Iowa with the Romney campaign, where, he says, he and a couple of other campaign aides concocted a stunt: They would mail anonymous letters to Iowa pastors, warning them that the IRS would come after them if they endorsed Mike Huckabee. The letters were sent from Missouri to make them less traceable.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I made the Drudge Report!\u201d Nunberg says now with evident pride.\n\nIn Iowa, he met Jay Sekulow, who leads the American Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit founded by Pat Robertson to advocate for Christian values. (Sekulow, a right-wing messianic Jew who also hosts a radio show, is now on Trump\u2019s personal legal team.) Sekulow hired him for the group\u2019s fledgling New York operation, and in 2010, when a Manhattan developer named Sharif El-Gamal attempted to build an Islamic community center in lower Manhattan, Nunberg got his first chance to kick up a dirt storm on the political scene.\n\nThe issue was the \u201cGround Zero Mosque,\u201d a building that was neither at Ground Zero nor a mosque. Anti-Islamic firebrands like Pamela Geller seized on the issue, and tried to whip up public anger at the idea of an Islamic anything near the site of World Trade Center attacks. At ACLJ, there was some hesitancy about getting involved in the issue, and \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you kidding me? This is going to be a national fucking issue! It is going to be an international issue!\u2019\u201d Nunberg says.\n\nAt a Landmarks Preservation Commission hearing, Nunberg represented a fireman who was opposed to the construction of the center, and he introduced testimony from his own uncle, who lived near the site. Building the center \u201cwould be like removing the sunken ship in Pearl Harbor to erect a memorial to the Japanese kamikazes killed in the attack,\" Nunberg told me with a big laugh. He was quoting himself. \u201cIt became an international soundbite!\u201d (This is true\u2014the soundbite landed Nunberg on NPR, was picked up by a number of newspapers and became part of the official talking points in opposition to the project.)\n\nThere was a Republican primary for governor going on in New York, and Nunberg decided to see who\u2019d be willing to take it on as a campaign issue. He says he took the story to the front-runner, former Congressman Rick Lazio, but his campaign team was ambivalent about it. Then he took it to Carl Paladino, a Buffalo developer running a long-shot campaign, and someone who had promised to take a baseball bat to Albany\u2019s entrenched political class. Paladino seized on the issue immediately, promising to use eminent domain to prevent the building\u2019s construction. He won the primary by 24 points.\n\nAs Nunberg tells the story, he kept going, and took the issue national. He says he began calling the White House desks of news organizations like AP and Reuters from an undisclosed number, leaving harassing phone messages asking, \u201cYou chicken shits, when are you going to ask [White House press secretary Robert] Gibbs about the ground zero mosque?\u201d\n\nEventually someone did, and Gibbs responded that the White House didn\u2019t want to get involved in local decision-making. But later, President Barack Obama did mention it. At a gathering at the White House the Friday evening before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Obama said he believed \"Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was at the Iftar dinner!\u201d Nunberg says. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?! That was like manna from heaven.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to know how much of this account\u2014or the Huckabee letters, or meeting Trump at WrestleMania\u2014is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. The checkable facts largely check out, but Nunberg is known as someone willing to traffic in untruths with reporters. \u201cHe likes to spread lies,\u201d said one associate of Nunberg\u2019s. \u201cHe loves to see some lie he told get into print. He thinks it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\nMost famously, he made up a story about Chris Christie fetching cheeseburgers for Trump on the campaign\u2014an anecdote that made its way into The New Yorker and which he said was justified because \u201cI despise Chris Christie. So I kept going around telling every reporter watch that fat-ass go buy hamburgers for Trump like a good little bitch.\u201d (To try to track down the true story of the story is to enter that Nunberg hall of mirrors: He claims to have made up the story, but also, in his telling, it doesn\u2019t count as making it up since it turned out to be true. A Christie spokesman vociferously denied the account, and the reporter who first brought the story to light, Ryan Lizza, then with the The New Yorker, stands by it and has denied Nunberg was his source, and for that matter, so has Nunberg.)\n\nNunberg tells me his favorite book is Trust Me, I Am Lying by former American Apparel media stuntman Ryan Holiday. \u201cThere is something about manipulating media that I love. It\u2019s like Katy Tur said: \u2018Who is Sam Nunberg? You gotta talk to him. Occasionally, he will give you something that is true, but usually you need to confirm it with three other people.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, he has limits.\n\n\u201cI have never, nor would I ever, lie to [Washington Post reporter Robert] Costa or to my Magela.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Magela. I call Maggie Haberman [of The New York Times] my Magela. You know, like Mamela. Maggie is like my aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if she feels that way, actually.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe person who really connected Nunberg with Trump is the man who he cites as his mentor: Roger Stone, the legendary dirty trickster of Republican politics, with a massive tattoo of Richard Nixon\u2019s face across his back. Nunberg became enamored of Stone for appearing, at least, to have orchestrated the downfall of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer. (Later, when Spitzer attempted a comeback run for New York City comptroller, Nunberg and Stone trolled him mercilessly, convincing a woman who claimed to operate a brothel that Spitzer frequented to run against him as a Libertarian, and bringing black socks\u2014which Spitzer was said to keep on during his liaisons\u2014to the victory night party of his opponent.) During the ground zero mosque controversy, he says, he met Stone at a bar during the New York state Republican convention. Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, was working for Paladino. That same summer, Trump offered to buy the site where the ground zero mosque was supposed to be built for $6 million, a move that was dismissed by the developer\u2019s attorneys as a \u201ccheap publicity stunt.\u201d\n\nNunberg says it was Stone who arranged for him to meet Trump for the first time. It was 2011, and Stone and Jonny Daniels, a PR agent who counts Benjamin Netanyahu as among his clients, wanted Trump to visit Israel in the run-up to another possible presidential campaign. Nunberg told him about their family connection and about meeting him at WrestleMania years before, and Trump hired him as a political jack-of-all trades, printing out news articles, keeping an eye out for political gossip, doing research and writing, handling the press and later mapping out a way that Trump could run as an independent in 2012.\n\nUntil he was broomed out four years later, Nunberg never left.\n\nTrump had been a clownish figure around New York for most of Nunberg\u2019s childhood, someone more famous for talking about sex with Howard Stern than trying to stir up populist anger against the Washington swamp. Most people in the elite Upper East Side world of private schools and corporate law firms\u2014the world Nunberg inhabited\u2014rolled their eyes at the thought of Trump, if they thought of him at all. Nunberg, though, was intrigued by the brashness and the airbrushed glamour.\n\nHe started dressing like Trump in flashy suits and ostentatious ties. He watched how would-be presidents and potentates came to kiss the ring at Trump Tower, and how Trump dealt with critics. Nunberg says he and Stone started dictating tweets to Trump\u2019s longtime assistant Rhona Graff, and Nunberg would map out on a spreadsheet a running tally of what Trump tweeted about to make sure his business and brands got enough airplay. When Jon Huntsman pointedly refused to supplicate himself before Trump like other rivals to the GOP nomination in 2012, Stone and Nunberg counseled Trump to go on the attack. \u201c@JonHuntsman has zero chance of getting the nomination,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhoever said I wanted to meet him? Time is money and I don\u2019t waste mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt blew up!\u201d says Nunberg. \u201cIt was on \u2018Entertainment Tonight,\u2018 it was in People Magazine. People were saying that Huntsman was Trump\u2019s new Rosie.\u201d\n\nWhen no one believed that Trump would actually run for president, let alone could win, Nunberg believed. \u201cTo him, Donald Trump hung the moon,\u201d Caputo said\n\nCaputo, a veteran political adviser to Trump, looks at Nunberg with an almost older-brother like affection, and he gives Nunberg significant credit for helping lay out the themes and the approach to the campaign that would launch Trump to the White House. \u201cHis DNA was all over the Trump campaign. Corey [Lewandowski] may have set him up to win, and [Paul] Manafort got him through the convention and Kellyanne [Conway] got him over the finish line, but none of that would have happened if it weren\u2019t for Sam.\u201d\n\nNunberg says the idea of a border wall with Mexico was his, inspired by watching how Paladino and Lazio approached the idea of the ground zero mosque. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, maybe we need to let some of these people in, maybe we put some of them in the back of the line, maybe we do this, maybe we do that,\u201d he said in his best impression of an immigration squish. \u201cNo, fuck that! We are building a wall and we are deporting them all. Trump\u2019s a builder anyway. And you get Mexico to pay for it! It\u2019s like one of his licensing deals!\u201d\n\nAs it happened, Nunberg barely survived into the campaign. He lost his job with Trump in August 2015 when Business Insider published a series of racist Facebook posts Nunberg had written eight years before, including one in which he called Al Sharpton\u2019s daughter a \u201cn---!\u201d Nunberg admits to writing them, and knows it was a mistake. He blames their excavation on Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who he said had it in for him from the beginning.\n\nAfterward, Nunberg fell into deep and lasting depression. He says he had trouble getting out of bed, and couldn\u2019t read or work. He credits Steve Bannon with helping him get back on his feet by giving him a bit of work, as well as the GOP operative Arthur Schwartz.\n\n\u201cThat was bad. That a very hard experience. And I wasn\u2019t good to myself. I don\u2019t want to get into it but I wasn\u2019t. It took therapy, and it took help from other people,\u201d he says, \u201cand I will admit that. And there is nothing wrong with that. But I wasn\u2019t good to myself. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNunberg watched from the sidelines as the political animal he helped feed made it all the way to the White House. As the Russia investigation intensified, he was cut off from old friends like Bannon and Stone. And as the White House whipped through personnel changes, Nunberg, whose life is political gossip, found himself less and less in the know. He would occasionally appear on the record or on background in stories about Trump when the perspective of a \u201cformer campaign aide\u201d was needed, but even those calls had begun to dry up.\n\n\n\nWhen Nunberg was subpoenaed by Robert Mueller in the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the campaign, \u201cIt brought stuff back in. At the same time I was getting these calls [from bookers and reporters] and it is almost like I am manic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo imagine, holy shit, I was called a low-level part-time consultant and suddenly I am pulling of one of the greatest media days of all time.\u201d\n\nHe views March 5 as a form of therapy, and as an unqualified professional success\n\n\u201cThis is a fact: When I did Ari Melber he won in total viewers and the demo. When I did Erin Burnett, she won in total viewers and the demo,\u201d he said, reiterating a point he brought up to me repeatedly. (He later texted me, unprompted, with a screen grab of the ratings on the date in question.) \u201cDid you notice there was one station I didn\u2019t go on that day? Fox. You know why? They are the only ones that never invited me on before. That day, I had like eight invitations from them to come on different shows, and I can show them to you.\u201d\n\nFriends were convinced Nunberg was drunk on air, and were emailing and texting television producers and hosts to get him off. Burnett asked him about it on air, telling him that she could smell alcohol on his breath. \u201cShe says to me, \u2018Are you on something?\u2019 And you know what I wanted to say? \u2018Yeah, I am on something\u2014I am on your show, giving you ratings like you never had before.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe affair set off a round of media finger-wagging, with some political journalists suggesting\u2014at the urging of Nunberg\u2019s friends\u2014that it was unethical to put him in front of all those television cameras. He was having some kind of psychotic break, he was drunk on the attention, or he was just plain drunk.\n\nNunberg isn\u2019t having any of it. He\u2019d had a drink the day before, he says, and went to his favorite bar afterward, the preppy New York enclave Dorrian\u2019s Red Hand, but all he had that day was his antidepressant medication.\n\n\u201cPeople told me I was used and abused. I knew what I was doing. I could have stopped it any time if I wanted to,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard someone on TV say, \u2018Oh Sam, he\u2019s an unbelievable attention-seeker.\u2019 There you are, sitting on fucking TV and you are telling me I am the attention-seeker.\u201d\n\nNunberg thinks Trump probably appreciated his television tour\u2014the brashness of it, for one, and the fact that he was able to command so much media attention for one night.\n\nIt was he said, a way to communicate with Trump, too. To say, \u201cWhy do I have to be drawn into your bullshit? I don\u2019t do anything to you. I want you to be successful. You know, I have a weird relationship with him. Maybe one day I can, maybe one day not. I like him. Why do I have to be drawn into his bullshit?\u201d\n\nWhen Trump fired him, as Nunberg recounts it, he told him it wasn\u2019t just the Facebook posts. He told Nunberg, \u201cEvery few months there is something new with you.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Trump did indeed tell that to Nunberg, he was right. Even cast into the outer darkness of the Trumpian orbit, Nunberg sees himself as a political operative of the highest order, always hatching, or getting embroiled in, something new. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many people at my level, I can tell you that,\u201d he said when asked about which current political professionals he admires. Like Trump, and like Cohn for that matter, Nunberg never forgets. It\u2019s been 2\u00bd years since he was fired, and he remains at war with anyone who he thinks slighted him, ever.\n\nWhen the Drudge Report published the news that Trump had named Brad Parscale his 2020 campaign manager, it was the same day that it was announced that Jared Kushner was losing his security clearance and that top Kushner aide Josh Raffel was leaving the White House. Nunberg, who considers Kushner a leftist who leaked to Drudge, sent an email to Drudge with the subject line, \u201cSorry Asshole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour little escapade failed,\u201d Nunberg wrote. \u201cThe Parscale announcement doesn\u2019t outdo Raffel leaving and your crush losing his security access. Fuck you sellout bitch hypocrite. You useless aggregator. Go shoot yourself up with more drugs. Warm regards, Sam.\u201d\n\nAnd Nunberg continues to be at war with Lewandowski. He told me with evident pride that he orchestrated the story of Lewandowski and Hope Hicks\u2019 argument that landed on Page Six in New York Post. \u201cWe are like high school mean girls. The whole Trump circle. We fight and we try to kill each other and then some of us make up in a week and some of us don\u2019t and some of us will always hate each other.\u201d\n\nTrump and Nunberg haven\u2019t talked since December 2015, Nunberg says. That\u2019s when Gawker published Trump\u2019s cellphone number, and Trump accused Nunberg of leaking it. (Nunberg thinks Lewandowski did it just to undermine him, so that Trump would be forced to abandon his cellphone and Nunberg would be unable to communicate with him.) He wrote Trump a letter after he was elected, telling him how proud he was of the president. Trump wrote a nice note back.\n\n\u201cI said a lot of bad things that day when I was stressed out [on television.] He did give me a lot of chances, and if it was up to him I would be on that campaign. He is not a bad guy. He is actually a sweet guy, frankly. He has a heart.\u201d\n\nCaputo says all of the people from the early of days of the Trump for president gambit are \u201clike an island of misfit toys. Sam is the jack-in-the-box.\n\n\u201cHe left his heart in Trump Tower,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cI just hope he finds it someday.\u201d\n\nUnlike some others who fell out of Trump\u2019s orbit, Nunberg has nothing to fall back on\u2014no job on Wall Street, no Kennedy School post waiting for him. He can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, leverage his former access to the White House to get work. He has a small consulting business that has only three clients for now, all of whom he declined to name. Nunberg listens to Preet Bharara\u2019s podcast to find out what\u2019s going on in the Russia investigation\u2014and if he gets wrapped up in it further, it will cost him tens of thousands of dollars. Someone who just got back on his feet could easily find himself knocked off them again, and his star turn before the klieg lights doesn\u2019t appear to have helped matters much.\n\nThe lure of those lights, however, is not something he has been able to avoid. In fact, Nunberg\u2019s media tour has slowed down only slightly since that Monday. He was on Ari Melber the next day, and ABC radio, and CNN, and was fielding requests throughout our conversation. They get less and less attention though, just another talking head talking his way through the news of the day. After his star turn digging in against Mueller, he quickly reversed himself and said he would in fact cooperate with the special counsel.\n\nOur dinner, such as it was, ended sometime around 10 p.m. He kept checking the mirror, wondering if he needed to get to the tanning salon, if his face was too red for TV. His mother kept calling, and he kept on pushing back their dinner, eventually canceling it, saying he was being interviewed for a profile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut that stuff down?\u201d she wanted to know. Eventually he had to go. The tanning salon was about to close, and he needed one more turn under the lights.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachael Bade", "body": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    Congressional leaders on verge of massive spending deal \n                        \n\n                \n                        But lawmakers will have to move quickly to avoid a shutdown on Friday night.\n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n\n        \n            By HEATHER CAYGLE, BURGESS EVERETT and RACHAEL BADE\n\n    03/21/2018 09:09 AM EDT\n\n                    \n\n\n        \n\nCongressional leaders are nearing agreement on a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, staving off a shutdown if both chambers can act by Friday night.\n \n Most major issues, including funding for a massive New York transportation project and the border wall have been resolved. But negotiators are still haggling over a plan to fix a snafu in the GOP\u2019s tax law \u2014 the so-called \u201cgrain glitch\u201d \u2014 that ag state lawmakers are seeking.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is opposed to the latest proposed \u201cgrain glitch\u201d fix, delaying the announcement of a final deal, according to two sources. But a Democratic aide disputes that the grain glitch standoff is the only thing holding up a deal, saying multiple issues, including provisions related to guns, are still in question.\n \n The Big Four \u2014 Pelosi, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2014 will meet later Wednesday morning to hash out the final details with text expected to be posted at noon.\n \n Congressional leaders are still hoping to avoid the need for a short-term spending bill to keep the government open for a few days beyond Friday. But if the spending bill is released Wednesday as planned, the House will likely vote on the measure Thursday, giving the Senate just one day to clear the deal before funding expires.\n \n Under this timetable, any single senator could cause a brief government shutdown under Senate rules and push work into the weekend. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul has pointedly refused to rule out doing so.\n \n The bill provides nearly $1.6 billion for border security, but does not include any money for an increase in detention beds or federal deportation agents, a key priority for Democrats in the talks.\n \n The deal provides $641 million for new fencing, including levees, but does not allocate money for a concrete wall, according to a source familiar with the agreement. The proposal also includes nearly $1.3 billion for other border security technologies. \n \n Negotiators also agreed to a compromise of sorts on the Gateway project. President Donald Trump had vowed to veto the must-pass spending bill if it included funding for the $900 million tunnel project, a top priority for Schumer and other New York and New Jersey lawmakers.\n \n The bill doesn\u2019t provide the specific funding for the project but does include funding increases for other federal transportation accounts, including Amtrak, that will allow tunnel construction to begin.\n \n Pelosi is holding up an agreement on one of the final sticking points, according to two sources familiar with the issue: a deal to fix a glitch in the GOP\u2019s tax law in exchange for a temporary boost in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.\n \n One of the sources said Pelosi is blocking a \u201cthree-corners\u201d agreement between Ryan, McConnell and Schumer because of concerns about her own growers in California \u2014 even as some Democrats from agriculture states join Republicans in their desire to fix the problem.\n \n The so-called \u201cgrain glitch\u201d lowers the tax bills of farmers that sell grain to cooperatives but at the expense of other farmers. Democrats at one point had sworn off allowing Republicans to iron out problems in their partisan tax bill passed last December. But many vulnerable swing-state and swing-district Democrats also want the relief for their own agriculture sectors back home.\n \n Pelosi\u2019s opposition comes just a day after Ryan also rejected a separate deal on the matter that had the backing of Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell. Democrats sought an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that Senate Republicans were ready to grant, but Ryan vetoed the proposal. Since then, a source familiar said Ryan, McConnell and Schumer have agreed to an increase in the annual housing credit for the poor for four years as well as some changes to income averaging rules.\n \n In the end, congressional leaders ended up abandoning negotiations on many of the most controversial provisions lawmakers were trying to include in the must-pass bill \u2014 likely the last major piece of legislation to reach Trump\u2019s desk before the midterms.\n \n There is no agreement to protect so-called Dreamers, as Democrats had initially sought, or cuts to funding for sanctuary cities, as Republicans had wanted. \n \n Lawmakers also gave up on efforts to stabilize Obamacare markets through subsidies known as cost-sharing reduction payments after both sides failed to settle a dispute over restrictions on abortion.\n \n The deal does not include a provision to protect special counsel Robert Mueller if he\u2019s fired by Trump \u2014 as Schumer and Pelosi had wanted \u2014 but it does provide for an increase in funding to fight Russian hacking ahead of the November elections.\n\n The proposal includes an increase in the FBI\u2019s budget to combat Russia cyberattacks this year and provides an additional $380 million for technology grants that will allow states to secure election systems.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Though long-expected, revoking the Cole Memo nonetheless caused anxiety throughout the financially galloping marijuana industry and confirmed for most observers that he was the chief antagonist of legal marijuana in Washington.\n\nBut while the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer has made it abundantly clear over the years that he views marijuana as a scourge equal to heroin, it turns out the unofficial title of Washington\u2019s most powerful marijuana opponent belongs to someone else named Sessions: Pete, the longtime congressman from Texas\u2019 32nd district in Dallas. No relation to the attorney general, Pete Sessions nevertheless shares the former Alabama senator\u2019s unforgiving attitudes toward all things cannabis.\n\n\u201cMarijuana is an addictive product, and the merchants of addiction make it that way,\u201d Pete Sessions said in January. \u201cThey make it to where our people, our young people, become addicted to marijuana and keep going.\u201d In February, at an opioid summit at the University of Texas Southwestern, Rep. Sessions stretched scientific fact when he said, today\u2019s product is \u201c300 times more powerful\u201d than when he went to high school. (Later, his communications director confirmed that he meant three times more powerful.)\n\nWhat Pete Sessions has, however, that Jeff Sessions doesn\u2019t have is the power to change laws. Very quietly, but with implacable efficiency, Pete Sessions has used his position as the chair of the House Rules Committee to stymie or roll back amendments that protected legal marijuana in the 29 states that have approved it (30 states if you count Louisiana). States that have grown increasingly dependent on tax revenue from newly legal marijuana businesses, and investors who are pumping millions into an industry that is projected to hit $28 billion globally by 2024, have sought assurances that federal authorities wouldn\u2019t try to invoke national drug law that still classifies marijuana as one of the most serious of all illegal drugs. Short of changing federal drug law, legislators in the states with forms of legal pot have sought the next best protection: using the power of the purse to curtail enforcement. But Sessions, with the approval of House leadership, has thwarted his colleagues. He neutralized one amendment that sailed through with a comfortable bipartisan majority and smothered others that would pass if they were ever allowed to see the light of day.\n\nSo far, the only people who have complained are the legislators whose amendments he has torpedoed and pro-marijuana lobbyists. That criticism has never troubled Sessions in his 16-year career. But recent polling indicates that 83 percent of Texas voters now favor legalizing medical marijuana, and that seems to be feeding a nascent campaign to use Sessions\u2019 anti-marijuana influence against him in the 2018 midterm election. Even some Texas Republicans think his zealousness on the issue violates essential conservative principles of less government. \u201cHe\u2019s got this personal viewpoint; he\u2019s just personally against it. And there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to change his mind,\u201d said Zoe Russell, of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP). \u201cThat\u2019s the absolute worst of big government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s easy to see the high-water mark of the legal marijuana movement in Congress. It was the summer of 2015, and legislators seemed to open the floodgates to yes votes on marijuana measures.\n\nThe year before, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment had passed for the first time, after seven tries. As a floor amendment to an appropriations bill and not a full bill in its own right, the measure completely bypassed the formidable House Judiciary Committee, the longstanding cemetery for marijuana legalization efforts. The downside of this tactic was that it had to be reauthorized every year with the budget, but it didn\u2019t seem like it would be a problem. As more states went legal, support was broadening within Congress, and in 2015, it was reauthorized with 23 additional votes.\n\nWith legalization efforts advancing around the country, it seemed to nearly everyone that 2016 would be the last time the marijuana prohibitionists would control the chamber. But this optimism did not account for the power of Pete Sessions, who knew there was still a way to stop the inexorable march of marijuana legalization, even when the legalizers had the votes.\n\nThe turning point came on an issue that had nothing to do with marijuana. On May 19, 2016, a vote was held on a floor amendment meant to protect LGBT rights in the federal contracting process. The amendment had enough votes to pass, but House leadership kept the vote open long enough to flip a sufficient handful of votes to defeat it. Shouts of \u201cShame!\u201d erupted from the House floor, and headlines referred to the aftermath as \u201cchaos.\u201d In a House Republican Conference meeting on June 8, members decided the way to avoid such embarrassments going forward was to use the Rules Committee to structure the appropriations process so that such \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments would be out of order. If the amendments couldn\u2019t be offered, there would be no votes and therefore no bad publicity. It was a complete reversal of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s promise to operate the House under regular order. \u201cMy goal as speaker is to return to what we call regular order\u2026 so that Congress works more smoothly, and more democratically,\u201d Ryan said in December 2015, a pledge that lasted all of six months. Now that Sessions has jammed up the Rules Committee for two years, Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman told POLITICO Magazine that, \u201cChairman Sessions has run the committee in a fair manner while advancing a robust agenda and the priorities of this majority.\u201d\n\nPro-marijuana advocates didn\u2019t learn that their issue had been put on the blacklist until Tuesday night, June 21. That\u2019s when Sessions\u2019 committee ruled a marijuana banking amendment out of order. Perhaps it would have received more attention if everyone\u2019s attention had not turned to the party conventions and the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats, for the first time ever, added a plank to their party\u2019s platform aimed at reforming the nation\u2019s marijuana laws. Meanwhile, Sessions killed at least three more marijuana amendments. One gave veterans better access to medical marijuana. Another was Rohrabacher-Farr, which could hardly be called a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d since it had already passed the House twice. And the third was an amendment known as McClintock-Polis, named for Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.), which aimed to do for states that had legalized recreational marijuana what Rohrabacher-Farr had done for the medical marijuana states. McClintock-Polis had failed narrowly in 2015, but it was understood to have the votes to pass in 2016. Thanks to Sessions, it never got to the floor.\n\nThe only thing that has prevented Pete Sessions from completely wiping out protections for medical marijuana, and freeing Jeff Sessions\u2019 Department of Justice to execute the crackdown he seems to pine for, is Congress\u2019 own dysfunction. Because Congress could not agree on a budget, Rohrabacher-Farr has remained alive through a series of never-ending continuous resolutions. In addition, the Senate hasn\u2019t been quite so willing to stifle its members\u2019 wills on this issue; Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has proposed a companion amendment to Rohrabacher-Farr, which passed the Senate\u2019s appropriations committee by acclamation.\n\nAfter Jeff Sessions repealed the Cole Memo in January, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi demanded that Congress fix the damage caused by both Sessionses by approving the Rohrabacher-Farr/Leahy amendment, and even expanding it to protect state legal recreational marijuana programs, as the blacklisted McClintock-Polis amendment was designed to do. \u201cCongress must now take action to ensure that state law is respected, and that Americans who legally use marijuana are not subject to federal prosecution,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement on January 4. \u201cDemocrats will continue to insist on bipartisan provisions in appropriations bills that protect Americans lawfully using medical marijuana. Congress should now consider expanding the provisions to cover those states that have decriminalized marijuana generally.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether the appropriations conference committee will approve the Senate version with the Leahy amendment or the House version that killed Rohrabacher-Farr remains to be answered. The current continuing resolution ends on Friday at midnight.\n\nDon Murphy, director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, bemoaned the fact that the Republican Party has surrendered ownership of marijuana reform as Democratic support for the issue gains steam: \u201cWhat had once been a GOP effort known simply as \u2018Rohrabacher\u2019 after [Republican Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s] decade-long sponsorship, will now be known as \u2018the Leahy Amendment.\u2019 It\u2019s a missed opportunity for the GOP.\u201d\n\nWhen he speaks publicly about marijuana, Pete Sessions often positions himself as a bulwark against just that kind of Republican accommodation, insisting even against mounting evidence to the contrary that marijuana is a gateway drug to the opioid epidemic. This is a viewpoint shared by Jeff Sessions but not by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, generally an anti-marijuana group, which acknowledges \u201cthe observed drop in opioid overdose death rates in states where marijuana use is legal for medicinal purposes. One study found that states with \u2018medical marijuana\u2019 laws had a 24.8 percent lower average annual opioid overdose death rate compared to states without similar laws.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nSince Pete Sessions halted congressional movement on marijuana legalization, the states have steamrolled ahead in perfect disregard of his personal beef with the plant. In November 2016, California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine approved full recreational use. Arkansas, Florida and North Dakota legalized medical marijuana by ballot measure, and Pennsylvania and Ohio approved medical marijuana by state legislation. In 2017, West Virginia became the 29th state to legalize medical marijuana. So far in 2018, Vermont implemented a full legal law, the first state to do so by state legislature. A legalization bill is currently working its way through the New Jersey legislature. In Michigan, full legalization is on the ballot in November, and voters in Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah will have the opportunity to vote their states into the medical marijuana club.\n\nThe signs that the Drug War is thawing even in deep-red Texas are hard to miss In 2015, the Texas legislature passed an extremely limited medical marijuana program that grants access to non-psychoactive CBD concentrates to Texans suffering from epilepsy. Given that the Drug Enforcement Administration still considers non-psychoactive CBD to be a drug with no medicinal value, Texas\u2019 tiptoe into the waters of medical marijuana legalization has been an act of civil disobedience against a federal drug enforcement policy that is staunchly defended by the likes of Pete Sessions. In Dallas County, where the majority of Sessions\u2019 constituents reside, police no longer arrest people caught with up to a quarter pound of marijuana, opting instead for a cite-and-release program meant to unclog the jails and judicial system, following the example of similar programs in San Antonio, Houston and Austin.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sessions finds himself defending his congressional seat in 2018 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by nearly 2 percentage points just two years ago. The Cook Political Report rates the race as leans Republican, but does Sessions\u2019 opposition to marijuana law reform make him more vulnerable to a Democratic challenger in November? Some Republicans fear that medical marijuana might be an effective wedge issue that could steer Republican voters toward a Democrat who supports marijuana law reform at the national level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Republican and will certainly not be voting for [Sessions] ever again,\u201d Mark Zartler told POLITICO Magazine. Zartler and his family are residents of Sessions\u2019 district; they made news when they went public with a video showing them medicating their severely autistic daughter with medical marijuana, which is illegal under Texas and federal law. Their video has been viewed over 88 million times. Mark Zartler sees Sessions as the reason his family has been put in legal jeopardy. \u201cAs you can imagine, he\u2019s not my favorite,\u201d Zartler told me.\n\nColin Allred and Lillian Salerno are the two candidates in the Democratic runoff election in May for the chance to run against Sessions in November. Neither Democrat has the word \u201cmarijuana\u201d on their campaign websites. Yet when asked by POLITICO Magazine, both candidates spoke in favor of medical marijuana legalization at the federal level, and both pointed to Sessions as a part of the problem.\n\nSalerno said, \u201cThe fact that Pete Sessions wants to deny sick kids, seniors and veterans access to the compassionate care they need by blocking medical marijuana is unconscionable. We demand new policy that stops the criminalization of communities of color, and allows states to generate revenue through regulation.\u201d\n\nAllred is on the same page: \u201cI support the use of medical marijuana as an alternative to the habit-forming opioids that have become a national crisis. This common-sense approach to alternative treatments has been opposed by Pete Sessions, and is something I will fight to expand.\u201d\n\nThese Democrats might be late to the pro-marijuana party, but Sessions has made so many enemies among the drug policy reform crowd that they are ready to support whichever Democrat emerges from the May runoff.\n\n\u201cPete Sessions has made himself the No. 1 target of drug policy reformers in the 2018 general election,\u201d Don Murphy of MPP told POLITICO Magazine. \u201cDefeating Pete Sessions in 2018 will send a message to Washington that even the tone-deaf GOP can\u2019t miss.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Murphy\u2019s prediction appears to be taking shape in Texas.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which Democrat wins. Either way, we\u2019re going to un-elect him,\u201d said Rob Kampia, the former executive director of MPP. Kampia\u2019s new venture is the Marijuana Leadership Campaign and its companion Marijuana Leadership PAC. \u201cOur invitation-only launch meeting was held in Dallas,\u201d he told POLITICO Magazine, \u201cand I can safely say we'll be spending $500,000 on this singular congressional race.\u201d\n\nKampia and his crew will need every penny if they want to dislodge Sessions from the House Rules Committee, where he\u2019s been chairman since 2013, which makes this year his sixth, and theoretically final year, but a spokeswoman for Rep. Tom Cole, the Oklahoma Republican and vice chair of the Rules Committee, told POLITICO Magazine that Cole \u201csupports the reappointment of Chairman Sessions should the Speaker do so, and the Congressman [Cole] has no desire to seek the chairmanship himself.\u201d\n\nSessions had $1.2 million cash on hand on February 14, the end of the most recent reporting period, but that doesn\u2019t account for the last month\u2019s worth of spending to win his March 6 primary by nearly 59 points.

Focusing on her role in the negotiation of Obama\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, the article was headlined, \u201cIran deal architect is running Tehran policy at the State Dept.\u201d \nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Nowrouzzadeh emailed Brian Hook, the new chief of the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, where she worked on Middle East issues, to insist that the article was \u201cfilled with misinformation.\u201d She assured Hook that, since joining the government under George W. Bush in 2005, she had always \u201cadapted\u201d to shifting U.S. policy priorities \u2013 as any career government staffer is expected to do. She asked for his help in correcting the record. \n\nHook was already well aware of the story. The article, which appeared in an obscure online publication called Conservative Review, had caused a stir among conservative activists and incoming Trump officials who were busy trying to establish who Nowrouzzadeh was \u2014 and whether she could be purged. \n\nAccording to emails obtained by POLITICO, the agitators included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who sent the article to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff; and an official who falsely claimed in an email to top Tillerson aides that Nowrouzzadeh \u201cwas born in Iran,\u201d and also that she had wept after Trump\u2019s election.\n\nThe emails show that State Department and White House officials repeatedly shared such misleading information about Nowrouzzadeh, deriding her as an Obama cheerleader and strong advocate for the nuclear deal with Iran, which Trump had repeatedly denounced. Later, after Nowrouzzadeh was reassigned to another job, some State Department officials tried to mislead a POLITICO reporter about whether she\u2019d completed her full tenure in Hook\u2019s policy shop. \n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The Global Politico\n                                Susan B.

In one email, a staffer was described as \u201ca leaker and a troublemaker\u201d while another was branded a \u201cturncoat.\u201d \n\nAlthough career staffers generally observe an ethos of nonpartisanship, many Trump officials saw them as constituting a \u201cdeep state\u201d cabal determined to sabotage the new president\u2019s agenda. The emails also suggest that Nowrouzzadeh may have been targeted in part because of her ethnicity, which would be a violation of federal employment law.\n\nThe emails were the subject of a Thursday letter to the White House and State Department from Rep. Elijah Cummings and Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, respectively. The letter called the emails, provided to Congress by an unnamed whistleblower, \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and demands further documents from the Trump administration.\n\nIn the early months of Trump\u2019s presidency, conservative media organizations such as Breitbart News and the Conservative Review published several stories singling out career civil and foreign service staffers by name. The reports often called such employees \u201cObama holdovers\u201d \u2014 even though many, like Nowrouzzadeh, joined the government well before Obama took office \u2014 and urged their firing. The stories were terrifying to career employees who in some cases had spent decades working out of the spotlight. Nowrouzzadeh, who would not comment for this article, told Hook that she feared for her safety.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that the makeup of the Policy Planning Staff reflects a bias against career civil servants is completely without merit,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told POLITICO. Nauert said that more than half of the office\u2019s current staff members are career professionals from the foreign and civil service and the military. \u201cThe details of Policy Planning's staffing under Director Hook demonstrate that career civil servants continue to play an integral role, as do political appointees,\u201d she added.\n\nThere are currently 14 career professionals on the Policy Planning Staff \u2013 two from the Foreign Service, nine from the Civil Service, and three from the military.\n\n    \n\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                            President Barack Obama is briefed by Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, Director for Iran, NSC, before taping a Nowruz message to the Iranian people in the Blue Room of the White House, March 18, 2016.

She went on to join Obama\u2019s National Security Council staff where she worked on the negotiation and implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. Former Obama officials describe Nowrouzzadeh as a seasoned Iran expert who gave them valuable insights into the country\u2019s dynamics and motivations.\n\nBy the time Trump took office in January 2017, Nowrouzzadeh was on a yearlong detail to the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, a kind of in-house think tank for the secretary of state, where she focused on Iran and the Gulf Arab states. Hook, a former George W. Bush administration official generally considered a moderate, had been tapped to run the office by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \n\nNowrouzzadeh attracted the attention of conservative media outlets during the Obama years after her name, which indicated her Iranian ethnicity, appeared on a public White House document. Conservative reports questioned her national loyalties, and fixated on the fact that she had interned with the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group which strongly supported the nuclear deal and generally favors better U.S.-Iranian relations. The Conservative Review article described NIAC as \u201can alleged Iranian regime lobbying group.\" (NIAC denies such ties, and had regular contact with the Obama White House. Nowrouzzadeh interned for the group as a college student, at a time when it did not take positions on U.S. policy.)\n\nThe story that ran about Nowrouzzadeh in the Conservative Review on March 14, 2017, covered much of that same territory, saying she had \u201cburrowed into the government under President Trump\u201d and had helped craft \u201cfalse narratives on the Iran deal to sell to the American public\u201d while working for Obama. \n\nIt touched off a flurry of activity in conservative circles. Barbara Ledeen, a prominent conservative activist, forwarded the story with an \u201cUgh\u201d in the subject line to a Google Group apparently focused on judicial strategy. David Wurmser, a former Middle East adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, forwarded the Conservative Review story to Gingrich and wrote of the State Department: \u201cA cleaning is in order there.\u201d Gingrich, in turn, flagged the article by email to Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSome emails suggest the conservative outlets were interested in more than publishing provocative stories. Joel B. Pollak, a top staffer at Breitbart News, emailed Tillerson aide Matt Mowers with an offer to supply \u201cadditional background\u201d on \u201cObama holdovers.\u201d \n\nThe same day that the story about Nowrouzzadeh was published, White House and State Department officials were busy exchanging emails about Nowrouzzadeh. In one of then, Julia Haller, whose LinkedIn profile lists her as being a White House liaison to the State Department at the time, incorrectly claimed that Nowrouzzadeh \u201cwas born in Iran,\u201d adding: \u201cupon my understanding [she] cried when the President won.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis initial info is helpful,\u201d Hook replied after that response, along with background on Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s employment status, was relayed to him. Hook said that he had \u201cemailed friends who track the Iran deal for intel on her.\u201d\n\nHook, whom many State employees have described as highly suspicious of the career diplomats around him, also asked his deputy director of the Policy Planning Staff, Edward Lacey, about Nowrouzzadeh. Himself a career official, Lacey used the opportunity to advocate for a house cleaning, noting that several people on the Policy Planning Staff were appointed by Hook\u2019s Obama-era predecessors. \n\n\u201cTheir picks without exception, were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda,\u201d Lacey wrote, adding that \u201call of these detailees have tried to stay on\u201d in Policy Planning. \n\n\u201cEd \u2013 This is helpful. Let\u2019s discuss on Monday,\u201d Hook replied. \n\nIn a later email, Lacey told Hook that Nowrouzzadeh had \u201chelped promote and defend\u201d the Iran deal \u2013 \u201cI would say, with enthusiasm.\u201d \n\nIn her March 15 email to Hook, Nowrouzzadeh tried to set the record straight, calling the Conservative Review story \u201cunfortunate\u201d and full of wrong information. \n\n    \n\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                            An email Brian Hook, chief of the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, sent to himself on April 25 included a list of names with questions about their loyalties. One person was listed as a \u201cleaker and troublemaker\u201d and another as a \u201cturncoat.\u201d | Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit\n\n                    \n                \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\u201cBy way of brief background, I am and have been a career civil servant for nearly 12 years now,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve adapted my work to the policy priorities of every administration I\u2019ve worked for.\u201d She adds that she has \u201cphysical and online safety concerns\u201d and asks for Hook\u2019s help in correcting the record. \n\nHook\u2019s response, if there was one, is not included in the material obtained by POLITICO. In April, Hook pushed Nowrouzzadeh out of his Policy Planning Staff, cutting her yearlong detail short by three months. She was returned to the State Department\u2019s Near East Bureau (NEA), where she was an official permanent employee. \n\nWhen POLITICO began asking questions about her sudden reassignment that same month, some State Department officials wanted to offer misleading statements about what had happened to Nowrouzzadeh. \n\nIn a series of emails on April 17, Lacey urged State Department public affairs officials to tell POLITICO that Nowrouzzadeh had left Policy Planning \u201con the completion of that assignment.\u201d A public affairs official, Justin Reynolds, tried to counter that, saying his unit \u201cwould like to avoid commenting on where she is now and how long details normally last if at all possible.\u201d \n\nBut Lacey insisted: \u201cWe need to counter the notion that she has been forced out of S/P,\u201d a common term for Policy Planning. \u201cHer return to NEA should be characterized as what it is \u2013 the normal return to a parent office of a civil servant at the completion of a detail assignment. A perfectly normal occurrence.\u201d \n\nNowrouzzadeh, who was copied on the exchange, fought back. \n\n\u201cEd \u2013 My assignment was not \u2018completed,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe 3 month curtailment to the duration of my detail was also not handled in accordance with that which was explicitly stated in my [memorandum of understanding].\u201d \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nAt one point, Nowrouzzadeh asks Reynolds: \u201cCan we try to kill the story?\u201d \n\nU.S. law is generally supposed to protect career government employees from politically motivated firings and other retaliation not linked to their work performance. But political appointees of incoming administrations have a lot of latitude when it comes to assigning people or promoting them. That means it\u2019s possible to shuffle people around without necessarily violating any laws.\n\nNowrouzzadeh remains a State Department employee, though she is now on a fellowship at Harvard University. \n\nShe was just one of many people viewed with suspicion by Trump administration officials. An email Hook sent to himself on April 25 included a list of names with questions about their loyalties. One person was listed as a \u201cleaker and troublemaker\u201d and another as a \u201cturncoat.\u201d \n\nThe email\u2019s subject line was \u201cDerek notes.\u201d The reference was to Derek Harvey, who was at the time a senior official at the National Security Council, according to a congressional aide who deals with State Department oversight. Harvey was worried about several career staffers he deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and was behind efforts to sideline them, the aide said. \n\nIn a brief interview, Harvey insisted he\u2019d not removed anyone from their position early and only had concerns about \u201ctwo or three people\u201d who\u2019d acted in a disruptive manner toward his deputies. \u201cBut even those were not removed early,\u201d he said. \n\nPOLITICO\u2019s story about Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s ouster from the Policy Planning Staff was published April 21, 2017. Hook emailed the story out to R.C. Hammond, at that time a communications aide to Tillerson. \n\nThe story, Hook said, was \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

John Culberson (R-Texas) appears to be a shoo-in for reelection. He\u2018s served nine terms in what\u2019s been a GOP stronghold for decades, hasn\u2019t had a serious challenger in years and sits on one of the most powerful committees in Congress.\n\nBut Culberson\u2018s suburban-Houston district went for Hillary Clinton by 1 percentage point in 2016. And when GOP leaders found out last year that he was being outraised by Democrats and barely had a campaign staff, they were exasperated. \nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Get your act together, they warned Culberson in so many words, according to sources familiar with the dressing-down. \n\nCulberson\u2019s slow start to his reelection campaign is what GOP leaders fear most heading into the thick of the midterm elections: incumbents who haven\u2019t seen a real race in years snoozing as a Democratic wave builds. Speaker Paul Ryan and the National Republican Congressional Committee are less concerned about their battle-tested swing-district members \u2014 who face tough races every election cycle \u2014 and more worried about complacent Republicans not prepared for a fight.\n\n\u201cThis is a very tough environment for Republicans. If you\u2019re getting outraised or if you haven\u2019t started your campaign yet, you need to be scared and start today,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Ryan-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019ve never lost before, therefore I can never lose this time\u2019 is not a campaign plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons Ryan\u2019s political team and NRCC officials have started holding a series of meetings with lawmakers from traditionally reliable GOP districts. Their message: Get ready for a roller coaster and begin your campaign in earnest now.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

More than 40 GOP incumbents were outraised by Democratic challengers during the last three months of 2017, a staggering number that senior Republicans said is unacceptable and amounts to nothing short of laziness.\n\nBut GOP leaders aren\u2019t satisfied there won\u2019t be more John Micas. The iconic former Transportation Committee chairman literally laughed at the notion that his Democratic challenger in 2016, Stephanie Murphy, would beat him \u2014 until it was too late. \n\nRepublicans blamed the loss on his blas\u00e9 approach.\n\nOther lawmakers in swing districts have been through this before. They don\u2019t need to be warned about taking victory for granted.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had three very tough races in a row, been a top target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and so I think I\u2019m well defined to the electorate,\" said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who represents a tossup suburban Denver district. But for any Republican from a safer district who \"hasn't had a fight,\" he continued, \"it could be turned into a competitive situation.\"\n\n\u201cMany of our members have not been in Congress during a possible \u2018wave\u2019 election cycle, as happened in 2006 and 2010,\u201d added a Republican campaign staffer. \u201cMembers in Republican-leaning districts should heed the warnings from House leadership and get ready for a fight.\u201d\n\nRep. Glenn Grothman\u2019s team is another office that\u2019s received a talking-to. Ryan is personally helping campaign for the Wisconsin Republican, who hasn\u2019t had a competitive race since he was elected in 2014. His sprawling district partly abutting Lake Michigan has been a Republican stronghold since the 1960s. But Grothman now faces a wealthy Democratic challenger who\u2019s planning to spend hundreds of thousands of his own money on the race.\n\nGrothman acknowledged in an interview the battle he\u2019s in for and said he's doing \"100 percent\" what he can to prepare. The 62-year-old former attorney pulled up his schedule on his phone and read a list of constituent events: a fish fry, a bowl-a-thon, some St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades and Lincoln Day dinners.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cObviously, that\u2019s a bigger problem than the typical year,\u201d Grothman said of his Democratic challenger, Dan Kohl, the nephew of former Milwaukee Bucks owner and ex-Sen. Herb Kohl. \u201cI\u2019ll raise more money, I think, because there\u2019s more a necessity. \u2026 My opponent has a lot of money, and he\u2019s telling people he\u2019s going to spend a lot of money \u2026 so it\u2019s concerning.\u201d\n\nRep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) also hails from a solid Republican district but is facing a well-funded Democratic opponent who last quarter raked in over $100,000 more than the incumbent. His staff, like Grothman\u2019s, has been warned to be ready \u2014 particularly because Pittenger is still introducing himself to constituents after a recent redistricting changed his district\u2019s borders.\n\nAnother North Carolinian on GOP leaders\u2019 radar is freshman Rep. Ted Budd. His well-connected Democratic opponent, philanthropist Kathy Manning, raised $564,000 last quarter, compared to his $183,000 haul. \n\nBudd said he realizes \u201cthe environment is tough this year,\u201d and he just hired a campaign manager who will start next month.\n\nRyan\u2019s political executive director, Kevin Seifert, and deputy executive director, Jake Kastan, are handling many of the reality-check meetings with incumbent Republicans or their staffs. While Ryan\u2019s team often helps incumbents, it's hosting more meetings than usual, and with a greater sense of urgency.\n\nRyan and NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) have also delivered the same message to lawmakers in conference gatherings in recent weeks: Raise money now, be active in your districts, find legislative issues that resonate with constituents and tout your accomplishments constantly. Also, define yourself and your opponent early, and label Democrats as obstructionists.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a million dollars spent attacking [GOP lawmakers] for the first time, a lot can change, and quickly,\u201d Bliss said.\n\nThe warnings from leadership aides are also expected to extend to a handful of Freedom Caucus members who typically feel safe enough to vote with the far right of the House Republican Conference \u2014 if they haven't already. Three Democratic opponents of caucus member Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) outraised him in the last fundraising quarter, two of them by $100,000.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGarrett's district elected a Democrat to the House in 2008, before a Republican reclaimed the seat two years later. And Garrett\u2019s conservative votes could make him more susceptible in a Democratic wave year, senior Republicans said. \n\nDitto, they said, for Rep.

A number of conservative Republicans, including the House Freedom Caucus, are opposed to the package. Republicans believe some Democrats will support the rule \u2014 despite Pelosi\u2019s push \u2014 because they want provisions in the omnibus.\n \n Trump's apathy toward the omnibus package is also a potential issue. While he has publicly called for its passage, Trump on Wednesday vented to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he wanted more money for his border wall with Mexico. Ultimately, Trump agreed to sign the bill once it\u2019s passed, but only after creating a panic with GOP leaders who had to scramble to convince the president that he had secured real legislative wins.\n \n GOP conservatives have already come out against the bill in droves.

Antholis", "body": "The allegations against Rob Porter, the recently departed White House staff secretary, are morally disturbing. Multiple ex-wives have accused him of abusive behavior, and while he disputes those accusations, the FBI found them credible enough to deny him a security clearance \u2013 and there are pictures of one of his exes with a black eye that she claims was delivered by him.\n\nFor White House and the National Security Council staff veterans, the revelation that Porter did not have a full security clearance raises a number of real questions that must be answered. Those questions speak directly to the safety of America\u2019s most sensitive intelligence officers and most dangerous operations.\n\nHaving worked at the White House -- including both at the National Security Council and alongside the staff secretary \u2013 I believe Porter-gate has all the markings either of a very high security breach or a highly unusual staff structure. It also raises real questions about how Trump White House staff under both Reince Priebus and John Kelly managed sensitive information, and what both of them knew about the allegations against Porter and when they knew it.\n\nAs staff secretary, Porter held one of the most important, and under-appreciated, positions at the White House. The staff secretary normally is responsible for managing all information that flows to the president \u2013 usually including the secrets known only to a small handful of people \u2013 principally, President Trump and Chiefs of Staff Priebus and Kelly, and National Security Advisers Michael Flynn and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\nNews reports indicate that Porter was granted an \u201cinterim security clearance.\u201d That certification is, indeed, quite common in the early days of an administration. Likewise, almost any new government employee who comes in contact with classified information \u2013 Secret, Top-Secret, and Top-Secret/Code Word intelligence \u2013 goes through this \u201cinterim\u201d phase.\n\nIf an employee receives an interim security clearance, he or she is allowed by law to serve in positions designated \u201cNational Security/ Non-Critical Sensitive\u201d or \u201cNational Security/Critical Sensitive.\u201d They cannot, however, be given a \u201cSpecial Sensitive\u201d job, which requires a different level of clearance: Top Secret/Special Compartmentalized Information \u2013 also known as TS/SCI or TS/CodeWord.\n\nOnly employees with TS/SCI or CodeWord clearance can see our government\u2019s most important secrets. Typically, the staff secretary is one of those very few people. One of the most important.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that the most highly classified secrets in the U.S. government are limited to a very finite group of people. U.S. human intelligence sources may be embedded deep in the government offices in Beijing, or Tehran, or Moscow or Pyongyang \u2013 capitals that the Trump administration has identified as America\u2019s prime competitors. If we have sources in those places, they are likely transmitting secrets back through secure channels to Washington. They would typically be given code words \u2014 say, Panda, Minaret, Ballerina and Kimchi.\n\nWithin each of those channels, only a handful of people has access to top secret information. Those pieces of information are the high holy data of intelligence. Like the Host in a Catholic mass, they are the flesh and word of our all-knowing government \u2014 literally, the lives and intelligence of our deepest and most sensitive sources. Each channel is \u201ccompartmentalized.\u201d That is, there are very few people who have access to both the Panda channel and the Ballerina channel.\n\nOnly a very, very select group of people has access to all of those channels, and the information that flows through them. That intelligence gets pulled into a daily intelligence summary that goes to the Oval Office \u2013 the President\u2019s Daily Briefing \u2013 and to a select small group of people. Agents and sources in the field are willing to put their lives at risk only if they believe that the information will be limited to a very limited group of people \u2013 among the most trustworthy in the world.\n\nWho in the White House has access to this information?\n\nIn the White House, other than the president, it likely to only be the national security adviser, his or her deputy, their chief of staff and the NSC\u2019s staff secretary. It would also include the White House chief of staff, perhaps one deputy, and the staff secretary \u2014 the job Porter held. Press reports also indicate that Jared Kushner had access to that information.\n\nThe staff secretary is the person who manages the paper flow to the Oval Office. It is hard to imagine that person does not have TS/SCI level clearance, as that would require the NSC staff to navigate around the staff secretary, rather than through him/her.\n\nIn Porter\u2019s case, the interim security clearances had been temporary: 180 days with the option for extension (another 180 days). Porter appears to have started on January 20, 2017 \u2013 Inauguration Day. Assuming he was given that \u201cinterim\u201d clearance on Day 1, it would have expired on January 15, 2018.\n\nThe fact that Chief of Staff Kelly -- a former military officer and former secretary of homeland security -- would not have seen this as a problem is staggering. He would know better than anyone that managing highly restricted information is essential to American national security.\n\nEvery person who has access to the most sensitive pieces of intelligence must be supremely trustworthy -- capable of being kept in the highest cones of silence. If they leak information, they potentially jeopardize lives of intelligence agents or sources in the field.\n\nSo, in essence, Kelly either (a) allowed a key aide in the chain of information access to TS/SCI information without a clearance, (b) waived the process entirely or (c) created a system that worked around him.\n\nIf Kelly knowingly allowed Porter access to TS/SCI information without formally approving it, that\u2019s an extraordinary security breach.\n\nIf Kelly waived off the TS/SCI restrictions, he likely would have done that formally -- including either with the White House counsel, the FBI, or the president himself. That would require understanding fully the reason Porter was still \u201cinterim\u201d \u2013 a restraining order preventing him from contacting a former wife who alleged that he physically abused her.\n\nMost defendable is that Kelly allowed a system for moving information -- from August 2017 through February 2018 -- that simply worked around the staff secretary. Porter needed to have been kept out of the loop for any truly sensitive material going into the Oval Office. That would have required a highly disciplined NSC staff which, in essence, would have had to have final control over all Oval Office paper flow.\n\nSo, in the coming days, it will be critical to know whether Priebus and Kelly, Flynn and McMaster, and/or the president himself knew about Porter\u2019s security clearance status. Based on that knowledge, did they allow him access to Top Secret/CodeWord intelligence, including the President\u2019s Daily Briefing? If they did know, and they allowed it, what made them feel so secure about Porter?\n\nIf they did not know, then who exactly at the White House is protecting our national secrets?", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Cristiano Lima", "body": "Rep.

Diane Black, a Republican who\u2019s running for governor, touting her support for the president wherever she goes. She believes her vote for his tax bill is going to be one of her best weapons.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the vulnerability Inslee believes Democrats can hit at, even though he continues to advise them to stay away from talking only about Trump himself all the time.\n\n\u201cWe have Republican governors who are kowtowing to Donald Trump and will continue to do so, who have been lackeys to his abysmal record and his moral depravity and his inhumane policies, and that all across the country they will be called to account for that chaotic behavior,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to me, shocking and disappointing, that we have so many Republicans who now aspire for governor who just are afraid and shaking in their boots and won\u2019t stand up against this man in the White House.\u201d\n\nStanding up to Trump is exactly what Inslee did, literally, last week in the White House, seizing a moment during a meeting of the National Governors Association to chastise Trump for his proposal to arm teachers. \u201cWe need to do a little less tweeting and a little more listening\u201d to educators, Inslee told Trump, in what was the most direct public confrontation any Democratic leader has had with the president to date.\n\nTrump listened, his arms folded across his chest, and moved on.\n\nInslee hasn\u2019t. He wants his candidates to lean hard into pushing for restrictions on magazine size, banning bump stocks, raising the minimum age for buying assault rifles\u2014and make it into an argument for states doing what Trump and the Republicans in Washington haven\u2019t. \u201cIt comes down to Democratic governors who are standing up for action and the Republicans who are standing in the courthouse door just taking orders from the NRA,\u201d said Inslee.\n\nThe difference between gubernatorial races in 2014 and 2018, Inslee argues, is both a wave now running in the other direction\u2014\u201cthe potential tsunami zone,\u201d he predicted\u2014and the lack of many Republican incumbents in an environment when governors have been reelected in 50 of the 58 races since 2010. This year, 12 of the 26 races Democrats are chasing are open seats, and three\u2014Kansas, South Carolina and Iowa\u2014are against Republican lieutenant governors who moved up after their predecessors received appointments to the Trump administration and are now running for governor for the first time as incumbents.\n\nDemocrats have been down this road before. In 2014, they were convinced that the nine states President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012 but which elected Republican governors in between, in the 2010 wave, were theirs for the taking.\n\nWisconsin, Florida, Michigan and Ohio not only reelected Republican governors in 2014, but also went for Trump in 2016. Along the way, Trump picked up Pennsylvania, the sole Democratic gubernatorial flip in 2014.\n\nBut, Democrats argue, what also happened since was Ralph Northam winning Virginia in a blowout last year by talking up progressive issues (including gun control) and projecting an air of calm rejection of the president, while Republican nominee Ed Gillespie never found an answer to the Trump question that worked for both the GOP base and the general electorate.\n\nJust as the Republican wins in 2014 governors races previewed Trump\u2019s strength in key states and helped put in place policies that helped him along\u2014passing right-to-work laws in Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, which undercut union strength on Election Day\u2014Republicans are warning the White House to focus on governors races this year if only for the sake of protecting Trump\u2019s reelection chances in 2020.\n\nThey\u2019re also dismissive of any Democratic effort to nationalize gubernatorial races, pointing out that their own attempt to do that in Montana and West Virginia, two of the heaviest pro-Trump states, didn\u2019t stop the states from electing Democratic governors on the same day in 2016.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in Washington are both anxiously watching the states that put Trump over the edge to see how the dynamics will play out this year.\n\nBill Schuette, Michigan\u2019s Republican attorney general and the front-runner in that state\u2019s gubernatorial primary, dismissed Inslee\u2019s strategy on Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wishful thinking, and I think it really comes with the same strain and premise that said it was going to be Armageddon for Republicans in 2016, and that didn\u2019t occur,\u201d said Schuette, who likes to brag he\u2019s the only candidate the president has tweeted about twice. (\u201cThe first time my name was misspelled. But you know what? Half of Michigan\u2019s taken decades to learn how to spell my name.\u201d)\n\nDemocrats who say that Trump is going to weigh down Republicans aren\u2019t paying attention to what\u2019s happening in Michigan or anywhere else, Schuette said.\n\nNow, Schuette said, he\u2019ll talk up the tax bill that House Republicans still can\u2019t figure out how to message, and remind Michigan voters that Ram truck production has moved from Mexico to Macomb County under Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s a shift of the rotation of the earth on its axis.\u201d\n\nMaybe try the Trump argument in bluer states\u2014though in two of the bluest, Maryland and Massachusetts, Republican incumbents running for reelection have the highest approval numbers in the country\u2014but not in any state where the president is popular.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that this administration is going in the direction that they\u2019re going,\u201d Black said. \u201cI lean into it, and I thank them for who they are.\u201d\n\nInslee boasts not just about what happens when a state elects a Democratic governor, but what happens when a state puts the whole government in Democratic hands\u2014as happened after a special election in the Washington state Senate last year flipped from red to blue\u2014and upends control of the whole chamber.\n\nIn the few months since, Inslee has signed new laws on a clean energy plan, voting rights, pay equity and reproductive rights.\n\nRepublicans say this represents overreach that will flip statehouse seats back in November. Inslee said he\u2019s not worried, and he embraces the contrast with Congress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a debate between Plan A or B. It\u2019s between Plan A and nothing, because that\u2019s what the Republicans have offered,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThey\u2019re not offering us a real solution on infrastructure. They\u2019re not offering us a solution on climate change' they just denied its existence. They\u2019re not offering a plan on really seriously what to do about gun violence. We are.\u201d\n\nThe issue that grabs Inslee the most, though, is climate change. He wrote a whole book about it\u2014\u201cApollo\u2019s Fire\u201d\u2014in 2007, made a green jobs economy the centerpiece of his first gubernatorial campaign in 2012, and has prioritized it the past six years.\n\nHe thinks there\u2019s enough attention to climate change that a candidate could even run on it in 2020 as an almost single-issue campaign.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s points where things change, and I think we\u2019re getting to that tipping point right now on climate change,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cAnd it has to happen now, because we don\u2019t have a lot more time.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t yet say whether that candidate might be him, despite the chatter about his running. His term is, after all, up in 2020, though there are no term limits in Washington.\n\n\u201cMy term could be up as long as the people accept me,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cI have plans to be governor because I love the job and I feel that I\u2019ve brought some things to the table for my state.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Adam Doster", "body": "Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, works on the 14th floor of the County-City Building, a faintly yellowed glass tower. The panoramic views are nothing to sneeze at; from the oval table beside his desk, Buttigieg can spot the hospital where he was born, the leafy middle-class neighborhood where he was raised and the Episcopal church where he worships most Sundays. Still, he concedes, \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly luxury digs.\u201d During downpours, the 36-year-old Democrat has to yank his framed photographs off the window ledge or risk water damage. And right above his head, on the roof, live a pair of mating falcons. This past summer, Buttigieg had a naturalist tag their chicks in a City Hall conference room. (Four hatched; two survived.) \u201cOccasionally, you\u2019ll see a pigeon massacre,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be trying to pay attention and \u2026 you\u2019ll just see feathers, like, drifting by, and guts going down outside the window.\u201d\n\nWhen Buttigieg moved back to South Bend a decade ago, the first place he rented was similarly shabby. Blue floors. Shag carpet. Bee hives. He can\u2019t even show me the actual carriage house he lived in because his old landlord mercifully knocked it down. All it really had going for it was the location (a couple blocks from his mom and dad\u2019s house) and the price (dirt cheap).\n\nDeals can be had in Buttigieg\u2019s hometown, a scrappy blue-collar city in north-central Indiana, 90 miles east of Chicago, best known as the home of the University of Notre Dame, where both of his parents taught. Its population peaked near 132,000 more than a half-century ago, when Studebaker\u2014then an automotive giant, now an anachronism\u2014still employed thousands of Hoosiers; today, the population hovers around 100,000. Roughly 32 percent of residents live below the poverty line, while three-quarters of public school students receive free or reduced lunch. Not even South Bend partisans would characterize it as a bucolic. \u201cIt had the feel of a Rust Belt city,\u201d says Reverend John Jenkins, Notre Dame\u2019s president, who arrived in the 1970s. \u201cIt had a past and was looking for a future.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, in other words, is the type of place that high-achievers tend to flee. \u201cI grew up at a time when people felt like success meant getting out,\u201d Buttigieg says. \u201cIt was made clear to me that there was a big future available to me if I left.\u201d For a while, that\u2019s what he did\u2014to Harvard, where he studied history and literature; to Washington, for a political consulting gig; to England on a Rhodes scholarship; and to the Chicago branch of McKinsey & Co., the prestigious consulting firm. During his McKinsey stint, Buttigieg remembers attending a house party in San Francisco where he casually mentioned he was thinking about relocating to South Bend, with an eye toward public service. \u201cThe assumption was I had a sick relative,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was the only reason I\u2019d be moving home.\u201d\n\nHe did anyway, into the bee-filled carriage house, while still under contract with McKinsey. In 2010, he quit consulting and threw himself into an unwinnable race for state treasurer, shuttling among Indiana\u2019s 92 counties, learning how to fundraise and glad-hand. (Campaign slogan: \u201cMeet Pete.\u201d) The mayor\u2019s seat opened up the following year. \u201cThe way the campaign for mayor really began was 100 cups of coffee with people who cared about the city, finding out what was on their minds, what they thought was working and what wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at the end of every cup of coffee, asking for two or three [more] people who I should have a coffee with, until everybody they named was somebody I\u2019d already met.\u201d He won the crowded Democratic primary by 34 points and the general election by 20 more. He was 29 years old.\n\nPlenty has changed in the intervening years, for Buttigieg personally and for the party he represents. In a term-and-a-half, he has overseen an economic and psychological resurgence in South Bend that few were predicting. In 2014, he served a seven-month tour in Afghanistan with the U.S. Naval Reserves, helping disrupt flows of funding to terrorist groups while monitoring South Bend business over sketchy internet connections. Before his 2015 reelection, he came out publicly as gay, writing in a local newspaper that \u201cit took years of struggle and growth for me to recognize that it\u2019s just a fact of life, like having brown hair, and part of who I am.\u201d (In December, he and his partner, middle-school teacher Chasten Glezman, got engaged.)\n\nThrough it all, Buttigieg established himself as a Democrat worth tracking, at a time when the party was desperate for fresh faces, particularly between the coasts. Howard Dean has called him \u201cthe face of the first global generation.\u201d Frank Bruni, the New York Times columnist, wondered after a 2016 South Bend visit whether he had just met the country\u2019s first gay president. And speaking to the New Yorker three weeks after Donald Trump was elected president, Barack Obama name-checked four gifted pols he trusted to lead Democrats into the suddenly terrifying future. Three were U.S. senators, all in their 50s. Then there was Buttigieg, a boyish municipal servant with a Maltese last name nobody can quite pronounce. (It\u2019s Boot-edge-edge, though South Bend residents just call him Mayor Pete.)\n\nThere is one glaring problem: The routes to higher office that are available to Buttigieg, as a progressive hailing from a state trending in the opposite direction, are winding and pockmarked. He could dither in Congress, if he could win a seat at all in his Republican-leaning home district. He could risk his political hide running statewide in Indiana, even though Trump bested Hillary Clinton there by 19 points. Maybe Buttigieg angles for a Cabinet post in the next Democratic administration? That\u2019s three years away, at minimum. Last winter, he sought to lead the Democratic National Committee, earning endorsements from five former party chairs, but he ultimately ceded to contenders with higher name recognition.\n\nA bitter irony is at play here: At a moment when the faces of the Democratic Party are 67-year-old Chuck Schumer and 77-year-old Nancy Pelosi, when so many novice Democrats are banging at the gate, spurred into action by powerful social currents and opposition to the president, one of the party\u2019s most talented young politicians has nowhere to go. Buttigieg could theoretically lead his party out of the Trump-era wilderness\u2014if only he can find his way out of South Bend.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s New Yorker nod was illustrative. Yes, Democrats hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the Great Depression. Yes, wounds from the 2016 primary cut deep. And yes, the party\u2019s current leadership represents something of a gerontocracy, filled with presidential hopefuls (Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders) who were teenagers when the Beatles played Ed Sullivan. To find an inspiring upstart who could potentially unify the Democratic establishment and its ascendant left wing, Obama had to reach all the way down to South Bend, the fourth-biggest city in the country\u2019s 17th most-populated state. Was there a dogcatcher he overlooked?\n\nOn the other hand, Obama could have named anyone in the entire party; even if the Democratic bench is as thin as some rank-and-file members fear, it\u2019s not barren. That he tossed out Buttigieg as a standard-bearer, without qualification, speaks to the mayor\u2019s combination of life experiences and governing talent. One morning last summer, I trailed Buttigieg on his way to a Rotary luncheon, where he was scheduled to give loosely prepared remarks. He walks quickly and with purpose, almost like a hound dog\u2014head leaning forward, shoulders slightly hunched, his destination never far from mind. He\u2019s both shorter and less naturally charismatic than a typical male politician, with a trim build and a middle-school haircut. (Brad Stevens, the famously youthful head coach of the Boston Celtics, could be his brother.)\n\nWe cut over on Jefferson Boulevard, one of several roads his administration retrofitted as part of a $25 million Smart Streets project. The running joke used to be that a South Bender could fire a shotgun downtown after 5 p.m. and hit nothing; a series of one-way highways stunted pedestrian activity. Buttigieg hosted dozens of public meetings and reviewed land use research from across the world, and then tempered public frustration over two years of heavy construction, during which the city overhauled 15 miles of its streetscape, adding two-ways and dedicated bike lanes. Nearly complete, South Bend\u2019s core now feels like a destination, not somewhere just to pass through anxiously.\n\nIt\u2019s the type of aggressive undertaking that inspired Buttigieg to run in the first place. \u201cThe fundamental project,\u201d he says, \u201cwas to get this city to believe in itself again.\u201d\n\nTwelve months before he took office, Newsweek had listed South Bend as one of America\u2019s 10 \u201cdying\u201d cities. Sure, the methodology was sloppy, but the magazine was tapping into an underlying pessimism that had animated civic life since before Buttigieg\u2019s birth. The once-pristine Chase Tower had fallen into receivership; the old Drewrys Brewery on the Northwest Side, reduced to rubble, looked like somewhere you would take your punk band to shoot cover art. Sometimes Buttigieg uses the terminology of natural disasters to describe the effects of deindustrialization: \u201cThe economic collapse is no different in its physical impact. It just takes longer.\u201d\n\nSeveral people I spoke with compared the 14th floor of the County-City building, where a diverse staff of six and an army of decorated interns work to solve the city\u2019s problems, to a shrunken version of Capitol Hill. (I met one Harvard grad student who, during her summer internship, was using a busted copier as a standing desk.) As an urban petri dish, South Bend itself is an attractive place to put theory into practice\u2014small enough that a topic feels manageable, big enough for the eventual solution to make a difference. Buttigieg sets the tone, fueled by a stream of black coffee, a service member\u2019s discipline and a sincere interest in public policy. He\u2019s a person who will talk with authority and enthusiasm about leaf removal or way-finding signage.\n\nHe can get philosophical about the moral import of local government, too. Essential services should be squared away, freeing people \u201cto work on whatever they think matters in life.\u201d And transparency is both sound policy and politics; a 3-1-1 hotline the city rolled out during Buttigieg\u2019s first term has now taken 1 million calls, giving residents an outlet to air grievances while providing administration officials with extra information to analyze.\n\nThen there\u2019s the economic development piece, in which City Hall plays a key promotional role. Early on, Buttigieg and his team set about demolishing or repairing 1,000 abandoned homes in 1,000 days, an almost asinine goal that required staffers to digitize 8-foot-tall piles of code forms just to figure out which properties they should target and who owned them. Over the years, the administration helped incubate what some are calling the \u201cSilicon Prairie,\u201d reimagining South Bend as a tech hub where startups, some affiliated with Notre Dame, can take advantage of low costs and a concentration of fiber optic cables. (In a poetic turn, a handful of companies have set up shop on the remediated Studebaker site.) The remainder of Buttigieg\u2019s second term will see multimillion dollar investment in parks and trails, along with a push for citywide early childhood education. Unemployment has been cut in half since 2012. Hip restaurants are sprouting. Empty factories are being retrofitted. The population is modestly increasing.\n\nThe trick, Buttigieg found, was to appeal to South Benders\u2019 pride without collapsing into paralyzing nostalgia. Mark Neal, the former deputy mayor, calls his old boss \u201cthe perfect person at the perfect time\u201d to lead a Rust Belt town on the rebound. \u201cHe was young, he was dynamic, he was smart,\u201d Neal says. \u201cHe had ideas.\u201d And he has paired that energy with rigor, says South Bend Common Council President Tim Scott. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything radical,\u201d Scott says. \u201cHe\u2019s always going to have the data behind him. He\u2019s going to do the research 10 times more than anyone else.\u201d\n\nLittle of this work is ideological, at least by the definition traditionally deployed in Washington. Nor is it glamorous. \u201cThey are not calling to ask about Syria or abortion,\u201d Buttigieg says of his constituents. \u201cThey want to know if I can get the dead possum out of the road.\u201d But it is pretty solid training for someone learning the ins and outs of public affairs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re mayor, you have to learn how to listen,\u201d says former Obama consigliere David Axelrod. Buttigieg, in Axelrod\u2019s opinion, \u201chas an enormous facility for listening to people, processing what they say, thinking about it and responding in a genuine way.\u201d\n\nSix years in, Buttigieg has even embraced the ceremonial aspects of his job\u2014he knows his presence and bearing matter. Take the Rotary luncheon, before a hundred or so diners on a dreary Wednesday. Everything is beige: the conference room walls, the table cloths, the lasagna warming on the buffet. The air conditioning is running, unnecessarily, at full blast. There are no television cameras, no radio microphones. If one wanted to mail in a public appearance, this wouldn\u2019t be a bad option.\n\nBut after picking at a side salad, Buttigieg stands at the dais and delivers a polished and witty rundown of his priorities. He admits that, during golf outings, he usually hangs out near the putting green so as to avoid \u201cinjuries or arrests.\u201d Eventually, he lays out \u201cthe big picture, which is that our city is on a roll.\u201d Somewhere during his spiel, the woman who introduced Buttigieg bends over her plate and snaps a commemorative photo, at an angle that could be only described as awkward. And on the way out, as a parting gift, a cheerful Rotarian hands Buttigieg a brick with a plaque on the front and a jar of homemade salsa. Buttigieg has no clue what to do with either, but he accepts both with an eager smile. \n\n\n\nDuring the few days that I hung by as Buttigieg bounced around South Bend last year, he promoted the city\u2019s municipal I.D. cards at a community radio station, gamely dusting off his high school Spanish, one of seven languages he speaks conversationally. He read a Mo Willems picture book to a gaggle of children at a pre-K program, who asked him critical questions afterward, like whether he owned a Lamborghini. (He does not.) I watched him spill a chamoy con mango ice cream bar on his crisp blue suit, nibble on tapas during a happy hour fundraiser and confidently cycle to his favorite bar using South Bend\u2019s dockless bike share system. Without fail, nearly everywhere we went, someone pressed Mayor Pete to run for president.\n\nThe pleas were unprompted and hard to ignore. He claims it\u2019s a recent phenomenon, connected to the jarring turnover in the White House last January. Anxiety over Democrats\u2019 future provides additional fuel. It\u2019s dispiriting to watch Washington insiders flail around for a convincing message, or worse, relitigate the crushing 2016 election. Then someone like Buttigieg arrives on the scene\u2014an urban mayor who can effectively sell progressive policies to neglected working-class voters, and who also happens to be a gay naval reservist with a degree from Oxford?\n\n\u201cWhat are you supposed to say?\u201d Buttigieg asks, about the newfound attention. \u201cThe school newspaper ran a story when I was at Harvard on students who wanted to be president one day. They might have actually called me. Even at that tender age, I had the good sense not to comment.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s started to do, in dribs and drabs, is develop a national profile. There was the DNC race, in which he couched his candidacy as a break from the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton proxy war and introduced himself to a wider swath of Democratic donors. Since then, he has hosted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2014a college acquaintance\u2014along his tour of America, and jumped on the late-night talk show circuit (Seth Meyers, Chelsea Handler). In September, Buttigieg headlined the Progress Iowa Corn Feed, an annual gathering of top Iowa Democrats in that crucial caucus state, and launched Hitting Home, a PAC to make independent expenditures in both federal and statehouse races. (The PAC had raised nearly $200,000 by the end of 2017, according to its year-end disclosure report.) His travel schedule, per the South Bend Tribune, has more than doubled during his second term.\n\nSipping a brown ale last summer at Four Winds Field, home to a Chicago Cubs minor league affiliate, Buttigieg laid out his strategic pitch. Democrats should fight for fairness and their own, pro-government version of freedom\u2014to marry or bargain collectively or switch jobs without fear of crippling medical debt, all with the help of basic public protections. \u201cSome people my age are seduced by this libertarian idea,\u201d he says, \u201c[of] having very little of anything by way of a role for government. I found that in my personal experience, freedom is secured by good government just as it\u2019s threatened by bad government.\u201d\n\nIt is a message that should resonate throughout the country, Buttigieg feels, among voters from diverse racial and socio-economic backgrounds. Targeting discrete slices of the electorate is counterproductive, and Democrats aren\u2019t that effective at it anyhow. \u201cI don\u2019t think the left-versus-center competition is really intelligible anymore,\u201d he adds. For too long, Democratic politics were \u201csimply keyed off whatever\u2019s going on on the Republican side.\u201d Now that the Republican Party is \u201ccompletely scrambled,\u201d a Democratic Party that \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to be anything but [the GOP\u2019s] mirror image is in an equal-but-opposite scramble.\u201d\n\nEverybody in South Bend knows Buttigieg will look for another job someday. \u201cNobody here wants to see Pete leave\u2014that\u2019s a fact,\u201d says Jason Critchlow, chairman of the St. Joseph County Democratic Party. \u201cBut I think a lot of people have come to terms with the fact that this guy can do more. He\u2019s got more to offer.\u201d\n\nWhere he goes is less clear. Buttigieg let pass the chance to primary incumbent U.S. Senator Joe Donnelly, a fellow Democrat from north-central Indiana up for reelection this fall. Biding his time as a backbencher in the U.S. House doesn\u2019t interest him, even a little. \u201cMy paycheck would go up, but I\u2019m not sure my impact would,\u201d he says. He could challenge Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb in 2020. It would be a natural step for an ambitious executive, but, as several Hoosiers told me, a precarious one, too: Holcomb is a well-regarded Republican in a state with Republican supermajorities, and Indiana has never elected an openly gay state legislator, much less a constitutional officer. Winning in South Bend is one thing\u2014only 10,589 people showed up to vote in 2015\u2014but the whole state is another matter.\n\nButtigieg believes Democrats shouldn\u2019t shy away from uphill battles. \u201cIt matters how we compete, even in the areas we\u2019re never going to win,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially if you believe true victory looks less like a day when Democrats are in control everywhere, [and] looks more like a day when Republicans are starting to sound more like Democrats.\u201d Yet the stakes are considerably higher now, with Buttigieg\u2019s career picking up momentum. Is it worth it for him to expend his accumulated capital taking on an incumbent who, under the right conditions, might clobber him? \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t run for governor in 2020, then he has to wait another two years after that for a senatorial seat,\u201d says Brian Howey, a veteran Indiana political reporter. \u201cThere are not many paths for him to emerge.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strange byproduct of our political system that someone like Buttigieg, by virtue of geography, could find himself landlocked. He doesn\u2019t scoff at his current posting, nor should he. After all, the Democratic Party is primarily an urban one now; cities are centers of \u201cresistance\u201d and laboratories for progressives who are serious about effective governance. At the same time, the list of mayors who have jumped straight into presidential politics is short and uninspiring: Sam Yorty, John Lindsay, Rudy Giuliani, to name a few. And as a national launching pad, South Bend\u2014complicated as it might be, and in a swing region where Democrats have lost important ground\u2014doesn\u2019t exactly have the cache of, say, Los Angeles, where Mayor Eric Garcetti is reportedly plotting a presidential run.\n\nWendy Davis ran for governor of Texas in 2014, a year after her career-defining abortion-rights filibuster at the Austin Statehouse. Campaigning from Houston to El Paso, and fighting off a better resourced and more organized state Republican Party, \u201cwas just a wearying task, as you can imagine,\u201d Davis says. (She lost the race by 20 points.) And so, the former state senator understands why someone like Buttigieg, or former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro, also a Democrat, might consider an otherwise premature presidential run. \u201cUnbelievably, in some sense it is more feasible to win nationwide than it is to win within their own states, with the existing infrastructure as it is,\u201d she says. Swing staters get plenty of financial and organizational attention from Democrats in Washington\u2014less so their counterparts in Republican strongholds. \u201cThat should be a wake-up call for us,\u201d Davis adds, \u201cto really think about the investments that ought to be made in these red states.\u201d\n\nAsk Buttgieg himself to forecast the future, and he gets uncharacteristically circumspect. \u201cWhatever the time comes, it will be very hard to step away from this job, just because it\u2019s such a great job,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest job I\u2019ve ever had. But it\u2019s just really rewarding and nourishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy guess is that he does not have a set game plan, which is probably smart,\u201d says Jack Colwell, a veteran political columnist for the South Bend Tribune. \u201cHe\u2019ll see what develops.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore the baseball game at Four Winds Field, we stop by the house Buttigieg shares with his fianc\u00e9, Glezman, so he can change into casual clothes and walk Truman, their rambunctious rescue dog. Buttigieg bought the place in 2009; the previous owner had fallen into foreclosure after her idea for a French-inspired bed and breakfast fell through. It\u2019s beautifully restored, with dark wood molding and a spacious porch overlooking the St. Joseph River. Inside, the couple has crammed an enviable collection of books, totems from Afghanistan (antique guns, intricate rugs) and a salvaged Hanover grand piano. \u201cBit of a money pit,\u201d Buttigieg calls it. His mortgage payment is roughly $450 per month.\n\nAround the block Truman leads us, past Buttigieg\u2019s childhood home and Triangle Park, where the trees served as goalposts for neighborhood football games. There\u2019s no security detail monitoring him, no invasive entourage interfering with his routine, no hassling constituents, no political calculations to make. Demanding as it can be, serving as mayor allows him and Glezman a level of comfort neither is itching to give up.\n\nOn sleepy Marquette Avenue, a middle-aged couple emerges from their garage and hollers to grab Buttigeg\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHow you doing, mayor! What are you doing Friday?\u201d\n\nMore than a hundred people are coming through the house, they tell him. The theme is \u201cMargaritaville.\u201d There will be drinks and music, an easy evening. \u201cWell that sounds fun!\u201d Buttigieg yells back. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s serious about the invitation. Although Mayor Pete never caught the Jimmy Buffett bug himself, Glezman, it turns out, is an unabashed Parrothead.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carmen Paun", "body": "For a man facing potential jail time, Victor Ponta seems at ease.\n\nThen again, the 45-year-old former Romanian prime minister is used to setbacks: When a fire killed 60 people at a Bucharest nightclub in 2015 and thousands of people took to the streets to protest lax safety standards, somebody\u2019s head had to roll.\n\n\u201cThat emotion and collective anger needed a lightning rod. And that could only have been me,\u201d said Ponta, who quickly\u00a0stepped down. \u201cThis is what being a politician means \u2014 you are accountable for things you don\u2019t do directly, just like you benefit from things you don\u2019t do directly.\u201d\n\nAfter a bid for the Romanian presidency in 2014 and being booted out of the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) last year for defying the party to back short-lived Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, Ponta is now building a party of his own, inspired by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche.\n\n\u201cHe [the French president] comes with a vision that is not only against something, but with how he wants to change France and Europe.

Already, Ponta is emerging as the main counterweight to PSD party strongman Liviu Dragnea, said Magdin.\n\n\u201cThe polarization between the two helps Ponta,\u201d he said.

The National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA)\u00a0requested\u00a0a jail sentence last month; Ponta denies the charges, which he says are not related to his political activity, but declined to go into the details of the case.\n\nFormer Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta pictured during an interview with journalists at the Romanian government headquarters in Bucharest on June 9, 2015 | Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\u201cI defended myself in court. I haven\u2019t talked about this in public as I didn\u2019t want to be judged on TV, but in court. I will accept the decision, whether I like it or not,\u201d said Ponta, who as prime minister\u00a0proposed current chief DNA prosecutor Laura Codru\u021ba K\u00f6vesi\u00a0(who was\u00a0named by POLITICO as one of 28 individuals\u00a0who would have a major impact on Europe in 2015)\u00a0for the job. Current Justice Minister Tudorel Toader\u00a0wants her out, saying she has overstepped the mark and doesn\u2019t respect parliament\u2019s authority.\n\nPonta defended the DNA\u2019s mission to investigate Romania\u2019s endemic high-level corruption, but feels its powers need fine-tuning to avoid abuse: He cites the anticorruption office\u2019s investigation of his former deputy prime minister, Gabriel Oprea, over a road accident in 2015 that led to the death of a policeman in his motorcade. The DNA said Oprea should not have had a police escort as he wasn\u2019t on official business.\n\nThe former prime minister spoke to POLITICO during a visit to Brussels to prepare for the March 22 conference of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, where he is due to speak. (If sentenced to prison, he intends to appeal.) Ponta was coy about whether his presence at the pre-EU summit conference of a pan-European party whose MEPs include members of Britain\u2019s ruling Conservatives and Poland\u2019s governing Law and Justice party means he hopes to join them.\n\nHowever, Ponta does want his new party to run for the European Parliament election in 2019. Once it has defined its ideology and worked out how best it can contribute to Romanian politics, it can turn to thinking about \u201cthe vision of Europe we find ourselves in.\u201d\n\nThe former prime minister believes the established center-right and center-left parties, such as the Social Democrats he used to represent, have run out of energy and can no longer deliver a vision for a more efficient, reformed European Union.\n\n\u201cSo the first thing is to accept that a cycle has ended and that if Europe is not reformed in the next legislature, we will have more and more anti-European votes and more rebels like Poland, Hungary and more recently Romania,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated stories on these topics:", "link": null, "source": "Politico - EU", "location": []}, {"author": "Jim Saksa", "body": "HOUSTON, Pa. \u2014 \u201cJesus always started out by going and being with a certain group of people,\u201d says Conor Lamb as we\u2019re winding down hilly back roads to the Washington County Gun Show. It snowed a few inches in Southwestern Pennsylvania last night and, other than the highways we\u2019re avoiding, nothing\u2019s been plowed. While I\u2019m silently saying Hail Marys as the campaign staffer driving whips around farms and fields, Lamb calmly continues explaining how his faith informs his politics.\n\nJesus, Lamb tells me, tried to get to know people as people before he tried to win them over with arguments. He \u201cwasn\u2019t asking people where they stood on abortion before they came and sat down with them.\u201d\n\nLamb, the Democratic candidate in a neck-and-neck special election on March 13, has to hope the people of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District will likewise listen to what he has to say before judging him by his party affiliation. In this part of the state, where highway billboards sport Bible verses and the start of deer hunting season is a holiday, Democratic politicians tend to flunk doctrinal tests. Even though registered Democrats technically outnumber Republicans here by 70,000, Trump won the district by nearly 20 percentage points. Mitt Romney and John McCain posted similar margins. Former Rep. Tim Murphy, the outspoken anti-abortion Republican whose seat Lamb is running to fill\u2014Murphy resigned after reports that he encouraged his married mistress to get an abortion after a pregnancy scare\u2014won eight straight elections, the first six by double-digit margins and the last two uncontested.\n\nLamb, a square-jawed 33-year-old Marine Corps officer who resigned from his job as a federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh to run, has a chance to upend the district\u2019s politics\u2014as long as he can avoid being labeled a liberal without discouraging the district\u2019s not inconsiderable Democrat base from turning out. A devout Catholic, Lamb is pro-union and pro-gun, backs bipartisan deals for fixing Obamacare and the nation\u2019s infrastructure, wants more job training and less college debt, and says he\u2019s pro-fracking but pro-environment, too. And he\u2019s betting that this mix of economic populism and moderate social politics can win the predominantly blue collar district. (Full disclosure: Lamb and I both played rugby at the University of Pennsylvania. We overlapped his senior year, 2005-06.)\n\nLamb\u2019s opponent, state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2014best known for sponsoring a bill that would have required posting \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on every school in the Commonwealth\u2014has a simpler message: He was \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump,\u201d and is an enthusiastic supporter of the president\u2019s agenda. But there are signs the president\u2019s popularity is waning here. A Monmouth University poll showed 42 percent of voters in the 18th strongly disapprove of his performance, compared with just 37 percent who strongly approve. When asked if they support the president\u2019s efforts in office, 48 percent said yes, 47 percent said no. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Saccone made 5 percent of respondents say they were more likely to back Saccone; it made 8 percent say they were more likely to support Lamb.\n\nGiven these shifting politics, political observers say Lamb has a tight, but plausible, path to victory in March. He needs suburban women with college educations and moderate social views\u2014both Democrats and Republicans wavering in their party allegiances post Trump\u2014to back him big (which is probably why he praises nurses and teachers in the same breath as veterans and cops). He also needs the district\u2019s 86,000 union households to vote their economic interests, and for enough of the rural, working-class Republican base to find him sufferable to stay home.\n\nThe Republican Party sees this path too\u2014and is pouring resources, both money and manpower, into this Pennsylvania district ahead of March 13. So far, Republican super PACs have thrown millions into the race, opening canvassing offices and flooding Pittsburgh\u2019s airwaves with ads calling Lamb a liberal. Trump himself made a visit to support Saccone\u2014as have Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence\u2014and says he will return.\n\nAfter all, the stakes are enormous. As the polls narrow\u2014the latest has Lamb just 3 points behind Saccone\u2014this race is being closely watched by political seismologists for early tremors of an oncoming blue tsunami in the November midterms. If Lamb, a virtual unknown five months ago, can win this once seemingly impregnable Republican stronghold\u2014one that so overwhelmingly supported Trump just 16 months ago, then other Democratic candidates across the country can do the same.\n\n\n\nOn this frigid Saturday in early January, Lamb has just wrapped up a rally at an American Legion in tiny Houston, Pennsylvania, where around 70 supporters braved snow-covered roads to hear him speak. But the labor leaders and left-leaning vets that filled the hall are already members of Lamb\u2019s growing flock of disciples. There\u2019s more missionary work to be done.\n\n\u201cMy faith tells me where to go and get started and what kind of sympathy to have for people once you get there,\u201d Lamb says. Today, his faith is leading him to the gun show in Washington County. Lamb has plotted a path to victory that runs through places like this, where he can evangelize to voters like Ken Gedeon, who is idling beside a display case full of World War II-era sidearms.\n\nGedeon is a registered Democrat and an avid hunter. The retiree from Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania, is upset at Saccone for supporting a bill to allow the use of automatic rifles during deer season. \u201cWhen I grew up, I was taught: You shoot one shot,\u201d Gedeon says. \u201cYou don\u2019t come get a second or third shot.\u201d\n\nGedeon voted for Trump. \u201cI felt good voting for who I voted for,\u201d he adds, unprompted. And he still feels good about his vote. \u201cYes, 100 percent,\u201d he says. \u201cNo qualms about him at all.\u201d\n\nBut Gedeon votes for the man, not the party. After Lamb introduces himself, Gedeon wastes no time sharing his displeasure with Saccone, practically a neighbor, for never asking him about the hunting bill. Lamb asserts he\u2019s pro-hunter and pro-gun, says he would\u2019ve given Gedeon a call, and asks for his support. (Years ago, at an alumni gathering when Lamb was still a Marine Corps JAG and I was in law school, he and I got into it over gun control, where he questioned why the vast majority of responsible gun owners should have their freedoms burdened by the sins of a few criminals, and the practical improbability of any law managing to significantly reduce the number of guns.) Gedeon ends the short conversation with a handshake, says he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet, but he\u2019s open to voting Democrat in the special election.\n\n\u201cWe can get him,\u201d Lamb says confidently a few minutes later as we walk toward a Marines-themed display case full of combat knives. If he can meet voters, and talk to them\u2014really talk to them honestly and rationally, and not get bogged down by partisan labels and national politics\u2014Lamb\u2019s sure he can win this thing.\n\nTake, for example, immigration. In a district dotted with shuttered steel mills, Lamb believes voters will come around to his position if he can hold an honest, earnest discussion. \u201cI think too often the whole issue gets talked about as if we were writing from a blank slate, or we can pick whatever we want, or the government is all powerful,\u201d Lamb says. \u201cNone of which is true.\u201d\n\nThere are only four real options on immigration, Lamb explains. One, try to kick every undocumented immigrant out. Two, legalize the Dreamers\u2014undocumented immigrants brought here as children\u2014but try to kick out all the other migrants here illegally. Three, \u201cthe Dreamers obviously should stay,\u201d and \u201cthe other 11\u00bd million people, who knows how they got here, but they\u2019re here, they\u2019re in the shadows, that\u2019s not really helping anybody, [so] let\u2019s find a way to pull them out [of the shadows.]\u201d And then there\u2019s four: no change, continue the current policies.\n\n\u201cI really believe that if you present those four options to people, 90 percent choose option three,\u201d he says, adding that he also supports increased border security, but at ports of entry, not a wall.\n\nLamb also believes voters can distinguish between a politician who is pro-coal worker\u2014like he is, backing a federal guaranty miners\u2019 pensions\u2014rather than just pro-coal. The lost mining jobs aren\u2019t coming back, Lamb says. \u201cWe have to get real about what the options are, and make sure the economy is diverse,\u201d which means he\u2019s not ready to trash the Clean Air Act just yet.\n\nAnd Lamb trusts voters can accept that he\u2019s anti-abortion, personally, but respects that choice is the law of the land.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Lamb is taking him head-on, stylistically if not substantively (the candidate is quick to say he\u2019s eager to work on issues like infrastructure and opioids with the president). While Trump and his detractors trade competing narrative volleys, armed with alternative sets of facts to back their differing opinions, Lamb is betting his campaign on his ability to marshal objective truth to cut through the noise and sway voters.\n\nBut Lamb knows no one will listen to his well-argued points if the district\u2019s 93-percent white, predominantly working-class residents dismiss him as just another liberal elitist before he can even open his mouth. \u201cFDR said one time that the true test of government was that people wanted to know that their government walked on the same side of the street that they did,\u201d Lamb says. \u201cSo, that\u2019s the impression I want people to be left with: Not necessarily what my policy papers say, just that I\u2019m accessible and that I\u2019m one of them\u2014that they can always find me, and trust me to at least tell them the truth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a campaign strategy that hinges on how Lamb interacts with voters\u2014something he does pretty well for a novice. He tends to speak with deep resolve in his voice\u2014even his questions seem to end in periods. Like a lot of politicians, Lamb is tall\u20146-foot-3\u2014but he has a habit of leaning in and jutting his head forward a bit when he talks to voters, as if he\u2019s been drawn in by whatever you have to say. He\u2019ll repeat your name before the conversation\u2019s end, and make a lame joke at his own expense about getting lost once in your home town. The body language, the call backs, the self-deprecation all instill the sense that he\u2019s really listening\u2014a useful trick here, where voters have long felt forgotten. \n\n\n\nIf Lamb does retail politics like a natural, it might be because he comes from a political family. Lamb was born and raised in the suburbs of Pittsburgh to a family of Irish Catholic Democrats. His grandfather, Tom, was the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate and his uncle, Michael, is Pittsburgh\u2019s controller. After high school at all-boys Central Catholic, Lamb moved across the state to go to the University of Pennsylvania, where he stayed for law school. After Penn, Lamb eschewed big law for the Marine Corps, which commissioned him as a Judge Advocate in Okinawa, Japan, despite Lamb\u2019s request to go into infantry. (\u201cYou went to Penn Law,\u201d Lamb remembers being told, \u201cI can make anybody an infantry officer, I need you to be a lawyer.\u201d)\n\nHe counts a Lasallian Christian Brother among his closest friends. The two like to critique Sunday liturgy the way movie buffs discuss an actor\u2019s performance, picking apart not just what was said in the homily, but how it was delivered. Such careful focus on how a priest can enliven and update material that\u2019s 2,000 years old has paid off on the trail, where Lamb tends to deliver short, lively speeches heavy on patriotism and optimism and light on legislative proposals, leaving the longer policy discussions for one-on-one chats.\n\nHe\u2019s not afraid to throw some punches, though. As a federal prosecutor, Lamb directed a righteous fury at \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d drug dealers and gun runners. On the campaign trail, it\u2019s mostly Saccone and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan who draw his opprobrium. After the American Legion campaign rally, Lamb grants a series of interviews, fielding questions about abortion, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Trump. For Lamb, nothing good can come from those lines of inquiry, and so he deflects. \u201cI\u2019m not running against the president, I\u2019m running against Rick Saccone,\u201d Lamb likes to say, pivoting to a litany of his opponent\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cHe votes against education funding, he voted against Narcan, the thing that saves people\u2019s lives, and he\u2019s gonna have some explaining about his support for Paul Ryan, who now wants to come after Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nLamb has also run heavily on the Republican tax cuts, calling them a \u201ccomplete betrayal of the middle class.\u201d So too have the super PACs backing Saccone. Their attack on Lamb can be summed up as, \u201cHe\u2019s a liberal who opposes the tax cuts and would support Nancy Pelosi.\u201d The truth is more complicated\u2014Lamb has actually called on Pelosi to step down from Democratic leadership\u2014but it\u2019s difficult to say whether voters will even get to hear those protestations over the massive amounts of super PAC attack ads asserting otherwise. Republican PACs have already spent $4.7 million in support of Saccone since Murphy resigned in October. That\u2019s double what Murphy had to fundraise in any of his races in the 18th.\n\nWhile the Republicans are trying to make all politics national, Lamb\u2019s trying to keep things local. He has foresworn super PAC support and is keeping the fired-up national Democratic groups at arms-length. According to the Washington Post, Republican-linked groups have outspent their Democratic rivals here 17-to-1.\n\nHis campaign says it\u2019s a deliberate move\u2014that he\u2019s worried that outside PAC support would boomerang and bolster the accusations that he\u2019s just another liberal Democrat. His campaign maintains it doesn\u2019t want to fall into the same trap Jon Ossoff did in Georgia, where national groups flooded in and turned the first special election after 2016 into a referendum on the two national parties instead of two individuals running for Congress.\n\nLamb, who managed to raise $560,000 in just two months last year and has spent nearly a million so far in campaign ads, feels he can personally raise enough money to keep the race close, especially given his opponent\u2019s reputation as a weak fundraiser. Saccone raised just $214,000 last year, including $42,000 transferred from a Senate campaign he abandoned to seek the 18th seat, and his campaign has spent less than $100,000 on ads. (Saccone\u2019s campaign did not respond to repeated interview requests.)\n\nLamb has recently accepted outside help from some prominent Democrats, but only those who fit the mold: white, Catholic, pro-union. Rep. Joe Kennedy III made a campaign stop, and Rep. Tim Ryan, who challenged Pelosi for leadership, has sent fundraising appeals on Lamb\u2019s behalf. So, too, did Randy Bryce, the Democratic ironworker challenging Paul Ryan in Wisconsin. Joe Biden will make a visit and his American Possibilities PAC sent out a fundraising letter on Lamb\u2019s behalf. \n\nSome of Lamb\u2019s supporters worry that his overabundance of caution is allowing Republicans to define him\u2014a serious disadvantage for a candidate with little name recognition. The same poll taken in mid-February that showed Lamb within striking distance of Saccone also showed that 20 percent of district voters still had no opinion of him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the campaign is taking advantage of the moment right now,\u201d says a Democratic consultant familiar with the area.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any doubt that [Lamb\u2019s] being significantly outspent on television by the Saccone people and their interests,\u201d says G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College poll and the dean of Pennsylvania political observers. \u201cThe Democrats at a national level and their interest groups don\u2019t seem to be nearly as engaged. \u2026 The Republicans realize how significant this is and they don\u2019t want to risk losing this seat and creating a literal meltdown.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe special election won\u2019t directly affect the outcome of the November midterms. Lamb and Saccone are running to fill the remainder of Murphy\u2019s term, meaning that whoever wins will be up for reelection just seven months later in November. Win or lose, Lamb says he\u2019ll be running again then.\n\nBy then, the district may look radically different than it does today. In January, the state Supreme Court found Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional districts unconstitutional and ordered the General Assembly to draw up new maps in time for the May primary. Republicans in Harrisburg have submitted a new map that would make the 18th District even more rural and place Lamb\u2019s Mount Lebanon home outside of the district. Pennsylvania Democrats immediately decried the new plans, and Gov. Tom Wolf submitted his own in response. The state Supreme Court said it will decide on a map by Monday and may draw its own\u2014a decision that is likely set off another set of legal challenges before any redistricting is finalized.\n\nFor now, Lamb\u2019s focused on the race ahead of him. After a full day on the trail, I meet up with him at a dimly lit corner table at a Hilton Garden Inn just outside Pittsburgh. It\u2019s 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday and I\u2019m nursing a beer. Lamb, who started his day at 5:30 a.m., orders a coffee, black. He has more meetings after this interview.\n\nWe\u2019re joined at the table by Lamb\u2019s younger brother, Coleman, who\u2019s working full time on the campaign for free, lest anyone accuse Conor of nepotism, and Mike Madeo, the candidate\u2019s body man. Madeo, who met Lamb in the Marines, is now playing aide-de-campaign for a guy four years his junior. I ask him why. He leans in and looks me directly in the eye.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the antidote to what is wrong with modern day politics,\u201d Madeo says. \u201cI think he\u2019s actually going to work with people to try to get shit done.\u201d\n\nMinus the swearing, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from a campaign staffer. But it\u2019s also a testament of faith I hear again and again from Lamb\u2019s choir of die-hard supporters: He can transcend this world of partisan hackery, fake news narratives and outrage-driven politics. Just how much of that is actually about Lamb, and how much of that is simply anti-Trump fervor, is hard to tell.\n\nFor his part, the candidate does little to dampen the hopes others place in him to restore politics to some bygone era when morally outstanding men brokered bipartisan deals and used long-winded, in-person arguments to sway voters instead of outrage-inducing tribal appeals on Twitter and TV.\n\nInstead, he sees it as a kind of legacy.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather \u2026 always used to say\u2014I remember it really well\u2014that he was proud to be a politician,\u201d says Lamb, who bought and moved into his grandfather\u2019s Mount Lebanon house last year. \u201cHe wanted to redeem that word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been ashamed to tell anyone that I was interested in this life [running for office], because I saw it [growing up], and I knew it could be good. And, honestly, I probably get more motivated the more maligned and degraded the whole thing has become.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ben White", "body": "Donald Trump swept into the White House on a promise to run the government like a business and stock his administration with titans of industry.\n\nJust over a year into Trump\u2019s presidency, those titans are leaving, driven out by a chief executive who doesn\u2019t want to hear no, doesn\u2019t trust anyone but himself and can\u2019t stand to share the spotlight, even with those he once hailed as \u201cthe best people\u201d on earth for these jobs.\n\nTrump humiliated Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of oil industry giant ExxonMobil whom he once described as \u201cthe embodiment of the American dream,\u201d firing him by tweet. He repeatedly rejected the advice of National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, driving the former president of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs nuts with his stubborn insistence on tariffs and hastening Cohn\u2019s exit.\n\nAnd he went ice cold on Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, reportedly telling the Wall Street legend that his understanding of trade was \u201cterrible,\u201d as West Wing aides leaked stories about Ross dozing off in meetings. Remember those CEO councils Trump initially set up to get advice from America\u2019s top executives? They shut down in August.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for publicly and privately torturing powerful leaders in his administration extends to military brass. National security adviser H.R. McMaster is likely on the way out with chief of staff John Kelly, a retired four-star general, possibly to follow. But it is Trump\u2019s break with his Masters of the Universe that undercuts most clearly a central premise of his appeal as a candidate: He knew what it took to be successful and he would hire people in his own image. The breakup, say White House officials, outside experts and even the president\u2019s close friends, was inevitable.\n\nTrump for decades ran a private real-estate and branding empire where he was the only star. He ran a personality-driven campaign where he said and did whatever he wanted, a strategy that resulted in stunning primary wins and a general election victory that few saw coming. And now Trump is even more fed up with strong-willed advisers who tell him he shouldn\u2019t declare trade wars, or take it so easy on Russia, or decide on a whim to stage a summit with a nuclear-armed North Korean dictator who it turns out might never have extended the invite in the first place.\n\nTrump is simply returning to who he\u2019s always been, a one-man reality show who prefers to be surrounded by admirers who will praise and fawn over him and confirm that all his instincts are correct and brilliant and certain to succeed. The wonder is that anyone is surprised.\n\n\u201cThere is an enormous literature on narcissistic leaders who rise to power because of grandiosity and an overwhelming amount of self-confidence,\u201d Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s business school, told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t tend to get along well with other strong leaders. Trump doesn\u2019t want anyone to stand in his way and he certainly doesn\u2019t want anyone who takes up any of his light or disagrees with him. He wants people who are willing to ingratiate themselves and flatter him. This is the way it was always going to be.\u201d \n\n\n\nWhen Trump hired Cohn away from Goldman Sachs, the president couldn\u2019t stop bragging about what a coup he pulled off by landing one of the top executives from the bluest of blue chip Wall Street firms. Never mind that Trump\u2019s final campaign ad treated Goldman as part of a global cabal out to destroy America.\n\n\u201cAs my top economic advisor, Gary Cohn is going to put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people,\u201d the president said after the hiring. In July of last year, Trump said in Wall Street Journal interview that he was thinking of nominating Cohn to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, possibly the most powerful finance job on the planet.\n\nThen it all came crashing down. Cohn sharply and publicly criticized the president\u2019s equivocating response to a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, leading to a tense Oval Office meeting, resignation threats and the end of Cohn\u2019s Fed chances.\n\nThings improved as Cohn helped drive through Trump\u2019s signature tax cut bill. But then the White House agenda moved on to trade and Cohn began to push back hard against Trump\u2019s instincts to slap giant tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Things came to a head in an Oval Office meeting in January when Cohn told the president his tariffs would crush consumers and industries that rely on imported metals.\n\n\u201cThese are the facts, where are your facts?\u201d Cohn said to Wilbur Ross and Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro, two of the administration\u2019s leading protectionists, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump rejected Cohn\u2019s facts and pushed ahead with tariffs, announcing them in a rushed manner with no actual policy ready to roll out.\n\nDays later, Cohn said he was leaving. And Trump slipped in a parting jab. \u201cHe may be a globalist, but I still like him,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cHe is seriously a globalist. There's no question.\u201d\n\nIn Cohn\u2019s place, Trump has hired former CNBC host and long-time Wall Street economist Larry Kudlow, who is also an avowed free trader and predicted during the campaign that Trump\u2019s trade policies would tank the stock market. In early commentary, Kudlow has moved closer to Trump on trade, applauding the idea of cracking down on China. The former Reagan administration OMB official may yet prove to be just as aggressive as Cohn in resisting Trump\u2019s mercantilist impulses. But the reason Trump hired Kudlow is mainly because he often says nice things about the president on television.\n\n\u201cTrump says he wants to be surrounded by a diversity of opinion but he doesn\u2019t really mean it,\u201d Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution told me. \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to be told that he\u2019s wrong.\u201d \n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s treatment of Tillerson was even more brutal than his clashes with Cohn.\n\nStories began to leak last fall that the president strongly disliked the ExxonMobil CEO, who had different ideas on dealing with Iran, Russia and North Korea. Tillerson, accustomed to being the unquestioned boss himself (after all, he had led a 75,300 employee corporation for 11 years), chafed at Trump\u2019s unwillingness to listen to his ideas or keep him involved in top diplomatic priorities. It was as if Trump was ignoring the very attribute that observers said made Tillerson appealing in the first place: He had negotiated with many key world leaders already\u2014and succeeded at it.\n\nIn late September, after Tillerson said he was working on a dialogue with North Korea about their weapons program, Trump immediately took to Twitter to tell the world his secretary of state shouldn\u2019t bother. \u201cI told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nShortly after this clash, reports emerged that at a July 20th meeting at the Pentagon, Tillerson referred to the president as a \u201cfucking moron.\u201d The secretary of state never denied the remark. He was then left twisting for months amid reports that he would soon be ousted.\n\nThe relationship cratered for good in recent days. While traveling in Africa, Tillerson said the U.S. and North Korea were \u201ca long way\u201d from direct negotiations on the nuclear program. A day later, Trump announced he would hold a summit with the North Korean leader and Tillerson admitted he had no idea the announcement was coming.\n\nOn March 13th, with Tillerson just returning from Africa, Trump fired the secretary of state by tweet, announcing he would be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo. He then also fired Tillerson\u2019s chief spokesman for denying the White House line that Tillerson knew about the firing plans in advance. Trump\u2019s pledge of running the nation like a business had totally gone off the rails.\n\n\u201cNo board of directors at any big company would ever permit this type of treatment or this level of chaos,\u201d says Pfeffer.\n\nFollowing the split with Tillerson and Cohn, some officials inside the administration, on Capitol Hill and in corporate America increasingly fear that the president is entering a period in which he will cast aside any strong advisers\u2014whether top executives or senior military officials\u2014who disagree with him while increasingly making rash decisions on his own.\n\nAnd they say his early hiring of former top executives with strong personalities never really worked because Trump didn\u2019t care very much about what they had to say and didn\u2019t want them taking high-profile roles.\n\n\u201cYou never really could convince him of anything and he doesn\u2019t really listen to anyone but himself,\u201d one senior White House official told me recently. \u201cYou need people around to make these alternate cases, but I don\u2019t think he really wants that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s friends and defenders don\u2019t really deny that the president is moving into a new phase of his presidency where he will naturally be less inclined to rely on executives who have subject-matter expertise like Cohn or Tillerson. The president is growing in confidence, these people say, and increasingly believes he is best served following his own instincts rather than relying on the savvy guidance of former top executives.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that there have been a number of personnel changes in the White House beginning with the first year and continuing,\u201d Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump confidant, told me. \u201cUnderstandably, the president's been going through an adjustment period after he left business life and went into political life. In politics, he started out with people having great credentials, but discovered that track record is a better criteria.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe question now is what the White House will look like once all the business titans are gone.\n\nThe biggest fear in the economic world is that Trump will no longer have any real constraints on his desire to impose major tariffs both on U.S. allies and on sometime-adversaries like China.\n\nCohn managed to get carve-outs for allies Canada and Mexico in the recently announced steel and aluminum tariffs. But once he\u2019s gone, Trump may feel free to be Trump.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman banker and movie producer, comes out of the business world and is generally in favor of free trade. But he\u2019s viewed both inside the White House and outside as someone very disinclined to buck the president, privately or publicly.\n\nWith Cohn gone, the U.S. is now at greater risk of trade wars and the possible end of the North American Free Trade agreement, a development most economists believe would be catastrophic.\n\n\u201cI think we are already marching down that path and it\u2019s not at all clear what will restrain him,\u201d Galston told me. \u201cHe is under the illusion that trade wars are easy to win and there is no historical evidence to support that. And my fear is that rather than back down his inclination will be to plunge forward and double down in the face of adversity.\u201d\n\nThe other major risk is that the exodus of business minds spreads to military and national security advisers and anyone else in the president\u2019s orbit who dares to express a contrary opinion or urge caution to a chief executive who believes his gut instincts turned him into the one of the most successful people in the world.\n\n\u201cI think all of these types of people will be gone soon and all for the exact same reason,\u201d says Pfeffer. \u201cTrump has gotten to where he is by basically being who he is and if you are a strong-minded person yourself and believe you have something substantial to contribute, you don\u2019t want to stick around and keep getting run over by the boss.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Susan B.

Warner calls out Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in arguably more explicit terms than any Democrat has yet, saying he has read the underlying classified material used in the memo and that Nunes misrepresented it as part of a McCarthyite \u201csecret Star Chamber\u201d effort to discredit the FBI probe of the president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this coordinated effort to try to impede the investigation,\u201d Warner says. The Nunes memo, which is apparently drawn from information contained in the same late-2017 document dumps that has caused the Senate panel to expand its inquiry, is based on \u201cfabrications\u201d and \u201cconnecting dots that don\u2019t connect,\u201d Warner asserts.\n\nMy interview with Warner\u2014and his revelation of the Senate panel\u2019s expanded investigation into Trump\u2014came a few hours before the New York Times reported that the president had threatened to fire Mueller last summer, leading to days of headlines over whether Congress should step in to legislatively block Trump from being able to oust the special counsel investigating him. Warner and other Democrats, joined by a few Republicans, have been urging such a step for months. Although GOP congressional leaders are unlikely to permit a vote, many senators in both parties have signaled to Trump in recent days that a move against Mueller would amount to an explosive escalation. Firing Mueller \u201cwould be the end of his presidency,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been an on-again, off-again ally of Trump\u2019s, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nBeyond the understandable focus on Mueller\u2019s job security, both disclosures struck me as getting at a perilous truth for the Trump White House one year into his presidency: Not only is the Russia investigation not going away, but questions associated with it are multiplying, whether it\u2019s the new evidence Warner says his committee must now investigate or the revelation that the special counsel himself is on the long list of those, like fired FBI director James Comey and the current deputy FBI director and deputy attorney general, that Trump has made very clear he wants out.\n\nAt a minimum, the fact that we continue to learn so much new information after so many months of investigation is a reminder of why it\u2019s important to be cautious about the endless punditry analyzing the prospects of a probe whose substance we still know very little about. For now at least, questions like the ones endlessly debated on cable TV \u2014 Will Trump be impeached if the House is retaken by Democrats in November? When and how will Mueller deliver a final report on the allegations, and will he seek the unprecedented step of trying to indict a sitting president? \u2014 remain almost pointless speculation.\n\nAnd they will continue to be until the basic concerns we started the investigation with are no longer hanging out there, shadowing the Trump White House with serious doubts that clearly infuriate the president: Did Trump or any close advisers actively collaborate with the Russians who sought to sway the 2016 race on his behalf? Did the president or others seek to cover up their dealings with Russians \u2013 or promise them concrete actions, like lifting U.S. economic sanctions on the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in exchange for Kremlin help? Once in office, have the president or members of his inner circle tried to obstruct the investigations into those questions?\n\nWe may not have the public evidence yet to definitely resolve those questions, but Warner offers a provocative rationale for why it is we are now seeing such a stepped-up campaign by Trump and his defenders against those who seek to provide us the answers.\n\n\u201cMueller is getting closer and closer to the truth,\u201d Warner tells me, and \u201ccloser and closer to the truth is getting closer and closer to the president.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee that Warner leads along with Republican Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina has remained a relative outpost of bipartisanship amid the escalating partisan catcalls over Russia, and throughout our nearly hour-long conversation about the investigation, I found Warner, a successful tech entrepreneur before he became a politician, careful to say what he and the committee know -- and don\u2019t know -- about the explosive Trump-Russia allegations.\n\nOn the revelations contained in the latest document dumps, for example, Warner says the panel still cannot attest to their \u201cveracity or truthfulness\u201d and is now \u201ctrying to either corroborate or not\u201d by calling up to a dozen new witnesses. He also says that the allegations contained in the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and made public last year remain neither \u201cproven nor, conversely, disproven\u201d despite the extensive investigations. \u201cThat's pretty amazing,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause as long as that sits out there, there's going to be a cloud that hangs over this administration.\u201d\n\nWarner says he and the Senate panel remain focused almost exclusively on the initial questions surrounding the Russian election intervention and alleged collusion; the senators have decided that questions surrounding possible Trump obstruction of justice, \u201cbecause it falls into criminality,\u201d should remain largely in the \u201cpurview\u201d of Mueller.\n\nWhile he acknowledges that the Senate probe may have months more to run and that no conclusions have been reached on the key question of Trump and collusion, Warner tells me that a bipartisan majority on the panel is now in agreement on the basic facts of the case aside from that. \u201cVirtually every member of our committee, Democrat or Republican, would agree,\u201d he says, that Russia sought to intervene in 2016 on Trump\u2019s behalf with \u201ctraditional spycraft\u201d of stealing information and then releasing it, along with not-so-traditional methods of using social media platforms, compromising state voting systems and offering \u201cdirt\u201d on Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cSenator Burr and my Republican colleagues, they\u2019ve looked at the same facts I\u2019ve looked at, and we may have areas where we disagree on conclusions, but we don\u2019t disagree on facts,\u201d Warner says, still a noteworthy conclusion given that President Trump himself has continued to cast doubt on the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Russians did in fact seek to influence the presidential race to Trump\u2019s benefit.\n\nStill, the spiraling investigation by the senators as well as Mueller suggests there is much we still don\u2019t know about a case that already has, as the Watergate author Elizabeth Drew put it in an interview for The Global Politico last spring, \u201cmore characters than a Russian novel.\u201d\n\nIn our conversation, Warner reels off a few of the characters whose actions he finds particularly significant \u2013 and about which he did not know when the probe started \u2013 including Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s efforts to build a Trump hotel in Moscow, efforts that continued up to the campaign; the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law, and campaign manager, and Russians claiming to have damaging information on Clinton; and the claim to an Australian diplomat by a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser that he\u2019d been offered information by the Russians.\n\nBut mid-investigation, much confusion still abounds. Consider the case of that former foreign policy adviser. The little-known George Papadopoulos emerged as a surprise figure in the Mueller investigation late last year, when it was revealed he had decided to cooperate in the probe and plead guilty to a charge of lying to the FBI. The president\u2019s defenders have characterized him as little more than an obscure junior official, \u201cthe coffee boy,\u201d as one Trump ally put it. But in an interview last week, Papapdopoulos\u2019s fianc\u00e9e spoke out for the first time and insisted that, far from being a coffee boy, he would emerge as a \u201cJohn Dean\u201d-like figure in the Trump case, offering damning revelations akin to those from the Nixon White House counsel that helped bring down that president.\n\nSo which is it, I ask Warner: coffee boy or John Dean? \u201cI don\u2019t know any coffee boy in any campaign that I\u2019ve been involved with,\u201d the senator quickly replies, \u201cthat had direct communications with the absolute senior leadership with the campaign.\u201d\n\nStill, it will be months if not years before we know for sure what George Papadopoulos \u2013 or Donald Trump for that matter -- knew and when he knew it.\n\nIn the meantime, the spectacle on Capitol Hill is sure to continue. In the Senate, Warner and Burr are negotiating over which witnesses to call next, and Warner makes it very clear he does not believe the Senate panel can finish its work without public testimony from key players like Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and lawyer Michael Cohen. Over on the House side, meanwhile, Republican leaders may allow a vote as soon as Monday on whether to publicly release the controversial Nunes memo \u2013 despite fervent objections from Trump\u2019s own Justice Department that doing so could harm national security.\n\nNone of which has all that much to do with the basic, jaw-dropping question that started the investigation off in the first place: just how and why Russia succeeded in intervening in an American presidential election on behalf of one of the candidates. With the 2018 midterm elections set to begin little more than a month from now, Warner says that\u2019s still the big story, even if it\u2019s in danger of being lost in a drumbeat of partisan name-calling.\n\n\u201cIf you add up all of the money Russia spent interfering in our election; if you add on what they spent in the French elections, where Facebook took down 50,000 sites that were connected to Russia because they\u2019d seen the Russian intervention, if you add up what they spent on the Dutch elections, where the Dutch hand-counted all of their ballots because they were so afraid of Russian intervention,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou add all that up and you\u2019re still talking about less money than the cost of one new F-35 airplane.\u201d\n\nRussia, Warner says, is not the only U.S. adversary in the world that can figure out a smart investment in America when it sees one.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Nolan D.

Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nThey asked for a response from the Ethics Committee by Jan. 5. Two months have since elapsed, and members say they\u2019ve heard nothing back. Members are considering issuing a follow-up letter, which would be the third in a saga one member says began almost two years ago. And if Democrats retake the House in November, they\u2019re almost certain to raise the issue again.\n\nA spokesperson for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment.\n\nThe practice reaches the highest levels of Congress. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) are among the dozens of members who sleep in their offices overnight. Estimates of how many do it range from 40-plus to more than 100. And while the list skews heavily Republican and male, some women and Democrats do it, too.\n\nThe Democratic critics argue that the behavior is unethical and beneath the dignity of the office. They also say it is unfair to the hundreds of members who choose to live outside the Capitol paying Washington\u2019s high living costs.\n\n\u201cThe House office buildings are \u2018OFFICE\u2019 buildings,\u201d the letter continues. \u201c[E]ach Member\u2019s office within the building should be used to serve the people of the Member\u2019s district, not as a personal residence. The House office buildings are not apartment complexes, homes or any other kind of residence.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats also say lawmakers sleeping in their offices could create a hostile work environment, particularly if staffers are tasked with cleaning up members\u2019 sleeping arrangements or interacting with lawmakers in inappropriate sleeping attire. However, even in the #MeToo era, there\u2019s been no indication that sleeping in the office has led to any untoward behavior or harassment.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nLawmakers who sleep in the Capitol reject these charges; they say it\u2019s a way for them to work harder for their constituents.\n\n\u201cI get up very early in the morning. I work out. I work until about 11:30 at night. I go to bed. And I do the same thing the next day,\u201d Ryan said in 2015 when asked whether he would continue sleeping in his office after becoming speaker. \u201cIt actually makes me more efficient. I can actually get more work done by sleeping on a cot in my office.\u201d\n\nThe letter recommends that if the committee determines the practice is permitted, that members who live in House office buildings be taxed at the \u201cfair market value of a Capitol Hill apartment.\u201d\n\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) pointed out in an interview that lawmakers pay taxes on reserved parking spaces on the Capitol campus but can live in their offices for free.\n\n\u201cIf it is OK, then aren\u2019t there tax implications?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you park your car in a reserved spot, you pay taxes on that. You park your body in a reserved spot overnight on a daily basis and there\u2019s no tax implication. That doesn\u2019t seem to make too much sense.\u201d\n\nSome CBC members also suggested that if the committee gives a formal green light to the practice, the House should provide lawmakers a per diem to help with living expenses, as many state legislatures do across the country, or a cost-of-living salary increase.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cWe think what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander,\u201d Watson Coleman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving members an opportunity to live here rent-free using all the facilities, then perhaps those who are forced to live outside of the campus should have some consideration as well.\u201d\n\nOne CBC member who declined to be named also criticized Republicans for advocating cuts to safety net programs while living rent-free in a government building.\n\n\u201cI think public housing should be for people who need it, not for members of Congress,\u201d the member said, adding that some of the lawmakers who sleep in the Capitol are  the CBC members are growing impatient with the Ethics Committee\u2019s pace in addressing their inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think that two months is more than enough time for the committee to do its work,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNormally, when members inquire of the committee, there\u2019s always a prompt response.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

WITCH HUNT!\u201d A day later: \u201cWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?

And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d\n\nRepublicans took to the Sunday shows apparently concerned about where that tweetstorm could be headed. \u201cI mean, talking to my colleagues all along it was, you know, once he goes after Mueller, then we'll take action,\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said Trump firing Mueller would \u201cbe the beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d\n\nBut would he really do it? And what political consequences would he face if he did? We rounded up a handful of political experts to answer that question, and they\u2019re just as confused as we are. Republicans and Democrats, Trump friend and Trump foe alike all agree, more or less, that firing Mueller should be a red line\u2014but they\u2019re not so sure it would be. Here\u2019s what they told us:\n\n\n\n\u2018Republicans will make some initial noise, but ultimately, do nothing.\u2019\n\n Ana Navarro is a Republican strategist and commentator.\n\nRepublicans have become the boys that cried wolf. Time and time again they have remained in complicit silence as Trump attacks American institutions, cyber-bullies the special counsel and law enforcement and one-by-one has fired the people standing in between him and Mueller.\n\nThe warnings on Sunday against such a move, from congressional Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Jeff Flake, ring hollow because the same congressional Republicans haven\u2019t acted on legislation that might actually protect the American people from obstruction of justice by their own president. These lawmakers would be a lot better off protecting the country and themselves from such an action by passing the Graham-Booker legislation, which would check the executive branch\u2019s ability to remove a special counsel and give an added layer of protection to a possible politically motivated, self-interested firing of Mueller.\n\nBut Congress hasn\u2019t acted on it. Even the bill\u2019s co-author, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, said in January that while he would \u201cbe glad to pass it right now,\u201d he also didn\u2019t think it was necessary. This inaction tells us all we need to know about what the GOP will do if Trump fires Mueller\u2014make some initial noise, but ultimately, do nothing.\n\n\u2018A House more willing to impeach, but a Senate less willing to convict.\u2019\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to believe Republicans would abandon Trump if Mueller was fired. Trump and his allies have been disparaging the investigation as a political witch hunt from the start, which has successfully sullied Mueller\u2019s reputation among Republican base voters. In both the POLITICO/Morning Consult and the USA Today/Suffolk University poll, a strong plurality of Republicans distrust and disapprove of Mueller. These base voters won\u2019t flinch if Trump whacks Mueller, but they would punish any Republican officeholder open to impeachment and conviction.\n\nFiring Mueller would also supercharge the Democratic base; Democratic voters would not only be fired up for the election, they would be fired up for impeachment. But that\u2019s not all bad news for Trump: Several Democratic congresspeople up for re-election represent states and districts Trump won, including 10 senators and nine House members (including newly elected Conor Lamb). They and some other Democrats don\u2019t want the midterms to be a referendum on impeachment; they want to emphasize pocketbook issues. But impeachment talk could crowd everything else out. Perhaps that wouldn\u2019t stop a \u201cBlue Wave\u201d giving Democrats the House, but it could hamper the already uphill battle for Democrats to claim the Senate.\n\nThe net result could be a House more willing to impeach, but a Senate less willing to convict.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t seen Republicans in Congress, as a whole, standing up to the president.\u2019\n\n Katie Packer Beeson is a commentator and the founder of Burning Glass Consulting. She has managed several campaigns, from state legislative to presidential, and was the deputy campaign manager for the Mitt Romney campaign in 2012.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, I think most reasonable people would consider it to be obstruction of justice. And I hope that Republican leaders and members of Congress would see that as a red line and get serious about their own investigation.\n\nThat said, I haven\u2019t seen Republicans in Congress, as a whole, standing up to the president and his bullying, self-interested behavior in a way that gives him any pause. So I would be pleasantly surprised to see that happen.\n\nIf Congress abdicates its role in our system of checks and balances and acts only with partisan interest, then we may as well kiss our Constitution goodbye. I hope we\u2019re not there yet, but if Trump does fire Mueller, the political aftermath might tell us if we are.\n\n\u2018Another FBI firing would make an obstruction of justice case more clear-cut than it was in Watergate.\u2019\n\nDouglas Schoen is a political analyst and former adviser to President Bill Clinton.\n\nFiring Mueller would almost certainly lead to the impeachment of President Trump and a trial in the Senate where the chance of removal from office would be very real, because another FBI firing would make an obstruction of justice case more clear-cut than it was in Watergate.\n\nThe firing of Mueller would cross a red line for legislators of both parties, and I believe the consequences would be even direr than they were for former president Nixon when he fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in October 1973, which prompted the resignations of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. A week after those resignations, a plurality of Americans favored impeachment, and soon afterward, a number of impeachment resolutions were introduced in Congress.\n\nIt would mean a 1974-style blow in the 2018 midterm elections for the Republicans, and it would severely weaken President Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, should he somehow stay in office until then.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure there are plenty of historians around the president who will remind him of the consequences.\u2019\n\nFrank Luntz is a Republican pollster.\n\n \n\nWe saw what firing the special prosecutor and the attorney general did to Richard Nixon. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of historians around the president who will remind him of the consequences.\n\n\u2018The tidal wave of leaks from the FBI and intelligence community would be astounding.\u2019\n\nRick Wilson is a GOP operative.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, Trump fires Mueller, triggers the constitutional crisis that stains his presidential legacy forever and brings down the Republican majority.\n\nHere\u2019s what would happen immediately: nothing. The GOP would go into \u201cFurrowed Brows and Deep Concern\u201d mode, and pretend it didn\u2019t happen. Republicans fear Trump\u2019s tweets, Fox News and his base more than they revere the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution. I\u2019ve said this before, and the joke is less of a joke and more of a caution at this point, but Trump could kill and eat a live baby on the South Lawn of the White House and the GOP caucus would shrug and say, \u201cWell, he\u2019s new at this. He\u2019s not a traditional politician.\u201d\n\nI think it would almost certainly make the 2018 election a referendum the GOP\u2019s support of Trump. We\u2019d see a replay of the \u201cscandal turnover\u201d elections where one party was marked by political corruption and blown out of office.\n\nIn 1973, Republicans were screaming about fake news and witch hunts. In 1974, many of those same people were looking for jobs: The Republicans lost 48 House and 8 Senate seats that year, and Democrats made large gains in state legislatures. Twenty years later, in 1994, Democrats lost in a landslide in midterm races dominated by the issue of corruption. The GOP took that ride in 2006 in the wake of the Mark Foley congressional page scandal and the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.\n\nWhat happens after the firing? Mueller is smart, and I presume he has a lot of the process set to continue on autopilot in the event that he gets taken off of it himself unexpectedly. Most of the FBI\u2019s work will continue regardless of whom the president fires.\n\nOh, and one thing Trump might not be anticipating as he considers the possibility of firing Mueller: The tidal wave of leaks from the FBI and intelligence community would be astounding.\n\n\u2018It will be a lot like 1974\u2014even without a presidential resignation.\u2019\n\nMichael Kazin is the editor of Dissent.\n\nSince taking office, Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on anyone who alleges that the Russians may have helped him win the presidency\u2014or even that they tried\u2014have failed to dent his popularity among the large majority of Americans who voted for him. And hardly any Republican politicians (and no Fox hosts) have broken with him over his charges.\n\nWhy would this change if he fired Mueller? Unless the special counsel presents unimpeachable evidence of collusion, which seems doubtful, his firing may actually fire up Trump\u2019s core voters more than it alienates them. Most already think he is being hounded unfairly and like it when he fights back.\n\nOn the other hand, the controversy over the firing (depending when it occurs) will likely dominate politics until the midterm elections and make it impossible to pass any legislation of significance in the Senate if not the House. And because of it, Republicans will lose the House and quite a few governorships in the fall. It will be a lot like 1974\u2014even without a presidential resignation.\n\n\u2018All of this would only hurt GOP chances in the midterms.\u2019\n\nScottie Nell Hughes is a political strategist and former surrogate for the Trump campaign.\n\nIf President Trump fired Mueller, vindication from the charges of Russian collusion in the court of public opinion would be almost inconceivable regardless of the truth. His opponents would cry obstruction, corruption and cover-up while doing everything they could to paint those aligned with President Trump as accomplices. Headlines, which could otherwise reflect the positive results of the Trump agenda, would be replaced with a sensationalized focus on the Russia investigation.\n\nAll of this would only hurt GOP chances in the midterms. Those who did survive would be too bruised or bitter to come to President Trump\u2019s defense after 2018.\n\nPresident Trump would do himself, the GOP and the country more of a favor by keeping Mueller but setting a reasonable time limit for the investigation to be completed.\n\n\u2018We are already in a constitutional crisis.\u2019\n\nSophia Nelson is author of E Pluribus One: Reclaiming Our Founders\u2019 Vision for a United America.\n\nWe are already in a constitutional crisis.

While their efforts may have succeeded in narrowing the tariffs' impact, Trump is pressing ahead \u2014 leaving Republicans pondering how to check the leader of their own party.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   Senate Republicans discussed the matter in depth on Thursday, just hours before Trump announced he would go through with his crackdown on imported metals. And they are gearing up for an open clash with Trump over economic policy, with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) telling reporters that he will introduce legislation to nullify the tariffs.\n \n \u201cIf it\u2019s anything approximating what he\u2019s talking about, introduce legislation to nullify it. I\u2019m assuming I\u2019m not going to be the only one doing that,\u201d Flake told reporters before the plan was formally issued. \u201cNobody knows what it is, so we can\u2019t do anything until we know what it is.\u201d\n \n On Thursday, Trump announced the United States would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports, with provisional exceptions for Canada and Mexico.\n \n Asked if he could support what Flake is talking about, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) replied: \u201cI could, yeah.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

I\u2019d look at it for sure,\u201d Corker said.\n \n Whether Republican leaders attempt to muster a veto-proof level of support for legislation limiting Trump's tariff remains an open question. That would require at least 16 Senate Democrats supporting a GOP override of Trump \u2014 a potentially difficult number to come up with given that Democrats are less enthused with free-trade policies than Republicans.\n \n Republicans have another chance at reining in the president on trade later this spring, when Trump faces a key deadline to seek renewal of fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals. But GOP leaders are not bullish about winning a legislative fight with Trump and have instead sought to get him to narrow his trade policies.\n \n Winning a veto-override fight would be \u201ca double bank shot,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican. Others think the battle is best won in the court of public opinion. \n \n Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) made a rare appearance in front of the Hill press corps to scorch Trump\u2019s trade policy.\n \n \u201cThis is a really stupid policy. It\u2019s going to hurt American consumers and it\u2019s going to hurt American workers. If the administration goes through with this policy, this policy will kill American jobs, lots of them,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cI\u2019ve wrestled with the president with this on this very topic.\u201d\n \n Indeed, the appetite appeared to be growing among GOP senators to try to claw back some power over trade policy from Trump, who has crowed that \"trade wars are good, and easy to win.\"\n \n Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told reporters that \"maybe we\u2019ve delegated too much authority to the presidency. I\u2019m not just saying to Trump.\"\n \n The power to slap national security-related tariffs \"could be abused by other presidents, past and future, and maybe we\u2019d better take a look at the trade laws,\" added Grassley, who joined the rest of his state's bipartisan congressional delegation in a Wednesday warning that the tariffs could prompt retaliation against U.S. agricultural interests.\n \n The Iowan described legislation from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would require congressional review of tariffs as a \"stopgap measure,\" saying that \"I think we had better be very careful how much power we delegate on trade issues to the president in the future.\"\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who also has urged Trump to consider the tariffs' effect on farmers, reiterated Thursday that \"I don\u2019t think our trade policy ought to be used as a playing card.\" Roberts added that \"on this issue, [Trump is] paying attention to Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro\" \u2014 the Commerce Department chief and trade adviser who have nudged Trump toward a more hardball trade agenda.\n \n No matter how Republicans respond next, their decision-making appeared slowed by the lack of specificity coming from the White House on which nations might be exempted from the tariffs. Lawmakers were also considering other strategies to try to narrow the penalties.\n \n Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was unsure about a legislative response, telling reporters that \"I\u2019m hoping that the president will rethink the breadth of\" the tariffs plan.\n \n \"I\u2019m going to look at it first, as to what his final decision and his recommendation is, and then we\u2019ll listen to what the alternatives are,\u201d she said.\n \n Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a former U.S. Trade Representative who earlier Thursday urged Trump to hone the tariffs' impact on electrical steel, told reporters that \"it sounds like\" the president is embracing some changes.\n\n \"You never know what he\u2019s going to actually say in terms of the final announcement, so we need to be careful here. But I think it looks like it\u2019s going to be more focused, more targeted,\" Portman told reporters. \"And that\u2019s a good thing.\"\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

It was documented in an email then-national security adviser Susan Rice sent to herself on Jan. 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), reflected the partisan tension in a judiciary committee whose investigation has for months been splintered along party lines. Story Continued Below\n\n It also amounted to a suggestion that witnesses \u2014 potentially including Donald Trump Jr., who sat for an interview in September \u2014 may have made false statements to the committee. In a recent interview, Blumenthal predicted the Trump Jr. transcript would be \u201cexplosive\u201d if released. \nThe Democrats recalled the early-January decision of Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to refer Christopher Steele, the author of the controversial intelligence dossier on Trump's alleged Russia ties, to the FBI for criminal investigation into possible false statements.  \n\"You have stated publicly that you believe it is important for the Special Counsel to carry his investigation through to completion and determine the facts,\" the Democratic duo wrote to Grassley. \"It is hard to see how withholding the transcripts achieves that goal.\"\n\"The transcripts of congressional testimony may reveal other, and better-founded, concerns about witness false statements,\" they wrote. \nThe Democrats also said they believe panel members in both parties already have \"agreed in principle\" on sharing testimony with Mueller's team to aid its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 including potential collusion with President Donald Trump's campaign. \nThe Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, angered Grassley earlier this month when she unilaterally released the transcript of the panel's interview with Glenn Simpson, co-founder of the firm that commissioned the Trump-Russia dossier Steele compiled. \nBeyond their request that Mueller receive Judiciary Committee transcripts, both Whitehouse and Blumenthal have said in recent interviews that they would like to see the transcript of the panel's interview with the president's eldest son get publicly released.  \nTrump Jr. took a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin, also attended by Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The Russian lawyer had offered the Trump campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, though Trump Jr. and others have said she provided no useful information. \n\"I think all these transcripts should be released \u2014 it's just a question of how and when,\" Blumenthal said in a recent interview. \"And the Donald Trump Jr. interview transcript will be explosive when it sees the light of day.\"\nWhitehouse agreed in a recent interview, saying that senators \"also need to rethink, if there isn\u2019t going to be a public hearing, why would we not release that transcript?

They also happen to include seven of the caucus' 10 incumbents up for reelection in states Donald Trump won in 2016.\n \nOne of them, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), openly acknowledged that Warren \"sure is\" mad about it.\n\nWarren \"has her perspective and her point of view, but the truth will prevail,\" Heitkamp told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday. \"And you know, we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time correcting the myths, correcting the misstatements about\" the legislation to roll back some elements of the Dodd-Frank law.\n \nOf course, being at odds with Warren may not be bad politics for some at-risk senators from conservative states.

Sherrod Brown of Ohio; Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin; and Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota.\n \nWarren isn't the first 2020 presidential hopeful to tar her colleagues as beholden to corporate interests during this Congress.

Activists sense an opening to derail Haspel\u2019s bid and at least complicate Pompeo\u2019s confirmation, given that the White House will need some Democratic support to pull the nominees across the finish line.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n It\u2019s not just Haspel\u2019s previous role in the use of interrogation tactics tantamount to torture against CIA detainees. Pompeo has taken a highly hawkish stance on Iran and amassed a controversial record on Islam, fodder for the left\u2019s campaign to convince 15 Senate Democratic caucus members who voted for him to be CIA director to oppose him as State Department chief.\n\nWith Senate Democrats still trying to heal a schism between moderates and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over a banking deregulation bill, the Pompeo and Haspel confirmation fights offer the chance for a moment of reconciliation between the wings of the caucus \u2014 or a further fracturing that finds vulnerable red-state incumbents on the GOP\u2019s side.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a blue-state veteran who\u2019s spent years fighting the legacy of the CIA\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d program, will end up. She faced an early jab from her liberal challenger to take a tougher line against Haspel and is now moving in that direction. Still, Feinstein and many in her party are declining to say where they stand before confirmation hearings begin.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are losing this opportunity to define a moral backbone for the party, to distinguish themselves on values,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, national political director at the ACLU and a former Senate Democratic aide. \n\n\u201cCertainly Trump loves torture \u2014 he\u2019s said it, it \u2018works.\u2019 This is a clear opportunity to say \u2018That\u2019s him and this is us.\u2019 A complete break.\u201d\n\nOne Democrat who supported Pompeo to lead CIA is already leaving the door open to opposing him as secretary of state. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a Foreign Relations Committee member, told POLITICO that he has \u201csome major concerns\u201d about the bid.\n\n\u201cThe intel position is so different than being the chief diplomat,\u201d Kaine said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd his track record as a House member was not pro-diplomacy, his track record was anti-diplomacy \u2014 and, I think, preferring war first. \u2026 That could exacerbate some major concerns I have about the president\u2019s attitude.\u201d\n\nWith Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) absent and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) opposed to Haspel and Pompeo, the Trump White House is likely to need Democratic votes to win confirmation. That means a handful of senators are in line for a maximum pressure campaign from the left.\n\nThe intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, was among 15 members of the minority to support Pompeo\u2019s CIA nomination last year. He\u2019s declining to tip his hand on Haspel, however, telling reporters late last week that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a lot of legitimate questions that need to be answered, and I hope that she will be as forthcoming as possible while protecting sources and methods.\u201d\n\nLiberal and civil rights groups would like to see Warner join Feinstein and other Democrats in asking for the declassification of CIA records on Haspel\u2019s role in the George W. Bush administration\u2019s use of brutal interrogation tactics, including waterboarding.\n\nWarner said that \u201cwithin the bounds of protecting sources and methods, yes, I want to see as much declassified as possible\u201d about Haspel\u2019s past activity. But that may not be enough for advocates who warn that the agency is unlikely to act without a more direct edict from the Senate.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cI don\u2019t think CIA will agree to it if the committee doesn\u2019t force the issue, and I don\u2019t think the committee will force the issue unless Warner is willing to tell Burr that it needs to happen,\u201d Project on Government Oversight investigator Katherine Hawkins said in an interview. \n\nPOGO joined more than two dozen liberal and civil liberties groups in a Friday plea for the Senate to declassify Haspel material. Amnesty International went further on Monday, urging Trump to withdraw her nomination outright and launch an investigation into her past.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who began pressing for the declassification of Haspel records last year alongside Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), said that \u201cother members will have the opportunity to see the intelligence. She\u2019s going to get some tough questions at this hearing.\u201d\n\nFeinstein raised alarms on the left last week by telling reporters that Haspel had been \u201ca good deputy director,\u201d citing a personal dinner with the three-decade agency veteran. But within days, after taking a hit from her primary challenger Kevin de Leon, Feinstein was aligning with Wyden and Heinrich in pushing for declassification.\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Marc Short didn\u2019t rule out giving lawmakers access to some material, telling CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m sure that we\u2019re going to want to provide as much information as necessary, without compromising any international secrets.\u201d\n\nTwo more Democrats getting watched by advocacy groups are Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who opposed Pompeo for CIA but appeared open to Haspel last week, and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who last year shifted from \u2018yes\u2019 to \u2018no\u2019 on a Trump nominee involved in the Bush-era legal memos that cleared the use of the interrogation tactics.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nManchin, an intelligence committee member, changed his stance on Steven Bradbury\u2019s nomination to be Department of Transportation general counsel after getting a personal appeal from McCain. Given that Manchin opposed Bradbury for a DOT role that\u2019s not connected to national security, activists are hopeful that the red-state Democrat and frequent Trump ally will also nix Haspel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rational argument for opposing Bradbury\u2019s nomination and not opposing Haspel\u2019s,\u201d Scott Roehm, Washington office director for the nonprofit Center for Victims of Torture, said in an interview.\n\nManchin has declined to indicate how he\u2019ll vote on Haspel or Pompeo ahead of meetings with the nominees. Pompeo is expected to meet on Monday with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who is eyeing a confirmation hearing next month.\n\nAnother Senate Democrat the left is closely watching on the nominations: Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who told POLITICO in a Friday statement that \"neither confirmation is a sure thing.\"\n\nSchumer told reporters on the day Pompeo and Haspel were tapped, however, that he's not yet urging his caucus to come out in opposition. And if he doesn\u2019t whip against the nominees, the grassroots activists the party is counting on to come out in November are likely going to be disappointed.\n\n\"The short answer is no \u2014 there is no reason for any Democrats to vote to confirm either Pompeo or Haspel,\" said Elizabeth Beavers, policy manager for the liberal group Indivisible.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Plus, the New Yorker is already viewed with suspicion by liberals for his own ties to Wall Street.\n \n Though Schumer opposes the banking bill, the typically chatty senator has been remarkably quiet about it. He\u2019s said very little publicly about the legislation since it was introduced four months ago, and privately has not whipped against it or tried to stop it, according to senators and aides. Instead, as he did with Warren last week, Schumer has been mostly listening and counseling his members behind the scenes.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

This is really the first time since he\u2019s been Democratic leader that there\u2019s been a significant split in the caucus. And it\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s awkward.\u201d\n \n POLITICO first inquired about Schumer\u2019s position on the legislation in November, as the bill was changing and winding through committee. Finally, in March he came out in opposition to the bill as it came to the floor. People who speak frequently with Schumer argue that he\u2019s always been in a no-win situation and that trying to derail it now would serve only to trample on what might be his moderate members\u2019 signature bipartisan law in an election year.\n \n The minority leader has essentially been playing to both sides of the banking debate, caught between competing factions of his caucus and seemingly unable to head off the warring Democrats, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic senators of all ideological stripes.\n \n Asked about the issue Tuesday, he avoided attacking the bill or its critics, focusing instead on procedure and ignoring the lingering tension within his ranks.\n \n \u201cThere\u2019s broad agreement in our caucus that community banks deserve some [regulatory] relief,\u201d Schumer told reporters.\n \n \u201cBut Republicans forced other amendments not related to community banks,\u201d he added, saying that he opposed ending debate on the bill \u201cbecause I want to see amendments.\u201d\n \n Warren is also pushing for votes on 17 separate amendments she has offered intended to crack down on big banks and protect consumers. But GOP leaders are eager to move on to a final vote this week after spending nearly two weeks of floor time on the measure. The far-reaching bill would relax rules for a range of small and large lenders. It's the biggest change to financial regulations since Democrats enacted Dodd-Frank in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street meltdown.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n Meanwhile, the brutal fight over the legislation continued in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic caucus meeting, according to senators. Democrats readily admit this has been perhaps the toughest internal battle of Schumer\u2019s 15-month tenure as leader, worse even than when Democrats stumbled into a three-day government shutdown over immigration, though they say the party will get over it.\n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not for Chuck to cause us not to disagree, it\u2019s for Chuck to make sure we keep our disagreements within certain boundaries,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who opposes the bill. \u201cThis will pass, which is not to say tempers didn\u2019t flare.\u201d\n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot worse, and we\u2019ll get through this,\u201d Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) said of the caucus\u2019 charged climate surrounding the banking bill. Carper supports it. \n \n Schumer was warned by liberals, particularly Warren, early on that they would forcefully make the case against legislation they argue would risk another financial crisis, according to Democratic sources. And on a conference call on Tuesday, Warren defended Schumer as a stalwart foe of the measure.\n \n \u201cHe has spoken against the bill in caucus meetings and he voted against moving the bill forward,\u201d Warren said. \"He has pushed against this bill from the very beginning.\"\n \n The idea of helping out community banks that argue post-financial crisis regulations imperiled their ability to make loans has long been popular in both parties. But though Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and ranking member Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) began talking about a bipartisan solution last year, the talks broke down. \n \n After that impasse, Schumer gave the banking bill\u2019s Democratic backers the green light to continue working with the GOP, according to moderate senators. He never told them to stop working on the bill. His message to the caucus was: \u201cEverybody do what they got to do,\u201d according to moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).\n \n \u201cSen. Schumer said, 'Look, if you guys can get it out of committee, you guys can get great bipartisan support, we\u2019ll facilitate a floor vote,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.).\n \n Privately, some Democrats argue that at the very least, Schumer should have tried to shut down the battles between Warren and moderates like Heitkamp and Manchin who face tough reelection races this year. Those critics say that Warren has made misleading arguments against the bill and that Schumer could have stopped it.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n But publicly, none of the 16 Democrats who voted to advance the bill last week have had a harsh word for their leader's handling of it. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) suggested that Schumer had staved off long-term damage, saying Schumer \"worked very hard to find a path forward here that allows the caucus a chance at being unified as we face other legislative challenges.\"\n \n Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who opposes it, agreed: \u201cI\u2019m against the bill, but when there are different voices, I think the leadership has allowed all voices to be heard.\"\n \n Meanwhile, some liberals off the Hill questioned the political wisdom of Schumer freeing up so many Democratic votes to loosen bank regulations. As the party pitches itself to voters with a promise to fight for their interests, liberal activists say the banking bill sends the wrong, pro-corporate message and argue Warren's argument is in line with the Democratic base.\n \n But given that the bill had 10 Democratic Caucus co-sponsors as of November, Schumer would have struggled to block the bill even if he tried, senators said.\n\n \u201cThe power of Wall Street and the way that Wall Street convinced community bankers that they should have a bill that included breaks for Wall Street made it very hard to defeat,\u201d Brown said. He added it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say Schumer didn\u2019t try to stop the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

To us, they are linked.\u201d  \n The division among Democrats is complicating negotiations, as lawmakers in both parties face intense pressure \u2014 and a two-week time crunch \u2014 to show progress on government funding, immigration and a raft of other outstanding issues that have resulted in the government operating on stopgap spending bills since September. \n Both parties are eager for a long-term budget agreement, with GOP defense hawks furious about uncertainty for the Pentagon and liberal Democrats concerned about deep cuts to domestic programs. But any legislation to boost spending by upwards of $250 billion over two years would likely need broad bipartisan backing in both chambers, as House conservatives have already hinted they\u2019ll balk. \n Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), another member of Democratic leadership, said that while she preferred a deal to protect young undocumented immigrants be part of budget negotiations, the agreement reached with McConnell could make that impossible. The Kentucky Republican has said the Senate would turn to an immigration bill only if the government is still funded, and few Democrats seem to want another shutdown. \n \u201cFeb. 8 we\u2019re going to have another [stopgap bill]. But we have to have that budget agreement in order to move forward. \u2026 That\u2019s the goal,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd then the deal is that if DACA is not part of that, then it will be the next thing considered.\u201d \n \u201cEveryone\u2019s first preference is to get it all done by the 8th,\u201d a Senate Democratic aide said on Wednesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t speculated on what happens if it doesn\u2019t all come together.\u201d \n If Democrats are indeed willing to deal on spending caps without a firm commitment on DACA, it would represent a significant shift in the budget talks, which have stalled for months over immigration. \n \u201cI think everybody has a pretty general idea about where it\u2019s going to end up. But this has been again another casualty of the DACA issue, that they\u2019ve refused to conclude those,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Wednesday when asked how close leaders are to a spending caps deal. \n \u201cThere\u2019s gonna have to be some agreement on the spending caps I believe [by Feb. 8] because I am skeptical whether the House in particular will vote for another continuing resolution. That\u2019s the dilemma created by our Democratic colleagues,\u201d Cornyn added.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n Without a solution for Dreamers, Democrats have largely refused to acknowledge that they are making progress on a spending deal. But sources familiar with the talks say the distance between Republicans and Democrats has been narrowing for weeks. \n Negotiators have already agreed to a massive boost to the Pentagon\u2019s budget. While the figures are still in flux, multiple sources say Congress would raise military spending by at least $70 billion above the caps for fiscal 2018 and $80 billion in fiscal 2019. \n That huge increase, far above the White House\u2019s most recent budget request, would deliver assurance to the GOP\u2019s long-suffering defense hawks who have grudgingly voted for four short-term funding bills this fiscal year alone. \n What remains is how much to spend on domestic programs, including everything from homeland security to the Department of Education. \n GOP leaders have pitched a deal that would boost domestic agencies\u2019 budgets by between $45 to $50 billion over the caps for the next two years, sources say. Democrats, however, are insisting on at least $60 billion. \n Under the current spending caps, military funding would be limited to $549 billion in fiscal 2018. Domestic funding would be capped at $516 billion. \n As Democrats have insisted on \u201cparity\u201d between the defense and non-defense spending boosts, GOP negotiators are eyeing creative budgetary maneuvers to get there. \n Republican leaders are proposing tens of billions of dollars in extra domestic spending that wouldn\u2019t count towards the caps, sources say. That would likely include billions in emergency funding to address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic, which both parties have called a priority. \n Rep. Tom Cole, an ally of House GOP leadership, said in a phone interview Wednesday that opioid funding would be included \u201cfor sure\u201d \u2014 likely in a way that wouldn\u2019t count toward the caps. \n Negotiators are also floating potential changes in mandatory spending \u2014 another budgetary gimmick \u2014 to further dodge the strict caps on discretionary spending. That could mean programs with bipartisan support like VA Choice, the private-sector health care program for veterans, would be moved to the mandatory side of the budget for good.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n \u201cThey\u2019re so close on these numbers,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a former top Senate staffer now with the Bipartisan Policy Center. \n Publicly though, House and Senate spending talks have been stalled since Thanksgiving, when Senate and House Democrats declared they wouldn\u2019t agree on spending until Dreamers were helped. \n \u201cIn some way, the most important budget negotiations are the negotiations on DACA,\u201d added Cole, a senior appropriator who writes the House\u2019s health, education and labor spending bill. \n \u201cThe phrase used to me [is], \u2018We\u2019re six inches away from a spending deal.\u2019 It\u2019s just simply the DACA issue and the immigration question.\u201d\nSeung Min Kim and Connor O'Brien contributed to this report.\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

The special counsel\u2019s indictments of the Russian hacker operation, and President Donald Trump\u2019s dizzying response to them, is competing for your attention (\u201cThis is code red\u201d says New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman). And what\u2019s that shiny object over there? A case for impeaching Justice Clarence Thomas? (\u201cDrop everything and read this\u201d urged HuffPost editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen.)\n\nMeanwhile, the National Rifle Association and its allies are maintaining their maniacal focus. Rush Limbaugh went on Fox News, right after an interview with several Parkland survivors critical of the gun lobby, to scold those who \u201cbash the NRA\u201d and insist the only solution to school shootings is \u201cconcealed carry in the schools.\u201d The NRA\u2019s 24-7 streaming network NRATV echoed the sentiment with the familiar refrain, \u201cwe need more good guys with guns.\u201d Hosts complained that the school only had one armed guard, while advertising the NRA\u2019s \u201cSchool Shield\u201d security initiative to freshly terrified school administrations.\n\nWhy does the NRA always win, despite the repeated national traumas, and despite poll after poll showing a majority in favor of stronger gun control measures? It\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s because the NRA has built a movement that has convinced its followers that gun ownership is a way of life, central to one\u2019s freedom and safety, that must be defended on a daily basis.\n\nThe gun control majority only gets worked up in the days after public mass shootings, even though such events only accounted for 71 of the 38,658 annual gun fatalities in 2016. Then the news coverage shifts, political prospects for action diminish, and the majority gravitates to other political matters while guns continue take lives in suicides, domestic violence incidents, other crimes and accidents every day.\n\nSince the progressive political prism views campaign cash as the scourge of democracy, gun control proponents are quick to blame NRA donations for why Congress seems immune to public opinion. In a powerful speech last week in Florida, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior Emma Gonazlez excoriated \u201cpoliticians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this\u201d and added, \u201cTo every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s a mistake to attribute the NRA\u2019s success entirely to its campaign spending. The dollar amount was considerable in 2016: $54.4 million. But that money was not spent on the entire Congress. Thirty million went to Donald Trump, the rest mainly to six Republican Senate candidates in competitive races, five of whom won. For most members of Congress, the amount of money they get from the NRA is a tiny percentage of their overall hauls. If money were the only reason for their gun rights stances, Michael Bloomberg could offer to double whatever the NRA gives them and flip their votes.\n\nTo beat the NRA at its own game, the gun control movement needs to better understand how the NRA has built an army of single-issue voters.\n\nNRATV is a new piece of the puzzle, having been launched only in late 2016. But it\u2019s a window into the culture that the NRA has nurtured for decades. Every minute, the network pumps out a message that can be delivered regardless of external events: Liberal elites want to take away your guns and freedom. Terrorists and criminals lurk everywhere and you need to know how to defend yourself. And by the way, look how cool guns are and how powerful they make you feel!\n\nSome shows are standard conservative political talk show fare, with hosts who wear T-shirts emblazoned with \u201cSocialist Tears\u201d and mock mainstream media figures for alleged bias (the network is particularly obsessed with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon).\n\nOther shows are more like reality TV, such as \u201cLove at First Shot,\u201d which follows women novices as they get firearms training for \u201chunting, personal protection and competition\u201d and learn the \u201clifestyle and cultural elements of being a gun owner.\u201d The show \u201cNoir\u201d recently offered a slow-motion tutorial on how to be that \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d if you\u2019re in a movie theater when a mass shooter enters. \u201cThey don\u2019t always talk about gun issues,\u201d gun policy expert Dr. Robert Spitzer said of the network to Time magazine, \u201cIt\u2019s about beliefs and how people view the world.\u201d\n\nWho knows how many watch NRATV\u2014the point is that it\u2019s a distilled version of the message the gun lobby has been pushing into the culture for decades. That worldview keeps the NRA on-message when events don\u2019t cooperate. But for frustrated and desperate gun control advocates, mass shootings goad them into chasing marginal proposals that have a real, or perceived, link to the immediate crime.\n\nThe Columbine school shooting prompted activists to prioritize the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d since the killers bought guns at a gun show where a background check wasn\u2019t required. The Charleston church massacre led to calls to close the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d which allows someone to get a gun if a background check isn\u2019t completed after three days. After the Las Vegas massacre, many demanded a ban on \u201cbump stocks\u201d that allow for more rapid firing.\n\nNot only did activists fail to enact these policy ideas, the ideas, however laudable, don\u2019t have much relevance to the vast majority of gun deaths. They can\u2019t help motivate people after memories of the last massacre fade.\n\nGun control proponents don\u2019t necessarily have to emulate the NRA and, say, launch a TV network. But they might consider marshaling the financial resources of Bloomberg, and other multimillionaires, and emulating one of the most successful public service advertising campaigns in history: the anti-tobacco \u201ctruth\u201d campaign.\n\nHundreds of millions have been spent since 2000 by what is now called the \u201cTruth Initiative\u201d on edgy ads that turned teenage perception of what smoking represents from cool rebellion to corporate dishonesty. The ad campaign is not the sole reason, but it is widely credited for helping drive smoking levels among teens down from from 23 percent to 6 percent.\n\nLike the tobacco industry, the NRA has been cultivating an image of guns as a source of freedom and cool, with the extra value of protection from grievous harm. A large-scale counter-campaign could help reverse that image, highlighting the damage guns do every day: the depressed never getting another chance for mental health services, the children dying from home accidents, the domestic abuse victims who never could escape. Other spots could depict life where guns are controlled around the world, to show what is possible. A partnership with Hollywood could bring gun issues into more TV shows and movies, similar to how Hollywood was successfully pressured to stop making cigarettes look cool.\n\nSuch a campaign would have two main objectives: in the short run, keep the gun control majority engaged on a daily basis, and in the long run, reduce the demand for guns in areas where the NRA exerts political influence.\n\nAs heartwarming as it is to see high school students organize anti-gun marches, they are no more likely to be successful in busting the NRA narrative, or separating politicians from NRA money, than the parents of Columbine and Sandy Hook. The gun rights community is steeled against succumbing to sympathetic victims, as they have convinced themselves that they are above the politics of knee-jerk emotion.\n\nSocial conservatives are fond of the insight, \u201cPolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d There is a big gun-rights culture that has a grip on our politics. Until there is a gun-free culture that can rival what the NRA has cultivated over decades, no national trauma, no matter how searing, is going to move the political needle.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Carpenter", "body": "The Trump administration\u2019s stunning decision this week to forgo mandatory sanctions on individuals doing business with Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors and its failure to publicly name and shame corrupt Kremlin insiders only underscores its dereliction of duty and disregard for our national security. With fitting symbolism, the administration chose instead to invite the directors of the three Russian intelligence services\u2014the very agencies responsible for carrying out an attack on our election\u2014for an unprecedented joint visit to Washington. To repeat: This is something that has never happened before in American history.\n\nTrump officials falsely argued that sanctions on Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors were unnecessary because the mere threat of sanctions was sufficient to deter businesses from doing deals. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert claimed, for example, that \u201cforeign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. But aside from the fact that the sanctions, which passed last summer by an overwhelming margin in Congress, were not optional, the evidence suggests Russia\u2019s defense industry is not being deterred from entering new markets. Far from it: Russia is currently in talks with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar\u2014both traditional U.S. arms purchasers\u2014to supply sophisticated S-400 air defense systems, while Russia\u2019s United Aircraft Corporation, a major defense contractor, decided just this month to market new airplanes in Europe and North America. Financial markets also read the administration\u2019s decision to forgo sanctions as a green light, with yields on Russian bonds sinking to the lowest point since the 2014 invasion of Crimea.\n\nRegarding the requirement to compile a \u201cKremlin list\u201d of corrupt officials, the administration decided to take the easy way out, and simply released a list of officials that could easily have been a copy-and-paste job of the Kremlin phone book and the Forbes Top 100 list of Russian oligarchs. No details on corruption were made public, thereby completely defeating the purpose of the report\u2014naming and shaming those enabling bad behavior in Moscow, and thus establishing a basis for future sanctions against them.\n\nDespite having enormous asymmetric power at its disposal, including the power to block all transactions going through the U.S. financial system, this White House has proven completely unwilling to impose meaningful costs on Russia in response to its assault on our institutions. Meanwhile, the Kremlin\u2019s war machine is still operating in full swing in Ukraine and Syria while defense-sector revenues support Russia\u2019s military modernization, including the development of new systems like treaty-banned intermediate-range cruise missiles that could target U.S. forces and allies in Central Europe and East Asia.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nFirst, we have to wake up to the fact that the United States is a financial superpower and that we have the ability to impose costs on Russia in a way that could permanently change the Kremlin\u2019s calculus. In the financial sector, for example, the U.S. market is so vast that any \u201cblocking sanctions\u201d on Russia\u2019s banks would have an immediate impact by forcing them to withdraw from international markets. Strangely, the United States has decided to take such sanctions entirely off the table, even as the Kremlin doubles down on election interference efforts across Europe, including the recent Czech presidential elections and the March 4 Italian parliamentary elections. Currently, full blocking sanctions, which block all transactions by entities that do business through the U.S. financial system, have been imposed on exactly one Russian bank, Bank Rossiya, which does not even rank in the top 10 Russian financial institutions.\n\nThe Trump administration has ignored and subverted the clear will of Congress\u2014and lawmakers therefore have no choice but to respond. They should consider passing an amendment to the Russia sanctions law specifying that unless the administration certifies that Russia has ceased interfering in our democratic institutions, full blocking sanctions will be applied iteratively to a list of select Russian banks according to a fixed schedule\u2014say, every six months. These sanctions would kick in automatically, and the Treasury Department would be able to waive them only if there were evidence of a serious risk of financial contagion.\n\nThe goal of such measures is not to crater Russia\u2019s economy but to show that the United States takes an attack on its democracy seriously and will respond with meaningful measures. (The measures the previous administration applied to Russia in December 2016, such as designating Russian Embassy personnel as persona non grata and confiscating Russian diplomatic facilities, were largely symbolic and had no impact on the Kremlin\u2019s long-term calculus.)

Trump complains incessantly that they need to pay more for their own defense.\n\nAdd it all up, and it amounts to the deepest national security breach between a president and his own advisers in memory \u2014 a bizarre disconnect between an administration scrambling to respond to Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist assault on the West, and a chief executive who openly admires the Kremlin leader and has yet to allay suspicions that his relationship with Russia was not on the level. It\u2019s the greatest mystery in American politics: What, exactly, explains Donald Trump\u2019s love affair with Moscow?\n\n\u201cThere has always been a gap between what the U.S. government \u2014 whether it\u2019s the State Department, Defense Department, intelligence agencies, Treasury Department \u2014has been saying to steadily increase pressure on the Russian government and what the president has said,\u201d said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt is obvious there is pent-up frustration between the agencies to push forward.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, that frustration has begun to translate into an increasingly confrontational posture toward Putin\u2019s Russia. On Friday, the Treasury Department slapped sanctions on several Russians for interfering in the 2016 election. The White House\u2019s January national security strategy slammed Moscow as a threat to global stability and a political meddler that \u201cchallenge[s] American power, influence, and interests.\u201d And a Pentagon national defense strategy released soon after declared that Russia is \u201cundermining the international order.\u201d\n\nOn March 1, the Trump administration even took a step vetoed by President Barack Obama. State Department notified Congress that it intends to sell some $47 million in antitank missiles to Ukraine for use against Russian aggression. When some top Obama national security officials recommended a similar step, Obama rejected the idea.\n\nMeanwhile, the headlines are awash with officials not named Trump slamming Russia on several fronts.\n\nOn Thursday, national security adviser H.R. McMaster tore into Russia, saying it was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Syrian regime \u201catrocities\u201d and warning that \u201call nations must respond more forcefully than simply issuing strong statements.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the United Nations, ambassador Nikki Haley has denounced the Kremlin so many times it has stopped being news, on issues ranging from Syria to Ukraine, over which Haley recently demanded \u201cclear and strong condemnation.\u201d\n\nAs for cyber and political meddling, during Senate testimony last month, Mike Rogers, the departing head of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command, re-affirmed the conclusion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election and warned that Putin would \u201ccontinue this activity\u201d if he doesn\u2019t meet a firmer U.S. response.\n\nAnd after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee declared on Monday that the Kremlin wasn\u2019t trying to help Trump get elected after all \u2014 but rather just seeking to sow chaos \u2014 a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community stands by its October 2016 findings to the contrary.\n\nFinally, there was Rex Tillerson, who took the secretary of state job last year speaking hopefully of better dialogue with Russia \u2014 but closed out his tenure with several shots at Putin\u2019s government, including a Monday statement saying he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the nerve agent attack and a warning, in his farewell remarks, that Moscow\u2019s \u201ctroubling behavior\u201d invited further isolation.\n\nA day after Tillerson\u2019s sacking, his department also released a withering statement about Russia\u2019s \u201csham\u201d annexation of Crimea that declared that Russia \u201cdisdains the international order and disrespects the territorial integrity of sovereign nations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump has had to sign off on his administration\u2019s tough policy actions. But that makes his refusal to criticize Putin all the more curious.\n\nThere have been some recent signs of a hardening, even on Trump\u2019s part. Twice this week in remarks to reporters, Trump echoed the British government\u2019s charges that Russia was behind the poisoning with nerve agent of a Russian double agent in London this month. \u201cIt certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office Thursday.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t linger long on the subject, and didn\u2019t summon anything like the outrage expressed by Tillerson and Haley, who called at the U.N. this week for \u201cimmediate concrete measures\u201d against Moscow and warned that its next attack could come in New York City.\n\nPerhaps the most deafening silence of all involves Trump\u2019s non-response to Putin\u2019s remarkably bellicose February national address in which he announced the development of new nuclear weapons \u2014 including one that \u201cflies to its target like a meteorite like a ball of fire\u201d \u2014 that he claimed can defeat U.S. defenses. An accompanying video Putin played showed one of the weapons slamming into southern Florida, in the approximate area where Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort is located.\n\nConley recalled Trump\u2019s reaction after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened, in a January address, that he could strike the U.S. with nuclear weapons. Trump angrily tweeted in response: \u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his.\u201d\n\nIn this case, a State Department spokeswoman mocked Putin\u2019s video as \u201ccheesy,\u201d Defense Secretary James Mattis called the chest-thumping \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a mild critique of the weapons as \u201cdestabilizing.\u201d\n\nBut more than two weeks after Putin\u2019s threat, Trump has publicly said nothing.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Bill Scher", "body": "The results aren\u2019t yet official, but Conor Lamb\u2019s apparent nail-biter special election win in a Western Pennsylvania congressional district that two years ago favored Donald Trump by 20 points is an unmistakable good sign for Democrats heading into the November midterm elections. Republican Rick Saccone couldn\u2019t be saved by Trump\u2019s tax reform bill or $10 million in outside campaign cash. And there are more than 100 Republican-held House seats in districts less conservative than this one. Many incumbents in those districts will likely choose retirement over getting soaked by a \u201cblue wave.\u201d\n\nNo wonder Republicans are worried.\n\nYet the way Lamb won does little to help Democrats adjudicate the raging debate on the left over how should they run in November: as proud left-wing populists or relative moderates willing to reach across the aisle. The 33-year-old Marine vet, federal prosecutor and Allegheny County political progeny didn\u2019t pick a side. He took some positions from out of each camp\u2019s bucket, all while brandishing his assault rifle.\n\nThe populist wing can point to Lamb\u2019s unapologetic defense of Social Security and Medicare from Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s long-standing goal of cost-saving \u201centitlement reform.\u201d In a district full of working-class people, Lamb pledged to defend \u201cunion rights\u201d while Saccone had a record of support for anti-union \u201cright to work\u201d laws. Trump arguably levied tariffs on steel last week in part to help Saccone with the district\u2019s Pittsburgh-area workers, but Lamb celebrated the new trade barriers, as have other protectionists on the left. He rejected Trump\u2019s tax reform as a giveaway to the rich, and one ad touted Lamb as an antidote to a Congress that \u201ccare[s] more about the corporations and the wealthy than the normal people.\u201d\n\nBut Lamb was hardly a poster child for democratic socialism. He did not campaign on the left\u2019s most cherished policy plank of a single-payer health insurance system. In fact, he followed the advice of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s cautious health care polling memo, which said, \u201cThe American people overwhelmingly want Congress to improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it or replace it with something radically different.\u201d\n\nThat memo, upon being leaked, attracted criticism for suggesting \u201cMedicare for All\u201d was a liability, and not, as progressive populists insist, an idea with the political juice necessary to boost base turnout. Yet Lamb did just fine defending the \u201cprogress\u201d made by the ACA and promising to \u201cfix what isn't working, and make the law better.\u201d\n\nLamb stayed away from another major progressive populist goal, a $15 minimum wage, which he said \u201csounds high based on what I\u2019ve been told by many small-business owners in our area.\u201d He did not endear himself to some environmentalists when he supported natural gas fracking, siding with energy industry workers still reeling from the decline of the coal industry.\n\nSince the Parkland massacre, progressive populists have been pushing Democrats to embrace gun control (though last year, many on the left excused candidates who married economic populism with gun rights such as Montana\u2019s Rob Quist). Lamb began his campaign with a biographical spot showing him with an AR-15 and letting voters know he \u201cstill loves to shoot.\u201d While he backed \u201cuniversal background checks\u201d after Parkland, he also reiterated his opposition to an assault weapons ban.\n\nHe also emphasized bipartisanship, much like Sen. Doug Jones did in Alabama, running ads promising to \u201cend the partisan divide,\u201d venting about a \u201cCongress where no one works together\u201d and even throwing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi under the bus as an example of failed congressional leadership. Progressives often chafe at paeans to bipartisanship, believing Republicans should be painted as corporate-backed impediments to populist goals. Establishment Democrats tend to view such rhetoric as the political castor oil one must take to pick off seats on red turf.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why the DCCC was comfortable looking past Lamb\u2019s dig at Pelosi and quietly funneling $1 million into his campaign that funded field staff and get-out-the-vote efforts, while the committee\u2019s progressive critics\u2014such as Our Revolution, Democracy for America, Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Justice Democrats\u2014left Lamb off their endorsement lists. Lamb got robust support from labor unions, despite some early grumbling over his minimum wage position, and they deserve a healthy share of credit. But so does the oft-maligned DCCC. It might have flopped in last week\u2019s Texas primary, but it recovered ably in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nThe DCCC is inclined to favor candidates it considers to be good fits for their districts; if a district tilts right, the DCCC will be hesitant to spend a lot of campaign cash on a candidate who swerves left. Many progressives have a different view\u2014they insist that proud, authentic populists can win anywhere, especially in working-class districts that sided with Trump.\n\nLamb\u2019s \u201cpopulism lite\u201d approach doesn\u2019t definitively disprove that argument, but after a year of special congressional elections in reddish areas, the progressive populists lack a model case of their own. Their preferred 2017 candidates, Quist in Montana and James Thompson in Kansas, fell short, while the more moderate Jones triumphed in Alabama. While some credited Roy Moore\u2019s scandals more than Jones\u2019 positions for the victory, Lamb\u2019s similar performance augurs otherwise.\n\nLamb\u2019s apparent victory doesn\u2019t prove that every Democrat on the ballot in November should run just like him. Many competitive races will be in districts with markedly different demographic profiles. Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District was heavily white and rural with a low percentage of college graduates. Other districts targeted by Democrats will be less culturally conservative, more racially diverse and more educated. Single-payer may strike a bigger chord in other contests, while support of gun rights and fracking may not, and disparaging Pelosi\u2014which, if it became a trend, could wreak havoc with party unity\u2014may not be necessary.\n\nBut Lamb\u2019s performance does suggest that Democratic candidates can tailor their messages to their home districts, appeal to swing voters and pacify the Republican base, while still generating strong Democratic base turnout. Republicans were able to nationalize some of last year\u2019s elections and fire up Trump supporters, pegging Montana\u2019s Quist and Georgia\u2019s Jon Ossoff as rubber stamps for Washington Democrats. Lamb\u2014perhaps because he came from a political family with deep roots in the area\u2014successfully defined himself on his own terms.\n\nProgressive populists have their midterm election hopes invested in primary candidates like Laura Moser in Texas\u2019 7th and Marie Newman in Illinois\u2019 3rd. In all likelihood, there will be some general election House candidates in their mold, who can fully test their propositions come November. But as the primary season gears up, those preaching electoral pragmatism, policy restraint and a bipartisan veneer have high-profile special election success stories to cite. Progressive populists are still waiting.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John A. Cassara", "body": "These days, a money launderer has to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught.\n\nIn fact, data suggests the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to enforce America\u2019s money-laundering laws fail 99.9 percent of the time. As financial crime expert Raymond Baker notes, \u201cTotal failure is just a decimal point away.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes it all the more surprising that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and his deputy, got busted last week. Special Counsel Robert Muller accused Manafort, with Gates\u2019s help, of laundering approximately $30 million\u2014an effort that, according to the indictment, began years ago but continued through their time on the Trump presidential campaign. The charges do not involve the president or his campaign.\n\nHad Trump lost the election, Manafort and Gates might have gotten away with their alleged crimes. But now they\u2019re caught up in Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and they have the misfortune of being pursued by skilled and motivated prosecutors with deep expertise in financial crimes and almost unlimited resources. Mueller\u2019s team includes Andrew Weissmann, who no less than former White House strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly dubbed \u201cthe LeBron James of money-laundering investigations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think of money laundering as a victimless crime. Who cares if Paul Manafort was able to buy himself some fancy rugs and a nice brownstone in Brooklyn? So what if Rick Gates bought himself a nice house and sent his kids to private schools?\n\nThat view couldn\u2019t be more wrong. I spent 26 years in the U.S. government, much of it fighting the scourge of money laundering. It\u2019s a crime that sustains devastating drug epidemics\u2014opioids, methamphetamines, cocaine. Gang violence, fraud in government programs, corruption, internet scams, identity theft and so many other crimes affect our daily lives. Terrorism\u2014made possible in part by money laundering\u2014threatens our national security.\n\nMany of the ills we face come back to money. And money laundering\u2014the hiding or disguising of the proceeds of any form of criminal activity\u2014is the essential component of transnational crime. Without the ability to move money around, pay their foot soldiers and profit from their illegal activities, criminal networks wither and die. It shouldn\u2019t take a national political scandal to crack down on their misdeeds.\n\n\n\nHow big is the world\u2019s money-laundering crisis? It\u2019s hard to say for sure, because precise data doesn\u2019t exist. The IMF believes money laundering makes up about 2 to 5 percent of the world\u2019s GDP, or approximately $1.5 trillion to $3.7 trillion in 2015. Similarly, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime found criminal proceeds in 2009 amounted to 3.6 percent of global GDP or roughly $2.1 trillion. Using these guesstimates, the amount of international money laundering today is approximately the same as the annual U.S. federal budget.\n\nDepending on what is included in the count, the reality is much higher. For example, there is an international movement to recognize tax evasion as a predicate offense to charge money laundering. The Tax Justice Network, an NGO that advocates against tax evasion, estimates that between $21 and $32 trillion is hiding in more than 80 international tax havens.\n\nThe scope of the problem is breathtaking, as the release of the \u201cPanama\u201d and \u201cParadise\u201d papers showed. Those records, millions of financial documents leaked from the files of Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, show the extraordinary lengths legitimate businesses, criminals, corrupt government officials, celebrities and common taxpayers go to hide their income and wealth. According to the Panama papers, Mossack Fonseca set up more than 200,000 shell corporations over the years, with registration in places with particularly lax money-laundering laws\u2014the kind of offshore web allegedly used by Manafort and Gates.\n\nThe IMF and UNODC don\u2019t count trade-based money-laundering, either. When you include all its various forms, this technique is probably the world\u2019s most common way to launder money. It is poorly understood, investigated or enforced\u2014and therefore escapes our traditional countermeasures. Here\u2019s one way it works: trade misinvoicing, an oft-used method of moving value illicitly across borders. Conspirators deliberately misrepresent the value of a commercial transaction on an invoice by misreporting the quantity, quality, price per unit and/or description of a good that results in the shipment being over or under-invoiced or other fraudulent schemes. The potential scale here is enormous, given that the amount of average annual global merchandise trade is approximately $20 trillion. According to some estimates, 80 percent of the world\u2019s illicit money flow stems from trade-related activities.\n\nSo out of the multiple trillions of dollars that are laundered internationally every year, how much of the proceeds of crime are actually seized and forfeited? According to the UNODC, the answer is less than 1 percent.\n\nThe other bottom-line metric that matters is the number of successful anti-money laundering convictions. The State Department tracks these statistics on a yearly basis. They vary markedly from country to country. Yet a review of the overall reporting shows that the actual numbers of convictions are miniscule in comparison to the magnitude of transnational criminal activity. Many countries\u2019 anti-money laundering efforts are essentially worthless. Some countries, the Philippines for example\u2014have never had a money laundering conviction. Criminals are attracted to the weak link; when one country fails to crack down on money laundering, it affects many others.\n\nBy looking at the bottom line numbers, unfortunately the United States is also a weak link. Manafort and Gates were allegedly able to exploit vulnerabilities for years until they were caught because of unique circumstances.\n\nThe total amount of money laundered annually in the United States is conservatively estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. According to the IRS, tax evasion is skyrocketing\u2014and \u201cmoney laundering is in effect tax evasion in progress.\u201d While tax evasion is not yet considered to be a \u201cspecified unlawful activity\u201d to charge money laundering in the U.S., related crimes are. For example, identity theft connected to tax fraud is rampant.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. \u201cconfiscated\u201d approximately $4.4 billion. While this appears to be an impressive number, it is not certain what percentage was actually forfeited instead of ultimately released. Let us approximate $3 billion. The UNODC estimated proceeds from crime in the U.S. (excluding tax evasion, many forms of trade-based money laundering, cybercrimes, the use of new payment methods, etc.) was $300 billion in 2010, about 2 percent of the U.S. economy. If we use the conservative UNODC estimate (a more accurate estimate would be much higher), that means we are recovering less than 1 percent of the illicit money generated by criminal activity every year.\n\nIn one illustration, a few years up to $39 billion of illicit proceeds were smuggled annually across our southern border in the form of bulk cash. Analysis showed that for every $100 smuggled across our southern border we are recovering a quarter! Literally one quarter\u2014as in 25 cents, not 25 dollars.\n\nWe often forget about the money made on the money that is successfully laundered. Although this is simplistic, let\u2019s assume the $39 billion is accurate and the cartels simply invest the illicit proceeds at a 5 percent annualized rate of return; after 20 years, just that one year has mushroomed into a $1.7 trillion problem! And that represents just one year and one straightforward money laundering methodology limited to one geographic area.\n\nSome apologists in government or industry will have you believe that countering money laundering is all about \u201cdisruption,\u201d or \u201cdeterrence\u201d or the number of financial intelligence reports filed by financial institutions. These platitudes are ridiculous. Stopping money laundering ultimately all comes down to enforcement\u2014and America is doing a lousy job of it.\n\nCurrently, there are about 1,200 money-laundering convictions a year at the federal level. That seems like a large number and undoubtedly some money launderers plead to other charges. But if we factor in the amount of criminal activity and the multi-hundreds of billions of illicit proceeds generated, it\u2019s just a drop in the ocean.\n\n\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the U.S. government\u2019s primary model for stopping money laundering, was enacted almost 50 years ago. Our financial intelligence countermeasures were primarily designed to stop the money laundering of cowboy cocaine dealers operating in Miami. The model is outdated, inefficient and expensive. Financial institutions and money service businesses in the United States spend approximately $8 billion a year to comply with money-laundering rules \u2013 more than twice the amount of criminal proceeds forfeited. As Ron Pol, a respected money laundering expert, recently put it, \u201cAnti-money laundering legislation is the least effective of any anti-crime measure, anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut we have to try. The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings aimed at modernizing laws against money laundering. Other committees are active as well. Government and industry representatives should work together and design and implement a modern, robust, efficient, effective and near real-time system for detecting money laundering that incorporates the necessary privacy safeguards and oversight.\n\nWe can do far better than a 1 percent success rate. It shouldn\u2019t take a special counsel\u2019s investigation to detect and prosecute money laundering.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Joanna Weiss", "body": "It\u2019s tough to lose an election for student council, let alone for president. So it made sense that, after November 2016, Hillary Clinton would have spent some time wallowing in the past, howling at the universe with a side of Chardonnay. That\u2019s the frame of mind she described in What Happened, her post-campaign memoir that came out in September, which was more of an angry play-by-play of how she was wronged than a clear-headed self-assessment of the race. Now, five months after the book came out, 15 months after the election, Clinton\u2019s been spotted promoting family friend Lanny Davis\u2019 new book, The Unmaking of the President 2016: How FBI Director James Comey Cost Hillary Clinton the Presidency.\n\nWe just passed Groundhog Day on the calendar, but it feels like we\u2019re still living it; we can\u2019t break free from the gnashing and rehashing of the 2016 election. It\u2019s not just the Mueller probe and legitimate questions about Russian influence. It\u2019s the emotional notes of triumph and defeat. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t dropped the subject, which is as perplexing as anything else Trump has done. But Clinton hasn\u2019t dropped it, either. And at this point, she should.\n\nI feel little nervous saying that, knowing what backlash will come: Clinton won the popular vote, she made history, she\u2019s double-ultra-accomplished, and suggesting that she sing a different tune is really just trying to silence her. Her fans are highly sensitive about critiques, and their fury reached a crescendo in December, when Vanity Fair posted a snarky video suggesting New Year\u2019s resolutions for Clinton\u2014including \u201cput away your James Comey voodoo doll\u201d and take up knitting\u2014and then, after a Twitter frenzy, sort of apologized.\n\nKnitting was a little much\u2014I\u2019m not suggesting Clinton retreat from public life to a domestic one, unless that\u2019s what she wants. But let\u2019s put the video in context: The media are often unkind to losing candidates of every gender. In March 2013, four months after he lost to Barack Obama, the Atlantic ran a snarky piece about the \u201cBizarre Post-Election Life\u201d of Mitt Romney, caught in such shocking acts as pumping his own gas, ordering McDonald\u2019s and going to Costco. Around that time, Romney did his first major post-election interview on \"Fox News Sunday\"; a Washington Post story about it began, \u201cOne hundred seventeen days later, Mitt Romney still isn\u2019t over it.\u201d Ever since his gut-piercing loss in 2000, writers have pop-psychologized over Al Gore\u2019s weight gain and post-election facial hair. \u201cIt is the beard of the hermit,\u201d one Guardian columnist wrote, \u201ca former warrior sorely done by and meditating in his manly cave until the people realise their folly.\u201d\n\nWhat Gore and Romney have managed to do, though, is move on\u2014or at least make it look like they have\u2014and reinvent. Romney has made his way back to the arena, after finding a new state in which to run for office and distinguishing himself as a rare Republican politician who criticized Trump flat out (with a brief interlude when he tried to position himself to be Trump\u2019s secretary of state). Gore turned the 2000 race into a throwaway punch line and embarked on a second act as an investor, climate-change Cassandra and Nobel laureate. This is what many of Clinton\u2019s critics want for her: Not to be silent, but to say something different. She\u2019s missing an opportunity to define herself beyond being the candidate who\u2014fairly, unfairly, or both\u2014lost a seemingly winnable election to Trump.\n\nSelf-definition, reinvention, self-improvement; those ideas sound like the stuff of Oprah, the  2020 presidential candidate. In fact, the internet is clogged with advice about what to do after a painful defeat. A 2016 piece of aggregated wisdom in Business News Daily, \u201cHow Successful Leaders Recover from Failure,\u201d wraps it up in bullet points: \u201cApologize quickly and own up,\u201d \u201cAnalyze what went wrong,\u201d and \u201cMove on.\u201d The job search website Ladders recently posted a list of \u201c10 things smart people never say,\u201d from \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault\u201d to \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u201d to \u201cHe\u2019s lazy/incompetent/a jerk.\u201d\n\nHow is it that Clinton, who is successful and smart, hasn\u2019t followed the most basic, Goop-like advice? For one thing, self-reflection isn\u2019t easy or natural, which is why there are so many of these lists in the first place. Plus, it\u2019s harder to let go when a mob of people\u2014from inner-circle loyalists like Lanny Davis to the internet hordes\u2014are egging you on while rending their garments over Trump.\n\nBut the irony is that Clinton has done it right before, handling past adversity in ways that were productive and inspired. In one of the feminist triumphs of modern politics, she refused to lock herself into the \u201cwronged wife\u201d story line, launched an ambitious bid for U.S. Senate from New York, and began a soaring political career. In 2008, after a tight loss to Obama in the Democratic primary, she graciously accepted his offer to be secretary of state, where she oversaw Washington\u2019s \u201creset\u201d with Moscow, managed sanctions in Iran and crises in Pakistan, and launched the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative.\n\nPerhaps Clinton was able to bounce back so quickly because she knew the presidency was still within reach. Now that goal is off the table, and she has yet to fully embrace a cause or future that can separate her from her loss. Finding the right path, among many possible options, is surely a challenge. But if she does commit herself to reinvention, Clinton will find that she is better-positioned than ever to make a difference. She\u2019ll be free from the daily trench warfare of Washington. Her every move will still attract attention. And her experiences as senator and secretary of state have prepared her for roll-up-your-sleeves work on policy issues, from the child-welfare matters that started her career to the status of women worldwide. Clinton has taken baby steps in that direction: This week, at a Georgetown University event, she spoke about how climate change will disproportionately affect women.\n\nShe could dive into the private sector, creating a market solution for any number of problems. She could follow Gore\u2019s path and take on a single cause as a public advocate. Naysayers be damned, she could run for office again. She\u2019s the same age as Romney\u2014and younger than Joe Biden.\n\nThe point is to drop any public grumbling about the past, or calling out of Trump in outraged tweets, or stirring up partisan fury by mocking Trump in public. (Though at least her cameo at the Grammys, reading a passage from \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d redeemed itself with a self-deprecating joke: \u201cThe Grammy\u2019s in the bag?\u201d) There are plenty of people willing and able to analyze the 2016 race and point out the absurdities of Trump. Clinton doesn\u2019t need to be a voice in that mix. She has the chance to go down in history as much more than the almost-first-woman-president.

Goodlatte, an immigration hard-liner, assured Ryan he would be flexible.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n But weeks later, Goodlatte\u2019s legislation is still languishing. No substantive changes have been made to the measure, according to multiple senior House GOP sources. And House Republicans have done nothing to deliver on President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to do right by young immigrants brought to the United States as children. \n\n\u201cThe chairman\u2019s efforts undermined all of the work that the White House has done and that many of us have done here to try to build a bipartisan coalition,\u201d said Rep.

They\u2019ve spent more than five years trying to cajole the 65-year-old Virginia Republican to take up consequential legislation. Instead, Goodlatte has moved slowly or not at all, his GOP colleagues say, often stalling until lawmakers move on. \n\nAt times, his tactics have created tension and ill will with leadership and Republican members of his own committee. In the process, they say, Goodlatte has squandered the power of the Judiciary Committee, which has among the most expansive jurisdictions of any committee in Congress.\n\nIn interviews with more than a dozen lawmakers, aides and White House officials, the same phrase was used to describe Goodlatte\u2019s tenure, which will come to a close when he retires at the end of this year. His committee, they said, is where \"bills go to die.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to kick him in the shorts on the way out the door, but there were a lot of missed opportunities,\u201d said former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who served with Goodlattee for years on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cIt was very frustrating because people wanted to move forward. But on some of the more difficult issues, Chairman Goodlatte chose to stay silent and not do anything.\u201d \n\nThe complaints abound. Some Republicans are unhappy that Goodlatte hasn\u2019t had a hearing on his own DACA bill. Others are upset he hasn\u2019t done more to respond to Russia\u2019s election meddling or the FBI\u2019s investigation of the matter, as his Senate counter, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, has done. \n\nIn recent months, some Republicans wanted a hearing to publicly examine bump stocks, the device a Las Vegas gunman used to mow down dozens of country concert-goers last October. Democrats also pleaded with Goodlatte to hold a hearing on domestic terrorism following the neo-Nazi rally last summer in Charlottesville last summer, a city in his own state.\n\nBut nothing happened. \n\n\u201cThis guy just refuses to move legislation,\u201d said a senior Republican lawmaker. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single thing he\u2019s actually accomplished,\u201d added a top GOP Republican aide.\n\nIn the wake of the Florida school shooting last month, GOP leaders implored Goodlatte to hold a hearing on how the gunman, who\u2019d been flagged by the FBI and local police, slipped through the cracks. Goodlatte initially hesitated to schedule one, according to two sources familiar with the matter. That prompted Republican leaders to ask Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy to consider holding a hearing if Goodlatte refused, even though the Judiciary Committee technically has jurisdiction.\n\nShortly before this story published, Goodlatte's office told POLITICO that he would, in fact, conduct a hearing on the shooting. \n\nGoodlatte, in an interview, rejected the notion that he hasn\u2019t done enough with his chairmanship. He argued that he can\u2019t possibly take up every lawmaker\u2019s pet legislation. Rather, Goodlatte said he\u2019s focused on holding hearings on issues that will yield concrete results.\n\nHis committee has been \u201cone of the busiest, most productive in the House,\u201d Goodlatte said. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had over 300 hearings \u2026 so we\u2019re not short of hearings by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to gauge what we think is going to be most likely to yield a productive change in policy. \u2026 I respect people wanting to [take action on] issues, but if they don\u2019t have a majority to move that issue, then I\u2019m not interested in having a platform for something that isn\u2019t going to change public policy or result in legislation.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGoodlatte also denied that he wasn\u2019t willing to negotiate on how to deal with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for Dreamers. The chairman pointed to changes he\u2019s made recently to try to win over the agriculture sector. And his committee staff sent POLITICO a list of changes he\u2019s made to the bill since the legislation was introduced in mid-January.\n\nGoodlatte also ticked off legislation the committee has passed over the years, including a permanent ban on taxing internet access and an overhaul to the nation\u2019s intelligence-gathering programs. He said his committee passed about a dozen criminal justice reform bills only to see them die in the Senate.\n\nJust last week, Goodlatte joined with Gowdy to ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel to investigate any potential FBI bias against Trump \u2014 a move to mollify conservatives on his panel who have become more vocal in pushing him to subpoena former FBI officials. On Tuesday, Goodlatte also held a news conference with conservative immigration groups and said he will continue to work on DACA. \n\nGoodlatte has some defenders, who praise his temperament and smarts. They say he never raises his voice and rarely tells colleagues \u201cno\u201d to their faces. They say he\u2019s only deliberate because the matters his committee deals with are so controversial.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows he thinks about the issues and that may leave people to say he\u2019s too cautious,\u201d said Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), a longtime friend of Goodlatte\u2019s. But \u201che thinks the issues through for good cause and he\u2019s just trying to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s supporters also note that arch-conservatives on his panel make it all but impossible for him to easily advance leadership\u2019s priorities. On some matters, they said, Goodlatte wouldn't have the votes if he tried to round them up.\n\nA native of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Goodlatte had a modest beginning, working at Friendly\u2019s and painting buses to make ends meet. He became politically active at Bates College in Maine, leading the College Republicans before graduating from Washington and Lee University School of Law. \n\nIn the late 1970s, he worked as district director for the late GOP Rep. Caldwell Butler (R-Va.) before running for another House seat. He has won reelection handily since.\n\nGoodlatte took the reins of the Judiciary Committee in early 2013. President Barack Obama had just won a second term, all but assuring that any partisan bill Goodlatte passed would be vetoed. \n\nBut tensions over Goodlatte\u2019s tenure flared early because some of his own party's members felt he wouldn\u2019t even try. Chaffetz said he tried for years to persuade Goodlatte to take up his online sales tax bill. The issue of how to tax online purchases had long stumped states and retailers, and many lawmakers, including GOP leaders, wanted the matter resolved. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nBut Chaffetz said Goodlatte would regularly cancel or fail to show up for meetings he\u2019d scheduled on his bill. \n\n\u201cHe was trying to avoid it, and he was trying to be nice and polite about it, but it was frustrating,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cIt is a difficult, thorny and complicated issue. But Congress is supposed to deal with those things.\u201d\n\nChaffetz said he also felt the panel relinquished its oversight authority over the FBI and Justice Department. When the bureau didn\u2019t respond to a joint request from Chaffetz and Goodlatte to look into whether Hillary Clinton lied to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, Chaffetz said, Goodlatte \u201cjust sat on his hands.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s staff contends that the panel has spent \u201cliterally thousands of hours\u201d on the online tax issue but has argued that ongoing litigation has complicated negotiations. \n\nGoodlatte\u2019s alleged intransigence came to a head in 2015, when Republican leaders were deciding whether to reappoint their committee chairmen to another term. Then-Speaker John Boehner lashed out at Goodlatte, warning him that he needed to do more with his gavel. \n\n\u201cBoehner just kind of took him on for everything he promised to get done,\" and he didn't, said one Republican who witnessed the exchange. Goodlatte, the person added, will \u201cgive you a white paper on [an issue], but he never plans to produce anything.\"\n\nGoodlatte acknowledged the upbraiding but dismissed Boehner\u2019s remarks, arguing that he has a \u201cvery good\u201d relationship with leadership.\n\n\u201cSometimes you can do [what leadership wants] and sometimes you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \"You know, the committee has its own jurisdiction, its own structure. And we have to work the will of the committee.\u201d \n\nMost recently, Goodlatte\u2019s work has come to the forefront on immigration. He, like many other House Republicans, was strongly opposed to the Senate\u2019s plan to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. \n\nBut Goodlatte's bill went even further right than Trump\u2019s plan. It included a controversial provision requiring all employers to certify that their workers are here legally \u2014 a burdensome mandate for many businesses, according to critics of the idea. Multiple House GOP and White House sources told POLITICO that the administration tried to persuade Goodlatte not to include so-called E-Verify in his bill. \n\nAt one point, the White House also tried to help facilitate negotiations between Goodlatte and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a leading moderate who tried to bridge the divide within the Republican Conference.\n\nBut Goodlatte rejected the changes. To the chagrin of a number of Republicans, he later left town for a congressional trip instead of staying in town to work on the bill. (A House Judiciary spokeswoman noted that staff continued to pursue a compromise and that Goodlatte worked the phones with members, who also were out of town during recess.)\n\n\u201cI would say there has been a very closed-minded approach\u201d to DACA, said Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), another moderate who\u2019s asked Goodlatte to make changes to his bill. \u201cWe have talked about regular order as well as an open process in front of the American public. We\u2019ve had neither.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGoodlatte, in his interview, refuted the notion that the White House encouraged him to change his bill and said he is in the process of making the text more \u201cgenerous\u201d for Dreamers who are not granted a path to citizenship under his legislation. \n\nGoodlatte says he can\u2019t easily accommodate demands from moderates because then he could lose conservative votes.\n\n\u201cMy job is to find 218 votes,\u201d Goodlatte said, adding that that \u201cwe\u2019re listening\u201d to Republicans who have concerns. \u201cObviously any change that\u2019s made has to grow votes, not be a net loss of votes. So if I make a change somebody wants, and I lose people who are already supporting the legislation, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d \n\nAsked what his legacy issue as chairman would be, Goodlatte said he didn\u2019t necessarily have one because he's taking on so many causes. Before retiring, he plans to tackle intellectual property, copyright law and perhaps patent and criminal justice reform. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sprint to the finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a huge agenda.\u201c\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

In December, she won her first term, making her both the most prominent black woman to win a major election since Donald Trump was inaugurated and the most prominent black female executive in the South\u2014and one of the few in the entire country.\n\nThere will be more, she said\u2014and soon.\n\n\u201cBlack women are realizing the power of their vote and of their influence,\u201d Bottoms told me in an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken what we are dealing with on a national level, I think, to really get us energized and not taking anything for granted, but I do think we are recognizing and exercising our power in a way that we\u2019ve never done before, and that\u2019s exciting,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cWe are becoming engaged, and we realize the danger of staying home.\u201d\n\nBlack women pouring out in big numbers already put Ralph Northam in Virginia and Doug Jones in Alabama over the top. There\u2019s a reason Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called them the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the party back in December.\n\nBut with Bottoms winning\u2014and black women also winning historic races for mayor in Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans in 2017\u2014Bottoms and others warn Democrats not to misread what\u2019s driving them, or fall back into taking them for granted. They can\u2019t stand Trump, but they\u2019re going to need more than that to keep showing up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge we\u2019ve seen in the Democratic Party. Black women are treated as monolithic, but then they receive underinvestment or very superficial investment,\u201d said Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic leader in the Georgia state House and a candidate for governor who is a black woman herself. \u201cThe question is not who they will vote for. The question is how many will vote. The party and too many candidates have stopped at the beginning of that equation.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are immediate across the midterms, at home in Georgia, too: Democrats see the glimmering of a path in the governor\u2019s race\u2014with Abrams in a primary against Stacey Evans, the star of a viral announcement video about growing up poor and making it as a lawyer, and who is white but has support from prominent black leaders like former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, and Bottoms suggesting she might be on board, too. But Democrats locally and nationally are still burned by putting their hopes in winning the House special election in the Atlanta suburbs last year which went national, brought in $50 million, and which Republican Karen Handel won anyway.\n\nThough Bottoms has now signed on to the Georgia Democratic Party\u2019s executive committee and pledged to campaign for statewide officials, she\u2019s privately expressed surprise when people have pushed her to realize her responsibility to the party as the most prominent elected Democrat in the state.\n\n\u201cShe understands Atlanta\u2019s potential,\u201d said DuBose Porter, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, who pointed out that Democrats have registered 200,000 voters since losing the 2014 gubernatorial and Senate races by about 200,000 votes. \u201cAnd she understands what her role now has the potential of being.\u201d\n\nBottoms\u2019 election was a rough one. Though she had the support of outgoing Mayor Reed, eight candidates made it to the last debate of the first round of voting, including the Bernie Sanders-backed state Sen. Vincent Fort, who slammed her for personal financial issues and for having a policy vision for the city which he deemed as not progressive enough. In the runoff in December, she faced an independent white woman with ties to Republicans, and won by all of 821 votes out of about 90,000 cast. More stark was how the election results looked on a map, with the city visibly divided north to south\u2014the wealthier, whiter parts of the city going for her opponent, and the blacker, less affluent part of the city pulling for Bottoms.\n\nThat an election in a heavily Democratic city was ever that close shows just how deep the fights dividing the party nationally affect races locally. Progressives and those voters who backed other candidates stayed home in the runoff, as Bottoms\u2014who is neither a fire-breather nor a firebrand\u2014failed to ignite movement enthusiasm.\n\nBottoms says she was never going to pretend to be something she\u2019s not. And she chalks up some of the struggles she faced as a candidate to an insidious mix of tacit sexism and racism.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of critiques and criticisms toward me that just would not have been thrown towards a man: \u2018Will she be her own person?\u2019 \u2018Can she lead?\u2019 \u2018Will she be a puppet?\u2019 Things that I know are never asked of men or weren\u2019t asked during this race, and in my own right, I\u2019ll put my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and my professional accomplishments up against anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s often perpetuated against African-American leaders, that you can\u2019t be accomplished and you can\u2019t drive a nice car\u2014you must be corrupt; there has to be something to it. And that was more concerning to me, just the underlying code words and language that was used.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s literally impossible to drive through Atlanta without thinking of the civil rights movement, taking Andrew Young International Boulevard or passing signs for the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial on the way to the National Center for Civil and Human Rights.\n\nBottoms has lived the recent history of the city. Her father, Major Lance, was an R&B sensation when she was a girl. She remembers seeing women scream when they saw him on stage\u2014which puzzled her, because in her eyes, he wasn\u2019t the Jackson 5. She also remembers coming home one day at 8 years old and seeing police swarming the house, arresting him for selling drugs when his music career hit the skids, and then visiting him in jail over the next three years.\n\n\u201cWhat always struck me is \u2026 the prisons were full of men who looked just like my Dad,\u201d she remembered.\n\nBottoms\u2019 mother was and is a more looming presence in her life, who was so broke after separating from Lance that she couldn\u2019t afford to buy new clothes and went to work as a file clerk dressed in the Ultrasuede suits she\u2019d stocked her closet with to look the part of a musician\u2019s wife. When her mother was working a second job, she\u2019d curl up in her bed to feel close to her, and learn with her older brother and sister how to stretch the couple of dollars left for lunch.\n\nAt first, she was reluctant to go public with many personal details, and though she told part of the story during the campaign, she went deeper in the Off Message interview than she ever had before.\n\nShe became a lawyer, worked her way up to be a local judge, realizing one day that she was serving alongside a man who\u2019d been the prosecutor who sent her father to jail. After a brief stint on the Atlanta City Council, she jumped into the mayor\u2019s race, backed by Reed, as he had been backed by outgoing Mayor Shirley Franklin eight years earlier.\n\nShe\u2019s eager to return the favor, boosting the much-rumored idea that Reed will run for Senate in 2020 against David Perdue, capitalizing on presidential election-year coattails\u2014\u201cwhatever he runs for, I think that it will be a nice next chapter, whatever it may be,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she\u2019s hoping that Democrats are fighting hard in Georgia\u2019s presidential race by then. \u201cI don\u2019t think the resources have ever been put into the state in the way they need to be to make us truly competitive,\u201d Bottoms said.\n\nPut the money in, Bottoms said, and \u201cabsolutely\u201d Georgia will be competitive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to realize that it\u2019s different than in Alabama, where Trump carried it with 65 percent.

And at first blush, the idea of a Soviet-style military procession down Pennsylvania Avenue plays into an unhelpful narrative for the president. This is a man after all who is routinely accused of trying to recreate his own gilded banana republic right here at home.\n\nBut as his ideas go, and admittedly he\u2019s had some doozies, this actually may be one of Trump\u2019s canniest.\n\nAs with many of his Republican predecessors, Trump has effectively tapped into the sense among millions of Americans that pride in the United States is diminishing, not only abroad but at home. Many of his supporters share a sentiment that D.C., N.Y. and L.A. \u201celites\u201d are embarrassed about our country and our achievements. This is why, as a candidate for the White House, Trump frequently lambasted President Barack Obama for his alleged global \u201capology tour.\u201d It\u2019s why he\u2019s waded into the protection of confederate monuments and claimed that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln might be the next to go. This is why he literally embraced the American flag. It\u2019s why he made such a big deal about NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem, so much so that he\u2019s almost achieving the unthinkable\u2014turning some red-blooded Republican men against football.\n\nThe president\u2019s State of the Union was pockmarked with so many tributes to American symbols\u2014our flag, our motto, our anthem\u2014that you almost expected him to bring out a freshly-baked apple pie and start eating it mid-speech. So much of what Trump does seem random, but all of this has a clear purpose. Trump understands, perhaps instinctively, that an appeal to national pride like calling for a gleaming, glorious military spectacle touches a nerve with many Americans.\n\nAt the same time, the president is overtly tying his administration to the most popular institution in our nation\u2014perhaps the only popular institution left\u2014the United States military. More to the point, he\u2019s daring the Democrats, and their allies in the media, to stand apart and oppose it. By doing so, Democratic leaders appear either as killjoys complaining about excessive costs (as if frugality were a Democratic Party hallmark) or as diminishing the achievements of the military or the need to publicly extol them. All in all, it\u2019s a pretty clever trap.\n\nIs an expensive display of American military hardware necessary? Of course not. But financial responsibility has never been Trump\u2019s primary concern. As a proposal, it\u2019s also not without some historical precedent, though typically these sort of things have followed an armed conflict. After the Civil War, for example, Washington, D.C., saw a Grand Review of the Armies. There was another military parade at the close of World War II. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush convened a National Victory Celebration parade after America\u2019s win in the Gulf War. And, as Trump is aware, other nations that are not thuggish dictatorships\u2014such as France\u2014have put their military might on display for various occasions, such as Bastille Day.\n\nWere he to pull off this event\u2014ostensibly to commemorate the 100th anniversary of our victory in World War I (and who can argue with that?) but in reality to commemorate the greatness of Donald Trump\u2014he would command center stage in the greatest tribute to the military most Americans have ever seen. News outlets will breathlessly cover the plans and preparations\u2014and of course, the main event\u2014giving Trump hours of free airtime while men and women in uniform visibly salute him. That\u2019s a free commercial for him and the GOP\u2014not to mention a timely and helpful distraction from the Russia probe or Cabinet members calling him stupid. Pretty smart.\n\nAnd who\u2019s going to complain when it\u2019s over? The parade might boost the D.C. economy, and will have put the nation\u2019s capital and its military capabilities, at least for a day, in the international spotlight. The only ones who will be sour are the Democrats, who will have discovered that Trump, contrary to their beliefs and hopes, is not a buffoon.

Obtaining a warrant under FISA requires the FBI to present an application to a court with evidence that indicates the target is acting on behalf of a foreign power. \nThe GOP has complained that the FBI included in its evidence material culled from a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that described illicit connections between Trump and Russia. Steele compiled the dossier in 2016 on behalf of research firm Fusion GPS, which was being paid by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. \nThe New York Times reported Monday that the memo also reveals that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved an application to extend the surveillance of Page in early 2017. \nThough Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, helped craft the memo and has championed its public release, he said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he believed the FBI should see the memo before it comes out.

Over the weekend, the indictment spurred intense reactions from President Donald Trump, who complained that the FBI is \u201cspending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nLike many of Trump\u2019s outbursts, that tweet could be used by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to show that Trump had \u201ccorrupt\u201d intent, which would be needed to prove obstruction of justice. After all, Trump admits in the tweet that he wants the Russia investigation to end, a desire that appears to be fueled by Friday\u2019s indictment. But was the indictment really bad news for Trump?\n\nThe indictment could not have come as much of a surprise. Back in September 2017, I wrote in this publication that the Facebook search warrant obtained by Mueller indicated he was investigating whether \u201cforeign individuals committed a crime by making a \u2018contribution\u2019 in connection with an election and that evidence of that crime existed on Facebook.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Mueller\u2019s indictment was more conservative than expected. He did not charge the foreign interference itself as a crime\u2014the indictment focused on efforts by the Russians to hide their activities from the U.S. government, along with the fraud they engaged in to do so. The indictment also did not allege wrongdoing by Trump\u2019s campaign or his associates, even though it indicates that the Russians supported Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nBut beneath the surface, it makes it harder for the president to undermine the Mueller investigation, which as I\u2019ve explained elsewhere, is his best strategy. Friday\u2019s indictment established that Mueller gathered substantial evidence establishing a Russian scheme to influence our election. When he announced the indictment, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was careful to state that \u201cthere is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\u201d and \u201cthere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThis careful approach makes it harder for Trump and his allies to attack Mueller\u2019s investigation as a waste of time, a hoax, or a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d On its face, this indictment and its announcement was not aimed at Trump and reached a nonpartisan conclusion, which is why Trump initially quoted Rosenstein\u2019s announcement in a tweet. It is now harder for Trump to claim that Rosenstein and Mueller are out of control.\n\nBut while the indictment undercuts Trump\u2019s arguments against the investigation, it does not reduce the potential liability of Trump or his associates. Mueller could still charge Americans in a future indictment with aiding and abetting the Russian operation if they knew of the criminal activity and helped make it succeed. Nothing in Friday\u2019s indictment forecloses that possibility, and one American, Richard Pinedo, has already pleaded guilty to helping the Russians to fraudulently obtain U.S. bank accounts.\n\nBased on what we know publicly, Trump\u2019s greatest legal liability appears to be for obstruction of justice\u2014not for aiding the Russians. As I\u2019ve explained in this publication, it appears likely that Mueller will conclude Trump obstructed justice, yet at this time there is not sufficient public evidence to prove that Trump or his close associates aided a Russian operation.\n\nTime will tell whether Mueller can prove that anyone associated with the Trump campaign assisted the Russian operation. Friday\u2019s indictment suggests that charges would involve knowledge of the Russian attempts to hide their tracks, not the Russian influence operation itself. But the lasting legacy of Friday\u2019s indictment may be its impact on Trump and on opinion within the Republican Party, either by buying time and space for Mueller to continue investigating obstruction or by generating more evidence (like this weekend\u2019s tweets) that aid Mueller's investigation.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ryan Heath", "body": "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair  | Carl Court/Getty Images\n        \n        \n                        Tony Blair: Just weeks left to stop Brexit\n                        The former prime minister will say in a speech Thursday that the EU should reform to provide an alternative to Brexit.\n\n                    \n                \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBy\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRyan Heath\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t3/1/18, 12:01 AM CET\n\n\t\t\tUpdated 3/1/18, 3:54 AM CET\n\n\t\t\n\n     Blair believes there are just weeks left to stop Brexit and will argue in a speech in Brussels Thursday that EU reforms centred on immigration control are\u00a0key to persuading Britons to change their mind in a second Brexit vote.\n\nIn a speech at a European Policy Center event, the former U.K. prime minister\u00a0will say the Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, in effect, lied to British voters and left them with an impossible-to-deliver vision of Brexit.\n\nInstead of the U.K. government delivering a complicated Brexit and EU supporters offering \u201cpassive acquiescence,\u201d Blair suggests that a \u201ccomprehensive plan on immigration control\u201d across Europe could sit at the core of an alternative to Brexit.\n\nBlair believes the Brexit vote is an unambiguous warning to the EU to reform, that puts responsibility on the shoulders of EU leaders to help all of Europe to escape the Brexit \u201ccul-de-sac.\u201d\n\nIf they fail, the competitive pressure a desperate Britain places on the EU will diminish both the EU and U.K., and potentially lead to race-to-the-bottom policies. \u201c[Brexit] weakens Europe\u2019s standing and power the world over.

That is who we are. And it's time to fight for it.\u201d\n\nKennedy, who delivered his speech in the auto shop of a technical school at the south end of his district in Fall River, was praised by a range of people for his speech but mocked by some\u2014including a number of prominent Republicans\u2014for the shininess in one corner of his mouth throughout the 10-minute speech.\n\nIt was a classic example of an issue that appeared only on television: the reflection of the lights wasn\u2019t visible to anyone in the room, and he and staff became aware of it only after the broadcast was done.\n\nIt was also a classic example of how the peanut gallery nature of Twitter can shape perceptions across the wider media. Kennedy painted a dark portrait of America on the brink, Nazi marches and mass shootings, \u201cand that nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs, \u2018This is not right. This is not who we are.\u2019\u201d\n\nKennedy wasn\u2019t defensive. He sees the hubbub over his shiny lips as another symptom of his larger argument: that when \u201cfar bigger\u201d issues are actually at stake, it can seem like everything is the chaos, partisanship and politics of the past year.\n\n\u201cAll of us bear some responsibility for that too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a fractured and divided country. There are undeniably a sizable percentage of our population that steadfastly supports the president.

And it\u2019s not going to stop the fact that I think that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s started tossing back mentions of the episode with self-effacing promises to use less Chapstick, and added, \u201cI like to think that if I can learn that lesson that quickly, some of the folks that are criticizing me can as well.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and others also criticized Kennedy\u2019s selection as showing the dearth of Democratic stars and ideas, dismissing him as either a white man, a Massachusetts liberal, a dynastic politician\u2014he is the grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy\u2014or some combination of the above.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, all those things are more or less true,\u201d Kennedy said of the japes at his privileged background. \u201cPart of what I tried to point out last night was that there\u2019s far more issues, opportunities, obstacles, challenges that unite those various identity groups than divide them, and I think this administration is using some cheap form of exploiting those divisions to exercise their own political agenda.

Phil Bredesen (D) narrowly edging out Blackburn in a hypothetical match-up. With Republicans controlling just 51 seats, a loss in Tennessee and other competitive races could put the Senate in play \u2014 despite an electoral map tilted heavily in the GOP\u2019s favor.  \nThe poll, conducted by Glen Bolger of Public Opinion Strategies for a Tennessee business group and obtained by POLITICO, shows Bredesen up 47 to 45, despite a sample that was overweighted with Republicans. The survey shows that voters preferred a generic Republican over a Democrat and strongly approved of Trump, signs that even in a Republican-leaning state like Tennessee, Blackburn is in for a tough race. \nAsked to respond to Corker\u2019s second thoughts and the coterie of Republicans pushing him to run again, Blackburn\u2019s campaign insisted she was in the race to stay, whether Corker runs or not. Blackburn\u2019s allies argue she will unite the GOP in the conservative state and crush Bredesen in the fall.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s well past time for the good old boys\u2019 club in Washington D.C. to quit thinking they know who the best candidate and conservative leader is for Tennessee families,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Blackburn. \nPublic polls show Blackburn is a heavy favorite over former Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) in the primary to succeed Corker, and her allies argue the state is so Republican that she can\u2019t lose after winning the primary. Trump won nearly 2-to-1 against Hillary Clinton in Tennessee. She also raised $2 million in her first quarter as a candidate, a significant haul. Meanwhile, a Club for Growth poll from January showed Blackburn trouncing Corker.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThe Club for Growth, which has spent millions in past elections to defeat more moderate Republicans, will stick with Blackburn regardless of whether Corker reverses course. Their poll showed Blackburn beating Fincher by more than 50 points and also showed Blackburn trouncing Corker. \n\u201cThe message that I\u2019d want to give to the folks trying to entice Corker into running: You shouldn\u2019t do it, he\u2019s gonna lose,\u201d said Club President David McIntosh. \u201cIt would be a sad way for him to end his career to end up being defeated. We will continue to support Marsha.\u201d \nMcIntosh also argued that Corker re-entering the race would only weaken the GOP by reopening ideological chasms within the party. Indeed, there is a long running feud between Tennessee\u2019s more moderate Republicans and conservatives like Blackburn. \nModerates in Tennessee had been aligning with Fincher, but Blackburn has outraised him and Fincher has failed to get traction in the polls. Fincher\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. \nVictor Ashe, a former GOP mayor of Knoxville, prefers Fincher but said he\u2019s \u201cnot sure that he\u2019s a candidate, based on his inactivity.\u201d If he was left to choose between Blackburn and Bredesen, Ashe said he would not commit to endorsing Blackburn. \u201cI could go either way,\u201d Ashe said. \n\u201cAnyone seriously sizing it up would have to say Mrs. Blackburn would be somewhat ahead of Bredesen but not a lot,\u201d Ashe said. \u201cDepending on how the national situation goes, it could be extremely competitive. It would be hard to attack [Bredesen\u2019s] record as governor because so many Republicans like him.\u201d \nFormer Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist (R) was blunt when asked about Blackburn: \u201cYou can say on the record I\u2019m not supporting her.\u201d Blackburn worked in Sundquist\u2019s administration and the two do not get along. \nThe distaste for Blackburn in some corners of the party is driving the campaign to recruit Corker to get back in. Those Republicans argue that she could blow a winnable race, pointing to Bredesen\u2019s coalitions of Republican supporters when he won two governors races. \n\u201cTennessee by any normal standard is a Republican state. I think it\u2019s only close with Blackburn,\u201d said a top Tennessee Republican urging Corker to get back in. \u201cThe problem is Marsha\u2019s a polarizing force. Her nomination is the only path to put this race in play.\u201d \nYet Corker would almost certainly need a blessing from Trump to have any hope of beating Blackburn, who has received money from Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s political action committee. Corker has reached out to the White House to gauge Trump\u2019s support, according to a source familiar with those conversations. And almost all of the dozen Republican officials and operatives interviewed for this story say Corker would need a presidential endorsement to have any chance against Blackburn. \nFurthermore, the electorate in Tennessee is so overwhelmingly Republican now that several strategists said Blackburn would be fine once she wins the August primary and shifts gears ahead of the general election. \nBlackburn launched her campaign attacking GOP leadership and had an early campaign ad pulled from Twitter for being \u201cinflammatory\u201d \u2014 and that rubs some Tennessee Republicans the wrong way. \n\u201cIt\u2019s as much about taste as it is about electability for some people,\u201d said a strategist following the race. \nThe last-gasp effort to recruit Corker is an awkward topic in the Senate GOP right now. Senate GOP campaign chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) attended a political event with Blackburn in New York on Monday, even as his colleague Corker mulled getting back in the race, according to two sources with knowledge of the event. \n Plus, Blackburn would be just the sixth female senator in the GOP caucus if she were to win. \n\u201cThis situation is baffling since we need more Republican women in the Senate \u2014 not less,\u201d said a senior Senate GOP aide.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). has spoken to Corker about whether he should reconsider his retirement, but the leader told Corker he needed to work it out with the president, a source with direct knowledge of the conversation said. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander has also discussed the race with Corker, but is not explicitly pushing Corker to run again, said a Republican familiar with those talks. \nYet clearly some Senate Republicans are excited by the Senate Foreign Relations chairman\u2019s fresh look at his decision to retire. Corker\u2019s departure, along with uncertainty about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and the retirement of House Foreign Relations Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.), would further drain the party of senior foreign policy voices. \n\u201cThat would be terrific,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). \u201cWe need to hold that seat. I don\u2019t have any doubt\u201d that Corker would win. \n Such a move would not be unprecedented. \nTwo years ago, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) reversed his plans to retire from the Senate despite denying any second thoughts for weeks. One of the key people who convinced Rubio to run? Sen.

Many Republicans say their memo, released with Trump\u2019s backing, demonstrates anti-Trump bias at the FBI and Justice Department that calls into question the entire Russia investigation. Democrats call that a highly misleading effort to taint the Russia probe.\nIf the House votes to release the Democratic memo, Trump will have five days to review it and either support its release \u2014 as he did the Republican memo \u2014 or object. White House officials have not committed to releasing the Democratic version. \nAt issue is an October 2016 application to a federal judge for a Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act (FISA) warrant against Page. That FISA application \u2014 and whether the FBI was fully transparent with a federal court that approved it in October 2016 \u2014 is at the heart of mounting allegations by President Donald Trump and allies in Congress that the FBI abused its spying authority during the 2016 campaign. \nBut Friday\u2019s memo also acknowledged that the Page warrant only came months after the FBI had already opened an investigation into Russian influence over the Trump campaign because of information it had received about another Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadapoulos, whom the New York Times has reported learned in early 2016 that the Russians had stolen Clinton campaign emails.\nThe memo released Friday by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee excoriated FBI leaders for what it described as a crucial omission in that application: the fact that the dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele \u2014 was financed by the campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.\n\u201cNeither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,\u201d the memo alleged.\nBut in an appearance on Fox  Friends, Nunes was asked about reports over the weekend that the FBI application did refer to a political entity connected to the dossier. It is unclear precisely what language the application might have used. \nNunes conceded that a \"footnote\" to that effect was included in the application, while faulting the bureau for failing to provide more specifics.\n\"A footnote saying something may be political is a far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant on an American citizen to spy on another campaign,\" Nunes said on Fox  Friends.\nThere's no evidence that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign itself. Rather, the warrant for Page was issued in October 2016, a month after he left the campaign \u2014 and after Trump campaign officials denied he played a central role. But the surveillance of Page was part of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump associates coordinated with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\nPage is a key figure in the dossier, which makes the unsubstantiated allegation that he held a secret meeting with a top Russian oil executive and a close Putin ally to discuss helping to lift U.S. sanctions against Russia in return for a financial windfall. Page had also been investigated by the FBI in 2013, after he was the target of a recruitment effort by Russian spies in New York City. And the former investment banker and energy consultant also made a summer 2016 trip to Moscow where, after shifting explanations, he now admits he met with Kremlin officials. (Page says the meetings were brief and denies any wrongdoing.)\nThe intelligence committee's memo, which Trump declassified Friday, casts Steele\u2019s dossier as a key component of the Page FISA warrant. But the memo doesn't clarify what other evidence might have been used to convince a court to grant its application, which was renewed several times, including once by Trump's own Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\nThe memo notes that the government must provide \"information potentially favorable to the target of a [surveillance] application,\" but charges that FBI agents \"withheld\" their knowledge that Steele\u2019s work had Democratic funding, and that Steele had openly expressed dislike for Trump.\nNunes' comments follow a similar acknowledgment on Sunday by Gowd, who also said the footnote revealed a possible political bias behind the dossier but called it convoluted.\n\"I read the footnote. I know exactly what the footnote says,\" Gowdy said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"It took longer to explain it the way they did, than if they just come right out and said, 'Hillary Clinton for America and DNC paid for it.' But they didn't do that.\" \nTrump may have provided a window into his thinking when he unleashed a Twitter attack on the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Monday morning. If Trump opposes the Democratic memo's release, the committee may then refer it to the full House of Representatives for a vote to overrule him.\n Among Schiff's complaints about the GOP memo: he says the application to spy on Page only included snippets of the controversial dossier -- and that those aspects may have been \"subject to corroboration\" by the FBI. \n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

We just know too much.\n\nEarlier this week, the editor of this magazine, Blake Hounshell, laid out the case for skepticism, centering on President Donald Trump\u2019s incompetence and the apparent lack of a smoking gun. He argues that the Trump campaign\u2014run by a first-time politician with no filter, aided by a bumbling staff of amateurs who leaked like sieves\u2014was simply too incompetent to have colluded with Russia and kept it a secret. Hence, we would have the smoking gun by now if there was one.\n\nNone of his arguments withstands a skeptical eye. Instead, they require disassembling, isolating and explaining away an array of damning information.\n\nThe first claim is that Trump is too undisciplined to hide this caper.\n\nThe Trump campaign was certainly a chaotic and leaky affair, but when something damaging needed to be kept quiet they certainly knew how to cover it up and keep quiet\u2014at least, temporarily. If anything, they have a lot of practice in coping with scandal. Trump has been silent on: cash payments to hide alleged extra-marital affairs, never revealed during the campaign; all those non-disclosure agreements he has signed over the decades; and his tax returns, despite immense pressure to release them. In the face of significant political or legal pressure he\u2019s had the message-discipline to stick to a line or keep quiet, such as by saying his taxes were under \u201croutine audit\u201d and therefore could not be released.\n\nThis same pattern exists in the Russia scandal. Since the campaign ended, more than 50 contacts between Trump\u2019s team and Russian operatives\u2014which the campaign repeatedly, and for a time successfully, lied about and covered up\u2014have been revealed. All the while, Trump stays on message, insisting, in all caps, there was no collusion and attacking those investigating him.\n\nIt is also true that colluding with a foreign government without getting exposed would require a certain crafty competence. But the Trump team\u2019s incompetence is exactly why we know so much already.\n\nThis gets to the second claim of the skeptics: Why has there been no smoking gun? In fact, there have already been several.\n\nTrump campaign and administration officials have been indicted and pleaded guilty. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman and his deputy, the national security adviser, and a campaign volunteer have all been charged with crimes as a result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nFor skeptics, Mueller\u2019s indictments don\u2019t yet provide anything truly damning. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos are just charged with lying to the FBI, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are in trouble for their work in Ukraine, and the 13 Russian indictments implicate Russia, not Trump. However, this is exactly how a veteran prosecutor would conduct an investigation against someone with pardon power and the ability to fire the investigator: Tread lightly and reveal only what you absolutely need to reveal.\n\nA skeptic will rightly say this is all tea-leaf reading. While Mueller\u2019s indictments might be suggestive, they do not yet implicate Trump. That\u2019s true, in isolation. But it raise the question: What are Flynn, Papadopolous, and now potentially Gates cooperating about, then? The answer is that they have information that Mueller finds valuable enough to grant them leniency.\n\nIn demanding a smoking gun, skeptics also ignore the obvious one: the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Trump\u2019s campaign leadership and Russian operatives. In June 2016, PR man Rob Goldstone offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton as \u201cpart of Russia and it\u2019s government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u201d in an email, to which Donald Trump Jr. responded, not to ask what Goldstone was talking about but to say, \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d He then brought in the campaign chairman and Trump\u2019s son-in-law to discuss both the dirt and Russian sanctions\u2014the quid and the quo.\n\nThis meeting is the Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition of collusion: \u201csecret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose.\u201d That these details have been public knowledge for months doesn\u2019t make them any less incriminating. This meeting demonstrates that the Trump campaign knew of the Russian government\u2019s support for Trump and was willing to collude. The Russians were offering information and capabilities that would have been of tremendous value to a political campaign. And the Trump campaign wanted what the Russians were offering.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. The big reveal from the memo by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes was that the FBI had reason to believe that one of Trump\u2019s first five foreign policy advisors, Carter Page, might be a Russian agent. Page had previously bragged about being an \u201cinformal adviser\u201d to the Kremlin and had been recruited by Russian spies who said of Page, \u201chis enthusiasm works for me.\u201d During the campaign he met top Putin allies and gave a pro-Kremlin speech in Moscow; upon returning, he spoke directly with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Republican National Convention. More recently, Trump\u2019s own Justice Department had sufficient evidence to monitor Page and then gained enough evidence to renew the surveillance warrant multiple times.\n\nMeanwhile, Papadopoulos, another one of Trump\u2019s first foreign policy advisers, was approached by people claiming to represent the Kremlin who offered \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails\u201d; Papadopoulos subsequently sent multiple emails to campaign higher-ups in the campaign about his Russian contacts. Afterwards, he stayed with the campaign for several months, during which he did interviews as a campaign surrogate and helped edit Trump\u2019s foreign policy addresses.\n\nSkeptics claim that much of what we know is built on these \u201chapless\u201d volunteers and \u201cattention-seeking wannabees.\u201d But intelligence agencies almost never recruit the best people, targeting instead individuals who are compromised, bitter, or overly ambitious, and, most importantly, who have access. It is now clear, as shown by the emails between Papadopolus and Trump campaign leadership referenced in the indictment, that these \u201chapless\u201d volunteers had access.\n\nMueller\u2019s latest indictments further spell out what the intelligence community asserted in January 2017: There were two campaigns to elect Trump, one based in Trump Tower and the other in the Kremlin. Insisting there was no collusion requires then imagining a bright line between the two and ignoring dozens of interactions between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and Kremlin-linked individuals, often discussing campaign strategy and shared goals.\n\nFaced with this evidence, arguing there was no collusion is no longer the position of a skeptic, but of someone in denial. It is the refusal to acknowledge what is staring us all in the face: The president of the United States and his campaign colluded with a foreign adversary to defeat his political opponent.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Seung Min Kim", "body": "Rand Paul and Nancy Pelosi have virtually nothing in common.

There's not a whole lot of history books about the great points of the American Senate.\"\nThe entire spectacle was a reminder of the sorry state of Beltway politics. Even a bipartisan deal blessed by the leaders of both chambers can get caught up in extraneous drama.\nPaul\u2019s sideshow wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. The arch-conservative has frequently used procedural delay tactics to gum up legislation he opposes, particularly on spending and spying powers, when his opposition was plainly in vain. But the last time he really went there was in 2015, so senators might have downplayed the possibility of it happening this time around.\nPaul believes it\u2019s entirely appropriate \u2014 even necessary \u2014 to cause some pain in order to call attention to what he believes is a monstrosity of a bill. He also wants to highlight the broken process: congressional leaders in both parties dropping a massive and expensive 652-page bill just over 24 hours before the shutdown deadline.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThe senator wanted a vote on keeping strict budget caps in place, which would essentially undo the entire deal. But even if his amendment reached the floor, Paul is fully aware it wouldn\u2019t pass. \n\"I have been asking all day. I have been asking all week for it,\" Paul said of the vote. \"We could have literally had dozens of votes today, but we squabble because people don't want to be put on the spot. So the reason I'm here tonight is to put people on the spot.\"\nHis protest is expected to delay a Senate vote into the wee hours of the morning.

I know your business is now doing very well.\u201d He later singled out Harley-Davidson as a \u201cgreat American company\u201d in his first address to Congress, vowing to help it again by persuading foreign countries to cut tariffs on its motorcycles.\n\nBut Harley-Davidson did not make Trump\u2019s list of corporations benefiting from his presidency during his State of the Union address Tuesday night. That may be because Tuesday morning, Harley-Davidson announced plans to close a Kansas City factory and lay off 800 employees after weak fourth-quarter earnings, capping off a rough 2017 that saw its worldwide sales drop 6.7 percent. The company\u2019s CEO has said publicly that part of the problem was Trump\u2019s decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal: \u201cThat would have helped us a lot.\u201d\n\nIt would be silly to portray Harley-Davidson\u2019s current troubles as a reflection of the economy, which is doing just fine after Trump\u2019s first year in office. But it was even sillier to portray Harley-Davidson\u2019s successes as a reflection of his instant rescue of the economy, which was also doing just fine before Trump took office. He loves to use corporations as props in his own heroic economic narrative, a narrative that depends on national amnesia about the state of the economy he inherited.\n\n\u201cFor many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us,\u201d Trump declared last night. \u201cBut now they are coming back!\u201d\n\nUm\u2026no. It\u2019s good that the U.S. economy created 2.4 million jobs in the last year, as Trump boasted last night, but it created 16 million jobs in the six years before that. The president provided an inadvertent reminder with his shoutout to Corey Adams, \u201can all-American worker\u201d whose bosses at Staub Manufacturing in Ohio used their tax cuts to give him a raise. Trump noted that Adams \u201clost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub,\u201d so he was presumably one of the 16 million who left the unemployment rolls under President Barack Obama.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s great that the African-American unemployment rate dropped from 7.9 percent to 6.8 percent in 2017, which Trump noted is \u201cthe lowest rate ever recorded,\u201d but that was after dropping from 16.1 percent to 7.9 percent since 2009. Trump also hailed how the stock market \u201chas smashed one record after another,\u201d and indeed it has, but it also nearly tripled on Obama\u2019s watch, which doesn\u2019t quite fit Trump\u2019s mythology of America rising from the ashes. Trump even took credit for the resurgence of U.S. auto manufacturing, \u201csomething we have not seen for decades.\u201d In fact, Obama inherited an auto industry in shambles, but auto sales and employment nearly doubled on his watch\u2014and have actually declined slightly on Trump\u2019s.\n\nLast night, Trump spent a lot of time advertising that \u201cmassive tax cut\u201d he signed last month\u2014and at $1.5 trillion it really is big, although not, as he claimed, the biggest in American history. And it is true, as he said, that 3 million workers have received bonuses that companies like Staub attributed to his corporate tax cuts. But if the point of the legislation had been to get money to workers, the Republicans who wrote it could have just given money to workers. Instead, they poured most of the money into permanent tax relief for corporations and wealthy heirs, while the relief for the middle class was much more modest and temporary.\n\nThose bonuses, of course, will also be temporary, but they gave employers an opportunity to play their beneficent roles in Trump\u2019s economic theater. With great fanfare, AT&T attributed its $1000 employee bonuses to the tax cuts, even though it had been discussing them with its unions for months, then unveiled major layoffs with no fanfare. Wal-Mart paired a $300 million wage increase for its workers with a $4 billion stock buyback for its investors, while also shuttering stores and firing workers. Kimberly-Clark, abandoning the Trump script, actually announced that it would use its tax-cut windfall to shut down factories and lay off 5,000 workers. One consulting firm surveyed 333 large employers about what they planned to do with their tax cuts, and only 7 percent said they were planning any kind of wage increase.\n\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of Trump\u2019s early days in office, when he kept touting big expansion plans from companies like Charter Communications, General Motors, and Intel that had been in the works long before he arrived in Washington. Or his post-election public-relations coup when he supposedly saved the jobs at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis from relocating to Mexico; that factory announced 300 layoffs in July and another 200 this month. Obviously, Carrier didn\u2019t fit last night\u2019s New American Moment theme\u2014the Democratic group American Bridge ran digital ads featuring angry Carrier workers accusing Trump of betraying them during the speech\u2014so Trump bragged about Apple instead, crediting its new $350 billion investment strategy to his tax cuts, even though the company has not.\n\nIt must be said that Trump misleading his audience about the economy was not exactly playing against type. What seemed unusual last night was Trump boring his audience about the economy. Whatever you thought of his muscular economic nationalism on the campaign trail, with his fiery rants about the nefariousness of China and Mexico and the stupidity of U.S. negotiators, he always put on a good and original show. Last night, most of the policy statements he read off the TelePromter were studiously bland and content-free politician-talk: \u201cFrom now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and reciprocal.\u201d Or: \u201cI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\u201d Perhaps he paid his speechwriters by the clich\u00e9.\n\nIn fairness, it\u2019s hard to craft an original or indelible State of the Union address. Obama\u2019s annual exhortations about \u201cwinning the future\u201d or \u201can economy built to last\u201d were pretty forgettable, too; the most memorable line in an Obama speech to Congress was \u201cYou lie!\u201d\u2014and it wasn\u2019t his. The public quickly forgot the promises Trump made about the economy last year, and last night\u2019s promises probably won\u2019t matter much, either.\n\n But Trump has committed pretty ferociously to his heroic narrative of resurrection. If the stock market or the labor market ever departs too dramatically from that narrative, if the rest of the economy follows the path of Harley-Davidson\u2014well, that might matter.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachael Bade", "body": "Minutes into Donald Trump\u2019s renegade embrace of the left\u2019s wish list for gun control, Republican Rep.

The GOP has its rifts on hot-button issues like immigration and health care. But its devotion to expansive gun rights has been close to absolute. As Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) put it, \u201cEveryone says it\u2019s the NRA\" that explains the GOP's devotion to the cause. \"No. It\u2019s your constituents.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Steve Daines (R-Mont.), a staunch gun rights advocate. \n\n\"When it comes down to it, his administration will have a problem,\u201d Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said of Trump\u2019s call to increase the age for some firearm purchases or to seize weapons in some cases without a court order.\n\nBut Trump is still president. So they were more prone to rationalize or explain away his apparent openness to an assault weapons ban and more background checks \u2014 among other items on gun control advocates\u2019 policy menu \u2014 than to go after him directly.\n\nMaybe Trump didn\u2019t mean what he said, some of them said, or perhaps was misunderstood. Others held out that he would come to his senses and quickly end his flirtation with Democrats.\n\n\u201cThat was yesterday. This is today,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a state that overwhelmingly supported Trump.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have somebody wanting to take away life, liberty or property without due process, that is a concern,\u201d added Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). \u201cI would like to figure out what he meant.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much thought he put into what he actually was saying, in terms of the details of it,\u201d offered Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) \n\nRepublicans have adopted a strategy of not necessarily taking what Trump says in showman mode at face value. Meeting with Democrats and Republicans at the White House in January, he talked up liberal immigration proposals only to later backpedal when conservatives howled. \n\nIt doesn't do much good, Republicans reason, to attack the leader of their party over a position he may not hold for more than a couple days. \n\nAnd practically speaking, it will be nearly impossible for Congress to pass much more than a bill to improve background checks, given the hardened GOP opposition. Even a modest background checks bill is being held up by Lee and other like-minded conservatives, who say it would trample the due process rights of veterans. \n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has balked at a guns debate in the immediate aftermath of the massacre of 17 people in Florida, a delay that could sap the energy of gun control activists. \n\n\u201cIf he embraces some of the things he talked about yesterday, a lot of folks up here on our side are not going to be for some of that stuff,\u201d Thune said of Trump\u2019s gun push. \n\nWhile Republicans think it\u2019s important to discourage the president from upsetting his rural, gun-loving base, most have taken to privately registering those feelings of discomfort with the White House rather than dressing down the president publicly. It's courtesy they never extended to President Barack Obama after his calls for tougher background checks. \n\nInstead, most Republicans spent Thursday highlighting the problems with Trump\u2019s seeming support for proposals advocated by the likes of Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that due process means that you get a lawyer, a trial, a hearing, an impartial court making a decision before any of your rights taken away,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of Trump's call to \"take the gun first, go through due process second.\"\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) similarly shied away from criticizing Trump personally, while firmly rejecting the bulk of the ideas the president floated Wednesday. Jordan emphasized similarities with Trump\u2019s viewpoints on arming teachers, and turned his criticisms toward Democrats instead of the White House.\n\n\u201cOn the most fundamental level in Florida we had the most systemic failure of government to deal with this bad guy, and now we\u2019re supposed to say the answer is more government?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe premise that so many on the left have \u2014 so many Democrats \u2014 I just don\u2019t buy into that premise.\u201d\n\nBut didn\u2019t Trump buy that premise?: \u201cAll I know is the answer is not more government,\u201d Jordan replied. \n\nThere\u2019s a smaller faction of Capitol Hill Republicans who\u2019ve attacked the president personally on guns. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who leads the House\u2019s gun caucus, tweeted Thursday that \u201clike liberals, @realDonaldTrump mentions Columbine, Pulse, Sandy Hook to motivate gun control, but totally ignores how guns were acquired: columbine: straw purchases, pulse: registered security guard, sandy hook: stolen. DISGRACEFUL!\u201d\n\nThere were a few Republicans who applauded Trump. They included Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who are pushing proposals to raise the age limit for buying some rifles and to enforce background checks for Internet and gun show sales. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cHe was enthusiastic about it,\u201d beamed Toomey after Trump lavished praise on his background checks plan. \n\nThe pair of GOP senators and some Democrats, meanwhile, held out hope that perhaps Trump could finally break the entrenched politics of gun control by getting behind \"common sense\" regulations. It's one thing for a Democratic president calls for stricter gun rules; it's a different equation when a pro-NRA Republican president does so.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one concerned about Donald Trump taking their Second Amendment rights away,\u201d Manchin said. \n\nThat still might be wishful thinking. Senators said Trump would struggle to move all but a handful of Republicans in the Senate. And in the more conservative House, prospects for new gun laws look even bleaker.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no changing minds,\u201d said Sen.

Britain was due to take over responsibility for providing the battle-ready force in the second six months of 2019, during the Brexit transition period.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s decision to withdraw from the roster of EU countries offering to lead battlegroups is likely to spark concern on the Continent that London\u2019s commitment to European security is now also uncertain,\u00a0despite May\u2019s repeated reassurance that this is not the case.\n\n\u2018Clarity of purpose\u2019\nIn the letter informing Brussels of the U.K.\u2019s decision, Britain\u2019s Lieutenant General George Norton said the decision to withdraw from the program was because of the logistical problems caused by Brexit, and insisted\u00a0Britain could still remain part of the program further down the line if a political agreement could be struck.\n\nWriting to General\u00a0Mikhail Kostarakos, chairman of the EU military committee, Norton said the U.K. is prepared to offer a battlegroup for the EU rota in future once the Brexit uncertainty had been cleared.\u00a0He added the U.K.\u2019s offer had always been \u201cprovisional.\u201d\n\nNorton said that while Britain\u2019s withdrawal had been under discussion since September last year, it was important to clarify the decision to give the EU time to prepare.\n\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Greece are the only other countries with national headquarters having sufficient capacity to command a European operation.\n\n\u201cMilitary activities, however, require clarity of purpose, and planning; not least of which involves the time that is necessary to force generate credible capabilities,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe U.K. believes that, for the practical purposes of the time needed for the EU and member states to identify and assign a stand-by battlegroup for the second half of 2019, a decision should not be delayed. Consequently we formally withdraw our provisional offer of a battlegroup for the period 2019-20.\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on: \u201cOur prime minister\u2019s unconditional commitment to European security of course stands, but the offer of a battlegroup in the period immediately following our exit strikes us an unnecessary complication.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment before this article was published.\n\nAny decision to deploy the battlegroup would be made by EU leaders at the European Council, which Britain will leave in March 2019. However, all lead battlegroup countries retain a veto over deployment.\n\nThe U.K. is one of only a handful of EU countries capable of providing battlegroup headquarters.\n\nBritain also currently leads the EU\u2019s counter-piracy mission \u201cAtlanta\u201d off the coast of Somalia, commanding the operation out of Northwood military headquarters in Hertfordshire.\n\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Greece are the only other countries with national headquarters having sufficient capacity to command a European operation.\u00a0The U.K., for example, is providing the headquarters for a Dutch/Belgian battlegroup in 2018.\n\nLondon also plays an important role in Operation Sophia \u2014 the counter-smuggling operation in the Mediterranean that is commanded from Italian national headquarters \u2014 as well as stationing troops in Estonia to act as a deterrent to any military action by Russia.\n\nWhether Britain continues its involvement in the EU battlegroup program after Brexit will depend on whether the U.K. can negotiate more involvement in decision-making and control of missions than is normally offered to third countries, U.K. officials said.\u00a0If this proves impossible, officials say it is unlikely Britain will continue to take part in EU missions in the  stories on these topics:", "link": null, "source": "Politico - EU", "location": []}, {"author": "Burgess Everett", "body": "Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    Republicans throw in the towel on Obamacare\n                        \n\n                \n                        Most GOP lawmakers aren\u2019t interested in another failed effort to repeal the health law in an election year.\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n        \n            By BURGESS EVERETT\n    02/01/2018 11:45 AM EST\n                    \n\n        \nWHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. \u2014 Republicans are giving up on their years-long dream of repealing Obamacare. \n Though the GOP still controls both chambers of Congress and maintains the ability to jam through a repeal-and-replace bill via a simple majority, there are no discussions of doing so here at House and Senate Republicans\u2019 joint retreat at The Greenbrier resort. Republicans doubt they can even pass a budget providing for the powerful party-line \u201creconciliation\u201d procedure used to pass tax reform last year, much less take on the politically perilous task of rewriting health care laws in an election year.Story Continued Below\n\n   \u201cI don\u2019t think leadership wants to,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who worked with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on a last-ditch repeal effort last fall. \u201cIn the sense of Graham-Cassidy, a partisan exercise? Doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d \n Republicans' decision to abstain from another attempt at gutting Barack Obama\u2019s health law \u2014 at least this year \u2014 goes back on a pledge the party has made to voters since 2010. And it underscores how Republicans overpromised in their ability to reform the nation\u2019s health care and never fully recognized how divided the party is over key Obamacare planks like protecting pre-existing conditions and preserving the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \n And now the GOP is facing reality. Senate Republicans would struggle to pass a bill slashing at Obamacare under the best circumstances this year. They lost a Senate seat in Alabama in December and are down another vote as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) undergoes cancer treatment. GOP leaders would rather put the debacle of last year\u2019s failed attempt behind them. \n \u201cIt would be a heavy lift. I think everybody knows,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 GOP leader. \u201cWe sort of tested the limits of what we can do in the Senate last year. And we\u2019re one vote down from where we were then.\u201d \n Republicans very well may lose the House or Senate this fall, which would officially stick a fork in their efforts to move a partisan agenda item like Obamacare repeal while President Donald Trump is in office. But there appears to be no urgency to capitalize on unified Republican control: None of the lawmakers interviewed for this story believe that Congress will pass a budget this year that would allow Republicans to use reconciliation to evade the Senate\u2019s supermajority requirements. \n And rather than make a major play to the frustrated conservative base on health care, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has charted a bipartisan approach in his comments when asked about the matter. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a budget. And without a budget I don\u2019t think we can do reconciliation,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). \u201cWhen you hear the leader speak, he\u2019s speaking about bipartisanship. So I think that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going to go in this year.\u201d \n The news is not being taken well in some corners of the party. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, winced when reminded of the party\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare and the lack of formal discussion on undermining the law at the retreat. \n Yet he was hopeful that Republicans can pick up Senate seats in November and try again with a bigger Senate majority. \n \u201cDo I see a full repeal of Obamacare happening on a reconciliation vehicle this year? No. And to suggest otherwise would be to ignore 51 votes in the Senate,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cIf we keep the majority in the House and they get a larger majority in the Senate then you might look at a reconciliation vehicle after November.\u201d \n Republicans took some heart in having recently passed laws that repealed Obamacare's individual mandate and delayed some Obamacare taxes. And most GOP lawmakers said that they believed those provisions are as far as they can go given the political constraints and the ugly nature of last year\u2019s attempt, including a failed Senate vote and months of party infighting. \n But Graham, for one, is not willing to give up. After a herculean, if failed, effort in September to push legislation repealing Obamacare and block granting federal health care funds to the states, Graham said the GOP will be savaged by its voters if it tries to give up on fully scuttling the law. \n \"We're coming back at it. Republicans have no choice but to try to replace Obamacare after repealing the individual mandate,\" he said, citing an obligation to GOP voters to try again. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not giving up without a fight. And to any Republican who thinks you can avoid the consequences of Obamacare collapsing, you're kidding yourself.\" \n Asked about Graham\u2019s latest push, Thune responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll believe it when we see it.\u201d \n \u201cIf he\u2019s got 50 for it, more power [to him],\u201d Thune said. \u201cThe leader\u2019s not going to bring that up if he can\u2019t get it through.\u201d \n In the meantime, some members of both parties are pushing bills to help stabilize the insurance markets, hoping to bring down premiums after Trump eliminated key payments to health insurers. But even that effort has flagged in recent weeks as conservatives have fought any effort seen as propping up Obamacare, most notably the stabilization bill written by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.). \n \u201cIt\u2019s on the backburner too,\u201d Capito said. Altering Obamacare is \"still being looked at. But not with the intensity it was.\"\nJennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), was joined by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) in requesting that DOJ name a special prosecutor to zero in on possible mishandling of the FBI's Russia investigation prior to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Specifically, the quartet raised concerns about the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier of verified and unverified intelligence alleging a Russian effort to compromise now-President Donald Trump.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Grassley and Graham, who previously requested that the DOJ open a criminal probe of Steele's conduct, on Feb. 28 asked DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz to probe the department's handling of investigations into Trump transition or campaign officials, as well as the Trump administration before Mueller's appointment. Horowitz has been investigating possible DOJ misconduct related to the Hillary Clinton email investigation since early 2017.\n\nThe Republican senators noted in their Thursday letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that under current law, \"the Inspector General does not have the tools that a prosecutor would to gather all the facts, such as the ability to obtain testimony from essential witnesses who are not current DOJ employees.\"\n\n\"Thus, we believe that a special counsel is needed to work with the Inspector General to independently gather the facts and make prosecutorial decisions, if any are merited,\" the Republicans continued. \"The Justice Department cannot credibly investigate itself without these enhanced measures of independence to ensure that the public can have confidence in the outcome.\"\n\nSessions is currently weighing whether to heed an internal recommendation to terminate Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director whom House Republicans say testified in December that a warrant to monitor former Trump campaign aide Carter Page would not have been sought without the Steele dossier. (House Democrats have disputed that characterization of McCabe's testimony.) \n\nIf McCabe is not fired, he is scheduled to retire from DOJ on Sunday. Another central player in the dossier timeline is Bruce Ohr, who was recently demoted from a top DOJ post. \n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

The bill, which has been drafted already, will end freedom of movement, impose new national laws on immigration and allow the U.K. to crack down on fraudulent use of European ID cards.\n\nAssuming there is a Brexit deal this year, the changes will not come into effect until the end of a post-Brexit transition period \u2014 which will finish most likely in December 2020.\n\nBorder control check point in Portsmouth, England | Matt Cardy/Getty Images\n\n\nAccording to one U.K. official familiar with the progress of the bill, Rudd was called to a meeting of the parliamentary business and legislation committee (PBL) on February 27 to provide an update on the progress of the bill. If no deal can be reached with the EU, the U.K. would crash out on March\u00a029, 2019 without a transition period, so the new immigration system would need to be in place much earlier than expected.\n\nThe delay to the immigration bill being brought before parliament until late this year or even early 2019 \u2014 leaving a matter of just a few months to get the bill onto the statute book \u2014 is having a knock-on effect on the crucial \u201caccess to benefits bill\u201d which had been pencilled in to be published in the spring after the EU summit later this month.\n\nThe benefits bill, which has been drafted for publication by David Gauke\u2019s Department for Work and Pensions, will need to be rewritten if the immigration bill is not introduced at the same time. Without the immigration bill, new clauses will be needed to deal with the entitlement to benefits of EU citizens in the U.K. after Brexit, which should have been covered by the Home Office legislation.\n\n\u201cThe point we are at now is we are expecting a note on why the Home Office does not think the bill is needed now,\u201d said one official from the committee.\n\nThe committee expects the note to set out how the Home Office is preparing for a no deal without an immigration bill given that the U.K.\u2019s official leaving date is now just over 21 months away. Rudd has already written to the Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom to set out her plans.\n\nAccording to the official who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity, Rudd wants three non-Brexit bills brought before MPs before the immigration bill.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about this. There are a few ministers who have concerns about it\u201d \u2014 Senior government official\n\nSome Brexiteer ministers are concerned that Rudd is delaying in an attempt to scupper preparations for no deal \u2014 something they regard as key to bolstering the U.K.\u2019s negotiating position. Rudd supported Remain in the referendum.\n\nOne minister, who confirmed the delay to the immigration bill, said there was widespread frustration at the home secretary. Williamson, the defense secretary, for example, is angry at the uncertainty faced by servicemen and women whose partners are from outside the U.K. and are waiting to see what system will be put in place after Brexit, although like other EU citizens they are covered by the agreement reached with the EU on citizens\u2019 rights in December.\n\nA senior government official said: \u201cThere has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about this. There are a few ministers who have concerns about it.

It needs to be in place in case we can\u2019t get a deal.\u201d\n\nThe FT reported last month that the delay to the government\u2019s immigration bill was to allow the Home Office to take in the conclusions of the Migration Advisory Committee\u2019s inquiry into the costs and benefits of European migrants to the U.K. economy, due to be announced in September.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \u201cWe are confident that our immigration systems will be ready for Brexit and have been working to develop the details of the settlement scheme for the\u00a0three million EU citizens already in the U.K. \u2014 as well as the registration of new EU arrivals after March 2019.\n\n\u201cWe will publish further details of this over the coming months, but the Government is currently\u00a0focused on successfully negotiating the terms of the Implementation Period with the EU.\u00a0The Immigration Bill will be introduced when Parliamentary time allows,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThis article has been updated with a response from the Home  stories on these topics:", "link": null, "source": "Politico - EU", "location": []}, {"author": "Kyle Cheney", "body": "Mistrust, anger and charges of skullduggery between Democrats and Republicans have hobbled the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia investigation for months. \n\nHope Hicks and a pair of frustrated senators may have finally broken it.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n There are new signs that Republicans may soon conclude a probe that Democrats call far from complete following Wednesday\u2019s testimony by Trump\u2019s confidante, Hicks. Leaks revealed that Hicks had admitted to sometimes telling white lies on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2014 a fact that Republicans called an unfair distortion of the departing White House communications director\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe next day, House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office confirmed that the top two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee paid an extraordinary visit to Ryan to express their \u201cconcerns\u201d about how the House panel is operating \u2014 and, according to one report, to accuse Republicans of their own dishonest leaking.\n\n\"I want [the House investigation] to end because we have gone off the rails of being able to objectively do our job,\" Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) said Friday. Rooney said that other GOP committee members agree with him, though he did not name them.\n\nThe partial leak of Hicks\u2019s testimony \u201cwas the tipping point for me,\u201d Rooney said, adding he had \u201cfinally come to the realization that we are not going to put together any kind of a bipartisan product that\u2019s going to help the national security apparatus we oversee or to find out objectively what happened in the last election.\"\n\nRooney has urged the panel's lead investigator, Mike Conaway (R-Texas), to shut down the probe, which another GOP committee member describes as \u201cnearly\u201d complete. But Democrats insist that dozens more witnesses must testify, including several top Trump associates such as the president\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It also escalates pressure on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has largely operated free of political drama, to serve as Congress' definitive assessment of the Russian plot.\n\nAt the same time, it underscores the fact that Capitol Hill is largely relying on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal investigation to produce the most meaningful account of Russian interference \u2014 and whether any Trump associates or other Americans conspired to assist the Kremlin.\n\nThe committee itself is facing an existential crisis of sorts. Members of both parties worry that the acrimony and charges of leaks will deter witnesses from cooperating \u2014 and could even scare U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies from sharing information.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan has largely taken a hands-off approach, meanwhile, deferring to committee leaders to resolve confrontations with the FBI and, more recently, with the Senate. \n\nThe day after Hicks testified, Ryan's office revealed that the top Senate Intelligence Committee members, Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), had met with him to discuss unspecified \u201cconcerns\u201d about the House panel\u2019s handling of the investigation.\n\nThe discussion, first revealed by The New York Times, came soon after a set of Warner's text messages that had recently been supplied to the panel were leaked to Fox News, which cited a \"Republican source\" for providing the messages. Ryan, according to a spokeswoman, told the two of them to work it out with Schiff and the committee's chairman, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).\n\nFor now, Conaway says he has no imminent plans to end the investigation until all leads have been explored. But he's expressed hope that the end is near, despite Democrats' protestations.\n\nOther GOP members of the panel increasingly say they\u2019re satisfied with the probe\u2019s thoroughness and expect it to wrap up soon. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) has said he hoped the Hicks interview, following closely on a limited interview of former Trump aide Steve Bannon, might be the panel\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cThe Intelligence Committee should continue our investigation until we have completed our work, which we nearly have,\u201d added Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah).\n\nAfter the leaks about Hick\u2019s testimony, even the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, chided colleagues for the disclosures amid a creeping realization that the GOP appears to be preparing to pull the plug: \"I think it was unfair to Hope Hicks that conversations, as part of her testimony were leaked out of the committee,\" Schiff said on CNN Thursday. \n\nAmid the anticipation of a GOP push to wind down the probe, Schiff also released a list of Democrats\u2019 outstanding requests for subpoenas that Republicans have failed to grant. He accused GOP members of constructing the fa\u00e7ade of a thorough probe but allowing recalcitrant witnesses to avoid answering central questions and refusing to deploy the committee\u2019s vast subpoena power to compel crucial information. \n\nSchiff said the committee failed to exercise this power despite unanswered questions from figures like Hicks, Donald Trump Jr. and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. He noted that Republicans never even attempted to broach potential financial ties between Trump associate and Russian interests. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nEven a rare moment of bipartisan agreement has yielded nothing: After former Trump aide Steve Bannon refused in two recent interviews to answer questions about his post-campaign work for Trump on the grounds that it was covered by executive privilege, the committee voted to subpoena him. \n\nBut Bannon has held his ground \u2014 and so far, committee Republicans have not followed through on threats to hold him in contempt of Congress. \n\nConaway said Thursday the matter is still under review and he expects to discuss it with Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nSidelining the committee further has been the increasingly aggressive parallel probe driven by the committee's chairman, Nunes, into what he alleges are a series of abuses by Obama administration appointees in the Justice and State Departments aimed at the Trump campaign in 2016. \n\nNunes removed himself from the committee's Russia probe nearly a year ago, after a controversial late-night visit to the White House to examine classified documents, about which he later briefed Trump. Since December, he has aggressively sought to change the narrative of the Russia investigation by spotlighting alleged wrongdoing on the part of senior Justice Department and FBI officials. \n\nThe committee was thrown into turmoil last month after Nunes orchestrated the public release \u2014 with Trump\u2019s approval \u2014 of a classified memo alleging anti-Trump bias on the part of FBI and Justice Department officials. Democrats called it a cynical and misleading attempt to protect Trump and issued a strong rebuttal.\n\nRooney is one of four Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee who are quitting Congress at the end of the year. He told POLITICO that his departure isn\u2019t related to his frustration with the panel \u2014 but that he isn\u2019t sorry to be leaving it, either. \n\nHe noted that as many as 70 of his colleagues were on a waiting list to fill opening slots in the next Congress.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some members that wish they were part of this,\" he said. \"Not me.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

While it was unclear to Cooper, the audience in Stormy Daniels v. Donald J. Trump is sometimes not a judge or jury, but viewers at home.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that it helps our legal case,\u201d Avenatti said, appearing on a split screen beside the grainy, years-old image of Daniels. \u201cBut we want the public to have as many facts as possible at their disposal.\u201d\n\nEver since Daniels sued President Donald Trump this month\u2014claiming she had an intimate affair with him in 2006 and 2007 and that a nondisclosure agreement created before the 2016 election is invalid\u2014Avenatti has tormented the administration with a steady drip of half-revelations about Daniels\u2019 relationship with the president, usually with an appeal to tune in for his client\u2019s 60 Minutes interview on Sunday to hear more. Late Thursday night, he tweeted an image of a DVD and hinted that it contained information damaging to the president. He wrote, \u201cIf \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words,\u2019 how many words is this worth?????\u201d The first hashtag: #60minutes.\n\nElaborating on CNN the next day, Avenatti called the tweet a \"warning shot,\" telling Wolf Blitzer the disc contained \"evidence substantiating the relationship.\" He added, \"If people think I'm bluffing, they should ask the opponents in countless cases I've had over the last 15 years if I'm generally a guy that bluffs.\"\n\nAvenatti is as much as Daniels\u2019 pitchman as her lawyer. And in the public relations war that he is waging, he has, in many ways, already won. In less than three weeks, Avenatti has transformed Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, from a tabloid curiosity into a sympathetic figure and cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Her interview on 60 Minutes is so highly anticipated that a movie theater in Oakland proposed charging admission to a screening.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played a pretty good hand in terms of cat-and-mouse,\u201d says John Burris, the civil rights attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s put his client in a high-visibility position, and himself as well.\u201d\n\nAvenatti says Daniels came to him for representation, though he won\u2019t say how. And he won\u2019t say how he is being paid. In a telephone call, he rejected mundane questions about his personal life before volunteering, spontaneously, that he\u2019s single.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a common question I\u2019m getting these days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very flattering.\u201d\n\nLawyers who have opposed Avenatti describe him as a talented litigator who is aggressive, prickly and confrontational. In 2014, he reached an $80.5 million settlement with a Los Angeles cemetery over claims the company dumped human remains, including those of a baby, to make room for new burials. Last year, he capitalized on the Ebola scare to win a $454 million jury verdict against Kimberly-Clark Corp. \u2014 maker of Huggies diapers and Scott toilet paper \u2014 after raising questions about the safety of the company\u2019s surgical gowns. It was the largest verdict in California last year.\n\nThose cases were turned into 60 Minutes features, too. But it took Daniels to catapult him into stardom. On the day in March when he filed her lawsuit, Avenatti had about 500 Twitter followers, he says. Now he\u2019s pushing 100,000. Earlier this week, Sports Illustrated took a special interest in his racing career. Avenatti has competed at Le Mans, a 24-hour endurance event in France where his teammates included Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud.\n\nBut he\u2019s a better lawyer than driver. \u201cThe last person you want to pick a fight with in court is an adrenaline junkie,\u201d says George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who knew Avenatti as a student and keeps in touch. \u201cHe does his best work under pressure. That\u2019s always a dangerous type of opponent to have.\u201d\n\nNow 47, Avenatti attended high school in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, the first person in his family to earn a college degree. During college and at George Washington Law School, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1999, Avenatti worked at an opposition research group run by Rahm Emanuel, who would later become President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff and is now mayor of Chicago. In recent days, Republicans have seized on the affiliation to suggest a political motive.\n\n\u201cWe ended up doing work not just for Democrats but also for Republicans\u201d at the firm, Avenatti says, adding that the last time he saw Emanuel was January 3, 2007. He says he\u2019s sure of the date because he checked his passport. They ran into each other at a Buenos Aires airport.\n\nAvenatti said he is registered to vote as an independent. He last donated to a political candidate in 2007, when he gave $1,000 to former Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Trump hater,\u201d Avenatti says. \u201cSome of the things he\u2019s done, such as rolling back some regulations, have been helpful to the economy and job creation. I agree with some of his tax policies.\u201d\n\nOn the Daniels case, Avenatti has proved unrelenting. He accused Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, of \u201cthuggish behavior\u201d on CNN this week, then pulled out an enormous picture of Cohen and appeared to challenge him to a Crossfire-style TV debate. \u201cWhere is this guy?\u201d Avenatti said.\n\nDavid Schwartz, a friend and representative of Cohen, scolded Avenatti, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go down in flames.\u201d Avenatti wagged his finger at Schwartz and asked, about Daniels, \u201cWhy not just let her talk? \u2026 Why is it so important to your friend and the president of the United States to keep this woman under wraps, to keep her under the thumb, to shut her up?\u201d\n\nBaiting the Trump administration to engage publicly in the controversy, Avenatti said on MSNBC this week, \u201cTo the extent that Mr. Cohen or the president have a counter-narrative or a different version of the facts, they should go on a show, have a press conference, they could have a White House briefing, they could do any number of things, and explain their version of events.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is all about Mr. Avenatti. It\u2019s not about his client. It\u2019s about him and getting himself out there,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cHis court is not the court of law. It\u2019s the court of public opinion. This is all about trying to use this against the president.\u201d\n\nUntil last week, Avenatti\u2019s main opposition in the Daniels case was Cohen, the president\u2019s personal fix-it man who might have made Avenatti\u2019s job easier by talking about the $130,000 payment he has said he made to Daniels from his personal funds as part of the nondisclosure agreement. But on March 16, Trump brought in a more formidable lawyer, Charles Harder, whose clients include Melania Trump and Hulk Hogan. Harder won a $140 million judgment that forced Gawker Media into bankruptcy for publishing a story that included a clip from a sex tape starring the professional wrestler.\n\n\u201cA face-off between Avenatti and Harder may be an example of the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object,\u201d Turley says. \u201cThese are two very good attorneys who are known to be very aggressive.\u201d\n\nHarder and Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. Avenatti appeared unflappable.\n\n\u201cIt is very rare that I draw an opponent who is not at the very top of the legal profession,\u201d he said. \u201cI would prefer to litigate against high-quality lawyers as opposed to low-quality lawyers.\u201d\n\nAsked if Cohen is a low-quality lawyer, the line fell silent. Ten seconds ticked by. Fifteen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d he said. Then, finally: \u201cNo comment.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Susan B.

Trump gleefully tweeted the news out, in all capital letters in case the point wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nBut the timing seemed terrible. The sudden end to the House probe came the very same week the president himself\u2014while stepping up his attacks on special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d\u2014finally and belatedly authorized new sanctions to respond to the Russian hacking. Newspaper editorialists, angry Democrats and even a few Republicans had a field day; the Daily Beast summed up the mocking coverage by calling the Republican report the equivalent of a \u201chalf-researched term paper.\u201d\n\nThe backlash was such that even on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace seemed to eviscerate the House exercise as little more than a coverup for Trump, pointing out that the committee had never heard from key witnesses ranging from former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadapoulos. \u201cYour conclusion is not conclusive,\u201d he said to one of the Republican members, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC).\n\nGowdy\u2014who, it must be noted, is planning to retire after his term is up at the end of the year\u2014seemed to agree, essentially responding: Pay attention to Mueller\u2019s probe and ignore this House report. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cExecutive branch investigations have more credibility, they have more tools, and that\u2019s what I think what my fellow citizens ought to be waiting for and have confidence in. Not congressional investigations that are run by guys running for the Senate in California who never met a camera they didn\u2019t fall in love with.\u201d\n\nThe TV-loving Californian Gowdy couldn\u2019t resist bashing is Rep. Adam Schiff, the panel\u2019s top Democrat and, over the last year, a reliably omnipresent public scourge of Trump and his Republican defenders on Capitol Hill on the subject of the Russiagate allegations. Schiff, a little-known former prosecutor before his committee began investigating Trump, is not running for Senate, but he is mentioned as a possible candidate for speaker if Democrats take back the House this fall, and he is now a favorite Twitter target of the embattled president, who loves to deride him as \u201cLittle Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nWhatever you call him, Schiff certainly was not in charge of the Republican-led House Intelligence investigation, but instead chief witness to its dysfunction. If you want to understand what a congressional committee gone \u201coff the rails\u201d (as one of its Republican members, Florida GOP Rep. Tom Rooney, called it) looks like, Schiff offered a compelling account in an interview for this week\u2019s Global Politico, recounting a committee process so broken that last week\u2019s follies seemed the logical culmination of a \u201cfundamentally unserious\u201d House Intelligence investigation. Schiff argued that the probe, as incomplete as it was, in fact did turn up \u201cample evidence\u201d of Trump\u2019s collusion both with the Russians and with the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Devin Nunes.\n\n\u201cThey announced their conclusions, which included among other things that the Russians had not intervened in the election to help Donald Trump. Now, that\u2019s at odds with what the intelligence community has found. It\u2019s at odds with what our committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what the Senate committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what Bob Mueller has found,\u201d Schiff pointed out to me. It was \u201ca political statement, not a finding,\u201d which is why, as comments like Gowdy\u2019s on Sunday suggest, \u201cwhen they were forced to defend it\u2026 they couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, the sense of a Republican investigation shut down so quickly its members hardly had a sense of what they had decided to put out was underscored watching Gowdy and Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican ostensibly leading the probe on Nunes\u2019 behalf, stumble through interviews on the Sunday talk shows.\n\nDid he really mean it when he said the Russian goal wasn\u2019t necessarily to elect Trump, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd pressed Conaway. \u201cI got us off on the wrong track quite frankly,\u201d Conaway responded.\n\nIronically, Schiff told me he and Conaway had worked well together in the investigation, blaming most of the breakdown on the committee chairman, Nunes, who said he would recuse himself after an early incident last year of coordinating with the Trump White House (\u201cthe midnight run,\u201d Schiff termed it). Instead, Schiff said, Nunes had continued to run the show \u2013 and seemed to be openly coordinating with the Trump White House about it.\n\n\u201cHad Mr. Conaway and I been really given the latitude to run the investigation, it would have been a very different investigation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cChairman Nunes, even when he said he was stepping aside after the midnight run, never did, and continued to make all the key decisions\u2014which witnesses would come in; when they would come; and what open hearings we would have; what open hearings we wouldn\u2019t have; what subpoenas would go out; what subpoenas wouldn\u2019t go out\u2014all of these sideshow investigations of FISA abuse and Uranium One and all that\u2014those were all decisions made by Chairman Nunes, not by Mike Conaway.\u201d\n\nSchiff and the Democrats issued their own 21-page memo days after being surprised by the Republican shutdown, offering a long list of witnesses never called and revealing avenues of investigation they were pursuing, including tantalizing hints about a potential NRA-Russia connection and \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of Trump having engaged in money laundering on behalf of Russian \u201coligarchs, criminals, and regime cronies.\u201d Schiff said he would pursue those if Democrats take the House this fall and he returns as the committee\u2019s chairman. (Interestingly, Schiff did not deny reports he might be a candidate for speaker if the Democrats win, telling me only that it was his \u201chope\u201d that the current Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi will run again. When I said that sounded like a non-denial denial, he replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what my future holds.\u201d)\n\nMeantime, Schiff was left marveling over a partisan spectacle that seemed to confirm, if nothing else, how committed House Republicans remain to President Trump, despite his historically high disapproval ratings for so early in a presidency and the discomfiting facts that have piled up about the Russian plot to help boost Trump\u2019s campaign. That includes, Schiff pointed out, House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom he called \u201ccomplicit in all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think one of the really sad realizations over the last year is not what kind of a president Donald Trump turns out to be\u2014I think it was all too predictable\u2014but rather, how many members of Congress would be unwilling to stand up to him, and more than that, would be completely willing to carry water for him. That is a very sad realization,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI did not expect that.

But Schiff\u2019s observation still applies \u2013 few Republicans aside from the small handful who\u2019ve made it their practice to challenge the president had anything to say about those presidential threats to Mueller this weekend. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of those who has spoken out, warned that if the president does in fact move to shut down the Mueller investigation, it would be \u201cthe beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d But I\u2019m not so sure; if Trump really does ax Mueller, will there be a real outcry among the Republicans who run the House of Representatives?\n\nLast week\u2019s circus in the House Intelligence Committee suggests the sound may be a lot less than deafening.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kyle Cheney", "body": "Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    House intelligence panel votes to release Trump-Russia report\n                        \n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n\n        \n            By KYLE CHENEY\n\n    03/22/2018 10:53 AM EDT\n\n                    \n\n\n        \n\nThe House Intelligence Committee on Thursday voted along party lines to formally end its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and issue a report that says the lawmakers found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s associates and the Kremlin.\n\nThe GOP-authored report must be reviewed by the intelligence community to redact classified information before it can be released.

Hey! Shoulder to shoulder! Don\u2019t take a step back! Y\u2019all deserve it!\u201d\n\nAs he tried to make his way through the pulsing crowd, another teacher stopped him, asking him to sign with a Sharpie the chest of her shirt that had on it a picture of him looking stalwart and stern in his military fatigues.\n\nThe people chanted his name.\n\nRichard Ojeda, hard j, is a first-term lawmaker from southern West Virginia. He\u2019s 47 years old, a husband and a father of two, and he\u2019s won exactly one general election in his life. He is running now for the open seat in West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which seems like a monumentally precocious act for somebody who has served slightly more than a year in any elected office at all. But Ojeda has made his mark on the volatile politics in this state with a stunning suddenness. Though he is a Democrat in a legislature in which his party is outnumbered almost 2-to-1, he spearheaded in his freshman session the passage of a bill legalizing medical marijuana. Then, this January, he stood on the Senate floor and argued in fiery speeches that energy companies should pony up more taxes so teachers could get better benefits and pay. A strike, he warned, was not out of the question. A month later, teachers from all 55 counties walked off the job\u2014a first in the history of the state\u2014instantly making Ojeda the father of one of the region\u2019s largest labor actions of the past 30 years.\n\nIn hard red, Donald Trump-loving West Virginia, Ojeda has become a kind of one-man blue wave, threatening to defy a conventional belief that the only kind of Democrat that can win big races here\u2014or anywhere, for that matter, in Appalachia or the industrial Midwest\u2014is somebody like Joe Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the United States Senate, a pragmatic, pro-business social conservative. Because here is Ojeda, a pro-labor, twang-talking, plainspoken populist, scrambling the state\u2019s recent rightward shift by harkening back to a deeper, more radical vein of its rich political history. In the early 20th century, miners fought and died for higher wages and safer working conditions while wearing red bandanas and carrying Winchester rifles. Now, teachers are the new miners; in fact, in a place all but defined by its coal heritage, there are some 20,000 teachers and fewer than 12,000 miners, making the teachers\u2014plus the 13,000 staff who walked off the job with them\u2014by far the largest union in the state. And here, as I hustled after Ojeda into the bustling Capitol, the striking school employees weren\u2019t armed\u2014but many were dressed in red. And some of them had knotted around their necks those bandanas.\n\nTheir songs of unrest ricocheted off the marble of the rotunda inside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna take it \u2026 we\u2019re not gonna take it \u2026 we\u2019re not gonna take it anymooooooore!\u201d\n\nWith me and Ojeda in this crush of energy was Krystal Ball, the former MSNBC host who\u2019s the president of the People\u2019s House Project, a PAC that has endorsed Ojeda\u2019s congressional candidacy. In the middle of the maelstrom, Ball had to shout to be heard. \u201cHe\u2019s going to win!\u201d she announced. She said this with a certainty that startled me. I had to lean in to make out her words. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be an instant national story! And Richard is going to be an instant national figure and face of the Democrats!\u201d\n\nI gave Ball a skeptical look. West Virginia, after all, voted overwhelmingly for Trump, and the 3rd District was the most pro-Trump district. The Cook Political Report doesn\u2019t even label the district as \u201ccompetitive.\u201d Evan Jenkins, the current GOP representative, won so decisively in 2016, he decided to run for the right to run against Manchin for Senate. And in Logan County, where Ojeda grew up and still lives, just shy of 80 percent of voters chose Trump\u2014and one of them was Ojeda himself. He\u2019s not on Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton\u2019s tally of veterans he has endorsed, and he\u2019s not on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d list, either. He\u2019s been a mostly limited fundraiser, too, in part because he takes no money from anybody except individual donors and labor unions. There is next to no standard reason to think Ojeda could win\u2014except for the visceral evidence that was swirling around us. The more than 5,000 teachers screaming his name. Ball looked at me and laughed.\n\nBy this time, we had lost him. When I spotted his skin-shorn flattop sticking out of the crowd, Ojeda was surrounded by a rapt half-moon of teachers. His eyes were wide, and he was jabbing the air with a finger. \u201cWe are on the next Saudi Arabia!\u201d he was hollering. \u201cThey\u2019ve said that\u2014the energy people said that! So, if we\u2019re on the next Saudi Arabia, obviously they want it to be just like Saudi Arabia, where you have about 10 people driving around in Lamborghinis and everybody else eatin\u2019 sand sandwiches! That\u2019s what they want. Guess what? No!\u201d He told them the people who give him money are regular folks. Labor unions. That\u2019s it. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Big Energy!\u201d he yelled. They erupted again in applause.\n\nOver the course of the next two days, the first two days of the West Virginia teachers\u2019 strike that remained unresolved as of Thursday, I saw signs that read: \u201cOVER WORKED UNDER PAID\u201d and \u201cTEACHERS ARE WORTH MORE.\u201d One just said, \u201cHelp Us Ojeda. You\u2019re our Only Hope!\u201d I heard people ask him to run for governor, so they could vote for him, too, even if they lived in the northern two-thirds of the state. I heard him described as a \u201crock star\u201d and a \u201cfolk hero.\u201d I even watched one teacher propose to him. Literally get down on one knee and ask him to marry her. It was the only time I saw him (a little) flustered and (very briefly) speechless. \u201cI\u2019m married!\u201d he finally blurted out. And everywhere I went with him, it was never too long before that chant started up again.\n\nAll of this has made Ojeda as confident about his prospects as Ball. \u201cI\u2019m going to blow through my primary,\u201d he matter-of-factly told me in his office. That\u2019s in May. And in the general election come November? His campaign manager is an over-the-road truck driver, his communications director is a single mother who lives in Mingo County with her parents and her 5-year-old son, and most of his unlikely, ragtag campaign staff isn\u2019t being paid\u2014and yet, fresh internal polling Ojeda shared with me shows he\u2019s not only projected to win the race, but he\u2019s beating his two likeliest GOP opponents among GOP voters. \u201cI\u2019m kicking the shit out of the Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nI first got interested in Ojeda late last year after I watched the launch video for his congressional campaign. It was unlike any campaign video I\u2019d ever seen. Shots of him toughing out pullups and bench press reps. A picture of his battered, bloodied head after he suffered facial fractures in a brass-knuckles attack at a campaign picnic before his primary in 2016\u2014an attack Ojeda believes was politically motivated. Anybody who\u2019s not out to help \u201cthe people,\u201d he says into the camera, somewhat menacingly, \u201cthey need not darken my doorstep.\u201d It was the creation, I would learn later, of a young man named J.D. Belcher, a former coal miner who taught himself filmmaking after taking a liking to The Walking Dead TV series and who used to be a member of a heavy metal band called Keep the Victim Warm. In the video, Ojeda also gave out the number to his cellphone. A few weeks ago, I called it.\n\nAfter I introduced myself, Ojeda uncorked a nearly unbroken, 13-minute tirade in which he called lobbyists \u201cthe absolute scum of the earth,\u201d said they should have to wear body cameras in the Capitol, said they shouldn\u2019t even be allowed \u201cin the damn Capitol,\u201d and told me one of the first things he did as a state legislator was give energy industry lobbyists a tongue-lashing. \u201cI threw Big Energy out of my office!\u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, is there anything we can do to change your mind?\u2019 I said, \u2018You can get yo\u2019 ass out of my office.\u2019\u201d He continued by scorching lawmakers for making decisions based on corporate campaign contributions instead of the interests of their constituents.\n\n\u201cBootlickers!\u201d he screamed into the phone.\n\nI asked when I could come visit him.\n\nHe picked me up at my hotel in Logan early in the morning on the first day of the strike. The back of his Jeep was covered with stickers. \u201cAFGHANISTAN I SERVED,\u201d said one. \u201cIRAQ I SERVED,\u201d said another. \u201cIT\u2019S NOT THAT I AND OTHERS ,\u201d said a third. \u201cBUT I WILL AND OTHERS WON\u2019T.\u201d\n\nAs we raced toward Charleston, Ojeda railing away about lobbyists and \u201cbought-and-paid-for politicians\u201d and Big Pharma and Big Energy while taking the curves in the four-lane highway so fast it felt at times like we were riding on just two wheels, it was hard not to consider his improbable path to this juncture.\n\nHis grandfather was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who came to this part of West Virginia because coal was booming and he could make a living. His father was a nurse. Ojeda graduated from Logan High in 1988. \u201cWhere I come from, when you graduate high school, there\u2019s only three choices\u2014dig coal, sell dope, or join the Army. And I chose the military.\u201d He served 24 years. He went to Korea and Honduras and Jordan and Haiti. Afghanistan. Iraq. He almost died five times, by his count, an IED blast, a couple of dud mortars, the Taliban. He earned two Bronze Stars and retired as Major Ojeda. \u201cI\u2019m a combat soldier,\u201d he told me. He wants his ashes spread on Sicily Drop Zone at North Carolina\u2019s Fort Bragg, the paratroopers\u2019 training facility, which he considers \u201challowed ground.\u201d\n\nToward the end of his time in the Army, he helped start a Junior ROTC program at an area high school and established a nonprofit organization called the Logan Empowerment Action and Development that did community cleanup projects and Christmas toy drives and served meals to the poor and the elderly and raised money for new shoes for kids. He began writing long letters to the editor to the Logan Banner. They always signed off the same way: \u201cSappers Clear The Way! Airborne All The Way!\u201d It all somehow led to an invite to the 2013 State of the Union as the guest of Manchin. The senator and his staff at the time were not expecting Ojeda to run for office. \u201cHe was just excited to take a Capitol tour,\u201d said Mara Boggs, Manchin\u2019s state director, who served with Ojeda in the Army. \u201cAll I saw was the passion,\u201d Manchin added. But after the speech that night, Ojeda heard Manchin talk about some \u201cmanufacturing hubs\u201d slated to come to West Virginia\u2014to the northern part of the state, though, not the southern part of the state that often feels even more overlooked and left behind. And he decided that was the fault of Nick Rahall, the Democrat who then represented the 3rd District. Rahall wasn\u2019t \u201cstanding on his desk,\u201d as Ojeda put it to me, doing his job. So he ran against him in a primary in 2014.\n\n\u201cI was unknown, and had no money, but I got 34 percent of the overall vote against Rahall,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cAnd I beat him like a drum in Logan County.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a thorn in our side,\u201d John Moffett told me. Moffett is the executive director of the People\u2019s House Project and an Ojeda booster now, but back then, he was a Rahall aide who developed a grudging respect for the novice challenger who got a third of the vote \u201cwith literally no campaign structure.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Ojeda ran for the state Senate and got attacked\u2014physically, brutally. The assailant, who had ties to Ojeda\u2019s opponent, later was sentenced to one to five years in prison\u2014bringing to a close the violent episode that elicited his first round of national news coverage, a trend that\u2019s continued. In 2016, though, even after the attack, Ojeda won, anyway, and then won in the general, and then went to Charleston, where he in no time was the lead sponsor of Senate Bill 386, Creating WV Medical Cannabis Act, which became law three months after he showed up at the Capitol and willed the legislation to the governor\u2019s desk. He saw it as a big win against Big Pharma.\n\nOjeda arrived in Charleston for his second legislative session, determined to take on the state\u2019s most powerful political force\u2014the energy companies that get rich off West Virginia\u2019s resources, he says, while leaving the state and the vast share of its people \u201cnone the better.\u201d A state with such wealth under the ground, he believes, shouldn\u2019t rank 48th out 50 states in teacher pay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not paying attention or speaking to the people that are on the ground and at the front lines of education,\u201d he warned last fall in an interview with the Huntington Herald-Dispatch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not listening to our teachers,\u201d he told his fellow senators in January.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting on a powder keg,\u201d he said.\n\nHis floor speeches got only so much reaction from many of his fellow legislators, but the teachers certainly were listening.\n\n\u201cThe spark that lit the match,\u201d Ball said.\n\nNow, pulling into Charleston, the gold dome shrouded in fog, hitting traffic, looking down from the interstate at a usually mostly empty parking lot filled with cars packed with sign-toting teachers, he dipped down onto surface streets, and the teachers saw his red Jeep and started waving and screaming, and he honked and pumped his fast before swinging into the Senate parking area.\n\n\u201cHooah,\u201d he said to the guard at the guard shack and then whipped into a reserved spot.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the sign that said ninja on it? Pay attention,\u201d he told me.\n\n\n\nOjeda is a new face in an old battle.\n\nThe fights of the future, same as the fights of the past, John Alexander Williams wrote in 1976 in West Virginia: A History, \u201care likely to pit weak and poorly organized coalitions of local reformers and interest groups against powerful and well-disciplined combinations of absentee owners and middlemen. If the past is any guide, there will always be plenty of middlemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of our workplaces are breeding growing dissatisfaction and insecurity,\u201d Robert Shogan wrote in 2004 in The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America\u2019s Largest Labor Uprising, \u201cour economy is producing increasing inequality and the labor laws put into place in the 1930s to prevent recurrences of what happened in Mingo County and many other places are no longer working very well to protect workers. There are no signs of bandana armies forming, of course \u2026\u201d\n\nFight? \u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d Ojeda said to a gaggle of teachers in his office when I was with him.\n\nWhen he was little, Ojeda was scrawny, but he could use his fists. \u201cIf I thought you was gonna try to come bully me,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was gonna get you.\u201d In Iraq, he built a boxing ring in a gravel pit. \u201cAnd we beat the shit out of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would come back from a mission, and we would fight.\u201d\n\nHis office at the Capitol, from what I could see, has two small pictures of a single politician\u2014John F. Kennedy, taped to the front of his desktop computer. On his desk, too, is \u201cA Coal Miner\u2019s Prayer.\u201d But almost all the other pieces of the d\u00e9cor, if that\u2019s even the right term, are Army flags, Army plaques, Army certificates, Army paraphernalia, the boots and fatigues of fallen friends. Now, he told the teachers that kept coming in, \u201cI fight like a daggone wild man for labor unions.\u201d And anybody who doesn\u2019t? \u201cI will make their life a living hell.\u201d\n\nThe state legislative session ends March 10. Already for the better part of a year, Ojeda has been hosting regular and energetic Facebook Live sessions and out and about campaigning\u2014clad in his typical garb of combat boots, Ripstop tactical pants and Grunt Style shirts. His bid to come to Washington is about to shift to full-fledged. His strategy? \u201cBoots on the ground, my man,\u201d he said. \u201cBoots on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have a very, very good shot of winning,\u201d David Graham, the truck driver who\u2019s the campaign manager, told me. He cited the recent internal polling that has Ojeda beating potential Republican opponent Conrad Lucas with Republican voters 24.3 percent to 23 percent (with 52.8 percent uncertain) and beating other potential Republican opponent Rupie Phillips with Republican voters 27.1 percent to 16.5 percent (with 56.4 percent uncertain). The overall numbers including all voters aren\u2019t even close. Ojeda\u2019s top foe in the primary, Huntington mayor Steve Williams, much more a Manchin-style Democrat and better-funded, dropped out of the race in January, saying it wasn\u2019t right to run for higher office given the severity of the drug problem in his city. Supporters of Ojeda wonder if the energy around their candidate had something to do with it, too. When I asked Manchin about Ojeda, his answer was brief. \u201cRich is a populist,\u201d Manchin told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a people\u2019s person\u201d\u2014as restrained an assessment of Ojeda as I\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cIf the election was tomorrow, he\u2019d win in a landslide,\u201d said Belcher, the miner turned videographer. \u201cHe\u2019s got the working class with him. If you\u2019ve got the working class in West Virginia, you\u2019re set.\u201d\n\nThe implications are compelling. \u201cIf Ojeda wins,\u201d said Moffett from People\u2019s House, \u201cit changes the entire conversation about how we run candidates, what type of candidates we run, and where.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s JFK with tattoos and a bench press,\u201d Randy Jones, his 25-year-old volunteer finance director from Huntington, told me.\n\n\u201cSomeone who sounds like you, talks like you, looks like you, struggled like you\u2014who\u2019s standing up and speaking truth to power,\u201d added Dennis White, 34, an Army veteran from West Virginia\u2019s Boone County who\u2019s a student at Connecticut\u2019s Wesleyan University and a remote-working jack-of-all-trades aide to Ojeda.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s a lesson for everybody, that these are the kinds of candidates that we need to recruit,\u201d Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan told me. Ryan plans on coming to West Virginia later this month or in early April to campaign with Ojeda. An Ojeda victory in November, he said, \u201ccould be a signal to the Republican Party that Democrats\u2014we\u2019re coming to your territory, we\u2019re not going to play this coastal game anymore. If we get candidates like him and have a strong economic message, there\u2019s not a state we can\u2019t win in.\u201d\n\nIn the red Jeep on the way back to Logan, I asked Ojeda about his vote for Trump, a fact that in another state could be seen as disqualifying for a Democrat.\n\n\u201cI voted for him because it was about family and friends,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else was saying anything. Hillary Clinton was coming here blowing smoke up everybody\u2019s ass. Hell, I wanted Bernie Sanders\u201d\u2014and he wasn\u2019t the only one, obviously, as Sanders beat Clinton in the primaries in all 55 counties\u2014\u201cbut once Bernie Sanders was screwed over by Hillary Clinton, by the way, you had no other option.\u201d\n\nHe regrets his vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cBecause he hasn\u2019t done shit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a friggin\u2019 circus for a solid year.\u201d Nothing\u2019s changed. So many people in southern West Virginia are still poor and need jobs. The opioid epidemic rages unabated. \u201cAll he\u2019s done,\u201d Ojeda said, \u201cis shown that he\u2019s taking care of the daggone people he\u2019s supposed to be getting rid of.\u201d\n\nAnd I asked him about 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kicking ass right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are winning this race. And we\u2019re winning it by a large margin. We did a scientific poll! And, oh, by the way, you show me one of my opponents that can walk anyplace right now and have 500 people screaming their name. And guess what? It\u2019s not just happening at the Capitol. This has been going on now for the last month. Everywhere I\u2019ve been going for the last month has always had between 250 and 500 people. And when I get there, I\u2019m the one they want to see. We\u2019re kicking ass. The polls? Kickin\u2019 ass!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not polished. I\u2019m sorry, but if you want a daggone, typical polished politician, vote for Conrad Lucas. But people are tired of that bullshit. People are tired of the same ol\u2019 garbage. They want people that are willing to speak out, speak up, be open and honest with them.\u201d\n\nKind of like \u2026 you know who.\n\n\u201cYou know, hey, here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ojeda told me. \u201cDonald Trump, Donald Trump, made everybody excited because he said shit nobody else has ever said. But the difference is, Donald Trump wins, and he ain\u2019t done jackshit to help us. Now let me tell you something about Ojeda.

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Gowdy urged the president to give Mueller the space and resources to finish his probe unimpeded, but he noted that the Senate has more leverage over Trump on this issue because it has a say in his senior administration appointments.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Trump had for months laid off Mueller, who is probing any criminal activity connected to Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 and whether any Trump associates aided the foreign plot. Though he\u2019s attacked senior leaders of the FBI and Justice Department for drawing out a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him, Trump has kept his criticism of Mueller\u2019s probe to a minimum, adopting a legal strategy that a public posture of cooperation with Mueller is the right course.\n\nBut that strategy shifted abruptly in the last few days, following news that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump organization for records. This weekend, Trump has tweeted that Mueller\u2019s investigation is unnecessary and is being run by \u201chardened Democrats.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said any decision by Trump to remove Mueller \u201cwould be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Mueller] is following the evidence where it takes him and I think it\u2019s very important he be allowed to do his job without interference,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd there are many Republicans who share my view.\u201d\n\nBut bipartisan legislation intended to block a unilateral move by Trump to remove Mueller has stalled in Congress for months, as Republicans and Democrats have worked to combine competing proposals, and even the sponsors of the legislation have described limited urgency to act. Until this weekend, they pointed to Trump\u2019s deference to Mueller and expressed confidence he wouldn\u2019t go after the veteran prosecutor.\n\nThat changed Saturday when Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called for Mueller to be shut down, arguing that it was contrived by former FBI Director James Comey and based on a dossier provided to the bureau by former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\n\u201cI pray that acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,\u201d Dowd said.\n\n(The FBI\u2019s investigation began several months before the bureau received Steele\u2019s dossier, according to Republican and Democratic House Intelligence Committee memos drawn from previously classified FBI documents.)\n\nTrump followed Dowd\u2019s comments with multiple attacks on Mueller\u2019s probe as well.\n\n\u201c[D]oes anyone think this is fair?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAnd yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nA decision by Trump to fire Mueller could be complex. Technically, the decision falls to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's probe and he's repeatedly expressed confidence in Mueller. Only Rosenstein has the authority to end it, but Trump has the authority to remove Rosenstein in order to install a more pliant official willing to carry out the order, a move that Trump's detractors fear could come without warning. \n\nYet if the new tone toward Mueller is going to motivate Republican lawmakers\u2019 to protect the investigation, there were few indications over the weekend. Leaders of the committees charged with overseeing the Justice Department offered no immediate response to Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nOn behalf of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), AshLee Strong merely said: : \u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\u201d\n\nTheir limited responses came despite renewed Democratic pleas for a bipartisan pledge to undo any actions Trump may take against Mueller.\n\n\u201cI would hope that that would be the result that we would affirm our system of checks and balances and appoint an independent counsel,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a statement.\n\nBut rather than endorse a specific response, several Republican lawmakers with a history of challenging Trump on Russia-related matters fanned out across the Sunday national news shows and pleaded broadly with Trump to back off Mueller.\n\n\u201cI mean, talking to my colleagues all along, it was, you know, once he goes after Mueller, then we will take action,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI think that people see that as a massive red line that can't be crossed. So, I hope that that's the case. And I would just hope that enough people would prevail on the president now: \u2018Don't go there.\u2018\u201d\n\nIn his tirades against the investigations, Trump has latched onto a recent finding by House Intelligence Committee Republicans that they found no evidence that Trump\u2019s campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the election.\n\n\u201cAs the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign,\u201d he tweeted Saturday.\n\nBut two prominent members of the committee contradicted this assessment Sunday, noting that some of the central figures in the investigation have been off-limits to the committee because they\u2019re entangled in Mueller\u2019s probe. Those witnesses include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his deputy Rick Gates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with a Russian-linked professor helped launch the FBI\u2019s initial Russia probe.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGowdy emphasized that the panel\u2019s conclusion was only limited to the 70-plus witnesses they were able to reach. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\" he said.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who ran the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, emphasized that the committee didn\u2019t conclude there was no collusion.\n\n\"What we said is that we found no evidence of it,\u201d he clarified. \u201cThat's a different statement.\"\n\nOthers pleaded with the president to recognize that Mueller\u2019s probe goes beyond questions about collusion and to the heart of Russia\u2019s larger, widely accepted plot to influence the election.\n\n\u201cIt is not a collusion probe. It is much broader than that,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \u201cNow, obviously, once you open that up and you start looking you can go in one direction or another. You go where the evidence takes you and that's what I support.\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

He said he had more than 2,000 pages of the 2,200-page bill left to get through before he\u2019ll decide how to proceed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on page 56 right now, and so I\u2019ve got a few more pages to read. I don\u2019t have any other comment,\u201d Paul said.\n\nUnder Senate rules, all 100 senators must agree to hold a vote before the Friday night shutdown deadline. But as of now, they don\u2019t have it. The House cleared the massive spending measure on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of if he delays the vote. It doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, said of Paul. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows and I don\u2019t think his staff knows \u2026 it\u2019s his right and his prerogative if he wants to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s fine to make a statement,\u201d said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who dislikes the spending increases in the bill but is eager to vote on it. \u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to waiting at this point. We should go ahead and get it done.\u201d\n\nThe will-he-or-won\u2019t-he cause a momentary shutdown is a familiar play from Paul. He loves using Senate rules to draw attention to his causes \u2014 even if it means agitating the people he goes to work with every day. \n\nHe has filibustered nominees, briefly caused a surveillance program to lapse and, in February, refused to give GOP leaders consent to vote on a funding bill before the funding deadline. The latter protest, against a bipartisan spending deal that dramatically increased spending, caused a government shutdown for several hours. \n\nHe's also irked GOP leaders by opposing President Donald Trump's nominees to lead the State Department and CIA this spring. That stand could allow Democrats to block the president\u2019s picks.\n\nBeyond simply annoying other senators, another protest by Paul could disrupt trips some of them who are planning to take overseas as part of congressional delegations. There are multiple so-called \u201cCODELs\u201c scheduled to leave on Thursday night, and they are making contingency plans now in case Paul forces the Senate to stay in on Friday, according to a Republican senator. \n\n\u201cI would hope that he can vote against what he doesn\u2019t like. That\u2019s what I do,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the soon-to-be Appropriations Committee chairman. \u201cI\u2019m sure he sees a purpose, an outlier, a protest. But there are a lot of ways to manifest that.\u201d\n\nThere was no concerted effort at the Republican lunch Thursday to persuade Paul to back down, attendees said. Instead GOP senators concentrated on paying tribute to retiring Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).\n\nSome Republicans hope reporters can shame Paul into giving in. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving that to y\u2019all,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters. \u201cWhatever rights he has, he will decide what\u2019s the best use of them. I know how the movie ends. No matter what he does we\u2019re going to pass this bill and the military is going to get a pay raise.\u201d\n\nSome senators believe that Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) also must be convinced to allow a quick vote. Kennedy is among a bloc of conservatives who loathe the closed process used to write the bill in leaders\u2019 offices, as well as the increase in spending that will increase the deficit.\n\nBut in an interview, he sounded less dug-in than Paul.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably not,\u201d Kennedy said, when asked whether he will hold up the bill. \u201cThey probably have the votes [to pass it]. But I can tell you this: This is the best effort of Congress to borrow and spend us into prosperity. And I\u2019m not going to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nGOP leaders are hoping that the looming recess \u2014 and certainty that the bill will pass, it\u2019s just a matter of when \u2014 will be enough to get Paul not to gum up the works again.\n\n\u201cThere are some unhappy folks, understandably. And they should be, the way this stuff gets done,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut in the end you realize we\u2019ve got to fund the government and it\u2019s kind of an inevitability.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Conservatives have slammed him as tainted with bias. And on Friday night, the Department of Justice fired Andrew McCabe a little more than 24 hours before his scheduled retirement.\n\nThe dismissal from his decades-long home at the department marks an ignominious end to a once-storied career for McCabe, who stepped aside as FBI deputy director in January. That departure came ahead of an inspector general\u2019s inquiry that\u2019s expected to criticize his handling of an October 2016 media report on his wife\u2019s failed run for the Virginia State Senate and his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n But McCabe sees bigger forces at work in the Justice Department inspector general\u2019s inquiry \u2014 which he views as part of a broader campaign to impugn him for his role in handling the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation and his ties to special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s personally devastating. It\u2019s so tough on my family,\u201d he told POLITICO during a wide-ranging interview conducted earlier this month, before his firing.\n\n\u201cBut at some point, this has to be seen in the larger context,\u201d said McCabe, 49, who says he has voted for every Republican presidential nominee until he sat out the 2016 contest entirely. \u201cAnd I firmly believe that this is an ongoing effort to undermine my credibility because of the work that I did on the Russia case, because of the investigations that I oversaw and impacted that target this administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have every reason to believe that I could end up being a significant witness in whatever the special counsel comes up with, and so they are trying to create this counter-narrative that I am not someone who can be believed or trusted,\u201d McCabe added. \u201cAnd as someone who has been believed and trusted by really good people for 21 years, it\u2019s just infuriating to me.\u201d\n\nWhile McCabe has been accused of a lack of candor during the inspector general\u2019s review, it is still unclear exactly what led the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility to recommended his firing.\n\nDuring an hourlong conversation, McCabe declined to comment or elaborate on the accusations against him. He also declined to allege any direct undue influence by President Donald Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the investigation into Russian electoral meddling, which is now helmed by Mueller. But he recalled making what he described as significant moves to bolster the investigation during the tumultuous six weeks between Sessions\u2019 recusal and the May 2017 appointment of Mueller, a former FBI chief who helped McCabe rise through the Justice Department ranks.\n\nMcCabe said that when he was tapped as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey on May 9, 2017, he also learned that \u201cI might not be in the position for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally walked into the building every day expecting that I would be removed from my position before the end of the day,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if that happened, I didn\u2019t want anyone to be able to just walk away from the work that we had done\u201d on the Russia investigation.\n\nOne step McCabe said he took then: pressing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for a special counsel. Another step: briefing congressional leaders in both parties, who get highly classified briefings as the so-called Gang of Eight, about what he was doing.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general was already conducting a sweeping inquiry into the FBI\u2019s decision-making process in closing its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, then disclosing the discovery of new Clinton emails in a message to Congress in late October 2016.\n\nThat inquiry includes a deeper look at the propriety of McCabe\u2019s pre-election actions, and is the biggest of several unanswered questions raised by critics who say his bias should have disqualified him from playing such a central role in politically volatile investigations. In addition to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, McCabe faces an Office of Special Counsel review into whether he violated a law prohibiting government officials from engaging in campaign activity.\n\nAmong the issues under the inspector general\u2019s purview was whether McCabe himself \u201cshould have been recused from participating in certain matters.\u201d Fuel for that political conflagration, which ultimately snuffed out McCabe\u2019s career and now threatens his full pension, stems from Wall Street Journal reports in October 2016 that raised questions about $467,500 in contributions that his wife\u2019s state Senate campaign received in 2015 from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally.\n\nRepublicans have cited the six-figure donation as proof of a pro-Clinton bias by McCabe and the FBI more broadly. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for one state Senate seat,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said last year during an FBI oversight hearing, warning that \u201ca cloud of doubt hangs over the FBI\u2019s objectivity.\u201d\n\nBut McCabe\u2019s most powerful foe may reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d the president tweeted in December. (Trump\u2019s $700,000 number rounds up after adding more than $200,000 that Jill McCabe received from Virginia\u2019s state Democratic Party.)\n\nSome in the GOP got more alarmed when McCabe showed up in politically charged text messages between FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok and bureau attorney Lisa Page, who began a romantic affair before the election and while both were working on issues that included the Russia and Clinton investigations. Mueller later fired Strzok from his team after learning of the texts and another Justice Department inspector general inquiry into them.\n\nIn one text message to Page, Strzok says that \u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s office \u2014 that there\u2019s no way [Trump] gets elected \u2014 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was among those seeing further proof of McCabe\u2019s entanglement in pro-Clinton bias. \n\n\u201cThat sounds very worrisome to the American people that high-ranking FBI agents were actually conspiring to try to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president,\u201d Paul told MSNBC in January.\n\nBut when it came to his wife\u2019s campaign, McCabe went into painstaking detail trying to dispel the notion of impropriety that Trump has burnished into Washington\u2019s consciousness.\n\nJill McCabe had voted for Republicans and Democrats, as her husband tells it, before getting approached about a state Senate bid after giving a quote to The Washington Post for a story about McAuliffe\u2019s tour of the pediatric emergency room she helped run. McCabe told a Post reporter that day in 2014 that the Democratic governor\u2019s pitch to expand Medicaid under Obamacare \u201chas to be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nAfter his wife decided to run, according to McCabe, he \u201cimmediately got counsel from my attorneys, ethics professionals at the bureau,\u201d to determine how to construct a firewall between his FBI work and her campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife has never met Hillary Clinton. Neither of us have ever met any Clinton, for that matter. She was supported by the governor of our state, who happened to be the leader of the Democratic Party in that state.\u201d\n\nBut when a Wall Street Journal reporter called in late October 2016 \u2014 nearly a year after Jill McCabe\u2019s election loss \u2014 to ask about the propriety of his supervising the Clinton email investigation given his wife\u2019s campaign donations, the deputy director authorized the FBI\u2019s then-chief public affairs official to engage with the reporter.\n\nSuch a practice, empowering the sharing of background information that can\u2019t be directly cited, is relatively routine at federal agencies when reporters dig into complex stories. McCabe said he was \u201cone of only three people in the FBI\u201d empowered to approve the sharing of information with the press.\n\nWhen the reporter called the FBI again, asking about allegations circulating around the bureau that McCabe had bowed to Justice Department pressure to wind down a probe of the Clinton Foundation, McCabe said he again authorized the disclosure of more details in order to reorient the story in what he believed was a more accurate direction.\n\nThe prospect that the Journal reporter \u201cwould put this incorrect narrative into his story, I thought, would be very damaging,\u201d McCabe said. He acknowledged the obvious \u2014 \u201cIt would be damaging to me personally\u201d \u2014 adding that \u201cthe more important factor is that it would be damaging to the FBI.\u201d\n\nThat decision to share information about an open investigation, and McCabe\u2019s later handling of inspector general inquiries concerning his actions, forms the bulk of the critical report that propelled his firing on Friday. McCabe had long planned to retire on his 50th birthday, which is Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always imagined this was the point where I could kind of go out proud of things I\u2019ve done and the sacrifices I\u2019ve made and ways I\u2019ve tried to protect this country,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cTo think that my reputation has now been, or will be, eroded by this \u2014 it\u2019s just, it\u2019s mind-boggling. It\u2019s been devastating.\u201d\n\nWhat he wonders about now is the chain of events that began after he testified behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee on Dec. 19. \u201cWithin hours,\u201d as McCabe put it, leaks to the press revealed that he had told lawmakers he could corroborate Comey\u2019s recounting of conversations with Trump before the president fired his FBI director.\n\nAnd soon after that, as McCabe tells it, he heard that the Justice Department inspector general would expedite the portion of its long-planned report on the Clinton investigation that related to him. \u201cFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits,\u201d Trump tweeted on Dec. 23. \u201c90 days to go?!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone from the White House or within the Department influenced the IG,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a striking coincidence. One that can\u2019t be seen outside the context of the president\u2019s own public communications.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report has yet to be released, but McCabe was feeling its black mark on his future even before his firing. When it finally does come out, he predicted, it will attempt to bolster the claim by Trump allies that previous FBI leadership \u201cwas corrupt, was politically biased, politically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201c[For] some people, like the president and others who are intent on undermining me for the reasons I\u2019ve stated, it will be very satisfying,\u201d McCabe said.\n\n\u201cI think most people will be like, \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

The secretary of defense walked the president through the complex fabric of trade deals, military agreements and international alliances that make up the global system the victors established after World War II, touching off what one attendee described as a \u201cfood fight\u201d and a \u201cfree for all\u201d with the president and the rest of the group. Trump punctuated the session by loudly telling his secretaries of state and defense, at several points during the meeting, \u201cI don\u2019t agree!\u201d The meeting culminated with Tillerson, his now ousted secretary of state, fatefully complaining after the president left the room, that Trump was \u201ca fucking moron.\u201d\n\nTrump is said to divide the members of his Cabinet into first-tier \u201ckillers\u201d and second-tier \u201cwinners.\u201d Mattis is indisputably a killer, but he\u2019s also something rarer: a sometime loser \u2014 of policy arguments, that is \u2014 who manages to disagree with the president without squandering his clout or getting under Trump\u2019s skin. He opposed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord, decertify the Iran deal, slap tariffs on steel and aluminum, and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He opposes the president\u2019s proposed ban on transgender service members and has reportedly ignored requests from the White House to see plans for a military strike against North Korea.\n\nYet Mattis has been able to present the president with views he doesn\u2019t like without bearing the brunt of his frustration. The departure of H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, was announced Thursday amid rumors that the president is poised to fire beleaguered Cabinet secretaries like David Shulkin of Veterans Affairs and Ben Carson of Housing and Urban Development, and is agonizing over whether to dismiss John Kelly, his chief of staff. Mattis\u2019 name has been conspicuously absent. One senior administration official called him \u201cbulletproof.\u201d\n\nOf the Cabinet selections and staff picks cheered by Trump critics, including McMaster, Kelly and former chairman of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, Mattis is the only one who seems to still have job security. Trump remains as enthused about Mattis, one of his first Cabinet picks, as he was when he tapped him for the job in December 2016, according to several White House aides.\n\nEven his detractors on the right are reluctant to criticize Mattis, a retired Marine general who fought in both Gulf wars and Afghanistan, on the record, either because they are looking to join the administration or because, despite their disagreements, they are happy he\u2019s there. Those critics say privately that Mattis is too cautious and conventional in his thinking, and that he doesn\u2019t sufficiently appreciate the political nature of his current job. But \u201cthey regard him as better than the likely alternatives,\u201d one such critic told me, and consider him \u201ca restraining hand on an otherwise unpredictable and impulsive president.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president sense that on a subset of important issues, he will defer to Mattis, who represents an institution, the military, that the president venerates, and whose status as a combat veteran has earned him Trump\u2019s respect. In contrast with, say, Cohn, who had to contend with the fact that Trump considers himself a business expert, Mattis benefits from serving a president who has never claimed to understand the military or international affairs. White House aides say Trump is cowed and intimidated by Mattis, who peppers his comments with aphorisms and historical arcana gleaned from his extraordinary personal library.\n\nJohn Bolton\u2019s arrival in April as the president's new national security adviser will give Mattis a more ardent and skillful adversary at the National Security Council. Mattis outranked McMaster in military terms and always considered him his junior, even though Mattis is retired. He likely won\u2019t view Bolton that way, and Bolton prizes his ability to corral the bureaucracy for his purposes.\n\nMattis, who was pushed out of the military by President Barack Obama because of his hawkish views on Iran, also sees eye to eye with Trump on plenty of policy matters, chief among them the importance of rebuilding the military. So the secretary of defense has, for example, stayed quiet about the president\u2019s request for a costly military parade, tentatively set for November, but has secured a 10 percent budget increase for the Pentagon. Both White House and Pentagon aides say Mattis has also been more discreet than some of his colleagues when he disagrees with the president, never undermining him publicly except in congressional testimony. \u201cHe makes his recommendations, gives his advice, and it\u2019s up to the president to decide,\u201d says Dana White, Mattis\u2019 Pentagon spokeswoman.\n\nThe president goes gaga for the sort of tough talk Mattis dished out on the battlefield. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than getting shot at and missed,\u201d Mattis has said. He doesn\u2019t run the Pentagon like \u201cMad Dog\u201d the Marine, but White House aides say he has endeared himself to President Trump by continuing to play the part in front of him \u2014 never showing weakness and maintaining the aura of invincibility with which he entered the job.\n\n\u201cMattis has figured out how to play Trump perfectly. He keeps his head down and keeps his face out of the news,\u201d says Tom Ricks, a columnist for the military news site Task & Purpose and the author of several books on military affairs. Mattis, said Ricks, is a \u201cnatural-born killer,\u201d and \u201cTrump, just like dogs smell fear, I think somebody like Trump who has very little natural courage, just smells it.\u201d\n\nMattis has told friends he doesn\u2019t like the nickname he acquired as a battlefield commander, but the fact that he rose to prominence as \u201cMad Dog\u201d made him a subject of immediate fascination for a president-elect whose concept of military valor was shaped largely by the movie \u201cPatton.\u201d (Some might say Mattis bears a passing resemblance to a younger George C. Scott, who played the hard-charging Gen. George Patton in the 1970 film, a Trump favorite.)\n\n\u201cThe secretary of defense is not simply \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis the Marine; he\u2019s really a thoughtful guy,\u201d says Mark Perry, the author of \u201cThe Pentagon\u2019s Wars.\u201d Perry says Mattis possesses a chameleon-like quality that allows him to be the Platonic ideal of a warrior at one turn, and a monkish scholar at another.\n\nAppearing on Face the Nation last May, Mattis played the warrior when CBS News\u2019 John Dickerson asked him, \u201cWhat keeps you awake at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mattis told him. \u201cI keep other people awake at night.\u201d The response delighted the president, who told several White House aides how much he liked it. In private, Mattis talks with the president the same way. \u201cHe\u2019s said similar things several times,\u201d said a former White House aide. \u201cTrump loves it.\u201d\n\nMattis channeled the same sentiment when he was asked, in early February, whether he had any misgivings about the president\u2019s plans for a military parade. \u201cI\u2019m not paid for my feelings,\u201d he replied. \u201cI save those for my girlfriend.\u201d\n\nThe president talks about Mattis in public and behind closed doors like he is still a battlefield commander. Trump asked top-dollar Republican donors last September, for example, what they thought of Mattis and bragged, \u201cThe guy never loses a battle, never loses. Winning record.\u201d\n\nThe irony of all of this is that, by all accounts, Mattis is deeply committed to protecting the military from politics. Some describe him as a conservative Democrat, but he has taken great care to keep his political views private and has been open about his belief that national security should be a bipartisan matter. That said, he has clashed behind the scenes not only with the president but also with some of his closest advisers, from McMaster and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley to Jared Kushner and, before them, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and McMaster predecessor Michael Flynn.\n\nMattis worked from the outset to make diplomatic overtures to presidential aides, including Bannon and Kushner, but also Cohn, Flynn and Flynn\u2019s deputy, K.T. McFarland, all of who could have thwarted his personnel preferences and policy preferences. Mattis\u2019 senior adviser, Sally Donnelly, who left the Pentagon last month, led these diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe work began immediately, on December 7, on the plane to North Carolina, when Mattis formally accepted the president\u2019s nomination as secretary of defense. On the plane ride to the event, Mattis and Donnelly joined the president-elect \u2014 along with Bannon, Kushner, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 and they began a discussion about how Mattis would staff the Pentagon.\n\nDonnelly\u2019s first request was that they be allowed to retain a handful of senior Obama administration officials at the Pentagon, including Bob Work, the Defense Department\u2019s No. 2. The White House acceded. Mattis personally spoke with Bannon about his desire to bring on Michele Flournoy, who was the leading candidate to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s secretary of defense, as his deputy to replace Work \u2014 a move that raised hackles among conservatives both in and out of government. Although Flournoy ultimately withdrew herself from consideration, it was not because of White House objections to her nomination. Likewise, Mattis\u2019 pick to run the Pentagon\u2019s policy shop, retired diplomat Anne Patterson, was pulled from consideration not over White House objections, but because Republicans on Capitol Hill threatened to veto her nomination.\n\n\u201cOn all of the appointments, they were fully open in coming to me and saying, \u2018Hey, these are the guys we think are the best team,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Fine,\u2019\u201d Bannon says. \u201cAnd Trump told me, \u2018Get the general the guys he thinks are the best team.\u2019 They played totally straight with that.\u201d\n\nVisiting Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the second weekend after he was elected, Mattis and the president-elect discussed how to conduct a war against ISIS, which Mattis made clear would \u201cnot be a war of attrition, it\u2019s going to be a war of annihilation,\u201d according to a source familiar with the discussion. \u201cTrump couldn\u2019t get enough of it,\u201d this person says.\n\nAt the same time, Mattis told Trump he disagreed with his views on torture \u2014 Trump had said he was strongly in favor of it \u2014 and, by the time the meeting ended, he seemed to have chastened the soon-to-be commander in chief.\n\n\u201c\u2018He said, \u2018I've never found it to be useful,\u2019\u201d Trump recounted after the meeting. He went on to say that Mattis told him he found it more useful to build trust with terror suspects. \u201cI was very impressed by that answer,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe goodwill Mattis engendered with the White House has given him freedom not only to disagree with the president when he sees fit, but also to run the Pentagon without political interference from the White House \u2014 much to the chagrin, at times, of the National Security Council and others close to the president.\n\nThe Trump administration and the president himself say they are decentralizing what was, in the Obama era, a defense policy run largely out of the West Wing. The president and his advisers have worked to devolve decision-making to Mattis and the combatant commanders who report to him. They have left the American military\u2019s war against ISIS, for example, largely in his hands. After making the decision to strike Syria in April 2017, Trump delegated to Mattis how and when carry out the strikes.\n\nWhen the White House does make requests, national security aides express frustration that their demands often go unanswered. According to two National Security Council officials, Mattis has ignored McMaster\u2019s requests for military options that would have allowed the U.S. to strike Eastern Gouta, in Syria, as well as requests to see plans on North Korea, and two requests for options to strike Iran\u2014one in response to a scenario in which the country sank an American ship in the Persian Gulf, another to the possibility that Iranian-funded Houthi missiles coming out of Yemen could strike the Riyadh airport in Saudi Arabia or the Saudi Aramco oil refinery.\n\n\u201cMattis and Tillerson routinely ignored NSC requests on all sorts of things,\u201d says a second former White House official.\n\nThe Pentagon denies that Mattis has slow-walked any requests for military options. \u201cSecretary Mattis is committed to ensuring our diplomats always operate from a position of strength and options equal strength,\u201d White says.\n\nWhatever tough talk Mattis dispenses to the president is measured and intentional. People close to him say he spends a lot of time thinking about how to communicate effectively, that he is always aware of his audience and that he often asks aides for a pithy quote to drive home a point. Friends and former colleagues say he was well aware of the position in which he entered the administration, uniquely admired by the news media. In contrast with his close friend and White House colleague John Kelly, he has been careful not to tarnish his reputation with inaccurate or ill-advised comments to the news media. He has steered clear of high-profile interviews and avoided making the sorts of off-the-record remarks that have, in some cases, cost his colleagues their jobs.\n\nAccording to a former senior White House official, the president once complained to Tillerson about his news coverage, asking him, \u201cHow come you only get bad stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cMattis only gets good stories,\u201d the former White House official says. \u201cThe progressive media loves him, and it\u2019s one of the reasons Trump loves him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a skill Mattis learned partly from watching his former colleague, then-Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, lose his job eight years ago after mocking President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in what he thought were off-the-record remarks to a Rolling Stone reporter. Before that, Mattis had his own unpleasant collision with the news media when he told a group of Marines at a 2005 event that it was, at times, \u201ca hell of a lot of fun\u201d to shoot people. Unbeknownst to him, cameras were rolling.\n\n\u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cYou know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\u201d The February 4, 2005, broadcast of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show led with the video, with Katie Couric declaring: \u201cFighting words. A decorated Marine Corps general raises eyebrows with these comments.\u201d\n\nThe Marine Corps brass at the time dismissed calls for Mattis\u2019 firing, and Mattis never formally apologized for the comment. But friends say the furor his remarks occasioned was enough to prompt some private reflection. For a Marine who likes to trade barbs, he learned that civilians have different sensitivities and that the news media will play up statements that have been made in jest. He began to choose his words more carefully.\n\nIn the Trump administration, where the president judges his Cabinet officials in large part based on the coverage they generate on television, Mattis has navigated the news media more deftly. He has appeared on just one Sunday morning news show during his time in office and rarely appears behind the lectern at the Pentagon. He seems to take pains never to overshadow the president.\n\nThose close to him dismiss the idea that Mattis has undertaken any sort of conscious strategy to enchant the president. Rather, they say, he is not a politician and simply isn\u2019t interested in publicity \u2014 something, they note, that is hard for many Washingtonians to understand. He has fended off White House requests that he appear on Fox News, and his friends say that\u2019s not out of a concern for self-preservation but because he\u2019s just not interested in being on TV.\n\n\u201cSecretary Mattis doesn't change who he is for anyone, but he is a battle-hardened Marine, who can talk about Thucydides and Chesty Puller in the same breath,\u201d White says.\n\nReporters travel with Mattis as he jets from one foreign capital to another \u2014 Tillerson generated a slew of negative headlines for abandoning this tradition at State \u2014 but he is pointed in his refusal to answer questions that he considers \u201cout of his lane.\u201d That includes the events leading up to a potential meeting between the president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, about which Mattis told reporters, \u201cWhat I want you to understand is that right now every word is going to be nuanced and parsed apart across different cultures, at different times of the day, in different contexts, and right now I want a very straight line from those actually responsible, not from those of us in a supporting or background role.\u201d\n\nMcMaster, in contrast, said last month in Munich that the evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was \u201cincontrovertible,\u201d prompting Trump to slap him down on Twitter.\n\nRunning Central Command under Obama, Mattis learned that presidents are particularly sensitive to what military leaders say about them. If watching McChrystal defenestrated didn\u2019t drive that home, his own experience did when, in 2013, he was ousted by the president for what the White House perceived as his outspoken hostility to the administration\u2019s diplomatic overtures to Iran. Mattis\u2019 frank remarks cost him access and, ultimately, his job.\n\n\u201cHe was shut out of certain discussions at certain points,\u201d a former senior military commander said of Mattis\u2019 experience in the Obama administration. \u201cThey sort of knew what they wanted to do, and they didn\u2019t want to hear what they didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d The commander added, \u201cThey told him, \u2018Thank you, we\u2019ve heard your views on Iran, now go sit under a tree.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was useful preparation for his current role, working for a notoriously sensitive and temperamental commander in chief who has discarded advisers, including Tillerson, for disparaging him privately. Trump never forgave Tillerson for the NBC News report that the former secretary of state called him a moron.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t ever hear Mattis quoted off the record saying Trump is dumb or an idiot \u2014 he\u2019s careful,\u201d said Perry, the military historian.\n\nHis survival in the administration may depend on it.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Elana Schor", "body": "The sanctions call for the Trump administration to produce a list of oligarchs linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a report on the consequences of sanctioning Russia's sovereign debt. | Alexander Nemenov/Getty Images \n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now\n                        \n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n        \n            By ELANA SCHOR\n    01/29/2018 08:26 PM EST\n                    \n\n        \nThe Trump administration informed lawmakers Monday that new Russia sanctions called for in a bipartisan bill passed last year are not necessary yet because the measure is already \"serving as a deterrent.\" \nThe announcement came as lawmakers in both parties nudged the administration to implement a sanctions legislation that passed overwhelmingly in July \u2014 with only five no votes in both the House and Senate.

The sanctions law was crafted partially in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nIt remains unclear whether the administration has already released or plans to release the oligarchs or sovereign debt reports that were due Monday, both of which are likely to contain classified information.

But they say they will also deploy Trump in the next tier of swing states that Trump won more narrowly: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. And they expect him to help preserve GOP seats in Nevada, where he narrowly lost, and in Arizona.\n\nIn fact, despite his unpopularity on the national level, Republicans insist there isn\u2019t a state on the Senate map where they are nervous about deploying Trump. Republicans reason that opposition to Trump is already baked into the Democratic electorate. They figure Democrats will be motivated to vote whether Trump shows up or not, so they might as well use him to fire up their base, too. \n\nRepublicans have \u201cgot to have some intensity in our base,\u201d as Sen.

No one knows where all the controversies swirling around him will end up.\n\nYet even if the GOP does follow through on its full Trump deployment plan, Democrats argue that the president\u2019s personality and popularity among some voters is neither transferable to other Republicans nor enough to put their candidates over the top. Just look at the two latest examples, they say: Trump went all in for Rick Saccone in last week\u2019s Pennsylvania special House election, and before that for Roy Moore\u2019s Senate bid in Alabama.\n\nBoth lost.\n\n\u201cThe pattern here is every time he goes in, they lose,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nStill, Democrats are gearing up what are sure to be personal and vicious battles with the president, and some are already making their case to Trump voters. Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester\u2019s first ad highlighted 13 bills he sponsored that Trump signed into law, even though Tester opposed Trump\u2019s tax bill as well as the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and his attempt to repeal Obamacare.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) similarly has noted 23 bills she has been involved with this Congress that Trump signed. But she doesn\u2019t expect that to spare her from Trump\u2019s scorched-earth campaign tactics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to trash me. Have you met him? His method in campaigns is to trash, in fact, do character assaults on opponents,\u201d McCaskill said. Still, she noted there is an upside: \u201cNothing motivates our base more than Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSeven of the 10 most vulnerable Senate Democrats said in interviews that they were prepared for Trump to come to their states and make a spectacle of them. Few said they expected it to change the trajectory of their race.\n\n\u201cIf it were Ronald Reagan? Yes.\u201d But Trump\u2019s effect is \u201cTBD,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is expected to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott this fall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he will persuade many people. He barely won in Michigan. And frankly [it was] because 51,000 people voted for Jill Stein,\u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.).\n\n    \n\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                             \u201cI don\u2019t think he will persuade many people. He barely won in Michigan,\u201d Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow said of President Donald Trump\u2019s influence on the 2018 campaign trail. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo\n\n                    \n                \n        \n\n\n    \n\nIf there is a wild card to the GOP\u2019s Trump strategy, it\u2019s whether the president can actually focus on promoting their candidates or going after Democrats. At the most recent Saccone rally, the president spent far more of the time talking about himself than the Republican hopeful.\n\nAnother factor: Trump enjoys warm relationships with some Senate Democrats, most notably Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \n\n\u201cHe does like Sen. Manchin,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). \u201cSo it\u2019ll be interesting to see when he does come \u2014 because I know he will \u2014 how he approaches\u201d it.\n\nRepublicans predicted that Trump will be plenty motivated to take on those Democrats because they have opposed so much of his agenda. There was scant Democratic support for Trump\u2019s most controversial nominees and his rollbacks of Obama-era regulations, and none for the president\u2019s tax cuts and Obamacare repeal push.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s learned his lesson. Trump thought there was going to be bipartisan support? Not happening. Supreme Court, [deregulation], circuit judges, tax bill \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty long list,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). \n\nRepublican Senate candidates have already given Trump a bear hug. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) has gone from \u201c99 percent\u201d against Trump to claiming that everything Trump has touched has been \u201cincredible.\"\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) chose to retire rather than try to run as an anti-Trump Republican in Arizona, which is trending away from Republicans. The hopeful to replace him, establishment pick Rep. Martha McSally, has been using Trump in ads.\n\nIn Missouri, a state where Trump received a higher percentage of the vote than any GOP presidential candidate this century, Attorney General Josh Hawley said in his Senate campaign kickoff speech he hopes Trump comes to Missouri \u201coften.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the president's popularity there in those states relative to his national popularity,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) of the top-tier races. \u201cHe\u2019s doing much better.\u201d\n\nEven in Michigan, a state Trump won by less than a quarter of a percentage point, the campaign of John James, an Iraq War veteran who is challenging Stabenow, said he hopes to campaign with the president.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThough Trump may be a major drag on endangered House Republicans from the suburbs, who have to appeal to a concentrated set of moderate voters, statewide races in rural places like North Dakota and West Virginia are a far different story. So top GOP operatives see bringing Trump out to the states as a way to alleviate one of their biggest fears for 2018: that a depressed base will allow Democrats to run roughshod over them even in heavily conservative areas.\n\n\u201cThere are some dangers in running away from the president of your own party,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy it, and you risk alienating your own base.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also said Trump could help Republicans close the fundraising gap plaguing many of their candidates, which is forcing them to rely on outside groups for television ads.\n\nBut the biggest contribution he can provide is the attention that comes with a presidential visit and nonstop news coverage.\n\nIf there is an upside for Democrats in having the president campaign against them in their backyards, it\u2019s that Trump\u2019s presence also brings a reminder that Democratic moderates will be a more effective check on the president than a Republican who would replace them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no mystery that if you want someone who\u2019s going to vote with the president 100 percent of the time and do whatever the president wants you to do \u2026 then I am probably not someone you should elect in North Dakota,\u201d Heitkamp said. That independence, she added, \u201cis not what the president expects from Congressman [Kevin] Cramer,\u201d her opponent.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Ben Sasse tore into President Donald Trump Wednesday for making a congratulatory call to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it \"terribly ill-advised\" and urging staffers who leaked Trump's briefing materials to resign.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican, in a speech on the Senate floor, called Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' refusal to condemn Putin's \"sham\" election this week \"very foolhardy\" \u2014 among the strongest statements made by a member of Trump's own party in the aftermath of Trump's call to the Russian president.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Sasse even turned Trump's signature campaign phrase against him, condemning a \"Russian despot that aims to make Soviet tyranny great again.\"\n\n\"The president of the United States was wrong to congratulate him, and the White House press secretary was wrong to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's reelection was free and fair. It was not. The American people know that, the Russian people know that and the world knows that,\" Sasse said. \"The White House refused to speak directly and clearly about this matter; we were weakened as a nation and a tyrant was strengthened.\"\n\nTrump has hit back amid the mounting criticism.\n\n\"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. \"Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\nSasse never supported Trump's presidential campaign, though he kept a relatively low-profile during the first year of Trump's presidency. Lately, however, Sasse has felt compelled to speak out against Trump's new tariffs, his comments about due process and on Wednesday, about his foreign policy.\n\nOther Senate Republicans have also criticized Trump's call to Putin on Tuesday, notably John McCain of Arizona. But Sasse's comments stand out given his past opposition to Trump and the venue of the Senate floor.\n\n\"The moral responsibilities of the office of the presidency matter. And when we don't affirm these basic truths, it is a failure to who we are. It is a failure to do what we do, and it is a betrayal. Not just to the millions of people who are denied free and fair elections in Russia this week, but it is a failure to people all across the globe who are struggling in darkness against tyrants,\" Sasse said. \n\nSeveral media outlets reported that Trump's briefing materials included a directive not to congratulate Putin, which Trump ignored. Sasse said the leaking of those materials is \"wrong.\"\n\n\u201cA president\u2019s staff shouldn\u2019t leak. In cases of principle, you may need to resign. So resign,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cDo the right and honorable thing if you believe your conscience is compelled to do so and resign your position.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

That would give Trump his full wall funding request in the must-pass spending bill and still give him leverage over the DACA program heading into his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nBut Democrats balked, demanding instead that the White House provide a pathway to citizenship to 1.8 million young immigrants eligible under the DACA program, those sources said. The White House might have been open to negotiating further, but Democrats were only willing to entertain the massive wall funding figure in exchange for helping the same number of immigrants that Trump embraced in a proposal earlier this year.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

So the White House is willing to drop its insistence that any immigration deal include major cuts to legal immigration. In the administration\u2018s view, Democrats are being unreasonable in the face of Trump\u2019s flexibility.\n\n\u201cWe sent the minority leaders\u2019 offices a proposal that is pretty fair,\u201d said a White House official. \u201cIt seems like Democrats don\u2019t want to take yes for an answer.\u201d\n\nDemocrats rejected that characterization.\n\n\u201cThe White House proposal gave them everything they asked for while leaving Dreamers in limbo, said a senior Democratic aide. \u201cOur counter offer lined up perfectly with what the president had proposed but of course, he said no to his own deal. Again.\u201d\n\nThere is little incentive for Democrats to give in to Trump\u2019s full border funding request without permanent protections for Dreamers. Their counteroffer was similar to a bipartisan bill that Republicans rejected last month under heavy pressure from Trump and White House officials.\n\nAnd now there is little chance that the outstanding DACA issue will be resolved this week as part of a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Trump\u2019s plan to rescind DACA protections is still tied up in the courts, and with no deadline facing Congress, action this year appears less likely by the day.\n\nRachael Bade, Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

McMaster with the fiery John Bolton as national security adviser, President Donald Trump is freeing himself of the last encumbrances on his increasingly strident unilateralism in world affairs. And the effects of this dramatic change are likely to go well beyond the renewed possibility of U.S. military attacks on both Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs, which Bolton has forcefully advocated. The blunt-spoken Bolton is a Yale-trained expert in international law who has spent a career seeking, ironically, to delegitimize the very idea of international law, and of multilateral action and organizations. Bolton can thus be expected to provide the president with just the intellectual gasoline he needs to ignite new hostilities on any number of global fronts, including an escalated trade war.\n\nDuring his decades in Washington, Bolton has earned a reputation as an uncompromising nationalist hawk. What is less understood is that Bolton arrived at these positions carefully, thoughtfully and consistently, as a militant libertarian thinker who has believed passionately that the United States has surrendered its sovereignty for far too long to multilateral treaties and organizations of all kinds, including the United Nations. In articles and speeches, he has gone so far to as to question whether \u201cglobalism\u201d or international law have any legitimacy under the U.S. Constitution. In a 2000 essay in the Chicago Journal of International Law titled \u201cShould We Take Global Governance Seriously?\u201d Bolton cast the U.S. political debate as a clash between two \u201cparties\u201d\u2014what he called the \u201cAmericanists\u201d versus the \u201cGlobalists\u201d\u2014and that he, as a \u201cconvinced Americanist,\u201d was engaged in a losing battle for America\u2019s very soul. \u201cAmericanists find themselves surrounded by small armies of Globalists, each tightly clutching a favorite new treaty or multilateralist proposal,\u201d Bolton wrote.\n\nBolton then proceeded to attack nearly every major multilateral convention, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming, the Land Mines Convention in Ottawa and the International Criminal Court. Over the years, he also has taken on the Biological Weapons Convention and the World Trade Organization, among other multilateral treaties, and continues to do so. Trump\u2019s new unilateral trade tariffs against China will likely meet with his incoming national security adviser\u2019s approval.\n\nIn what has since become his mantra, Bolton wrote back then that globalism \u201crepresents a kind of worldwide cartelization of governments and interest groups,\u201d and \u201cthe costs to the United States\u2014reduced constitutional autonomy, impaired popular sovereignty, reduction of our international power, and limitations on our domestic and foreign policy options and solutions\u2014are far too great.\u201d This puts him at odds with the 70-odd year consensus that has guided U.S. foreign policy since World War II: that a world of rule-based cooperation rather than atavistic competition is ultimately in American interests, too.\n\nWhat lies behind Bolton\u2019s current stance against any deal with North Korea and the nuclear treaty with Iran is a long and embattled history of infighting that harks back to his unwavering determination to put his theoretical unilateralism into action. Because North Korea is an \u201cimminent threat,\u201d he wrote last month in a Wall Street Journal piece titled \u201cThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First,\u201d \u201cit is perfectly legitimate\u201d for the U.S. to strike without having to worry about any multilateral say-so. Similarly on Iran, Bolton wrote that the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and approved by the U.N. Security Council was a \u201cdiplomatic Waterloo.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure as George W. Bush\u2019s under secretary of state for arms control, and later as a recess-appointed U.N. ambassador, Bolton often enraged U.S. allies with his recalcitrance to the point where both Secretary of State Colin Powell and his successor, Condoleezza Rice, sought to get rid of him. At a meeting in London in November 2003, Powell\u2019s counterpart, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, complained to the secretary of state that Bolton\u2019s belligerence was making it impossible to reach allied agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Powell turned to an aide and said, \u201cGet a different view,\u201d according to a government source at the time. Unbeknownst to Bolton, the aide then interviewed experts in Bolton\u2019s own Nonproliferation Bureau. The issue was resolved only after Powell adopted softer language recommended by these experts on how and when Iran might be referred to the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThat same year, British officials persuaded the White House to keep Bolton off the team negotiating with Libya to surrender its nuclear program. A crucial issue, according to sources involved in the affair, was the dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi\u2019s demand that if Libya abandoned its WMD program, the U.S. in turn would drop its goal of regime change. Bolton was unwilling to support this compromise, and the White House finally agreed to keep him \u201cout of the loop,\u201d as one source put it to my then-Newsweek colleague John Barry at the time. A deal was finally struck without him.\n\nIf nothing else, Bolton has proved unerringly true to his philosophical views. During his tension-filled career at the U.N. and State Department (he once told me in a 2002 interview that he felt surrounded by \u201cenemies\u201d at State), he consistently brooked no interference from allies and fulminated at interference from anyone, especially U.N. \u201ccivil servants.\u201d Before he became U.N. ambassador\u2014in a recess appointment because even many Senate Republicans would not back him\u2014Bolton infamously proposed that if the U.N. Secretariat in New York \u201clost 10 stories, it wouldn\u2019t make a bit of difference.\u201d When the No. 2 official at the U.N., Mark Malloch Brown, suggested that Americans were acting against their own interests when they bashed the world body, Bolton exploded. Malloch Brown, in a speech, warned Americans they could \u201close\u201d the organization if they continued \u201cthe prevailing practice of seeking to use the U.N. almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics.\u201d In response, Bolton declared that Malloch Brown, as a mere \u201cinternational civil servant\u201d rather than a representative of an individual country, had no right to say such things. \u201cIt\u2019s just illegitimate,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nArriving at a time when Trump appears to be giving voice more to his own anti-globalist and unilateralist instincts, Bolton will no doubt encourage these tendencies with a kind of career-vindicating glee. He will lend eager validation to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d views that Trump has embraced since his presidential campaign: that the United States can and should act alone as it pleases. \u201cWe will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism,\u201d Trump said in his defining foreign-policy speech as a candidate in the spring of 2016. \u201cThe nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down.\u201d The language of Trump\u2019s in-your-face inaugural address echoed these views: \u201cFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America First,\u201d he said.\n\nBolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R McMaster, an Army lieutenant general, was no soft-hearted globalist, but he was known to urge the president to be cautious in moving away from multilateral cooperation. Both McMaster and recently ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly were in favor of finding ways to maintain the Iran nuclear treaty, and both their policy views and their occasional differences in style were said to rankle the president. But in John Bolton\u2014and in the incoming secretary of state, the hawkish Mike Pompeo\u2014Donald Trump is likely getting a pair of full-throated cheerleaders.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Edward-isaac Dovere", "body": "Bernie Sanders on Wednesday blamed Hillary Clinton for not doing more to stop the Russian attack on the last presidential election.

But Weaver later acknowledged that the Vermont senator had no firsthand knowledge that this had happened. Weaver said Sanders based his remark on an article published by NBC\u2019s San Diego affiliate over the weekend about a campaign volunteer who claimed to have conducted his own investigation and brought the findings to the Clinton campaign in September \u2014 an assertion flatly denied by a former Clinton campaign aide. \n\n\"A guy who was on my staff \u2026 checked it out and he went to the Clinton campaign, and he said, \u2018You know what?

Not exactly new.\u201d\n\nA former Clinton campaign staffer said it was nonsense that Sanders' campaign had reached out to Clinton's about potential Russian interference. \"No one from the Sanders campaign ever contacted us about this\u201d \u2014 not in September, and not in \u201cApril and May.\u201d Sanders said in the radio interview that he noticed \"lots of strange things\" during those months in 2016.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cThey were supporting my campaign? No. They were attacking Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and using my supporters against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Sanders said in the radio interview.\n\nAsked why Sanders would blame Clinton for not intervening, Weaver said, \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. They [Clinton's campaign] did have more information.\u201d\n\nAs for Sanders\u2019 claims of having gone to Clinton\u2019s campaign about possible Russian meddling, Weaver said Sanders was \u201cspeaking broadly.\"\n\n\u201cWhat he knows is all from published news reports,\u201d Weaver said. \n\nThe Vermont senator was adamant that he did not benefit from Russian bots urging voters to support him. \u201cI did not know that Russian bots were promoting my campaign. Russian bots were not promoting my campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders has repeatedly condemned President Donald Trump for not acknowledging the Russian attack on the 2016 election alleged in the Mueller indictment and being investigated by congressional committees. But he has refused to say that his campaign benefited from the activities. \n\nMueller\u2019s indictment states that the 13 Russians indicted \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\u201d \n\nAmong the evidence the indictment cites is a message from the day after Sanders and Trump won their New Hampshire primaries. \"Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on \u2018politics in the USA\u2019 and to \u2018use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2014 we support them.),\u201d the document read.\n\nWeaver, who is one of the senator\u2019s closest aides, said repeatedly he wasn\u2019t sure if he should believe the charges.\n\n\u201cThe factual underpinning of that in the indictment is what? Zero,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI have not seen any evidence of support for Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nKenneth Pennington, the campaign\u2019s digital director, said in an MSNBC appearance after the Mueller indictments were issued that he knew nothing of Russian support for the campaign, and Weaver said in the interview he didn\u2019t either. \n\n\u201cTwo dudes sitting in a hole somewhere support Bernie Sanders \u2014 tell me what they did to support Bernie Sanders,\u201d Weaver added later. \n\nSanders\u2019 and Weaver's argument mirrors that of Trump, who has argued in a days-long series of tweets that the Russians were not supporting him. The president has blamed his nemesis, Barack Obama, for not doing enough to stop Russian disruption in the campaign. \n\n\u201cIf all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren\u2019t they the subject of the investigation?\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. He earlier said that \"some 400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer\" could have been responsible for the activities attributed to Russians.\n\nSanders repeatedly refused to say why he didn\u2019t call out Russian involvement during the campaign. Clinton's campaign regularly raised suspicions of Kremlin-backed activity during the home stretch of the race.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSanders said the key point was that he was campaigning hard for Clinton after losing the nomination to her, and \u201cat this point we were working with them.\u201d\n\nSanders has faced questions since Friday about why he has not more strongly condemned the Russian actions that benefited his campaign. On Wednesday, liberal writer Joan Walsh of The Nation tweeted in response to Sanders\u2019 comments about Clinton: \u201cSeriously, this could be the end of Sanders 2020. Someone who cares about him ought to tell him how badly he stepped in it today.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Sanders repeatedly said that the attention should be on Trump\u2019s denials of Russian activity \u2014 an assertion he's made repeatedly since Friday's indictment.\n\nBut in doing so, he floated his own conspiracy theory. \n\n\u201cYou have a president of the United States not saying that [Russians meddled in the election]. What exactly is going on? And you have speculation: \u2018Do the Russians really own him?\u2019\u201d Sanders said. When pressed by the host if he believed that the Russians do have something compromising on the president, Sanders said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But something [is] very weird.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sanders took to Twitter with additional statements. \n\n\"Mueller's indictment provides further evidence that the Russian government interfered in 2016. It also shows that they tried to turn my supporters against Hillary Clinton in the primary and general election. I unequivocally condemn such interference,\" he wrote. \n\nA Sanders spokesman declined to explain the senator's apparent change of heart over the course of the day. \n\n\n                                    \n                                        CLARIFICATION:   An earlier version of this story did not include Bernie Sanders' statement that his own campaign needs to be among those that condemn Russian activity. \n\n                                        \n                                \n\n                            \n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Beyond Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman reiterating on Sunday that Mueller\u2019s investigators should \u201cbe able to do their job,\u201d Republican leaders have remained silent as Trump escalated his attacks on the Russia investigation. The issue didn't even surface at a House Republican Conference meeting or the Senate GOP leadership huddle on Monday evening. \n\nAnd the leaders are expected to refrain from criticizing the president at Tuesday press conferences, even as they say they support an independent probe.\n\nThe muted reaction showed yet again that if Trump is trying to test the boundaries of his opposition to the Russia probe \u2014 some critics fretted during Trump\u2019s weekend tweetstorm that a Saturday Night Massacre-like housecleaning might be in the offing \u2014 he\u2019s unlikely to get much resistance from congressional Republicans until the deed is done.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Cornyn said leaders have sent a back-channel message to the White House that Trump must not fire Mueller. But he seemed resigned to Trump\u2019s deepening attacks on the special counsel: \u201cI can\u2019t control that. That\u2019s his decision. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201c[GOP leaders] probably feel like they don\u2019t need to say it,\u201d added Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has been among the strongest Republicans in pushing back against Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cYou spend your capital on issues where you think you get the best return. And I don\u2019t think anybody in our conference thinks Mueller is going to be fired. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly surprising that Republican leaders are once again shying from a conflict with the president. Ryan once fashioned himself as the moral compass of the Republican Party, but has tamped down his criticism of Trump since the election. His deputy, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), often makes the case that private conversations with Trump have a much better chance of persuading him than any public dispute.\n\nMcConnell, on the other hand, has always shied from publicly criticizing the president \u2014 and doesn\u2019t appear poised to break that tradition now. He's said nothing about Trump's attack on Mueller over the weekend. \n\n\"I don\u2019t know if they know what to say. What do you say? \u2018Stop it\u2019?' said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). \u201cTrump is going to do what he\u2019s going to do.\"\n\nGOP leadership allies argue they\u2019ll gain nothing by rebuking Trump publicly and predict they\u2019d probably only make him angrier and the situation worse if they spoke out against him. They say they\u2019re confident that Trump will not sack Mueller and have reassurances from the White House that they\u2019ll leave him alone.\n\n\"I would certainly hope that the president doesn't intervene in any way or make it difficult for Mueller to complete his work,\" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader. \"I've made no secret of the fact that I'm not a fan of when the president tweets. In this case I'm sure he's venting some frustration. But I don't think it's constructive.\"\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThat\u2019s not going to be enough for Democrats. Some of them want Congress to immediately take up legislation to protect Mueller. Indeed, the party spent the entire weekend and Monday calling on Republicans to, essentially, grow a spine.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan needs to be stronger and so does Mitch McConnell,\u201d said House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) \u201cThe president is testing the waters and\u2026 a muted reaction to what could be another Saturday night massacre is only an encouragement\u201d to fire Mueller.\n\nSome Republicans took to the Sunday morning TV shows to push back on Trump. Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) suggested on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that if the president was innocent he and his lawyer needed to act like it instead of attacking the special counsel like they have something to hide.\n\nBut most of the Republicans who criticized the president were the usual Trump critics, including Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is not running for reelection, and Graham, who warned Trump that firing Mueller would be the end of his presidency.\n\nIndeed, many House Republicans don't want Ryan to criticize Trump. Even Rep. Brian Mast, a vulnerable Republican from Florida, said his leadership didn't need to be more vocal about protecting the Mueller probe. \"Nah, I think we've got enough work around here,\" he said.\n\nTrump in recent months has ignored the advice of some allies suggesting he take a more aggressive stand against Mueller, listening instead to GOP lawmakers and lawyers advising that he not go after the special counsel. But that changed over the weekend, when Trump took to Twitter to accuse Mueller of filling his \u201cteam\u201d with \u201chardened Democrats\u201d and \u201csome big Crooked Hillary supporters.\u201d \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nAnd on Monday, Trump hired prominent Washington attorney Joe DiGenova, who has accused the FBI of trying to frame Trump. \n\n\u201cA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning.\n\nThose comments came after another Trump lawyer, John Dowd, suggested Friday that Mueller end his investigation. The White House distanced itself from Dowd\u2019s comments, but many in Washington viewed his remarks as a trial balloon to gauge how far Republicans would allow Trump to go in taking on Mueller.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee member, said \"I would hope that the president would stop commenting and tweeting on Mr. Mueller.\u201d \n\nBut Collins said she didn\u2019t believe Trump would move to fire Mueller because the probe is overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 who has pledged to protect the investigation absent any evidence of improper conduct. But Democrats warn that Trump could fire Rosenstein, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that Ryan says, \u2018Don\u2019t fire the special counsel.\u2019 But \u2026 they\u2019re almost encouraging\u201d Trump, said House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not discouraging.\"\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

According to excerpts of his prepared remarks shared with POLITICO, Ryan will argue that \u201cwe have up-ended the status quo and are actually improving things for our constituents.\u201d\n \n \u201cA year ago, we came together and talked about all the great things that this new, unified, Republican government was going to be able to do on behalf of the American people,\u201d Ryan will say. \u201cWell, we got to work and we are delivering on that promise. As we advance our agenda and help more Americans reach new heights, you can feel a sense of pride and confidence working its way back into our country.\u201d\n \n That sums up Republicans\u2019 2018 campaign message: that Republicans are better for Americans\u2019 bottom-line than Democrats. They\u2019ll play up tax reform, which has slowly increased in popularity in recent months. And they\u2019ll point to the economy and booming stock market to argue the economy is growing while also touting a recent influx in military spending aimed at protecting the nation.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

He brought in $44 million last year and as of March 1 had transferred $38 million to the NRCC, a new record.\n \n Of course, that\u2019s not the full story of the GOP-led Congress. Republicans were unable to pass a repeal of Obamacare \u2014 something they campaigned on for years. And they\u2019ve also struggled to deliver on Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico, though the latter was never a huge priority for most congressional Republicans. In order to deliver on their budget boost for the Pentagon, they\u2019ve also have to fund Democratic priorities that will increase the national debt, not exactly the hallmark of conservative orthodoxy.\n \n But Ryan \u2014 who has raised more money for the NRCC than anyone else by a long shot \u2014 will zero in on the boxes they\u2019ve checked on Tuesday evening. And his campaign team has expressed confidence that focusing on their economic message is a winning strategy.\n \n \u201cWe need to line up the choice for our constituents and make it clear for them: if you re-elect us, we\u2019ll continue to push this economy higher, we\u2019ll take control from Washington and return it to the states, and we\u2019ll empower people with the freedom and ability to reach their full potential,\u201d Ryan will say. \u201cI know we can tell this story in our districts.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n The message is typical Ryan, who\u2019s known for tuning out Trump\u2019s drama and sticking to policy in his public remarks. He and his team have been encouraging their members to do the same and will soon start traveling to vulnerable districts to help them sell that message.\n \n Ryan on Tuesday night will introduce the president, who raised $30 million at the 2017 annual dinner. This year\u2019s event is expected to shatter that record, per several GOP sources.\n\n With Republicans facing an increasingly daunting task of keeping the House, that payday can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

As conspicuous as he was at the Alfalfa dinner\u2014one of the few black faces in the Capital Hilton ballroom\u2014I am all the more so here. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, leaning in, \u201cyou\u2019re about to be like the third white dude ever inside this place.\u201d\n\nThe Quick Service Barber Shop is the aesthetic pinnacle of Forest Avenue; its cream-colored exterior is dressed in red and blue paint announcing the proprietors and proclaiming Hebrews 12:14: \u201cStrive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\u201d That\u2019s easier said than done around these parts. There was a shooting inside the shop a few months back, Scott tells me; his friends urged him to find a new barber. The senator wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Scott got his very first haircut here a half-century ago, courtesy of Charles Swint. His son, Charles Swint Jr.\u2014a minister who took over the family business\u2014is the only person Scott trusts with a pair of clippers. When his white Cadillac Escalade finally pulls up, Swint Jr., a small, salt-and-pepper-haired man wearing a dark three-piece suit, jumps out and grins at Scott: \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d\n\nThe old friends hug and we head inside. A pillar of the area\u2019s African-American community, the shop features aging walls covered in photos, news clippings and other paraphernalia. Two individuals in particular are lionized: Barack Obama, the country\u2019s first black president; and Scott, the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction\u2014and the only African-American ever to serve in both chambers of Congress. Both are children of single mothers, but politically, the pair have little in common: Obama, a liberal Democrat raised primarily by well-off whites in Hawaii before adopting Chicago\u2019s impoverished South Side as his political base; Scott, a conservative Republican who grew up poor in North Charleston, and whose initial ticket to D.C. was punched by affluent voters in the state\u2019s three-quarters-white 1st Congressional District. Still, they are members of a small fraternity\u2014two of just 10 African-Americans ever to serve in the Senate\u2014and both are an immeasurable source of pride for the barber shop and its customers.\n\n\u201cHe took this haircut,\u201d Swint Jr. says, running his fingers over Scott\u2019s newly sheened, oval-shaped head, \u201call the way from Quick Service Barber Shop to the White House.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the senator has spent plenty of time lately at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. When the unified Republican government made tax reform its top priority\u2014after failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act\u2014he emerged as a star player, one of four senators who crafted the legislation and worked alongside the administration to win over holdouts. Scott\u2019s repeat visits to the White House were punctuated by a victory lap on the South Lawn after Congress passed the GOP tax plan. It should have been a crowning moment in his career\u2014not only for the role he played in writing and passing the law, but because he had triumphed in securing bipartisan language in the final product that accomplished a longtime goal: creating \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d across America, with tax incentives offered for investing in poor communities. (He makes a point of noting that both urban and rural areas will benefit.) When Scott took his place at the ceremony on the afternoon of December 20\u2014flanking President Donald Trump, right next to Speaker Paul Ryan\u2014the extent of his influence was on full display.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what everyone saw. Just minutes before Trump invited Scott to speak at the lectern, Andy Ostroy, a HuffPost blogger, tweeted: \u201cWhat a shocker \u2026 there\u2019s ONE black person there and sure enough they have him standing right next to the mic like a manipulated prop. Way to go @SenatorTimScott.\u201d When the event ended, Scott opened Twitter and spotted the comment. He responded: \u201cUh probably because I helped write the bill for the past year, have multiple provisions included, got multiple Senators on board over the last week and have worked on tax reform my entire time in Congress. But if you\u2019d rather just see my skin color, pls feel free.\u201d\n\nThe exchange crystallized the central dilemma of Scott\u2019s political existence. Concerned about narrowing his brand, the senator long has tried to downplay his ethnic exceptionalism and avoid the role of race-relations ambassador for the GOP. And yet Scott, now more than ever, cannot seem to escape being perceived as such. He is not just a generic black Republican in a generic period of history; he is the most powerful and prominent black elected official in America, serving at a time of heightened racial tension and widespread accusations of xenophobia against his own party and the president who leads it. This ensures that Scott wears a target on his back regardless of the issue or crisis at hand. When race is involved, the stakes are even higher, forcing upon him decisions of personal and political identity: Scott can choose to stay silent and be accused of selling out his heritage, or speak out and be defined by his blackness.\n\n\u201cGod made me black on purpose. For a specific reason. It has helped me to help others who have been locked out of opportunity in many ways,\u201d Scott tells me over lunch at a Subway sandwich shop near his home, after the barber visit and a game of pickup basketball. \u201cI am not pretending that this characteristic, this Earth suit that I\u2019m in\u201d\u2014he pinches the skin of his arm\u2014\u201cisn\u2019t being evaluated. It requires a response, or a reaction, to the situations at my level of government. I am fully aware of that. I just don\u2019t want to play a game with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are fixated on my color,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI\u2019m just not.\u201d\n\nYet in the age of Trump, he is coming to terms with an uncomfortable truth: The fixation on his color is a feature, not a bug. No matter his achievements or aspirations, Tim Scott is sentenced to exist in America\u2019s collective political subconscious as a black man first and everything else second.\n\n\n\nUnlike most members of Congress, who rise early, Scott is a creature of the night. A teetotaling bachelor at age 52, he follows an unorthodox schedule: sleeping in as late as possible, then staying up into the wee hours of the morning. He reads, prays, works out, watches movies. But his favorite post-midnight pastime is writing. Scott, a successful businessman and politician in Charleston before coming to Congress in the Tea Party insurgency of 2010, has spent his adult years putting life on pen and pad: his plans for the coming days and weeks; goals for the years ahead; visions of how problems big and small will be resolved and what the future will look like.\n\nScott\u2019s friends universally describe him as cerebral and calculating, someone who speaks very little until he is convinced there is something specific to say. This is particularly true concerning matters of race. Scott mostly kept his head down after first arriving in the Senate in 2013, but has used his megaphone with greater frequency the past two years. One such instance was in July 2016, when he delivered a historic speech from the Senate floor describing being profiled by law enforcement. Another came in February 2017, when Scott took to the floor again, this time to read racially charged tweets sent by liberals attacking him for supporting Jeff Sessions\u2019 confirmation as attorney general. The most recent example was when, after Trump equivocated in his response to the August 2017 white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, Scott said the president\u2019s \u201cmoral authority is compromised.\u201d\n\nThat earned Scott a different sort of invitation to the White House. Reached on his cellphone by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the senator agreed to sit down with the president and explain his displeasure. What ensued was a lengthy, Scott-led seminar on systemic discrimination. He recalls doing most of the talking; the White House released a photo of Trump listening intently to a senator identified as \u201cTom Scott.\u201d When I ask whether he got through to Trump, Scott does not hesitate. \u201cYes. I have no question that I got through to him,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the question is, [does] getting through lead to immediate transformation or change? Or maybe instantly the light comes on, but that doesn\u2019t mean it stays on. Because he\u2019s, what, 71 years old? I don\u2019t think anybody at that age changes in a single conversation, save for one with the good Lord.\u201d\n\nWhen I list Trump\u2019s history of race-based controversies\u2014housing discrimination suits, the Central Park Five, lying about Obama\u2019s birthplace, Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d the Muslim ban\u2014Scott bobs his head up and down: \u201cI am not unaware of the president\u2019s past,\u201d he tells me. A long pause. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s a racist?\u201d I ask. Scott shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t,\u201d he replies. \u201cIs he racially insensitive? Yes. But is he a racist? No.\u201d\n\nEvery Republican lawmaker is on a tightrope these days, forced to weigh his or her moral and philosophical objections to Trump\u2019s presidency against fears of losing influence in Washington and support back home. In Scott\u2019s case, he is suspended above a pit of vipers. Any rebuke of the president exposes him to more lunacy from the right; the senator is a frequent target of menacing calls and messages, and last fall a Georgia man was arrested for threatening to kill him. (\u201cHe said he wanted to be the next Dylann Roof,\u201d Scott tells me, referring to the white supremacist who murdered eight parishioners and their pastor at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston.) Meanwhile, biting his tongue when it comes to Trump\u2019s behavior has opened Scott to unyielding vitriol from the left, with accusations of being an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d or worse. He invariably handles such attacks with elegance and humor: When one Twitter user called Scott a \u201chouse n----\u201d last year, after his vote to confirm Sessions, he tweeted back a one-word reply: \u201cSenate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt weighs on him,\u201d says Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina congressman and Scott\u2019s closest friend in Washington. \u201cThat man goes through things\u201d\u2014his voice cracks\u2014\u201cthe rest of us will never, ever have to go through. And he does it with grace. And he does it with class. And he does it with dignity.\u201d Gowdy apologizes for getting emotional, then continues: \u201cYes, Tim is an African-American who happens to be a Republican. But he\u2019s a lot deeper than a spokesperson on racial issues. ... People want to drag him in when there\u2019s a Charlottesville. And they want to drag him in when the president is alleged to say something about African countries or Haiti. And there\u2019s an expectation that he\u2019s going to have to respond. And he does. But whatever response he gives, it\u2019s never enough for the left. And when he does speak from the heart \u2026 he\u2019s accused of not supporting the president. So he\u2019s in a no-win situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is, however, a silver lining to Scott\u2019s predicament. A deeply religious man who sees the Almighty\u2019s hands on the country, Scott does not believe that God \u201cchose\u201d Trump. But he does believe the \u201cAmerican family\u201d was long overdue for \u201cpainful, ugly, embarrassing\u201d conversations about race and other combustible subjects that have simmered for generations. We are now having them, he says, thanks to Trump and the unsettled national climate he exploited to win the presidency. \u201cI know what fear looks like. I think fear typically comes with anger and hostility. You\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re losing something, that you won\u2019t have something that you used to have,\u201d Scott tells me. \u201cI think people who march with torches\u2014who want to resurrect a thankfully dead part of who we were\u2014these are people who are afraid. Afraid of the changes happening in the country. Afraid of the other man who doesn\u2019t look like them.\u201d He adds: \u201cAnd it\u2019s permanent. That\u2019s why the fear. Something is permanently changing.\u201d\n\nSurveying this societal upheaval, Scott sees \u201ca wave of negative hostility, and a wave of opportunity, all hidden in the same room.\u201d He finds himself hopeful of two things: first, that by virtue of his diverse experiences he is uniquely positioned to help broker a peace between the warring tribes; and second, that if successful, not only will today\u2019s tumult lead to \u201ca healthier country\u201d in the long run, but that those who follow in Scott\u2019s footsteps might be liberated from the racial paradigms he has struggled to transcend.\n\n\u201cAll of it hurts. All of it is painful. I\u2019m not impervious to pain, nor do I seek to be. I\u2019ve asked the good Lord to be able to feel that pain,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to remember what it feels like to be disrespected, to be disgusted with the treatment I\u2019ve received, so that I can make sure other people don\u2019t go through that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are two Tim Scotts. One is gregarious, outgoing, magnetic, confident\u2014the guy with the lightning-fast quips and crazy, colorful socks. But there is an alter ego: People close to the senator describe him as withdrawn and introverted and deeply private, someone more comfortable speaking to 500 people than five. When I ask about this, Scott, a physically imposing man with soft facial features and a barrel-sized chest, leans back in his chair and nods. \u201cI think I\u2019m still a shy kid in many ways,\u201d he says.\n\nScott was 7 years old and living on a Michigan Air Force base when his parents separated. He and his older brother were taken by their mother back to their native South Carolina. Moving in with her parents, Frances Scott and her boys shared a bedroom, and a bed, in the cramped, shack-style home off a dirt road in North Charleston. Scott is certain that he saw his father at least once in the two decades that followed but can\u2019t recall when or under what circumstance. It wasn\u2019t until his late 20s or early 30s, he tells me, that he opened himself to reconciling with Ben Scott Sr. They are \u201cdoing well now\u201d and talk once a month, the senator says, but the feelings of abandonment he felt shaped him in unmistakable ways. \u201cGetting over that takes, for me, so far, 45 years,\u201d Scott says, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cIt just takes time.\u201d\n\nLeft to raise Tim and Ben Jr. on her own, Frances pulled double shifts as a nursing assistant at a Charleston hospital: 7 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon, then 3:30 until 11 at night. Scott was deeply influenced by his grandfather, Artis Ware, who had left a segregated school in the 3rd grade to pick cotton in the fields of Charleston for 50 cents a day. Scott remembers his role model scouring the newspaper each morning, impressing upon his grandsons the importance of reading; it wasn\u2019t until years later that Scott realized his grandfather was illiterate.\n\nScott did not fall into the drug trade like two neighborhood friends who were shot and killed. But he rebelled in other ways. The future senator flunked his freshman year of high school, failing English, world geography, civics and Spanish. His options: repeat the grade or take summer school to pass the courses. Scott\u2019s mother told him he was going to summer school\u2014and finding work to pay the $265 fee himself. Failing the 9th grade was the first of several inflection points in Scott\u2019s young life. \u201cShe was working all the hours in the world to keep us off of welfare,\u201d Scott recalls, \u201cand I just knew I was blowing it.\u201d\n\nHis sophomore year showed improvement, but it was the summer after that changed everything. On break from his movie theater job, Scott walked into the nearby Chick-fil-A and requested his usual: waffle fries and water. The store\u2019s owner, John Moniz, asked about the order; Scott said it was all he could afford. The exchange sparked a mentoring relationship that transformed Scott\u2019s outlook on life. Having grown to a muscular 200 pounds, Scott, the varsity football team\u2019s star running back, had been plotting a path to the NFL so he could provide for his mother. \u201cHe said you can become a business owner, and you can do the exact same things you want to do for your mother through football,\u201d the senator recalls Moniz saying. \u201cHe was selling hope and opportunity\u2014all things are possible no matter where you\u2019re from.\u201d\n\nScott averaged 6\u00bd yards per carry his junior year, and big schools came calling to recruit him. But it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Weeks before his senior year began, after driving his mother to work early one morning, Scott fell asleep at the wheel of her Toyota hatchback, flipping the car, going through the windshield, and mangling his back and ankle. (The ankle still nags at him; Scott mostly hovers around the three-point arc during the hoops game.) He missed most of the season\u2014a source of sadness to this day\u2014and received offers from only a few smaller schools. Scott accepted an athletic scholarship from Presbyterian University in Clinton, South Carolina, where he experienced \u201cculture shock\u201d as one of roughly three dozen black students on a campus of 1,200. But Scott, who credits team sports and the military with doing more for race relations than any other institutions in America, adjusted rather quickly. \u201cThe thing I remember most about Tim was his smile. I would pop him good on the practice field, and he would come up grinning every time,\u201d says John Rickenbacker, the team\u2019s strong safety. \u201cIt would drive you crazy.\u201d Football wasn\u2019t the focus for long: That fall of his freshman year, Scott attended a Bible study on campus and prayed to accept Jesus. Suddenly, athletics were an afterthought. \u201cFootball was my god,\u201d he explains, \u201cand you can\u2019t have two of them.\u201d Scott quit the team after one season and visited Columbia Seminary, wanting to enter the clergy. But it wasn\u2019t the right fit. Instead, he transferred to Baptist College (now Charleston Southern) and moved back home.\n\nScott had caught the political bug in high school; somehow, the freshman flunky became student body vice president his junior year, went to Boys State that summer, and was elected student body president as a senior. Thanks to Moniz\u2019s mentoring, Scott had also developed a keen interest in business, and spent time studying finance and government in college. Tragedy struck during Scott\u2019s sophomore year: Moniz died of a pulmonary embolism at age 38. \u201cIt was pretty hard on Tim,\u201d recalls Brian Moniz, John\u2019s son, who was 14 at the time. \u201cDad had a mission statement that he wanted to have a positive influence on a million people. When he passed, Tim sat down and wrote his own mission statement. He wanted to influence a billion people.\u201d\n\nScott went into insurance sales after college, first with New York Life, then a smaller private company and finally with his own highly successful Allstate agency. All the while he had scanned for political opportunities, and in 1994, one came knocking: a vacancy on the Charleston County Council. Scott knew immediately he would run; what he didn\u2019t know was for which party. He was volunteering that year on the congressional campaign of a young man named Mark Sanford, attracted to his platform of fiscal discipline. But Scott wasn\u2019t sure he himself was a Republican. He visited the local Democratic Party headquarters to tell them he was interested in running for the open seat. \u201cThey told me to get in line,\u201d Scott laughs. He went straight to the GOP headquarters. \u201cThey said, \u2018You probably won\u2019t win, but heck we\u2019d love to see you run.\u2019\u201d And just like that, Scott was a Republican. \u201cAccess to opportunity is my No. 1 issue,\u201d he says by way of explanation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what your title is; your mission is the same.\u201d\n\nThe newcomer had a natural feel for politics. He wound up serving on the council for 13 years, including multiple stints as chairman, earning a reputation for his pro-business sensibilities and consensus-building style. \u201cIt was interesting that he was an African-American Republican, but you know, he didn\u2019t approach his job on the county council in a partisan manner,\u201d says former Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, a legendary Democrat who held office for 40 years. \u201cHe was very well-liked on the council and enormously popular in the community. He was easy to work with and easy to like. And it seemed we were usually on the same side of issues.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s promising career nearly ended before it began. While serving his first term on the council, he ran and lost a race for state Senate; a boilerplate Republican on most issues, he took the unpopular stance of removing the Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol. It was also during that campaign he began attending Seacoast Church in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy, overwhelmingly white suburb of Charleston. There he met Pastor Greg Surratt, who became Scott\u2019s close friend and spiritual adviser. Scott was reelected to the council, but confided to Surratt that he was losing interest in politics\u2014and wanted to go to seminary. Surratt allowed him to speak at the church soon afterward. Scott says he was \u201csweating up there, trying to do too much\u201d to impress the congregation. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you today that he applied and didn\u2019t get the job,\u201d Surratt laughs. \u201cBut I told him, \u2018I believe that you have a calling to politics, and that\u2019s where you can serve the best with your life.\u2019 As a pastor, I think he would have been very good. But as a politician, he is excellent.\u201d\n\nWalking away from the ministry for a second time, Scott renewed his focus on politics, building a sprawling base of support across the county over the ensuing decade. When he launched a second campaign for the Legislature, in 2008, he easily won a House seat in the affluent exurbs of Charleston. Even before his swearing-in, Scott began preparing a bid for lieutenant governor in 2010. He quickly became the favorite, raising nearly $300,000 for the race. But it wasn\u2019t a natural fit. Scott kept hammering national issues\u2014the debt and deficit, Obamacare, military readiness\u2014that weren\u2019t relevant to the office he sought. Friends urged Scott to run for Congress, but he refused; a GOP incumbent, Henry Brown, represented the 1st District.\n\nWhen Brown abruptly retired in January 2010, Scott\u2019s advisers told him to pounce. It was a no-brainer. But not to him. Scott admits to being a homebody; he doesn\u2019t like boarding weekly flights to D.C. Moreover, he recalls, \u201cThere were these behemoths in the race.\u201d The loaded field included Carroll Campbell III, son of the state\u2019s iconic former governor, and Paul Thurmond, son of the famous senator and segregationist Dixiecrat. Scott, a self-made insurance salesman from North Charleston, was fretful. He prayed and prayed, he says, but received no guidance. Yet for reasons he today cannot articulate\u2014other than pressure from friends\u2014Scott ultimately joined the race.\n\nIt took a toll on his personal life. \u201cAs a poor kid growing up, the most important thing for me to do was take care of my mom. And until I had that accomplished, starting a new family was just not an option for me,\u201d he explains. Finally, in his early 40s, Scott began looking to settle down. But just as things got serious with a girlfriend, the 1st District seat opened\u2014and it ultimately became clear that marriage and Congress would not mix. Scott, who is known to dote on the children of his colleagues and staffers\u2014and tells me he always wanted six of his own\u2014says he struggles with regrets at having prioritized politics over love. \u201cBut I think in the right time, I will meet Mrs. Right, and she\u2019ll want to have a couple kids,\u201d he smiles. \u201cOr she ain\u2019t Mrs. Right. Right?\u201d\n\nOther than the failed romance, everything worked out: Scott placed first in the nine-way primary but failed to hit 50 percent and wound up in a runoff with Thurmond. The headlines wrote themselves: Black Republican vs. Strom Thurmond\u2019s Son. But the candidates, former colleagues on the council, refused to engage in such narratives, even as the famously dirty and race-baiting South Carolina political underbelly demanded them. \u201cThe thing about Tim I\u2019ve always appreciated is it\u2019s never him trying to point out how unique he is as an African-American Republican. He didn\u2019t want to discuss that,\u201d Thurmond tells me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to monopolize or cash in on that.\u201d\n\nHe hardly needed to. Scott, reading the populist mood in 2010, built his candidacy around two Tea Party mandates\u2014eliminating earmarks and enforcing term limits\u2014and bludgeoned Thurmond for disagreeing. He received national endorsements from the Club for Growth and Sarah Palin, as well as conspicuous financial backing from two members of the House Republican leadership, Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy. Scott demolished Thurmond in the runoff and packed his bags for Washington.\n\n\n\nIf Scott is sensitive to allegations of being a political \u201cprop,\u201d it\u2019s because upon arriving on Capitol Hill he was sometimes treated like one. The freshman congressman was not naive; he recognized the yawning racial disparity in the GOP, and was warned to be wary of the support he\u2019d received from Cantor and McCarthy. For the same reason he declined to join the Congressional Black Caucus\u2014not wanting to be viewed through the prism of race\u2014Scott planned to keep a low profile in the GOP. \u201cTim was very careful. He didn\u2019t want to be used by the leadership,\u201d recalls Nick Muzin, Scott\u2019s then-chief of staff. \u201cHe wanted to speak up on things he cared about. He didn\u2019t want to be used as a spokesman for the party.\u201d\n\nThat proved difficult. \u201cTim was far and away the best-known member of that historically large class,\u201d says Gowdy, who arrived with Scott in January 2011, knowing him only as the guy who dropped out of the lieutenant governor\u2019s race. \u201cTim was like Elvis Presley. Leadership wanted him all the time to be the party\u2019s face on television. It was incredible pressure on someone brand new to Congress.\u201d One night as freshmen, Gowdy remembers, he met Scott\u2014still more of a colleague than a friend\u2014for dinner. He looked \u201cfrazzled\u201d and \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Gowdy could see the strain. \u201cYou have earned every bit of capital you have, politically,\u201d Gowdy told him. \u201cDo not let anyone else spend that capital.\u201d They were inseparable after that; the two men dine together every night Congress is in session, and they recently co-authored a book, Unified, that publishes in April.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just one party seizing on Scott\u2019s sudden prominence. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how the most racially insensitive people I have encountered are white liberals who are stunned and dismayed that there can be someone who looks like me who doesn\u2019t fit their mold,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Democrats want to use my color against the Republican Party. And the Republicans want to\u201d\u2014he breaks into a broad smile, cocking his head sideways\u2014\u201cemphasize my complexion in ways that say that we are not a party that is bigoted.\u201d\n\nAs Scott pulled back, sick of the unwanted attention, Muzin recalls a GOP lobbyist calling him to express concern. Allen West\u2014the other black Republican congressman in Scott\u2019s class, a loose cannon with a penchant for provocative commentary\u2014was becoming a fixture on Fox News. \u201cHe said, \u2018You guys are falling behind. Allen West is the black Republican,\u2019\u201d Muzin chuckles. \u201cAnd I remember thinking, \u2018Tim\u2019s trajectory is much longer than Allen\u2019s.\u2019\u201d Sure enough, West lost his reelection bid in November 2012. A month later, before Scott had even completed his first term in the House, he was appointed by Governor Nikki Haley to replace Senator Jim DeMint, who had resigned to become president of The Heritage Foundation.\n\nMuch ink was spilled on the symbolism: South Carolina\u2019s Indian-American governor bulldozing a major racial barrier on behalf of Scott, making him the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction. What received less attention was the reality that Scott, having held public office for more than 15 years and developed deep relationships and policy expertise, was considered on merit to be the obvious choice. \u201cIt is very important to me, as a minority female, that Congressman Scott earned this seat,\u201d Haley said when announcing his appointment. The five years since have done nothing to change that perception. \u201cHe\u2019s the perfect package,\u201d says Sanford, who was Haley\u2019s predecessor, and who ultimately won back the seat in his old congressional district that Scott vacated. \u201cHe's a breath of fresh air in a place that at times can be fairly dark. He\u2019s a person who in profound ways walks his faith. He\u2019s likable. He\u2019s affable. You get some people who are policy wonks but they frighten you or bore you; he does neither. He presents well on camera. There\u2019s incredible relatability to him. He\u2019s just as close to a god, politically, as you can get back home.\u201d\n\nOf course, Scott heard the whispers\u2014and in some quarters, the grumbling\u2014about his appointment being an affirmative action hire. It made him all the more determined not to give them ammunition. In the absence of words, Scott tried to lead with actions, assembling one of the most diverse offices on Capitol Hill, led by his black, single-mother chief of staff. He also poured time and resources into mentoring programs in distressed communities back home. But his silence on major cultural events grew more and more deafening. \u201cScott has said little on the racial controversies and civil rights issues of the last four years, from the killings of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis to the death of Michael Brown and the explosion of anger and rage in Ferguson,\u201d Jamelle Bouie wrote in Slate in November 2014. Soon enough, circumstances made the senator\u2019s reticence unsustainable.\n\nIn April 2015, Walter Scott\u2014no relation\u2014was fatally shot in the back by a policeman in North Charleston; the senator was shaken by the hometown incident and called for the officer\u2019s prosecution. (In 2017, Scott introduced the Walter Scott Notification Act, which would create a database of police shootings.) Ten weeks after Walter Scott\u2019s murder, Roof opened fire at Emanuel AME Church; the church's pastor and the senator\u2019s friend, Clementa Pinckney, was among those gunned down. Scott, who still keeps his final text message exchange with Pinckney, delivered an emotional address on the Senate floor. (\u201cGod cares for His people,\u201d Scott said, quoting the son of one of the victims he had spoken with. \u201cGod still lives.\u201d) The next summer, in July 2016, amid another rash of police shootings, Scott returned to the Senate floor to describe how he himself had been victimized by racial profiling\u2014being pulled over seven times in a single year as an elected official, and being forced to show identification to Capitol Police despite wearing his members-only Senate pin. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to sit back and deny these things are happening, until they\u2019re happening to you,\u201d says Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a close friend, who knew about the profiling incidents but never expected them to be shared from the Senate floor. \u201cAt the core of his argument, we have a significant percentage of people in this country who feel they\u2019re treated differently because of their background or their color. And we need to talk about it. No one else could have done that. No one else could have given that speech.\u201d\n\nUntil Trump arrived on the scene, Scott was content to pick and choose his spots, speaking on race authoritatively enough to command attention but infrequently enough to avoid being typecast. If threading that needle was difficult before, it now appears impossible. The question is no longer whether Scott is the GOP\u2019s dominant voice on race relations, but whether he can preserve credibility in both camps: engaging minority communities while simultaneously partnering with an administration they distrust, all in the pursuit of maintaining an influence over policies he believes will positively affect them. It might sound duplicitous, but Charlottesville offers a potential blueprint. If Trump was going to get a good photo-op out of their White House meeting, Scott, after skewering the president, was going to get something, too. When Trump asked what he could do to help the situation, the senator pitched his \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d idea, and the president instantly offered his support. That language, Scott tells me, probably would not have become law without the administration\u2019s backing.\n\nEven so, these dynamics are fragile and fluid. Many Republicans have spent the past year accommodating Trump at all costs to protect themselves back home. Scott\u2014who just won a six-year term in 2016, and has struggled to mask his irritation with the White House\u2014won\u2019t be one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough position to be in,\u201d Sanford tells me. \u201cBecause at some point, given the pattern, the president\u2019s going to say something so outlandish that it\u2019s going to force Tim to say, \u2018No more. I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe senator is running behind. It\u2019s a Wednesday morning in late January, and he is scheduled to join a colleague in addressing the United States Conference of Mayors. When Scott enters the room, searching for his seat at the roundtable, he stops to slap hands with Cory Booker. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the Big Bald Black Man Caucus of the United States Senate,\u201d his colleague from New Jersey announces. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a third!\u201d Scott bellows out, the room breaking up in laughter.\n\nThere is truth in jest: Despite ideological differences, Scott and Booker have become good friends in no small part due to shared expectations, if not shared experiences. (\u201cCory graduated cum laude,\u201d Scott tells the crowd of his Ivy-educated colleague. \u201cI graduated thank you law-dy!\u201d) Along with Democrat Kamala Harris of California, they are the only three African-Americans in the Senate, and feel the obligation of growing that number. The burden is especially heavy for Scott, given his party\u2019s dearth of nonwhite voters and the pressure on him to engage the black community without alienating the GOP\u2019s white base. \u201cI get fewer chances to mess up than other people,\u201d he tells me. \u201cTherefore, realizing that my reaction is something that will either create more opportunities for people like me or reduce opportunities for people like me, I have to be very aware of how [it] will be taken by a larger audience.\u201d\n\nThis is why, as much as Scott loathes being seen as the token black Republican, his only hope is serving well enough, long enough, to see the day reinforcements arrive and stereotypes fade. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the cutting edge of these things, you\u2019re going to be a prop. Now the question is, whether or not you conduct yourself in such a way that the guy or gal coming behind you won\u2019t be a prop,\u201d says Jim Clyburn, the longtime Democratic congressman and the only other African-American in South Carolina\u2019s delegation. Clyburn tells me, in a bit of serendipity, that just before our talk he was on the phone with Utah\u2019s Mia Love\u2014a black Republican elected in 2014\u2014planning an event with her in Salt Lake City. \u201cI think that she is much more comfortable being a Republican in the Congress because Tim handled being a prop in a way that makes it easier for her,\u201d Clyburn says. \u201cAnd she will make it easier for other people.\u201d\n\nScott likes to use the phrase \u201cfrom cotton to Congress,\u201d describing how his grandfather, a product of the Jim Crow South, lived long enough to see his grandson elected to federal office. \u201cI watched him eulogize his grandfather, and to see the tears running down his face\u2014there was a lot of sacrifice, tribulation, suffering that happened in his family,\u201d says Al Jenkins, a longtime friend who runs Scott\u2019s community outreach and mentoring programs in the Charleston region. \u201cHe\u2019s there on the shoulders of all of those generations of Scotts that sacrificed today so that maybe somebody will be able to break through tomorrow. And he carries that with him every day. He is constantly reminded, \u2018You are the one. You are the breakthrough.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the truth is, for all of his trailblazing, Tim Scott is also a living testament to a lack of progress. Breaking through isn\u2019t enough\u2014not for him. He sees minorities lagging on the socioeconomic spectrum. He sees that nativism and prejudice are alive and well. He sees entire communities undereducated and overincarcerated. He sees decades of momentum on race relations stalled. He sees people continuing to judge him by the color of his skin rather than the content of his character. Sometimes he struggles to hold back; all he wants to do is unleash a lifetime of exasperation and say what he really thinks\u2014about Trump, racism, law enforcement and the hypocrisy in both parties. The only thing holding him back is the feeling that now it\u2019s his turn to sacrifice.\n\n\u201cI've been frustrated. And angry. Man,\u201d Scott says, looking downward, his voice trembling with emotion. He looks up. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to be angry. And too natural. And also, too unproductive for me. But I get it. I get it. I\u2019m not at a point where my grandfather was. He could say nothing. He had to eat his anger. Or the next generation, who harnessed their anger and led to marches. I\u2019m on the inside track. I have a very different responsibility. It cannot be about me.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Nussbaum", "body": "Even among self-identified Republicans and conservatives, President Donald Trump came in 40th.\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    Trump comes in last in expert presidential rankings survey\t\t\n                        \n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n        \n            By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM\n    02/19/2018 12:52 PM EST\n                    \n\n        \nBarack Obama and Ronald Reagan are up, Bill Clinton is down and Donald Trump is off to a historically bad start \u2014 and the greats, meanwhile, remain the greats.\nThat was the finding of the 2018 Presidents  Executive Politics Presidential Greatness Survey, released Monday by professors Brandon Rottinghaus of the University of Houston and Justin S.

Mike Conaway (R-Texas), announced on Monday that last week\u2019s session with Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, was the final witness interview of the investigation. The investigation included an examination of whether associates of President Donald Trump assisted the Russian effort, but Republicans say they\u2019ve concluded that there was no cooperation.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n \u201cWe will now be moving into the next phase of this investigation, working with the minority on a report to give the American people answers to the questions they\u2019ve been asking for over a year,\u201d Conaway said in a statement. \u201cWith the 2018 primary elections already underway and just 238 days until the midterm elections in November, it\u2019s important that we give the American people the information they need to arm themselves against Russian attempts to influence our elections.\u201d\n\nThe Republican report \u2014 which has yet to be shared with Democrats on the committee \u2014 differs from the intelligence community\u2019s assessment last year that the Russian effort was intended to boost Trump\u2019s campaign and harm Hillary Clinton's.\n\nRather, the GOP\u2019s 150-page report finds that Russians intended to \u201csow discord,\u201d faulted a \u201clackluster\u201d effort by the Obama administration to combat Russian cyber activities, and raised questions about contacts between members of the intelligence community and the media.\n\nDemocrats have sharply disagreed with that suggestion, and they\u2019re expected to produce a report with a different conclusion in the coming weeks. All told, the committee\u2019s work is likely produce competing narratives that do little to resolve the white-hot worries about Russia\u2019s capacity to interfere in future elections. \n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Democrats, though, have insisted that Republicans failed to show even a remote interest in getting straight answers from top Trump allies, like the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and the president\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the panel, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and the rest of the committee Democrats have complained that committee Republicans have failed to force witnesses to answer questions, to subpoena documents or to even attempt to look into potential financial entanglements among Trump, his associates and Russia.\n \n \"By ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the president over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly,\" Schiff said on Monday. \n\n\"In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the special counsel, or continued investigative work by committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate,\" he continued. \"And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.\u201d\n\nIt also appears that Conaway ended the investigation without ever convening a meeting with Schiff and Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who head up the Senate panel looking into Russian interference. Though Conaway had suggested in December that he hoped to align his committee\u2019s factual findings with the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, a source familiar with the inquiries said no meetings had occurred.\n\nThe decision to end the House investigation essentially cedes central questions to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading a parallel probe on Russian interference. That investigation has already led to the indictment of another former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and former national security adviser Mike Flynn, as well as guilty pleas from two other campaign aides. \n\nConaway\u2019s decision comes despite recent reports suggesting that a new angle in Mueller\u2019s investigation had picked up steam: questions surrounding the January 2017 trip by Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Seychelles, where he met with the leader of a Russian-government-run investment fund. Reports suggest that investigators believe Prince was acting as a representative of the Trump transition team, but Prince told the House Intelligence Committee that wasn\u2019t true.\n\nThose entanglements have prevented House investigators from accessing Manafort, Flynn and other potentially pivotal witnesses to the activities of the campaign.\n\nBut the investigation had been marred from its early days by steadily rising hostility between Republicans and Democrats, a dynamic that grew into a crippling distraction. Members accused one another of leaking sensitive information from inside committee hearings, and the panel was sidetracked for weeks as Republicans took unprecedented steps to disclose classified information impugning the integrity of FBI agents involved in the early days of the Russia investigation.\n\nDemocrats have raised alarms in recent weeks amid indications that Republicans were moving quickly to curtail the inquiry. Schiff issued a list of subpoena requests Democrats had made that had gone ignored by Republicans on the committee. Among them: demanding more details from Donald Trump Jr. about the fallout from news that he\u2019d met with Kremlin-connected Russians in Trump Tower during the campaign; travel, phone and banking records from Cohen; and Hicks, who declined to discuss her time in the White House and certain elements of the transition period.\n\nRepublicans, though, have argued that Democrats are stringing the investigation along to generate harmful headlines about members of the Trump team amid accusations they courted Russian help during the campaign. GOP members say they\u2019ve seen no conclusive evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government.\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

She helped destroy the very evidence of this program, and people tell us we have no reason for concern?\n\nDirect participation in the program itself would be disqualifying enough for me, but appointing someone who also helped push for destroying evidence of that program to run one of the most powerful organizations in the world should not be acceptable to Congress.\n\nAt the end of the day, does this sound like what you would want from someone in a position of incredible power\u2014much of which is hidden from the public? Without hesitation, I say no.\n\nThose who run our government have a duty to the American people to ensure that their organizations are free of corruption. We are a nation of laws, where transparency and accountability are supposed to be paramount.\n\nI don\u2019t always agree with my Arizona colleague, Sen. John McCain, but his December 2014 floor statement regarding the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s torture report still rings true today. He said then:\n\nOur enemies act without conscience. We must not. This executive summary of the Committee\u2019s report makes clear that acting without conscience isn\u2019t necessary, it isn\u2019t even helpful, in winning this strange and long war we\u2019re fighting. We should be grateful to have that truth affirmed.\n\nNow, let us reassert the contrary proposition: that is it essential to our success in this war that we ask those who fight it for us to remember at all times that they are defending a sacred ideal of how nations should be governed and conduct their relations with others \u2013 even our enemies.\n\nUnless Haspel\u2019s tenure in charge of waterboarding is declassified, the exact details of her actions will be argued back and forth.\n\nWhat is known is that Haspel participated in a program that was antithetical to the ideals of this country. She destroyed evidence in defiance of our ideals.\n\nI simply do not believe she should hold the post to which she has been nominated.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Louis Nelson", "body": "\"Obviously he doesn't like McCabe and he's made that pretty clear now for over a year,\u201d Sen.

But there was clear frustration with the U.S. president\u2019s evidently limited grasp of complex trade issues, his allegations of unfair practices (which the EU disputes) and the overall tumult and unpredictability emanating from Washington.\n\nThe EU has developed an arsenal of retaliatory measures targeting American goods in politically sensitive states.\n\nFollowing a pattern set by other disagreements with Trump \u2014 over his withdrawal from the Paris climate change accords; his criticism of the Iran nuclear deal; and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, which the EU opposed \u2014 European leaders tried to dial down the tension, and to avoid inciting the combustible American president.\n\nTrump upended the EU leaders\u2019 quarterly summit on Thursday with cryptic comments that left Brussels wondering if indeed it had been granted the promised exemption to his tariffs.\n\nDiscussion among the 28 leaders of a potential trade war \u2014 and the EU\u2019s battle plan for retaliation \u2014 was pushed back twice on the summit agenda, first from the Thursday afternoon to dinner, and then from Thursday evening to Friday, because of uncertainty in Washington. Trump held a news conference where he slapped new penalties on China \u2014 which sent U.S. markets into a tailspin \u2014 talked about \u201cnegotiations\u201d beginning with the EU and repeated his complaints about unfair trade practices by Europe. But he never made clear an exemption had been granted.\n\nThat clarity came shortly before midnight Brussels time and received a mixed reception. Officials were glad to be granted an exemption, meaning the EU fared better than other allies such as Japan, but European leaders interpreted the May 1 expiration date as a threat.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on the final day of the European Council leaders\u2019 summit | Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was the first to use the gunpoint imagery. \u201cThis is maybe also a way to exert a strong pressure on the European Union and to start a kind of negotiation with a type of revolver at our head,\u201d Michel said as he arrived at the summit Friday.\n\nIn the European Council\u2019s formal conclusions, leaders once again rebuked Trump over the tariffs, which they assert violate World Trade Organization rules and cannot be justified, as Trump has claimed, by national security imperatives.\n\n\u201cThe European Council regrets the decision by the United States to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum. These measures cannot be justified on the grounds of national security, and sector-wide protection in the U.S. is an inappropriate remedy for the real problems of overcapacity, on which the EU already has offered the U.S. its full cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe leaders also reiterated their right to respond if Trump ever imposes the tariffs. The EU has developed an arsenal of retaliatory measures targeting American goods in politically sensitive states, including Kentucky bourbon, made in the home state of the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Harley Davidson motor bikes, made in Wisconsin, the home of the Republican house speaker, Paul Ryan.\n\nAt the summit\u2019s closing news conference, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he was happy Trump finally seemed to understand that the EU negotiates trade policy as a 28-member\u00a0 bloc.\n\n\u201cWhat the president was saying yesterday is recognizing that the European Union is an entity,\u201d Juncker said, noting the granting of a temporary exemption. \u201cIt cannot be divided into 28 parts.

If this were a serious undertaking, congressional investigators would be collaborating with the Department of Justice, FBI and relevant Senate committees to save America from the threat within. But we\u2019re no longer dealing in the realm of facts and reason when it comes to grave matters of security and justice. We are, at Donald Trump\u2019s behest, fully engulfed in a narrative explicitly designed to impugn and destroy the credibility of the law enforcement agency tasked with investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe memo in question is one written by the staff of Republican Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes\u2014the same Nunes who recused himself from the Russia investigation last year amongst allegations that \u201che made unauthorized disclosures of classified information.\u201d Now, Nunes is at it again. This time with a four-page classified memo that, if you believe what those who have read it say, shows an Obama-era FBI rife with corruption and engaging in eye-popping abuses of power. The details of what the memo says have been kept private, because they are classified. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill and beyond from crowing about the allegedly shocking memo since mid-January, demanding it be released to the public and spawning a viral hashtag, now used by everyone from Donald Trump Jr. to Sean Hannity and Julian Assange. After the House voted on Monday to do so, House Speaker Paul Ryan made a statement in favor of the decision. Now, the matter is in the president\u2019s hands.\n\nBut really, at this point, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the memo says. Prompted by Trump, his allies on Capitol Hill and in the Trump-affirming media universe, millions of Americans have been led to brainstorm all the various ways faceless bureaucrats embedded in the government could be working to undermine Trump. The entire American political media complex is consumed with speculation about what may be in the memo\u2019s contents. We\u2019ve all been sucked into a story we know probably isn\u2019t true. And, there\u2019s not a thing we can do to stop it. The president has already claimed two scalps with his shameless bullying, rumor mongering and conspiracy peddling: Former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. And it\u2019s happening all over again. With #Releasethememo, the FBI has already been accused of a multitude of various crimes without ever being given the chance to answer or explain.\n\nThe #ReleasetheMemo campaign bears all the classic hallmarks of a uniquely Trumpian ruse. Throughout his career as a New York real estate mogul and media star Trump has stumbled upon a foolproof way of trapping people into his web of lies. He always begins by casting vague aspersions about his target, in this case, the law enforcement networks investigating him. Recall how news reports of the now well-known and controversial dossier prompted him to ask, \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d Or how he compared the surveillance of campaign associates, such as Paul Manafort and Carter Page, to \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and \u201cNixon/Watergate.\u201d Nevermind that his actions more closely resemble those of Nixon during Watergate than anything undertaken those investigating him. Trump wanted his followers to believe one thing and one thing only: A massive conspiracy was underfoot to undermine his presidency, and he\u2019s been peddling this particular theory for well over a year now.\n\nNext step: Rather than answer any questions directly about the matter, Trump advances his narrative, often while denying any responsibility for it. His statement to NBC\u2019s Lester Holt about firing Comey is a classic example. \u201cAnd, in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election they should have won,\u201d he said. In other words, he fired Comey because of the Russian investigation, but denied there was any wrong doing with Russia. This tactic has similarly played out with #ReleasetheMemo. Republicans have widely advanced the narrative that various abuses were committed, but denied naming anything specific, citing security concerns with releasing the material. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another Trumpian tactic: suspense building. When Trump tweeted that \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d people immediately started to question whether, a la Watergate, there was a secret taping system inside the Oval Office. They hoped there were tapes. Even Comey himself testified to Congress, \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d Weeks later, Trump admitted there were no tapes. Oftentimes Trump will, whether he has it or not, promise information will come out \u201csoon \u2026 perhaps in two weeks.\u201d This is the precise stage we find ourselves upon now with #ReleasetheMemo. At this moment, Trump is waiting to make a final decision to release the contents. We all have our countdown clocks on; Trump is in control of this story. Whatever happens next, rest assured, Trump will use the self-manufactured controversy Nunes created to discredit the Russian investigators.\n\nYou may think this all sounds silly and misleading; that this nonsense could never work. But when people see what\u2019s in the memo, it won\u2019t settle the debate. More likely than not, another round of gaslighting will begin to tip the debate in Trump\u2019s favor. Remember, Trump is the same guy who used the bogus birther theory to launch himself on the political stage. He is the same guy who used the National Enquirer to accuse Ted Cruz\u2019s father of being involved in the assassination of JFK. Don\u2019t laugh. The same week Trump started flacking the flabbergasting story, Cruz dropped out of the presidential election and Trump became the default GOP presidential nominee.\n\nAnd this time, Trump has an eager crop of Republicans on Capitol Hill eager to assist him and an entire government apparatus at his disposal in the form of bobble-headed Cabinet secretaries, press teams and even a vice president. As a result, everyone is talking about what could possibly be in the mysterious memo. Republicans are running to TV cameras hyping claims about improper surveillance, FISA court abuse and partisan rancor inside the FBI.\n\nWe are being gaslit into believing that, supposedly, those investigating Trump\u2019s ties to Russia are so biased and corrupt nothing they produce should be believed. Every once in a while, the true aims of this narrative are revealed. Rep. Matt Gaetz, the freshly-elected Republican congressman from Florida, let the truth slip. He told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in between his hits on InfoWars with Alex Jones, that there was \u201ctremendous bias that should stop this probe from going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop this probe from going forward.\u201d Alas, there is always a purpose to Trump\u2019s gaslighting. Trump\u2019s firemen on Capitol Hill know their mission. Whether they succeed or not depends on our ability to see through the smoke.

Democrats say Pompeo will fall far short of that \u2014 if he gets any Democratic support at all.\n\n\u201cBoth of them have serious questions to answer and neither confirmation is a sure thing,\u201d Schumer told POLITICO in a statement. \n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n                            \n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n\nRepublicans agree that failed confirmation votes are a real possibility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they didn\u2019t\u201d block the two nominees, said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). \u201cSen. Schumer is pretty clear that he\u2019s trying to slow us down. And again, it may not be [over] the nominee themselves. It\u2019s purely a tactic to prevent us from doing our work here.\u201d\n\nUntil the Tillerson ouster, the calendar for 2018 appeared free of the type of divisive legislative fights over health care and taxes that defined Republicans\u2019 first year back in full control of the government.\n\nThe completion of an omnibus spending bill and a punt on the immigration status of Dreamers, the thinking went, would leave the White House free to focus its energies on the midterms and avoid any debilitating intraparty brawls.\n\nInstead, the White House is gearing up for a full-on push to keep the GOP in line behind two nominees known for defending torture techniques \u2014 and the prospect of additional confirmation fights if Trump shuffles other members of his Cabinet.\n\n\u201cI think we assume a tough fight on almost all of our nominations. I think that the obstruction has been historic. So we wouldn\u2019t expect anything different at this point,\u201d said White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. \u201cI\u2019m confident that they\u2019re both eminently qualified and have amazing stories to tell, and I think they\u2019ll generate a lot of confidence through the hearing process.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials say they\u2019re confident that they\u2019ll emerge victorious, in part because there are 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in states that Trump won in 2016, who will face pressure not to obstruct. \n\n\u201cI think Democrats make a show out of both of them,\u201d one White House official said, but predicted eventual confirmation, voicing particular confidence about Pompeo.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are well aware that they could get a much less agreeable appointee in the Trump administration, someone that doesn\u2019t have the credentials he does,\u201d the person said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to make a scene of it, but they\u2019re going to take him.\u201d\n\nThe White House is also hopeful that the looming prospect of talks with North Korea could put further pressure on Democrats to approve the nominees.\n\nHaspel and Pompeo each face a different set of challenges. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) voted in favor of Pompeo as CIA director last year, but could flip. With Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, already opposed, losing another Republican on the panel could be catastrophic, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could still bring Pompeo to the floor, regardless of his committee vote.\n\nRetiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who serves on the Foreign Relations panel, has been privately cited by Democrats as a potential flip vote on both Pompeo and Haspel. A vocal Trump critic, he said he\u2019s \u201clooking into\u201d Haspel\u2019s record and wants to hear willingness from Pompeo to break with Trump on Russia.\n\n\u201cWe need people who will stand up to the president, frankly, on some of these issues. I want to make sure he\u2019s willing to do that,\u201d Flake said in an interview. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nHaspel, whose current role did not require confirmation, is unlikely to face a no vote from a committee stacked with defense hawks. But she will face difficult questions from Democrats about her time overseeing a CIA prison in Thailand where suspects were interrogated with methods that many consider to constitute torture.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be hard-hitting hearings. So certainly, Democrats are very, very anxious to get some answers,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who serves on the Intelligence Committee and opposes both Pompeo and Haspel.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s demonstrated preference for unorthodox figures could leave some Democrats inclined to accept the pair, who few would label unqualified even if they disagree with them on policy.\n\nRepublicans also have the advantage of a cadre of Democratic senators facing reelection in 2018 in states Trump easily won: Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. All four voted to confirm Pompeo at the CIA.\n\nThe most conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, is not an automatic \u201cyes\u201d on either, despite his closeness to Trump.\n\n\u201cSen. Manchin looks forward to meeting with both nominees and evaluating their records of service,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nDemocrats have shown increased unity since the early months of the Trump administration. They held together to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act when they were joined by three Republicans. And they voted unanimously against Trump\u2019s signature tax cut bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible. At 51-49, what\u2019s the possibility that there will be some Republican opposition? I think it\u2019s fairly high,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). \u201cI think there will be drama.\u201d\n\nShort of blocking the picks altogether, Democrats could still cause serious headaches for the White House throughout the process.\n\n\u201cThe biggest danger for the White House is that both of these people are coming from inside the administration and are going to be asked to talk about what\u2019s happened inside the administration during their confirmation hearings,\u201d said Matthew Miller, who helped shepherd former Attorney General Eric Holder through his confirmation hearings and joined him at DOJ as a spokesman.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nHe pointed as an example to a Washington Post report from June 2017 that Trump complained to Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats early in his presidency about then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of the Russia probe.\n\nIf Pompeo refuses to address that conversation, Democrats could use that as justification for voting against him, Miller said, since such questions go to how Pompeo reacted to presidential pressure while leading the CIA.\n\n\u201cIf you invoke executive privilege at your oversight hearing, there\u2019s nothing the senators can do to you,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIn a confirmation hearing, you can lose votes over it.\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Glasser", "body": "Subscribe to The Global POLITICO on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.\n\n\n\nSusan Glasser: Hi, I\u2019m Susan Glasser and this is The Global Politico. Our guest this week is Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence Committee. Days ago, Republican abruptly shut down the committee\u2019s yearlong investigation of President Trump and the 2016 Russian election meddling \u2014 to the surprise of Schiff and the Democrats on the panel. Now even many Republicans are pointing fingers, and we\u2019ll hear from Congressman Schiff about how it all went down, what it\u2019s like when a congressional committee melts down and what he thinks comes next in the investigations of the president that are still ongoing.\n\nCongressman Schiff was one of our very first guests on the Global Politico a year ago at the very start of that investigation on the House Intelligence Committee, so it seemed appropriate to have him back as our very first repeat guest. Back then, we started our conversation by saying it was a very topsy turvy week in the Trump White House; the same could be said of this past week too\u2026\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif): It has, and we may be meeting on the eve of another national security advisor being pushed out the door. That\u2019s at least the speculation at the moment. And I understand that John Bolton is one of the potential candidates. And the pressing question here is, does that mean that the president has gotten a commitment that he\u2019ll shave the mustache? Because I understand that was an impediment to begin with.\n\nGlasser: Well, you know, if this is a reality show, we know that this is a president for whom appearances matter, so I\u2019m not sure if the contestants are being judged on that, but then again, maybe President Trump has learned. He thought that Rex Tillerson fit the suit\u2014right?\u2014that appearances seem to matter in the selection of that, but then he soured on him. So\u2026\n\nSchiff: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether if Pompeo is confirmed for that position, his proximity to the president and the favor that he holds with the president will allow him, or if he will even seek to restore the ranks of the State Department, which have been so badly depleted under Rex Tillerson. We can only hope so.\n\nIn many respects I think that role as a policymaker is a better fit for Mike Pompeo, but I hope that it will mean that the State Department will now get the attention and the resources that it really needs.\n\nGlasser: Just before we jump back to the investigation, former Congressman Pompeo obviously has a wide network here on the Hill, and you dealt with him also in your capacity on the Intelligence Committee. You\u2019re one of the eight members of Congress who receive briefings on classified information and sort of a key part of the leadership. What was your impression of him as the CIA director? He seemed to somewhat suit that workforce at a time when President Trump had assaulted them and their integrity.\n\nSchiff: Well, I think that his tenure at the CIA was one that the employees and career servants at the CIA welcomed. They wanted someone who would not be out of favor with the president, and subject the agency to further attacks by the president. I think he was a good manager of people. We\u2019ve had some very serious policy differences, both when he was in Congress and in the CIA, and I\u2019ve had some concerns at times about his willingness to stand up to the president.\n\nThere were a couple times where he diminished the significance of the Russian intervention in our election and perhaps\u2014\n\n Glasser: Publicly or privately?\n\nSchiff: Publicly. And even more seriously, made the statement which was a repeat of the president\u2019s talking points, but clearly untrue that the intelligence community had found that the Russian intervention in our election had not affected the outcome.\n\nNow, clearly, that\u2019s not at all what the intelligence community found, and they made it quite explicit in their unclassified assessment they were reaching no conclusion about that; that was beyond their purview. So, when I would hear him repeat talking points, or do the president\u2019s bidding that way in public, it certainly made me question whether he was willing to stand up to him in private.\n\nGlasser: Have you had any personal interaction with him as CIA director?\n\nSchiff: Certainly, frequent interaction, and on many things we\u2019ve had a real meeting of minds, and other times we\u2019ve had very, very serious differences.\n\nGlasser: Would you say those largely revolve around Russia, or other matters?\n\nSchiff: I can\u2019t get into specifics, but they\u2019re more of a policy nature than they are of an allocation of resources or whether we\u2019re developing the right skill sets at the agency.\n\nGlasser: You don\u2019t think he was tilting intelligence, do you?\n\nSchiff: No. No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any evidence that he was trying to skew the intelligence we were seeing. I hope that he will continue to try to shed some of the partisanship that he exhibited in Congress. I don\u2019t think that his positions on Iran as a member of Congress were in the national interest, and it does concern me that those positions he had then are all too much in alignment with the president\u2019s positions now. Certainly, that would be true if John Bolton became national security advisor.\n\nI don\u2019t see any of the critics of the Iran agreement offering a better solution, and if they take us out of this agreement, and we have another deadline coming up, then\u2014\n\nSchiff: Then, we end up isolated, not Iran. And Iran may be back on the path to its nuclear program, but free from the sanctions, at least vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world, and that would, to my point of view, be the worst of all outcomes.\n\nGlasser: You make the point about the intelligence and Russia, and your concern about the representations of it. My guess is that concern is magnified by many times over when it comes to your colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee, the Republicans who\u2019ve now abruptly put an end to your investigation. It seems like the most controversial aspect of that\u2014it\u2019s not really a surprise on some level that they were skeptics going into this case; they\u2019ve resisted you every step of the way. But, they seem to have gotten a lot of pushback coming out on a week when there\u2019s this nerve gas attack in the U.K., when actually even President Trump\u2019s administration has put out sanctions on Russia addressing the 2016 elections.\n\nTheir conclusion seems really at odds with the facts to say that the Russians were not intervening on behalf of Donald Trump. Was this a misfire? I think the headline today in POLITICO is \u201cRepublicans Fear They Botched Russia Report Rollout.\u201d Do you agree with that?\n\nSchiff: I do agree with that in many ways. They announced their conclusions, which included among other things that the Russians had not intervened in the election to help Donald Trump. Now, that\u2019s at odds with what the intelligence community has found. It\u2019s at odds with what our committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what the Senate committee has found. It\u2019s at odds with what Bob Mueller has found.\n\nIt\u2019s a political statement, not a finding. And I think when they were forced to defend it, even within the last 24 to 48 hours, they couldn\u2019t. They acknowledged\u2014well, clearly, these ads and these other things that are in the public domain show that they were attacking Hillary. Doesn\u2019t that help Donald Trump? And they had no answer. And it demonstrates, I think, the problem that we\u2019ve had behind closed doors, which is they\u2019ve been fundamentally unserious about this investigation, and tragically, that started from a very early point.\n\nWe started out committed to a bipartisan, nonpartisan investigation, and a unified report at the end of it. But within days of the open hearing we had with James Comey, when he revealed the Trump campaign had been under a counterintelligence investigation, we had that midnight run by our chairman, in which he went to some undisclosed location and then went to the White House the following day and announced that he had received from a secret source documents he had to show the White House, which he wouldn\u2019t show even his own committee. Only to learn that he\u2019d got these documents from the White House. It was a charade.\n\nFrom that point on, the mission of the chairman was protecting the White House, protecting the president. And so, here we are, the Republicans say they\u2019re shutting down; they\u2019re not going to do any more. The Senate isn\u2019t shutting down. They recognize the importance of this. Bob Mueller certainly isn\u2019t shutting down; there are reports within the last 24 hours of subpoenas going out to the Trump Organization. And just within the last week we have seen now reports of witnesses contradicting the sworn testimony of people who came before our committee, like Erik Prince and Roger Stone.\n\nAnd the Republican members of our committee had just said they don\u2019t care; they\u2019d really rather not know.\n\nGlasser: Tell me a little bit\u2014there\u2019s so much to unpack here\u2014but, how did this happen? I mean, the end\u2014they didn\u2019t even tell you\u2014is that right\u2014that they were just going to end the investigation?\n\nSchiff: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. We would hear through sort of the rumor mill that\u2014and sometimes they would state publicly that they were under enormous pressure to shut it down. Certainly, the White House wanted it shut down. Certainly, Breitbart wanted it shut down, and the Sean Hannitys and the Fox echo chamber wanted it shut down. And they buckled. And it was just a question of how soon they were going to buckle.\n\nGlasser: Do you have any intelligence on how explicit the collusion was with the White House?\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t know, but we did ask the chairman when they put out that very partisan, misleading Nunes memo\u2014\n\nGlasser: Right. This was the headline news 24-hours-a-day, six weeks ago, and now is basically forgotten.\n\nSchiff: Yes. And it should be forgotten, except for the fact that it was a terrible chapter for our committee in which the chairman decided, with the acquiescence of his members, to cherry-pick intelligence and use a once\u2014never before used House rule to publish that in a way that was misleading and omitted key facts to attack the FBI and to attack the department and try to undermine Bob Mueller.\n\nAnd that will chill the willingness of the intelligence community to share information with our committee, to see it abused by our chairman that way. So, we asked the chairman, was this concocted with the White House, the way that midnight run was? Is this a sequel to the midnight run? And he refused to answer the question for days, and when he finally did answer the question, he read a very lawyerly statement of about one sentence that said the White House was not involved in its drafting. But, of course, that leaves open a whole lot of other coordination of that whole chapter.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a terrible tragedy, I think, for the public, because it means that, at least as far as the House is concerned, the public isn\u2019t going to get an accounting of what the Russians did and what the Trump campaign did, that too much of that work will be left to Bob Mueller. And this was not only the only authorized Russia investigation in the House\u2014it was really the only authorized investigation, period. The House is doing no oversight of this administration.\n\nCountless violations of the emoluments clause, and other elements of potentially corrupt behavior of the White House doing business deals out of the White House are going uninvestigated, and won\u2019t be, I think, as long as this crowd is in the majority.\n\nGlasser: Okay. So, a week ago, last Friday, did you know that on Monday they were going to shut down the investigation?\n\nSchiff: And, similarly, when they produced that Nunes memo, we found out about it when they announced it at our business meeting, and asked us to vote it out. They gave us about a minute or two to read it. I made a motion that we allow the members of the committee to actually read the underlying documents\u2014\n\nGlasser: If you are chairman next year, will you make a pledge not to do that to the Republican minority, if you get into the majority?\n\nSchiff: Absolutely. Absolutely. And indeed, up until this Russia chapter\u2014really up until the midnight run\u2014we had worked in a very bipartisan way, and in fact, even now, even through the worst of it, on our non-Russia business we continue to work in a bipartisan way. But yes, this is not way to conduct an investigation. It\u2019s certainly not the way I would do it.\n\nAnd I think, frankly, had Mr. Conaway and I been really given the latitude to run the investigation, it would have been a very different investigation.\n\nGlasser: So, you don\u2019t think this was really Congressman Conaway; you think this was Nunes who was really working with the White House?\n\nSchiff: Well, Chairman Nunes, even when he said he was stepping aside after the midnight run, never did, and continued to make all the key decisions\u2014which witnesses would come in; when they would come; and what open hearings we would have; what open hearings we wouldn\u2019t have; what subpoenas would go out; what subpoenas wouldn\u2019t go out\u2014all of these sideshow investigations of FISA abuse and Uranium One and all that\u2014those were all decisions made by Chairman Nunes, not by Mike Conaway.\n\nGlasser: Do you believe Speaker Ryan was involved in that, as well?\n\nSchiff: Of course. This was of such importance in the House and to the country, and the problems that we\u2019ve had with our chair were raised with the speaker, and the speaker made the decision to be complicit in all this and to acquiesce in all of this. There\u2019s no hiding responsibility for the Republican leadership.\n\nI think one of the really sad realizations over the last year is not what kind of a president Donald Trump turns out to be\u2014I think it was all too predictable\u2014but rather, how many members of Congress would be unwilling to stand up to him, and more than that, would be completely willing to carry water for him. That is a very sad realization.\n\nGlasser: So, you didn\u2019t expect that?\n\nSchiff: I did not expect that. I thought there would be more Jeff Flakes, more John McCains, more Bob Corkers\u2014people who would defend our system of checks and balances, would speak out for decency, who would defend the First Amendment. When the president suggested pulling the license of NBC because he didn\u2019t like what they had to say, the speaker was asked about this, and his comment was, \u201cI\u2019m a conservative constitutionalist and I support the First Amendment, and that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d That\u2019s not much of a defense of our First Amendment rights.\n\nI take it, by conservative constitutionalists what he meant was he\u2019s conservative in his support for the Constitution when it\u2019s not convenient. Those kind of things, the willingness to see the president attack the independence of the Justice Department, attack the judiciary and judges that rule against the president as being illegitimate\u2014to stand silent in the face of that is a real abdication of responsibility.\n\nGlasser: So, going forward, what do you see happening to the Russia investigation? Let\u2019s talk first about your conclusions. Had you known now what you know a year ago, would you have been shocked? I mean, there\u2019s really a lot more information on the record. I was struck by that, looking back at our first interview.\n\nSchiff: I would have been completely shocked, and I gave a very lengthy opening statement in that first hearing we had with James Comey where I tried to set out what was alleged at the time, and what was warranted in terms of investigation. We knew nothing at that time that we would later find out.\n\nIf I were giving that opening statement now, I would be saying that we have evidence that in April of 2016, before even the Clinton campaign knew, the Russians approached the Trump campaign through a foreign policy advisor named George Papadopoulos and told him that they had stolen Clinton emails, that they wanted a relationship with the campaign, that they previewed the dissemination of these stolen emails, that weeks later they would approach the highest levels of the campaign, that they would dispatch an attorney from Moscow with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton to a secret meeting in the Trump Tower\u2014something they described as part of the Russian government\u2019s effort to help the Trump campaign.\n\nSchiff: In writing. In writing. And the campaign\u2019s response to this Russian overture, this invitation to collusion, was, we would love it. And that the national security advisor would have secret conversations with the Russian ambassador designed to undermine the bipartisan policy of the United States to sanction Russia over its interference in our election, and then lie about it\u2014if I had suggested any of these things at the time, people would have said that, oh, you\u2019re smoking something. You\u2019ll never find evidence of that. And certainly, nobody would ever put that in writing.\n\nBut yet of course, we\u2019ve found evidence of all of that, and more. And so, we\u2019ve come a long way. But there\u2019s still a great many unanswered questions.\n\nGlasser: Right. And your Democrats on House Intelligence released a 21-page essentially roadmap to further lines of inquiry, things that you were pursuing at the time the investigation was shut down. Is it your view that there\u2019s an overall question mark on this evidence? You\u2019ve been publicly quoted as saying there already is \u201cample evidence of collusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Do you believe there is already sufficient basis to proceed either with further indictments, or with an impeachment case?\n\nSchiff: Well, there certainly is ample evidence of collusion, and the facts that I\u2019ve just set out are clear evidence of collusion. Now, whether they and other facts known to us and known to the special counsel amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a criminal conspiracy to violate a particular election code section\u2014that will be something Bob Mueller will have to decide.\n\nAnd he still knows a great deal more than we do. For example, what did George Papadopoulos tell the rest of the campaign? Who was knowing in the campaign of what the Russian early overture had been? Did that color the willingness of the president\u2019s son to take that meeting in Trump Tower? Why was the campaign manager and the president\u2019s son-in-law there? Why have three of the most senior campaign people in that meeting at a time when they\u2019re still fighting a contested convention about whether they\u2019ll be the nominee?\n\nThey clearly thought this was a key meeting. Why were they so disappointed in what they got at the meeting? Were they expecting something different? All these questions need answers, and the majority doesn\u2019t want to know. What about these communications between Roger Stone and efforts by Cambridge Analytica to get stolen information from Julian Assange?\n\nGlasser: Do you expect there will be\u2014as an informed observer only\u2014indictments related to the hacking part of it? We haven\u2019t seen that yet.\n\nSchiff: Yes. Yes. And that\u2019s a very good question. I fully expect that there will be. The only question is whether the indictment on the hacking and dumping of documents operation is Russian only, or it includes Americans. When I saw the indictment that Mueller returned, the grand jury returned, charging the 13 Russians with that ambitious social media campaign, that surreptitious\u2014\n\nGlasser: Right, this is the Internet Research Agency, St. Petersburg troll farm, basically?\n\nSchiff: Exactly. There were two things that leapt out at me. First, was the extraordinary level of detail that was included. You put that much detail about a Russian operation and you\u2019re potentially risking sources and methods, and the intelligence community must have signed off on that, which to me means that they felt that informing the public of this was sufficiently important to take that risk, and I think it\u2019s the right call.\n\nBut, the other thing that leapt out at me was, there\u2019s no mention of the hacking and dumping operation. Now, why is that? It\u2019s certainly not because the evidence wasn\u2019t there. Indeed, the evidence of that was more fully developed earlier than the evidence of the social media campaign.\n\nThe reason why you wouldn\u2019t include that\u2014speaking as a former prosecutor\u2014when it reinforces the conspiracy allegations against the Russians\u2014the reason you wouldn\u2019t include that is either that component involves Americans, or you\u2019re not finished investigating whether Americans should be included in that part of the indictment.\n\nGlasser: And, of course, that\u2019s the part of the investigation that could lead more directly to this question of whether the Trump campaign actually was involved or knew about or colluded with the release of those hacked emails.\n\nSchiff: Yes. What Mueller charged in that indictment\u2014the one that was released some weeks ago\u2014was a conspiracy to defraud the United States. That is a good blueprint for how the hacking and dumping operation might be described, along with other elements involving the violation of U.S. election laws. But, defrauding the American people, defrauding the U.S. government, defrauding the agencies that administer our election laws, that\u2019s the kind of conspiracy you would charge; that\u2019s what collusion would look like in legal terms. And the fact that that part of the Russian operation wasn\u2019t included tells me that he either has more work to do on the U.S. person part of it, or that the U.S. persons will be included in that, and\u2014but, that indictment is coming. The only question is whether it includes U.S. persons or not.\n\nGlasser: So, I found your document very interesting reading that suggests a lot of names and entities for possible further investigation that was shut down. The Daily Beast today, I think, said the Republican report was like a half-written term paper. Well, you\u2019ve offered a sort of list of what could have been in the other part of the term paper. There\u2019s a lot to digest in there. What are vtwo or three of what you thought were the most promising leads?\n\nSchiff: Well, there\u2019s a lot more work to do on fleshing out what we already know about the social media campaign of the Russians, about the hacking and dumping operation of the Russians\u2014you know, most of the areas, frankly though, where the Republicans shut us down were on the issues of collusion and obstruction of justice.\n\nSo, we would have witnesses come before the committee who would invoke very broad privileges, or even invoke no privilege and just say they didn\u2019t want to answer the questions. So, Steve Bannon comes in\u2014he\u2019s a perfect illustration\u2014really, the Bannon situation is a perfect illustration of all the problems with how the GOP conducted this investigation. You can look in microcosm.\n\nGlasser: Right. And this was right after he was fired, right?\n\nSchiff: Yes. No long after he was fired. But, in microcosm you can see in the Steve Bannon saga all of the problems with how the Republicans ran their investigation. So, first Bannon comes in as a voluntary witness, which is how we initially bring everyone in. He refuses to answer any question dealing with his time in the White House, his time in the transition, and most of his time even after he left the White House. He invokes no privilege; he simply says, I\u2019m instructed by the White House not to answer.\n\nNow, the Republicans, unlike other witnesses who refused to answer, expressed great umbrage at this. This is unheard of; you can\u2019t do this. If we allow you to stonewall this way, then what will it do to our investigation, and future investigations? They hand him a subpoena on the spot. \n\n Now, this was extraordinary, because other witnesses who stonewalled and we said they needed to subpoena, the majority said no. \n\n Glasser: No.\n\nSchiff: Now, why did they treat him differently? Because Steve Bannon was a man without a country\u2014neither beloved in the White House, nor beloved at Breitbart. So, they give him a subpoena. He comes back now under compulsion of the subpoena, and he\u2019s got 25 questions written out for him helpfully by the White House, which are the only questions he will answer. And the answer to each one of them is no.\n\nSo, one of the questions might be, did you meet with so-and-so? And the answer he tells us is no. Now, that would give you the impression that he had no communication with that person. So, I would ask, \u201cDid you speak with that person?\u201d and the answer was yes. And, what did you say? I am not answering that question.\n\nGlasser: So, he was making a distinction between meeting and speaking?\n\n\n\n Schiff: Yes. Well, and I\u2019m sure the White House didn\u2019t even want him to acknowledge that he had even spoken to the person, but the whole goal of the White House was to mislead us and to stonewall us. Now, the Republicans in that case, quite apart from other witnesses, again expressed great umbrage. How dare you come in here and to claim executive privilege\u2014which he was then doing\u2014in such a broad way is unsustainable, and blah, blah, blah. We\u2019re going to have to insist. We\u2019re going to have to initiate contempt proceedings. We can\u2019t stand for this. Well, that was over a month ago, and it\u2019s been radio silence since.\n\nNow, why did the Republicans never follow up? Two reasons why they didn\u2019t follow up. The first is, they soon realized after they did that, they couldn\u2019t defend their treatment of other witnesses like Hope Hicks and Cory Lewandowski, and others who similarly came in and stonewalled on key questions. So, that was a big problem.\n\nBut the second reason is, they didn\u2019t really want to know the answers. They wanted, I suppose, to punish Steve Bannon, but they didn\u2019t want to know the answers. And that\u2019s the more fundamental problem with how they conducted the investigation.\n\nGlasser: So, I know we\u2019re going to run out of time, but, what will you do differently if you\u2019re the chairman? Will you, first of all, will you just restart the investigation where it is right now? Would you release all these documents?\n\nSchiff: First of all, I think the Republicans did a real disservice in not bringing in the witnesses that we\u2019d been asking them for months to bring in. We could have moved this investigation much more expeditiously if they had done that. What we will do if we take over the majority is we will look at the work that\u2019s been done, the work that\u2019s been done by the Senate, the work that\u2019s been done by Bob Mueller\u2014and decide, did they do all the work? Did they finish the investigation, or are there parts of the investigation that were still left undone? So, we\u2019ll reserve judgment.\n\nOne of the issues that really concerns me, and it may go or it may not, to the reports of Mueller\u2019s subpoenaing the Trump Organization is, we were never allowed to investigate money laundering.\n\nGlasser: Right. So, you talked about this in your report\u2014Deutsche Bank and the like\u2014you wanted to go there and the majority said no.\n\nSchiff: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. And the reason why this is so significant\u2014when we began the investigation, the allegations that the Trump campaign had secret meetings with the Russians were nothing more than allegations. The allegations of money laundering were allegations.\n\nSome of the allegations we were allowed to investigate, and we found actually\u2014okay, this turned out to be very true; there were all these secret meetings with the Russians. We were never allowed to investigate whether the Russians are holding financial leverage over the president. That\u2019s a vulnerability for our country that could influence what the president\u2019s position is on sanctions over Ukraine or sanctions over election interference or why he seemingly is incapable of criticizing Vladimir Putin. Do they have a financial hammer over his head?\n\nIt\u2019s derelict for us not to find out, and we could find out, I think, in fairly short order. And the first place to stop would be Deutsche Bank. So, I hope that Bob Mueller has the license to do that; it\u2019s within the scope of his investigation, but we didn\u2019t have the chance, and neither does the Senate. The Senate is not authorized either to look at this, and someone in the public interest needs to find out whether the Russians are holding financial leverage over our president.\n\nGlasser: So, on Sunday there will be an election\u2014I\u2019m putting quotes around it\u2014in Russia, and Vladimir Putin, of course, is expected to win another six-year term in office. He\u2019s already the longest-serving Russian leader since Stalin. A lot of people here in the U.S., even liberals, are worried that our Russiagate obsession has both overshadowed and distorted the real challenge of what Putin\u2019s actually doing in the world. Is this a modern-day Red scare that we\u2019re having? And, have we become obsessed with 2016 at the expense of looking forward?\n\nYou\u2019ve been a leading proponent out there publicly all the time saying this Russia investigation is serious and it has to be taken seriously. Do you worry about that at all? That we\u2019ve sort of made Vladimir Putin a 10-foot-tall figure in our own politics?\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t worry that we have overstated the danger by Putin and Russia. What I do worry about, and this is something, and I\u2019m glad you asked this question\u2014but I always try to emphasize in talking about the Russia investigation and why people should care about it, is what the Russians did here, they\u2019ve been doing all over the world. It was only new to us. And what we see going on around the world is a real rise of authoritarianism.\n\nWe see autocrats on the rise in Hungary, in Poland, in the Philippines, in Turkey. We see the rise of far-right parties in Germany and in Austria and France. This is part of a global challenge to the very idea of democracy. America needs to push back and fight back and be the champion of democracy and a free press and a free society, and right now we are not. At least not in the White House.\n\nGlasser: So, you don\u2019t think those sanctions this week were a sufficient response to the Russian attack in the United States?\n\nSchiff: Not at all. I think the message they sent to Vladimir Putin was, this administration is going to do the absolute minimum. Many of the people on that list to be sanctioned were people that have already been sanctioned by Barack Obama. This is from the president who says he\u2019s so much tougher than Barack Obama.\n\nThe other people on the list, with only two exceptions, were people that Bob Mueller named, that this administration made no effort to identify; that was Bob Mueller\u2019s work. We\u2019re not likely to get those people here, and the economic impact of that very limited set of sanctions isn\u2019t going to make much difference to the Russians. So, I think they were really seriously inadequate and sent exactly the wrong message.\n\nGlasser: In the intelligence committee there was a public announcement the other day that even more cyberattacks from Russia had occurred, including on our power infrastructure, our nuclear power infrastructure. This started at the same time, really, as this election intervention in 2015. I thought that was a wow story.\n\nAre you aware in a broad sense that there are more things yet to become public about the components of this Russian campaign inside the United States, which seemed to have all ramped up after the 2014 intervention in Crimea?\n\nSchiff: Yeah, there was certainly a lot that I can\u2019t discuss that I would characterize as a broad-ranging threat from Russia.\n\nGlasser: So, it\u2019s not just internet trolls?\n\nSchiff: It\u2019s not just internet trolls. There is a broad ideological fight globally over the idea of democracy, that the Russians are trying to tear down. There are cyberattacks and infiltrations by the Russians into all kinds of systems.\n\nGlasser: Including things that are not pubic?\n\nSchiff: Yes. There are military threats posed by the Russians, and treaty violations by the Russians. There are, obviously, poisonings by the Russians around the world on foreign soil, political assassinations. Of course, the Russians invaded their neighbor; they propped up a regime that was gassing its own people in Syria. These are bad actors, and they\u2019re not our friend. They\u2019re not going to be our friend simply because the president says nice things about Putin or refrains from saying bad things about Putin.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to need to stand up to them, because the only thing the Russians respect is strength. They don\u2019t see that in this president; they see weakness. And they also see in this president someone they can manipulate just by saying flattering things. And that\u2019s a real danger to this country, and it\u2019s a danger to our allies, and we need to step up to this challenge.\n\nGlasser: But you don\u2019t worry that Putin\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re also playing into his hands, though, if he needed a war on the West in order to justify the legitimacy of his own election. We sort of handed him that, right?\n\nSchiff: Putin has viewed his ticket to the grand stage and Russia\u2019s resurrection as coming at the expense of the United States. We can wish it were otherwise; that was true before Donald Trump arrived on the scene. It will be true after Donald Trump leaves the scene. That\u2019s just the reality of who this KGB operative that\u2019s become the president of Russia. So, we have to deal with it. I don\u2019t think it plays into his hands; it\u2019s just a reality. I don\u2019t think we should make him 10 feet tall, and I think this poisoning in London was a tragic miscalculation on Putin\u2019s part. But, we need to recognize that Russia at the present is a malevolent force that needs to be pushed back.\n\nGlasser: So, Donald Trump has called you \u201cLittle Adam Schiff.\u201d Do you have a nickname for him? And do you think right now are you ready say he should be impeached?\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t have a nickname for him. You know, the first impulse\u2014and I\u2019ve been the subject of now many nicknames from the president\u2014you know, it\u2019s so absurd that you want to laugh. And then, it\u2019s such a diminishment of the Oval Office, it makes you want to cry.\n\nGlasser: Last week\u2019s guest on this show was Chuck Todd, who was called a sleepy-eyed son of a bitch by the president.\n\nSchiff: Yes. Well. You know, these are the kind of grade-school insults that you see lobbed from the White House. So, we don\u2019t want to get down in the sandbox with him. I think, frankly, the best way to respond to his Twitter insults is with humor and mockery. He makes himself a very easy target of being mocked, and so when he tweets at me early in the morning from watching Fox and getting all upset in his bathrobe\u2014we point out that clearly he\u2019s had a busy morning of \u201cexecutive time.\u201d I think that\u2019s the best way to respond. With this president, I think you need to push back hard, but you don\u2019t need to push back dirty; you don\u2019t need to get down to his level.\n\nSchiff: I don\u2019t favor people talking about impeachment. I tried an impeachment case in the Senate some years ago involving a corrupt federal judge, and there\u2019s a legal standard, and what constitutes a high crime and misdemeanor, but there\u2019s a political standard, too. And I think the political standard is, if we give the country the impression this is something we are eager to embrace, even before the investigation is done\u2014now, the House may say their investigation is done, but the investigation isn\u2019t done, by any means.\n\nIf we give the country that impression, then if the evidence does warrant it, it\u2019s going to be a much harder case to make. So, let\u2019s finish our investigative work\u2014we\u2019re going to continue, as Democrats on the committee\u2014to do our investigative work. We\u2019re still learning more from the intelligence community. We still have witnesses who are willing to come in and talk with us, even if the Republicans aren\u2019t interested in listening.\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to continue to do our work, and Bob Mueller\u2019s going to continue to do his, and the Senate will do theirs, and when we\u2019re done, then we can decide does that rise to the level of a removal from office.\n\nGlasser: So, that\u2019s Congressman Adam Schiff, who is our guest, our only repeat guest so far on The Global POLITICO, coming full circle after the beginning of the House Intelligence Committee investigation, and now back to the end. One final question. You\u2019ve impressed many of your fellow Democrats in your very public and vocal communicating with people about this investigation. You\u2019re now even talked about as a potential successor to Nancy Pelosi, should the Democrats win the House. Would you consider running for speaker?\n\nSchiff: Well, I\u2019m for Nancy. I think she\u2019s the most talented person we have in the caucus and I don\u2019t think there is even a close second. So, my hope is that she stays and is our speaker if we take back the majority. What people don\u2019t realize, I think, is a couple of things. First, whoever has that job in the post-Newt Gingrich era is going to be shredded, going to be torn apart. And you won\u2019t recognize them after a certain of time.\n\nAnd the second thing is, we are a very difficult caucus to keep together. We\u2019re a very diverse caucus. Unlike the Republican Conference, we are very diverse, and you really need someone with the kind of skill set that she has to keep us together, and she does an extraordinary job of it.\n\nGlasser: So, that was sort of a non-denial denial.\n\nSchiff: Well, I hope she stays; I hope she becomes our speaker.\n\nGlasser: But you would not rule out seeking to follow her?\n\nSchiff: Well, I honestly don\u2019t know what my future holds in the sense that I had thought about running for the Senate if Senator Feinstein retired, and I told the senator I was a full supporter of hers. I hope she would run again, and if she did I would support her. And she has run again and is running again.\n\nSo, I hadn\u2019t thought about it much other than that, and haven\u2019t had much time to think about much other than what I\u2019m doing in the day job. Right now, what I am doing is traveling around the country, trying to help take back the House. And so, when I\u2019m not working on my day job, that\u2019s my night job.\n\nGlasser: All right. Well, stay tuned, folks. It sounds like there might be an interesting decision in your future. Congressman Adam Schiff, thank you so much for joining us on The Global POLITICO, and of course, thank you to our audience\u2014as always, the best audience on podcast, and you can email me or write any time at sglasser@politico.com, and you can listen to us on Apple podcasts.

I raised $43 million, and I needed another 20,\u201d said Wendy Davis, the former Democratic state senator who became a national cause in her 2014 run for Texas governor after mounting a headline-grabbing filibuster in an attempt to stop a law that would restrict abortion rights in the state.\n\nDavis lost by 21 points. She expects O\u2019Rourke will do \u201cfar better,\u201d in part because of the difference in the national political climate between 2014 and 2018\u2014and in part because she expects that the 43,000 people who\u2019ve chipped in a few dollars for O\u2019Rourke will be motivated to help push him to do more.\n\nO\u2019Rourke wants to be seen as a renegade, running against all the conventional wisdom and usual politicking. He claimed victory on primary night in an off-kilter webcam Facebook Live chat from the dining room table of the row house he shares with a few colleagues on Capitol Hill; he\u2019s planning to drive through all 254 counties in Texas (he\u2019s hit 226 so far); he\u2019s refusing to spend money on focus groups or pollsters; he casually curses in interviews\u2014and makes sure he\u2019s doing interviews all the time. He points out that he voted against Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader and insists he got in the race against Cruz without any commitment of help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nAll that can generate some eye rolls in Washington\u2014like from people who point out that the DSCC doesn\u2019t commit to help any nonincumbent a year out, or who laugh at how much press he does\u2014but it\u2019s also been generating hundreds of people showing up at events in parts of the state that haven\u2019t seen a candidate in years.\n\n\u201cI can understand how people think that this is crazy that I think that I\u2019m going to win. But so much of this is crazy. Right? Like, what is this guy doing from El Paso? El Paso has produced precisely zero statewide victories in the history of the state of Texas. Last time a Democrat won was in 1988, for U.S. Senate, Lloyd Bentsen. So why in the world, against Ted Cruz of all people? That guy almost won the Republican presidential nomination,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI think the confidence is borne not out of any kind of mental illness, but out of what I am seeing and hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a state like Texas, you\u2019re not going to win unless you\u2019re fearless. And Beto\u2019s fearless,\u201d said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, who predicted O\u2019Rourke is on his way to do better than any Democrat statewide since Ann Richards, Texas\u2019 charismatic late governor. \u201cHe still has a ways to go to catch up to Ted [Cruz], but he\u2019s a lot closer than anybody ever believed he\u2019d be at this point in the election.\u201d\n\nNational help isn\u2019t materializing for O\u2019Rourke, but that\u2019s the way he wants it. Ever since Georgia\u2019s special election for U.S. House last June\u2014when the Democratic candidate, an out-of-district documentary filmmaker, raised $23 million and still lost\u2014Democrats who\u2019ve avoided becoming national causes have been able to compete in elections with bigger impacts and closer numbers.\n\nOf celebrity support, O\u2019Rourke says, Alyssa Milano and others can keep their tweets.\n\n\u201cShe is, I am sure, a great person,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is going to be decided by Texas and by Texans.\u201d\n\nSo far, swearing off PAC money and relying on small donors, he\u2019s raised $8 million, including tripling Cruz\u2019s haul in the last quarter of 2017. Democrats got excited: What if Texas becomes the seat that tips them into the majority this year? (They\u2019re so excited, they\u2019re using math that assumes they\u2019ll hold every Senate seat in Trump country and have at least one other pickup.)\n\nThen again, Cruz already has more money on hand, has a national fundraising base from his presidential run to tap, and is assumed to be in line for as much outside money as he could possibly want. A spokesperson for Cruz didn\u2019t respond when asked to make the senator available for an interview.\n\nTo date, Cruz\u2019s response to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s primary victory in early March\u2014which he did with less than 62 percent of the vote, worrying Texas Democrats that he may not be able to unite the party in a way that matches his media appeal\u2014has been in the form of releasing a country jingle calling O\u2019Rourke a \u201cliberal man\u201d (in contrast to being a tough and honest Texan); mocking him for going by \u201cBeto,\u201d the nickname he\u2019s used since childhood; and declaring, \u201che wants those open borders and wants to take our guns.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded to the nickname jab by tweeting a photo of himself as a young child in a sweater with \u201cBeto\u201d on it. As for being a liberal, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I am on the spectrum,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says, though he\u2019s fine banning AR-15s, has sponsored only bipartisan bills in the House and was one of the two dozen Democrats who broke with the party to give Obama authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. As for not being tough, O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that stuff means.\u201d\n\nWhat he does see in Cruz is a person who\u2019s crumpled on many of his beliefs and principled stands in search of support for another presidential run.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how else to explain the turnabout from asking the delegates at the Republican National Convention to vote their conscience to the picture of him at a phone bank dialing for Donald Trump; from saying that \u2018I\u2019m not in the habit of endorsing people who malign my wife and my father,\u2019 to being his most full-throated supporter in the Senate right now,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else explains it.\u201d\n\nHe treasures the brief conversation he had with Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who sat in the row ahead of him at the State of the Union and leaned over to tell him, \u201cYou can do this.\u201d Trump won Alabama by 28 points and Texas by only 9, O\u2019Rourke noted, and Roy Moore was polling better in Alabama on the eve of that election than Cruz is in Texas today.\n\nAmong O\u2019Rourke\u2019s friends in Washington who let themselves believe, even for a second, that he might win, their brains start tap dancing to the next step. The vice presidential shortlist for sure, they say\u2014maybe even president, if he can take Texas with him.\n\nO\u2019Rourke pledges to serve his full six-year term if elected, and to limit himself to two terms, but loops that discussion right back to his big attack on Cruz, who, he complains, became so quickly consumed with running for president after winning (on the same day in 2012 that O\u2019Rourke was first elected to Congress himself) that they\u2019ve rarely talked about anything in six years serving together in the Texas delegation.\n\nThat\u2019s held since he announced his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can remember him saying is maybe the first time we saw each other after I announced, he said something like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be an interesting campaign,\u2019 or something. You know, nice, you know, a nice thing. And he had just, for the first time in the five years that he had been in the Senate, had just visited El Paso, which is the sixth-largest city,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Hey, heard you were in El Paso. We\u2014as an El Pasoan, as a constituent of yours\u2014are grateful that you showed up.

Republicans have largely defended Sessions, but lawmakers in both parties are eager to see the flap aired out in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   The Judiciary panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), this week said he would hold hearings on the still-unreleased DOJ inspector general\u2019s report, which underpinned Sessions' firing of McCabe. Although all 10 Democrats on the committee have urged Grassley to ask for \u201can advance and embargoed copy of\u201d the report and called on DOJ \u201cto explain the timing and manner of this firing,\u201d whether the GOP would insist on testimony from Sessions himself remains an open question.\n \n Democrats would welcome the chance to put Sessions back on the hot seat for the first time since last fall. And it\u2019s not just the McCabe firing that Democrats want to dig into. \n \n Should Sessions return to his former home in the Senate for the first time since two ex-Trump campaign aides pleaded guilty to lying to investigators, he can also expect sharp questions on his shifting statements about Trump campaign contacts with Russia.\n \n Sessions \u201ceither made a false statement or misled the committee\u201d in the past when discussing contacts with Russia, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in an interview. \u201cI think that that\u2019s not a question \u2014 that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n \n The attorney general told the Judiciary panel at his confirmation hearing last year that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians,\u201d only to later revise himself after reports of two meetings with the then-Russian ambassador. Sessions said he attended those meetings in his role as a senator, not a Trump campaign adviser, although media reports have suggested the two discussed campaign-related issues.\n \n McCabe himself authorized a criminal inquiry into Sessions' Senate testimony last year in response to a request from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), ABC reported Wednesday. That move is bound to raise further questions among Democrats already concerned about politicization driving Sessions' firing of McCabe less than two days before the former FBI No. 2's scheduled retirement.\n \n Sessions \u201cwasn\u2019t forthcoming with the truth,\u201d Booker said before ABC's report, adding that \u201cit sounds eerily familiar to what the IG\u2019s accusing McCabe about.\u201d \n \n The DOJ\u2019s inspector general has found that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to media about an ongoing investigation and then misled investigators about it \u2014 an allegation McCabe denies.\n \n A source close to Sessions said the attorney general was unaware of the probe McCabe opened when he decided on the firing. Chuck Cooper, Sessions' lawyer, said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is not currently investigating Sessions' congressional testimony.\n \n \"The special counsel's office has informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting additional investigation, the Attorney General is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,\" Cooper said in a statement.\n \n A DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Sessions would consider testifying in the Senate Judiciary Committee if asked. A spokesman for Grassley said that the panel first would \"need to review\" the inspector general's report and the recommendation for McCabe's firing from the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility before deciding on witnesses for a hearing.\n \n But several Democrats on the committee, including ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, made clear this week that they would want Sessions himself to discuss the unique circumstances behind McCabe\u2019s firing.\n \n It\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d for the attorney general to personally address the McCabe firing, Feinstein told reporters, adding that she has \"a lot of questions.\" Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) also issued a call for Sessions' testimony hours after McCabe's firing.\n \n Leahy and Franken sent three requests for an FBI inquiry into Sessions\u2019 communications with Russian officials last year, raising concerns about false statements \u2014 the first two to Comey, dinging Sessions for \"lack of candor,\" the same ethics breach that resulted in McCabe\u2019s dismissal.\n \n The Democrats\u2019 sent their third letter seeking a Sessions probe to McCabe, three days after McCabe became acting FBI director following Trump\u2019s firing of Comey. \n \n Another hot-button issue that Democrats want addressed: how Sessions' recusal from investigative matters related to Hillary Clinton's email server and family foundation squares with his decision to fire McCabe over the ex-FBI No. 2's disclosures to the media about its probe of the Clinton Foundation.\n \n \"I have concerns about his respect to the scope of his recusal,\" said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), another Judiciary Committee member. \"I also have concerns that the president is inappropriately influencing the leadership of the Department of Justice.\"\n \n DOJ points to existing internal regulations to note that, while Sessions is recused from investigative matters relating to the 2016 election, that recusal does not cover personnel or employee misconduct decisions such as McCabe\u2019s firing or last year's Comey firing.\n \n With the IG\u2019s report still under wraps and subject to potential delays, Democrats who challenged the timing of McCabe\u2019s termination face political pitfalls of their own in any effort to probe more deeply.\n \n Before seeing the results of the DOJ watchdog\u2019s probe, it\u2019s impossible for them to know whether McCabe\u2019s behavior documented within it undercuts his claim to be a target of Trump administration allies who want to \"undermine my credibility\" ahead of likely cooperation with Mueller.\n \n \"What\u2019s been widely reported, and I assume it\u2019s true, is Mr. McCabe leaked classified information and lied, including but not limited to lied under oath,\u201d another Judiciary panel Republican, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, said in an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a firing offense.\"\n \n Trump's GOP allies in the House have largely applauded Sessions' decision to fire McCabe, calling it a justified action after a year of questions about his role in both the Clinton investigation and Mueller's Russia probe.\n \n Senate Republicans on the Judiciary panel have offered more measured responses, welcoming the chance for a hearing on the inspector general's report while stopping short of passing judgment on conclusions they have yet to see.\n \n \"I want the country to understand what happened. Was it political reprisal or was it justified?\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \"I think it\u2019d be good for the country to understand the basis of the firing.\"\n \n Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) agreed with Grassley's camp that lawmakers should first get a complete look at the inspector general's and internal FBI recommendations.\n\n \"I'm sure the attorney general will be testifying\" at some point soon, Cornyn told reporters, as part of his periodic returns to the Hill. \"[S]o people will have their shot at him. But I'd like to get the facts first.\"\n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Republicans, usually the champions of family values and small government, now want to restrict family reunification and give bureaucrats the power to screen people who want to enter the country. Democrats, traditionally the allies of the working class, want big business to select immigrants and have given scant attention to the legitimate interests of working-class natives.\n\nThe only way to end this politically charged debate is to think carefully about benefits and costs as well as politics and perceptions. We need a new immigration system that offers liberal admission policies but targets its benefits to native workers rather than corporations.\n\nEconomic research provides little doubt that immigration benefits our economy. Highly educated immigrants offer their skills, entrepreneurial drive and much-needed expertise for our most important industries. Low-skilled migrants are willing to do back-breaking but vitally important labor that most Americans refuse. Both types bring their purchasing power, which increases the demand for American services and American-made goods, and their cultural heritage, which enriches ours.\n\nThe problem posed by migration is that the benefits are not evenly distributed. They flow to the migrants themselves and the corporations that hire them. Consumers do receive better products and lower prices, but ordinary people don\u2019t really perceive these benefits. And working-class people may suffer a decline in their wages (some or many of them, depending on which economist you ask, but most agree the decline is not large), or (certainly, in most cases) believe that immigration undercuts their wages and threatens their cultural values.\n\nSo, immigration expands the economic pie but gives too meager a slice to ordinary people. The goal must be to retain, and in fact expand, immigration while ensuring that its benefits are distributed fairly. The current system does the opposite: channeling the benefits of migration to immigrants and domestic elites. Right now, special classes of citizens\u2014mostly corporations (and in practice, big corporations) and family members\u2014can sponsor temporary or permanent migrants, benefiting shareholders mainly, as well as ethnic enclaves.\n\nThis system should be wiped away and replaced with a system of citizenship sponsorship for immigrants that we call a Visas Between Individuals Program. Under this new system, all citizens would have the right to sponsor a migrant for economic purposes.\n\nHere\u2019s how the program would work: Imagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay.\n\nSofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nWhile the program might seem crazy at first, it would not be that different from the existing H1-B program, except that individuals like Mary rather than corporations like Google and Exxon would sponsor the workers. Second, the program is not that different from the au pair program run by the State Department, nominally under the J-1 cultural exchange visa program, but in reality a nanny migrant-labor program used by upper-middle class American families.\n\nA Visas Between Individuals Program would extend the benefits of these types of immigration programs to everyone, rather than just to corporations and the affluent. It would also achieve the goals of both sides of the immigration debate\u2014better than their own proposals do. Immigrants would no longer have special privileges to sponsor family members, while working-class voters would enjoy dramatic benefits.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a typical family of four could boost its income by $10,000 to 20,000 by hosting migrants. The reason is that migrants to the United States usually increase their wages many times, allowing them to pay as much as $6,000 to hosts for sponsorships (and our average family could sponsor up to four visas, one for each member).\n\nThis financial benefit for working families would be a larger increase in income than they have received over the last 40 years of economic growth. (Median household income in the United States was about $50,000 in 1977 and is roughly $59,000 today.) At the same time, a Visas Between Individuals Program would be true to Republican free-market and small-government principles by drastically reducing the role of government bureaucrats, who would merely run security checks on migrants rather than trying to evaluate their likely contributions to the economy.\n\nMany people will worry that the Sofias of the world would be exploited by their sponsors. But all health and safety laws would apply to them, and periodic inspections could be undertaken (as exist for the J-1 au pair program, where admittedly occasional exploitation also occurs). Yes, Mary would be able to pay Sofia less than the minimum wage, but even at $5 an hour, Sofia would earn many times what she earns on a farm in Paraguay. Sofia would be free to leave at any time if she did not like the conditions of her employment. Effectively, this system allows the benefits of exchange in international labor that are permitted by online labor markets like Fiverr and Amazon Mechanical Turk to extend to a much broader range of tasks that need to be done in person, from dog walking to construction work.\n\nWouldn\u2019t lower-income Americans oppose a Visas between Individuals Program because of fears that these immigrants would take away their jobs? At first, maybe. But they would soon realize that they can use the program to make money for themselves. Like Sofia, many Americans would like to start or expand small businesses. Others might try, in entrepreneurial fashion, to find foreign workers for American businesses\u2014which would not be allowed to sponsor migrants under our proposal\u2014taking a cut in the process. Google and Exxon would need to pay people like Mary to find migrants for their businesses. Other Americans would sponsor migrants for low-skilled agricultural work, or to work in factories that move back on shore to take advantage of newly available cheap labor, or to work in their own businesses. A great free market using migrant labor would flourish, creating new jobs for working class natives as supervisors and agents. (Wealthy families could sponsor migrants, too, but there are fewer of them, and they would likely find a $6,000 boost in income not worth the trouble\u2014while the money would be a tremendous gain for sponsors with more limited prospects.)\n\nOne of the most fascinating findings of social scientists is that the people who oppose immigration the most are not those who live among migrants. The fear of migrants is largely based on ignorance about who they are. That\u2019s why people who live among migrants tend to support immigration or not to oppose it too much. By making sponsorship accessible to all Americans, a Visas Between Individuals Program would spread migrants throughout the United States rather than concentrating them in Silicon Valley, the big cities, and certain agricultural areas near the southern border. Sponsors will normally want the migrants they sponsor to live near them. Or Americans might move to areas of high migrant demand to take advantage of the opportunity to sponsor migrants there. It is hard to demonize the person who lives in your basement, or the basement of your neighbor, and has increased your income greatly. Most migrants, even those who came here illegally, obey the law and work extremely hard, in ways that are hard not to admire.\n\nA Visas Between Individuals Program would offer advantages to working people, while preserving America\u2019s historic commitment to immigration. Democrats should understand that it would increase the wealth and well-being of low-income Americans and impoverished foreigners, while Republicans should appreciate how it would contribute to economic growth, which offers benefits to all. Moreover, a Visas Between Individuals Program does so in the spirit of the market, by allowing every citizen to choose how she uses her right to sponsor visas rather than allowing corporations or governments to manage migration. The program puts the burden of responsibility and choice as well as the freedom to profit on hard-working Americans who seek to better their lot.\n\nImmigration is just one of any number of social problems that can be solved with what we call \u201cradical markets.\u201d By exploiting the logic of the market in an area that is normally bureaucratized, we can advance equality as well as economic growth.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jack Shafer", "body": "For the longest time, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of the Russia mess looked like a backyard drainage ditch. Into it flowed a regular stream of witnesses, evidence and press speculation. But when was it ever going to amount to anything real? When was Mueller going to rent a hydraulic excavator and dig for real glory? After accepting the guilty pleas of Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, and spraying Paul Manafort with a few dozen indictments, the Mueller ditch had grown big enough to serve as a family plot. But dedicated followers of the scandal made no effort to hide their disappointment. Is this what prosecutorial dither looks like?\n\nThen, two weeks ago, Mueller\u2019s modest ditch opened like a sinkhole as he filed an indictment against 13 Russians and three Russian entities for monkeying with the 2016 election. Last week, the maw yawned a little wider as Manafort\u2019s former business partner Rick Gates pleaded guilty to many of the charges also filed against Manafort and agreed to turn on him. The question today is no longer: When will the Mueller machine get going? Now, it\u2019s: Who will escape Mueller\u2019s big dig?\n\nStanding at the hole\u2019s unstable rim and looking into the chasm is son-in-law Jared Kushner. He had a very bad week, suffering a humiliating downgrade from a top-secret clearance to one lower than the White House chief calligrapher. But that bad news wasn\u2019t the worst. Although still a free man with no charges filed against him, Kushner exudes legal liability, blithely mixing business interests with his role as an adviser to the president of the United States. Mueller will seize on Kushner\u2019s conflicts of interest like signposts to guide his investigative voyage.\n\nConflict No. 1: Kushner\u2019s family business accepted huge loans from two financial empires after he met with their executives in the White House. Were any laws or ethics boundaries violated? Conflict No. 2: In early 2017, he hit up Qatar\u2019s minister of finance for a loan and then a month later, with no loan forthcoming, he backed a blockade of the country. If it\u2019s a coincidence, it\u2019s a rotten one. Conflict No. 3: Officials from four countries\u2014UAE, China, Israel and Mexico\u2014think of Kushner as a sucker. They\u2019ve privately discussed using his financial weakness to manipulate him on matters of state. Conflict No. 4: What role did he play in his family\u2019s promotion of the foreign visa investment program, which has attracted the interest of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York?\n\nWill Kushner jump from the White House before Mueller pushes him into the sinkhole? Or will Kushner even get his chance to jump? White House staffers and the president are now thought to regard Kushner as a political liability, and the president has reportedly asked Chief of Staff John Kelly for help in elbowing both Jared and wife Ivanka Trump out of the White House.\n\nIvanka Trump might toss her husband a lifeline and plead with her daddy to keep them on. But she\u2019s in a precarious position, too. FBI scrutiny of a Trump Organization deal in Vancouver could block her application for a full security clearance as a presidential adviser and lend Kelly the oomph he needs to give her the full Omarosa and escort her out of the White House. Nobody is saying\u2014yet\u2014that the sinkhole will claim Ivanka. They\u2019re not saying that about her former employee, Hope Hicks, who functioned for three years as Trump\u2019s press go-between and portal to the real world. Hicks placed her big toe over the sinkhole\u2019s edge this week when she gave Capitol Hill testimony confessing to occasional white lies for her president. A communications director can\u2019t very well admit to lying and keep her job, so she resigned. Having established herself as a sometime prevaricator, Mueller will not leave her be until he unmasks the untruths he finds relevant to his investigation. If she knows anything valuable\u2014and how could she not, given that she appears to have played a role in drafting the inaccurate statement about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s notorious meeting with the Russians\u2014Mueller will extract it from her.\n\nThe Mueller machinations pointed this week to a new criminal case against the Russians suspected to have hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and distributed the emails via Wikileaks. According to NBC News, Mueller has asked witnesses how much Trump knew about the stolen emails before their theft became common knowledge, and what he did, if anything, to spur their release. Both Trump associate Roger Stone and Trump\u2019s eldest son Donald Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks. Stone appears to have foreshadowed the release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails with a tweet that said, \u201cit would soon [be] Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201d Several weeks later the stolen Podesta emails were released by WikiLeaks.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigators, who still want their interview with Trump, also want to know more about his Russophilia and his crush-like adoration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He may have already placed his staff in peril, Politico tells us, by defying his lawyers\u2019 orders not to talk to aides, including Hicks, about the Russia investigation. Current and former Trump staffers say he \u201coften fails to observe boundaries about the Russia probe and [he] calls staffers into his office and raises the subject without warning.\u201d\n\nTrump knows more about working on the edge than any politician not currently in jail. As a part-time Floridian, he should know plenty about sinkholes, too. But has he studied their geology? If the water table drops, sandy soil in the porous limestone yields and houses can disappear overnight. In 1981, a sinkhole in Winter Park, Fla., choked down a car dealership, two streets, an Olympic-sized swimming pool and a three-bedroom home. It\u2019s common for new sinkholes to pop up next to existing ones and become their partner in annihilation. As Trump would say, \u201cYuge.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m partial to tornadoes myself.

So now we\u2019ve made plans for dinner at his favorite Vietnamese spot near his Upper East Side apartment, but when he arrives 20 minutes late, Nunberg says he has already eaten at the same restaurant earlier in the day, and that he is having dinner with his mother later, so no food for him, just one Thai iced coffee after another that he cuts with water from his water glass.\n\nWords tumble out of Nunberg in a torrent, not always cohering into sentences, and occasionally contradicting something he said a few minutes ago. At our nondinner, he apologies for his ADD as he keeps going outside to vape.\n\nSam Nunberg was a name known only to a small coterie of political journalists until March 5, when it suddenly became inescapable. In a media barrage that will forever be known as The Full Nunberg, the former Donald Trump campaign aide streaked across the media landscape like a falling satellite. First he told The Washington Post that he had been subpoenaed by special counsel Robert Mueller but wouldn\u2019t show up. He then phoned in live to MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur, telling her that he thought it would be funny if Mueller arrested him for contempt of court and that \u201cTrump may very well have\u201d colluded with Russia during the election. Then he called CNN to assert that Trump didn\u2019t have anything to do with Russia, then CNN again and said that maybe Trump did, actually. He told POLITICO that Trump couldn\u2019t have colluded because he \u201ccan\u2019t keep his fucking mouth shut.\u201d It didn\u2019t end there. He repeated variations of his claims on the local news station NY1, then on MSNBC again, where a fellow panelist seemingly convinced him live on air that he would be looking at serious jail time if he didn\u2019t comply with the subpoena, and finally CNN again where host Erin Burnett asked point-blank if Nunberg was drunk. In the meantime, there were interviews with New York, The Atlantic, Vox, The Associated Press and The New York Times.\n\nPolitical Twitter went nuts. In newsrooms across America, Nunberg vanished from one screen in the TV bank only to reappear on another. Friends feared they were watching a spectacular flame-out, someone having a nervous breakdown in public and determined to go out in a blaze of glory. To Nunberg\u2014or at least to hear him tell it now\u2014it was all carefully choreographed. He was perfectly in control, seizing the chance for time in the spotlight, an out-in-the-cold political consultant cleverly leveraging the media\u2019s hunger for any inside dope about Trump.\n\nOur dinner ended up lasting nearly four hours, and at the end I\u2019m still not sure whether his accomplishment was a triumph or an embarrassment. And at a time when Trump is president\u2014a national spectacle that Nunberg himself helped engineer\u2014I\u2019m also not sure it matters anymore. There\u2019s no question, however, it was a perfect moment for our political-media age: Someone willing to bungee jump without making sure that the knot was tight enough, and a world thirsty to know what he knew about a similarly reckless administration. Was he a crazy man, or a chessmaster?\n\n\n\nEveryone who has encountered Sam Nunberg has a theory about him, and nobody is quite sure which theory is right, in part because Nunberg himself is as unreliable a narrator as you can find. He\u2019s known for making up stories to tell the press\u2014and then making up stories about those stories, so coverage turns into a hall of mirrors whose only occupant appears to be Nunberg, or (in better times) his political client.\n\nWhat drew Nunberg to politics, and to Trump, was Roy Cohn. The actual Cohn was a knife fighter of the legal world, a mentor to the young Trump who inspired the mogul\u2019s punch-back-harder, never-back-down political style. But Nunberg is talking about the Cohn of Angels in America, the one portrayed by Al Pacino, especially the part where he tells his young protege how he would have pulled the switch to execute Ethel Rosenberg himself if he could have\u2014how he leaned on the judge in her espionage case to put that \u201csweet unpreposessing woman, two kids, boo-hoo-hoo, reminded us all of our little Jewish mamas\u201d to death.\n\n\u201cWas it legal? Fuck legal,\u201d Nunberg says, jabbing his finger in the air and slowing down for a second in his best Pacino impression. \u201cAm I a nice man? Fuck nice! They say terrible things about me in The Nation? Fuck The Nation! You want to be nice or you want to be effective?! You want to make the law, or be subject to it? Choose!\u201d\n\nNunberg pauses, and resumes his own cadence. \u201cNow, is that good, is that bad, I don\u2019t know, whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me that just showed hard grit, tough, you can tell Roy Cohn, obviously Jewish, you know, tough guy, fighter, doesn\u2019t fuck around, was trying to work the system for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that that was depicted as being bad,\u201d he says, \u201cthat to me was ironic, because by the way, that\u2019s the way the sauce is made. It was like almost Machiavellian to me. But it\u2019s an out-front Machiavelli. He was open about it. On the one hand, you don\u2019t want your enemy to see you coming, but sometimes you want people to think of you as a crazy man.\u201d\n\nThe person sitting across from me appears to be the opposite of the diminutive, tightly focused Cohn. There\u2019s something hard to pin down about Nunberg. On one hand, he looks older than his 36 years, dark circles under his eyes suggesting sleepless nights, but on the other he can seem a bit like a child inflated to adult size. Cohn was a ruthlessly successful lawyer who divided his time between New York, Washington and a country house in Connecticut. Nunberg just moved out of his parents\u2019 house. Cohn was a killer; Nunberg, as former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo put it, \u201cis not a backstabbing soulless climber in an arena where that is almost required.\u201d (One friend of Nunberg\u2019s described him more as \u201ca yenta,\u201d someone who thrives on political gossip, true or not, calling friends in the political world dozens of times a day to find out the latest.) Cohn was tanned and dandyish, an aficionado of the plastic surgeon\u2019s scalpel; Nunberg is dressed plainly, in blue jeans and a sweater, though he does plan to stop by the tanning salon before it closes.\n\n\u201cI like to say I am only bad to three people in my life,\u201d Nunberg says. \u201cPeople that are disloyal to me, people that hurt my friends. Well, OK, four people. People that are disloyal to me, people that hurt my friends, people that hurt my clients, people that my clients hire me to hurt, and myself occasionally, unfortunately.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, so that\u2019s five. Those are the five people I am bad to.\u201d\n\n\n\nSam Nunberg first crossed paths with Donald Trump on April 2, 1989. It was WrestleMania V. Nunberg\u2019s father is an attorney, and worked with Gerald Schrager, Trump\u2019s longtime real estate attorney and adviser. They were sitting behind Donald and Ivana, and Donald moved the Nunbergs so he could get into a photo shot with some dignitary sitting on the other side of the ring. Nunberg was then a student at Ramaz, an elite private Jewish school on the Upper East Side that counts Michael Mukasey and Philippe Reines as alumni. His mother was a corporate attorney at the white-shoe law firm Wachtell, Lipton, and counted Bain Capital as one of her clients. They were Democrats until the Clinton era\u2014Nunberg interned with Upper West Side liberal lion Jerry Nadler\u2014when the household became, in Nunberg\u2019s words, \u201cClinton-haters.\u201d He started listening to Mark Levin on the radio.\n\nAfter college, inspired he said, by the movie Men in Black, Nunberg enrolled in Touro Law School, a fourth-tier, $40,000-a-year law school on Long Island. There he restarted the law school\u2019s Federalist Society, using it to build up a network in conservative politics. When the 2008 campaign rolled around, even though his father had done legal work for members of the Rudy Giuliani administration when they left City Hall, Nunberg volunteered for his rival in the Republican primary, Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cMitt was the most conservative candidate in the race. Frankly, he looked the best out of everybody,\u201d Nunberg says. \u201cAnd going to Touro Law School, if I went to go work for the Rudy campaign, I would be licking envelopes for the students at NYU Law School. I hate to be, but you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nHe traveled to Iowa with the Romney campaign, where, he says, he and a couple of other campaign aides concocted a stunt: They would mail anonymous letters to Iowa pastors, warning them that the IRS would come after them if they endorsed Mike Huckabee. The letters were sent from Missouri to make them less traceable.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I made the Drudge Report!\u201d Nunberg says now with evident pride.\n\nIn Iowa, he met Jay Sekulow, who leads the American Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit founded by Pat Robertson to advocate for Christian values. (Sekulow, a right-wing messianic Jew who also hosts a radio show, is now on Trump\u2019s personal legal team.) Sekulow hired him for the group\u2019s fledgling New York operation, and in 2010, when a Manhattan developer named Sharif El-Gamal attempted to build an Islamic community center in lower Manhattan, Nunberg got his first chance to kick up a dirt storm on the political scene.\n\nThe issue was the \u201cGround Zero Mosque,\u201d a building that was neither at Ground Zero nor a mosque. Anti-Islamic firebrands like Pamela Geller seized on the issue, and tried to whip up public anger at the idea of an Islamic anything near the site of World Trade Center attacks. At ACLJ, there was some hesitancy about getting involved in the issue, and \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you kidding me? This is going to be a national fucking issue! It is going to be an international issue!\u2019\u201d Nunberg says.\n\nAt a Landmarks Preservation Commission hearing, Nunberg represented a fireman who was opposed to the construction of the center, and he introduced testimony from his own uncle, who lived near the site. Building the center \u201cwould be like removing the sunken ship in Pearl Harbor to erect a memorial to the Japanese kamikazes killed in the attack,\" Nunberg told me with a big laugh. He was quoting himself. \u201cIt became an international soundbite!\u201d (This is true\u2014the soundbite landed Nunberg on NPR, was picked up by a number of newspapers and became part of the official talking points in opposition to the project.)\n\nThere was a Republican primary for governor going on in New York, and Nunberg decided to see who\u2019d be willing to take it on as a campaign issue. He says he took the story to the front-runner, former Congressman Rick Lazio, but his campaign team was ambivalent about it. Then he took it to Carl Paladino, a Buffalo developer running a long-shot campaign, and someone who had promised to take a baseball bat to Albany\u2019s entrenched political class. Paladino seized on the issue immediately, promising to use eminent domain to prevent the building\u2019s construction. He won the primary by 24 points.\n\nAs Nunberg tells the story, he kept going, and took the issue national. He says he began calling the White House desks of news organizations like AP and Reuters from an undisclosed number, leaving harassing phone messages asking, \u201cYou chicken shits, when are you going to ask [White House press secretary Robert] Gibbs about the ground zero mosque?\u201d\n\nEventually someone did, and Gibbs responded that the White House didn\u2019t want to get involved in local decision-making. But later, President Barack Obama did mention it. At a gathering at the White House the Friday evening before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Obama said he believed \"Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was at the Iftar dinner!\u201d Nunberg says. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?! That was like manna from heaven.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to know how much of this account\u2014or the Huckabee letters, or meeting Trump at WrestleMania\u2014is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. The checkable facts largely check out, but Nunberg is known as someone willing to traffic in untruths with reporters. \u201cHe likes to spread lies,\u201d said one associate of Nunberg\u2019s. \u201cHe loves to see some lie he told get into print. He thinks it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\nMost famously, he made up a story about Chris Christie fetching cheeseburgers for Trump on the campaign\u2014an anecdote that made its way into The New Yorker and which he said was justified because \u201cI despise Chris Christie. So I kept going around telling every reporter watch that fat-ass go buy hamburgers for Trump like a good little bitch.\u201d (To try to track down the true story of the story is to enter that Nunberg hall of mirrors: He claims to have made up the story, but also, in his telling, it doesn\u2019t count as making it up since it turned out to be true. A Christie spokesman vociferously denied the account, and the reporter who first brought the story to light, Ryan Lizza, then with the The New Yorker, stands by it and has denied Nunberg was his source, and for that matter, so has Nunberg.)\n\nNunberg tells me his favorite book is Trust Me, I Am Lying by former American Apparel media stuntman Ryan Holiday. \u201cThere is something about manipulating media that I love. It\u2019s like Katy Tur said: \u2018Who is Sam Nunberg? You gotta talk to him. Occasionally, he will give you something that is true, but usually you need to confirm it with three other people.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, he has limits.\n\n\u201cI have never, nor would I ever, lie to [Washington Post reporter Robert] Costa or to my Magela.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Magela. I call Maggie Haberman [of The New York Times] my Magela. You know, like Mamela. Maggie is like my aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if she feels that way, actually.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe person who really connected Nunberg with Trump is the man who he cites as his mentor: Roger Stone, the legendary dirty trickster of Republican politics, with a massive tattoo of Richard Nixon\u2019s face across his back. Nunberg became enamored of Stone for appearing, at least, to have orchestrated the downfall of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer. (Later, when Spitzer attempted a comeback run for New York City comptroller, Nunberg and Stone trolled him mercilessly, convincing a woman who claimed to operate a brothel that Spitzer frequented to run against him as a Libertarian, and bringing black socks\u2014which Spitzer was said to keep on during his liaisons\u2014to the victory night party of his opponent.) During the ground zero mosque controversy, he says, he met Stone at a bar during the New York state Republican convention. Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, was working for Paladino. That same summer, Trump offered to buy the site where the ground zero mosque was supposed to be built for $6 million, a move that was dismissed by the developer\u2019s attorneys as a \u201ccheap publicity stunt.\u201d\n\nNunberg says it was Stone who arranged for him to meet Trump for the first time. It was 2011, and Stone and Jonny Daniels, a PR agent who counts Benjamin Netanyahu as among his clients, wanted Trump to visit Israel in the run-up to another possible presidential campaign. Nunberg told him about their family connection and about meeting him at WrestleMania years before, and Trump hired him as a political jack-of-all trades, printing out news articles, keeping an eye out for political gossip, doing research and writing, handling the press and later mapping out a way that Trump could run as an independent in 2012.\n\nUntil he was broomed out four years later, Nunberg never left.\n\nTrump had been a clownish figure around New York for most of Nunberg\u2019s childhood, someone more famous for talking about sex with Howard Stern than trying to stir up populist anger against the Washington swamp. Most people in the elite Upper East Side world of private schools and corporate law firms\u2014the world Nunberg inhabited\u2014rolled their eyes at the thought of Trump, if they thought of him at all. Nunberg, though, was intrigued by the brashness and the airbrushed glamour.\n\nHe started dressing like Trump in flashy suits and ostentatious ties. He watched how would-be presidents and potentates came to kiss the ring at Trump Tower, and how Trump dealt with critics. Nunberg says he and Stone started dictating tweets to Trump\u2019s longtime assistant Rhona Graff, and Nunberg would map out on a spreadsheet a running tally of what Trump tweeted about to make sure his business and brands got enough airplay. When Jon Huntsman pointedly refused to supplicate himself before Trump like other rivals to the GOP nomination in 2012, Stone and Nunberg counseled Trump to go on the attack. \u201c@JonHuntsman has zero chance of getting the nomination,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhoever said I wanted to meet him? Time is money and I don\u2019t waste mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt blew up!\u201d says Nunberg. \u201cIt was on \u2018Entertainment Tonight,\u2018 it was in People Magazine. People were saying that Huntsman was Trump\u2019s new Rosie.\u201d\n\nWhen no one believed that Trump would actually run for president, let alone could win, Nunberg believed. \u201cTo him, Donald Trump hung the moon,\u201d Caputo said\n\nCaputo, a veteran political adviser to Trump, looks at Nunberg with an almost older-brother like affection, and he gives Nunberg significant credit for helping lay out the themes and the approach to the campaign that would launch Trump to the White House. \u201cHis DNA was all over the Trump campaign. Corey [Lewandowski] may have set him up to win, and [Paul] Manafort got him through the convention and Kellyanne [Conway] got him over the finish line, but none of that would have happened if it weren\u2019t for Sam.\u201d\n\nNunberg says the idea of a border wall with Mexico was his, inspired by watching how Paladino and Lazio approached the idea of the ground zero mosque. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, maybe we need to let some of these people in, maybe we put some of them in the back of the line, maybe we do this, maybe we do that,\u201d he said in his best impression of an immigration squish. \u201cNo, fuck that! We are building a wall and we are deporting them all. Trump\u2019s a builder anyway. And you get Mexico to pay for it! It\u2019s like one of his licensing deals!\u201d\n\nAs it happened, Nunberg barely survived into the campaign. He lost his job with Trump in August 2015 when Business Insider published a series of racist Facebook posts Nunberg had written eight years before, including one in which he called Al Sharpton\u2019s daughter a \u201cn---!\u201d Nunberg admits to writing them, and knows it was a mistake. He blames their excavation on Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who he said had it in for him from the beginning.\n\nAfterward, Nunberg fell into deep and lasting depression. He says he had trouble getting out of bed, and couldn\u2019t read or work. He credits Steve Bannon with helping him get back on his feet by giving him a bit of work, as well as the GOP operative Arthur Schwartz.\n\n\u201cThat was bad. That a very hard experience. And I wasn\u2019t good to myself. I don\u2019t want to get into it but I wasn\u2019t. It took therapy, and it took help from other people,\u201d he says, \u201cand I will admit that. And there is nothing wrong with that. But I wasn\u2019t good to myself. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNunberg watched from the sidelines as the political animal he helped feed made it all the way to the White House. As the Russia investigation intensified, he was cut off from old friends like Bannon and Stone. And as the White House whipped through personnel changes, Nunberg, whose life is political gossip, found himself less and less in the know. He would occasionally appear on the record or on background in stories about Trump when the perspective of a \u201cformer campaign aide\u201d was needed, but even those calls had begun to dry up.\n\n\n\nWhen Nunberg was subpoenaed by Robert Mueller in the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the campaign, \u201cIt brought stuff back in. At the same time I was getting these calls [from bookers and reporters] and it is almost like I am manic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo imagine, holy shit, I was called a low-level part-time consultant and suddenly I am pulling of one of the greatest media days of all time.\u201d\n\nHe views March 5 as a form of therapy, and as an unqualified professional success\n\n\u201cThis is a fact: When I did Ari Melber he won in total viewers and the demo. When I did Erin Burnett, she won in total viewers and the demo,\u201d he said, reiterating a point he brought up to me repeatedly. (He later texted me, unprompted, with a screen grab of the ratings on the date in question.) \u201cDid you notice there was one station I didn\u2019t go on that day? Fox. You know why? They are the only ones that never invited me on before. That day, I had like eight invitations from them to come on different shows, and I can show them to you.\u201d\n\nFriends were convinced Nunberg was drunk on air, and were emailing and texting television producers and hosts to get him off. Burnett asked him about it on air, telling him that she could smell alcohol on his breath. \u201cShe says to me, \u2018Are you on something?\u2019 And you know what I wanted to say? \u2018Yeah, I am on something\u2014I am on your show, giving you ratings like you never had before.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe affair set off a round of media finger-wagging, with some political journalists suggesting\u2014at the urging of Nunberg\u2019s friends\u2014that it was unethical to put him in front of all those television cameras. He was having some kind of psychotic break, he was drunk on the attention, or he was just plain drunk.\n\nNunberg isn\u2019t having any of it. He\u2019d had a drink the day before, he says, and went to his favorite bar afterward, the preppy New York enclave Dorrian\u2019s Red Hand, but all he had that day was his antidepressant medication.\n\n\u201cPeople told me I was used and abused. I knew what I was doing. I could have stopped it any time if I wanted to,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard someone on TV say, \u2018Oh Sam, he\u2019s an unbelievable attention-seeker.\u2019 There you are, sitting on fucking TV and you are telling me I am the attention-seeker.\u201d\n\nNunberg thinks Trump probably appreciated his television tour\u2014the brashness of it, for one, and the fact that he was able to command so much media attention for one night.\n\nIt was he said, a way to communicate with Trump, too. To say, \u201cWhy do I have to be drawn into your bullshit? I don\u2019t do anything to you. I want you to be successful. You know, I have a weird relationship with him. Maybe one day I can, maybe one day not. I like him. Why do I have to be drawn into his bullshit?\u201d\n\nWhen Trump fired him, as Nunberg recounts it, he told him it wasn\u2019t just the Facebook posts. He told Nunberg, \u201cEvery few months there is something new with you.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Trump did indeed tell that to Nunberg, he was right. Even cast into the outer darkness of the Trumpian orbit, Nunberg sees himself as a political operative of the highest order, always hatching, or getting embroiled in, something new. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many people at my level, I can tell you that,\u201d he said when asked about which current political professionals he admires. Like Trump, and like Cohn for that matter, Nunberg never forgets. It\u2019s been 2\u00bd years since he was fired, and he remains at war with anyone who he thinks slighted him, ever.\n\nWhen the Drudge Report published the news that Trump had named Brad Parscale his 2020 campaign manager, it was the same day that it was announced that Jared Kushner was losing his security clearance and that top Kushner aide Josh Raffel was leaving the White House. Nunberg, who considers Kushner a leftist who leaked to Drudge, sent an email to Drudge with the subject line, \u201cSorry Asshole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour little escapade failed,\u201d Nunberg wrote. \u201cThe Parscale announcement doesn\u2019t outdo Raffel leaving and your crush losing his security access. Fuck you sellout bitch hypocrite. You useless aggregator. Go shoot yourself up with more drugs. Warm regards, Sam.\u201d\n\nAnd Nunberg continues to be at war with Lewandowski. He told me with evident pride that he orchestrated the story of Lewandowski and Hope Hicks\u2019 argument that landed on Page Six in New York Post. \u201cWe are like high school mean girls. The whole Trump circle. We fight and we try to kill each other and then some of us make up in a week and some of us don\u2019t and some of us will always hate each other.\u201d\n\nTrump and Nunberg haven\u2019t talked since December 2015, Nunberg says. That\u2019s when Gawker published Trump\u2019s cellphone number, and Trump accused Nunberg of leaking it. (Nunberg thinks Lewandowski did it just to undermine him, so that Trump would be forced to abandon his cellphone and Nunberg would be unable to communicate with him.) He wrote Trump a letter after he was elected, telling him how proud he was of the president. Trump wrote a nice note back.\n\n\u201cI said a lot of bad things that day when I was stressed out [on television.] He did give me a lot of chances, and if it was up to him I would be on that campaign. He is not a bad guy. He is actually a sweet guy, frankly. He has a heart.\u201d\n\nCaputo says all of the people from the early of days of the Trump for president gambit are \u201clike an island of misfit toys. Sam is the jack-in-the-box.\n\n\u201cHe left his heart in Trump Tower,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cI just hope he finds it someday.\u201d\n\nUnlike some others who fell out of Trump\u2019s orbit, Nunberg has nothing to fall back on\u2014no job on Wall Street, no Kennedy School post waiting for him. He can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, leverage his former access to the White House to get work. He has a small consulting business that has only three clients for now, all of whom he declined to name. Nunberg listens to Preet Bharara\u2019s podcast to find out what\u2019s going on in the Russia investigation\u2014and if he gets wrapped up in it further, it will cost him tens of thousands of dollars. Someone who just got back on his feet could easily find himself knocked off them again, and his star turn before the klieg lights doesn\u2019t appear to have helped matters much.\n\nThe lure of those lights, however, is not something he has been able to avoid. In fact, Nunberg\u2019s media tour has slowed down only slightly since that Monday. He was on Ari Melber the next day, and ABC radio, and CNN, and was fielding requests throughout our conversation. They get less and less attention though, just another talking head talking his way through the news of the day. After his star turn digging in against Mueller, he quickly reversed himself and said he would in fact cooperate with the special counsel.\n\nOur dinner, such as it was, ended sometime around 10 p.m. He kept checking the mirror, wondering if he needed to get to the tanning salon, if his face was too red for TV. His mother kept calling, and he kept on pushing back their dinner, eventually canceling it, saying he was being interviewed for a profile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut that stuff down?\u201d she wanted to know. Eventually he had to go. The tanning salon was about to close, and he needed one more turn under the lights.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachael Bade", "body": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    Congressional leaders on verge of massive spending deal \n                        \n\n                \n                        But lawmakers will have to move quickly to avoid a shutdown on Friday night.\n\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n\n        \n            By HEATHER CAYGLE, BURGESS EVERETT and RACHAEL BADE\n\n    03/21/2018 09:09 AM EDT\n\n                    \n\n\n        \n\nCongressional leaders are nearing agreement on a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, staving off a shutdown if both chambers can act by Friday night.\n \n Most major issues, including funding for a massive New York transportation project and the border wall have been resolved. But negotiators are still haggling over a plan to fix a snafu in the GOP\u2019s tax law \u2014 the so-called \u201cgrain glitch\u201d \u2014 that ag state lawmakers are seeking.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is opposed to the latest proposed \u201cgrain glitch\u201d fix, delaying the announcement of a final deal, according to two sources. But a Democratic aide disputes that the grain glitch standoff is the only thing holding up a deal, saying multiple issues, including provisions related to guns, are still in question.\n \n The Big Four \u2014 Pelosi, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2014 will meet later Wednesday morning to hash out the final details with text expected to be posted at noon.\n \n Congressional leaders are still hoping to avoid the need for a short-term spending bill to keep the government open for a few days beyond Friday. But if the spending bill is released Wednesday as planned, the House will likely vote on the measure Thursday, giving the Senate just one day to clear the deal before funding expires.\n \n Under this timetable, any single senator could cause a brief government shutdown under Senate rules and push work into the weekend. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul has pointedly refused to rule out doing so.\n \n The bill provides nearly $1.6 billion for border security, but does not include any money for an increase in detention beds or federal deportation agents, a key priority for Democrats in the talks.\n \n The deal provides $641 million for new fencing, including levees, but does not allocate money for a concrete wall, according to a source familiar with the agreement. The proposal also includes nearly $1.3 billion for other border security technologies. \n \n Negotiators also agreed to a compromise of sorts on the Gateway project. President Donald Trump had vowed to veto the must-pass spending bill if it included funding for the $900 million tunnel project, a top priority for Schumer and other New York and New Jersey lawmakers.\n \n The bill doesn\u2019t provide the specific funding for the project but does include funding increases for other federal transportation accounts, including Amtrak, that will allow tunnel construction to begin.\n \n Pelosi is holding up an agreement on one of the final sticking points, according to two sources familiar with the issue: a deal to fix a glitch in the GOP\u2019s tax law in exchange for a temporary boost in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.\n \n One of the sources said Pelosi is blocking a \u201cthree-corners\u201d agreement between Ryan, McConnell and Schumer because of concerns about her own growers in California \u2014 even as some Democrats from agriculture states join Republicans in their desire to fix the problem.\n \n The so-called \u201cgrain glitch\u201d lowers the tax bills of farmers that sell grain to cooperatives but at the expense of other farmers. Democrats at one point had sworn off allowing Republicans to iron out problems in their partisan tax bill passed last December. But many vulnerable swing-state and swing-district Democrats also want the relief for their own agriculture sectors back home.\n \n Pelosi\u2019s opposition comes just a day after Ryan also rejected a separate deal on the matter that had the backing of Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell. Democrats sought an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that Senate Republicans were ready to grant, but Ryan vetoed the proposal. Since then, a source familiar said Ryan, McConnell and Schumer have agreed to an increase in the annual housing credit for the poor for four years as well as some changes to income averaging rules.\n \n In the end, congressional leaders ended up abandoning negotiations on many of the most controversial provisions lawmakers were trying to include in the must-pass bill \u2014 likely the last major piece of legislation to reach Trump\u2019s desk before the midterms.\n \n There is no agreement to protect so-called Dreamers, as Democrats had initially sought, or cuts to funding for sanctuary cities, as Republicans had wanted. \n \n Lawmakers also gave up on efforts to stabilize Obamacare markets through subsidies known as cost-sharing reduction payments after both sides failed to settle a dispute over restrictions on abortion.\n \n The deal does not include a provision to protect special counsel Robert Mueller if he\u2019s fired by Trump \u2014 as Schumer and Pelosi had wanted \u2014 but it does provide for an increase in funding to fight Russian hacking ahead of the November elections.\n\n The proposal includes an increase in the FBI\u2019s budget to combat Russia cyberattacks this year and provides an additional $380 million for technology grants that will allow states to secure election systems.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Though long-expected, revoking the Cole Memo nonetheless caused anxiety throughout the financially galloping marijuana industry and confirmed for most observers that he was the chief antagonist of legal marijuana in Washington.\n\nBut while the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer has made it abundantly clear over the years that he views marijuana as a scourge equal to heroin, it turns out the unofficial title of Washington\u2019s most powerful marijuana opponent belongs to someone else named Sessions: Pete, the longtime congressman from Texas\u2019 32nd district in Dallas. No relation to the attorney general, Pete Sessions nevertheless shares the former Alabama senator\u2019s unforgiving attitudes toward all things cannabis.\n\n\u201cMarijuana is an addictive product, and the merchants of addiction make it that way,\u201d Pete Sessions said in January. \u201cThey make it to where our people, our young people, become addicted to marijuana and keep going.\u201d In February, at an opioid summit at the University of Texas Southwestern, Rep. Sessions stretched scientific fact when he said, today\u2019s product is \u201c300 times more powerful\u201d than when he went to high school. (Later, his communications director confirmed that he meant three times more powerful.)\n\nWhat Pete Sessions has, however, that Jeff Sessions doesn\u2019t have is the power to change laws. Very quietly, but with implacable efficiency, Pete Sessions has used his position as the chair of the House Rules Committee to stymie or roll back amendments that protected legal marijuana in the 29 states that have approved it (30 states if you count Louisiana). States that have grown increasingly dependent on tax revenue from newly legal marijuana businesses, and investors who are pumping millions into an industry that is projected to hit $28 billion globally by 2024, have sought assurances that federal authorities wouldn\u2019t try to invoke national drug law that still classifies marijuana as one of the most serious of all illegal drugs. Short of changing federal drug law, legislators in the states with forms of legal pot have sought the next best protection: using the power of the purse to curtail enforcement. But Sessions, with the approval of House leadership, has thwarted his colleagues. He neutralized one amendment that sailed through with a comfortable bipartisan majority and smothered others that would pass if they were ever allowed to see the light of day.\n\nSo far, the only people who have complained are the legislators whose amendments he has torpedoed and pro-marijuana lobbyists. That criticism has never troubled Sessions in his 16-year career. But recent polling indicates that 83 percent of Texas voters now favor legalizing medical marijuana, and that seems to be feeding a nascent campaign to use Sessions\u2019 anti-marijuana influence against him in the 2018 midterm election. Even some Texas Republicans think his zealousness on the issue violates essential conservative principles of less government. \u201cHe\u2019s got this personal viewpoint; he\u2019s just personally against it. And there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to change his mind,\u201d said Zoe Russell, of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP). \u201cThat\u2019s the absolute worst of big government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s easy to see the high-water mark of the legal marijuana movement in Congress. It was the summer of 2015, and legislators seemed to open the floodgates to yes votes on marijuana measures.\n\nThe year before, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment had passed for the first time, after seven tries. As a floor amendment to an appropriations bill and not a full bill in its own right, the measure completely bypassed the formidable House Judiciary Committee, the longstanding cemetery for marijuana legalization efforts. The downside of this tactic was that it had to be reauthorized every year with the budget, but it didn\u2019t seem like it would be a problem. As more states went legal, support was broadening within Congress, and in 2015, it was reauthorized with 23 additional votes.\n\nWith legalization efforts advancing around the country, it seemed to nearly everyone that 2016 would be the last time the marijuana prohibitionists would control the chamber. But this optimism did not account for the power of Pete Sessions, who knew there was still a way to stop the inexorable march of marijuana legalization, even when the legalizers had the votes.\n\nThe turning point came on an issue that had nothing to do with marijuana. On May 19, 2016, a vote was held on a floor amendment meant to protect LGBT rights in the federal contracting process. The amendment had enough votes to pass, but House leadership kept the vote open long enough to flip a sufficient handful of votes to defeat it. Shouts of \u201cShame!\u201d erupted from the House floor, and headlines referred to the aftermath as \u201cchaos.\u201d In a House Republican Conference meeting on June 8, members decided the way to avoid such embarrassments going forward was to use the Rules Committee to structure the appropriations process so that such \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments would be out of order. If the amendments couldn\u2019t be offered, there would be no votes and therefore no bad publicity. It was a complete reversal of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s promise to operate the House under regular order. \u201cMy goal as speaker is to return to what we call regular order\u2026 so that Congress works more smoothly, and more democratically,\u201d Ryan said in December 2015, a pledge that lasted all of six months. Now that Sessions has jammed up the Rules Committee for two years, Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman told POLITICO Magazine that, \u201cChairman Sessions has run the committee in a fair manner while advancing a robust agenda and the priorities of this majority.\u201d\n\nPro-marijuana advocates didn\u2019t learn that their issue had been put on the blacklist until Tuesday night, June 21. That\u2019s when Sessions\u2019 committee ruled a marijuana banking amendment out of order. Perhaps it would have received more attention if everyone\u2019s attention had not turned to the party conventions and the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats, for the first time ever, added a plank to their party\u2019s platform aimed at reforming the nation\u2019s marijuana laws. Meanwhile, Sessions killed at least three more marijuana amendments. One gave veterans better access to medical marijuana. Another was Rohrabacher-Farr, which could hardly be called a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d since it had already passed the House twice. And the third was an amendment known as McClintock-Polis, named for Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.), which aimed to do for states that had legalized recreational marijuana what Rohrabacher-Farr had done for the medical marijuana states. McClintock-Polis had failed narrowly in 2015, but it was understood to have the votes to pass in 2016. Thanks to Sessions, it never got to the floor.\n\nThe only thing that has prevented Pete Sessions from completely wiping out protections for medical marijuana, and freeing Jeff Sessions\u2019 Department of Justice to execute the crackdown he seems to pine for, is Congress\u2019 own dysfunction. Because Congress could not agree on a budget, Rohrabacher-Farr has remained alive through a series of never-ending continuous resolutions. In addition, the Senate hasn\u2019t been quite so willing to stifle its members\u2019 wills on this issue; Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has proposed a companion amendment to Rohrabacher-Farr, which passed the Senate\u2019s appropriations committee by acclamation.\n\nAfter Jeff Sessions repealed the Cole Memo in January, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi demanded that Congress fix the damage caused by both Sessionses by approving the Rohrabacher-Farr/Leahy amendment, and even expanding it to protect state legal recreational marijuana programs, as the blacklisted McClintock-Polis amendment was designed to do. \u201cCongress must now take action to ensure that state law is respected, and that Americans who legally use marijuana are not subject to federal prosecution,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement on January 4. \u201cDemocrats will continue to insist on bipartisan provisions in appropriations bills that protect Americans lawfully using medical marijuana. Congress should now consider expanding the provisions to cover those states that have decriminalized marijuana generally.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether the appropriations conference committee will approve the Senate version with the Leahy amendment or the House version that killed Rohrabacher-Farr remains to be answered. The current continuing resolution ends on Friday at midnight.\n\nDon Murphy, director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, bemoaned the fact that the Republican Party has surrendered ownership of marijuana reform as Democratic support for the issue gains steam: \u201cWhat had once been a GOP effort known simply as \u2018Rohrabacher\u2019 after [Republican Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s] decade-long sponsorship, will now be known as \u2018the Leahy Amendment.\u2019 It\u2019s a missed opportunity for the GOP.\u201d\n\nWhen he speaks publicly about marijuana, Pete Sessions often positions himself as a bulwark against just that kind of Republican accommodation, insisting even against mounting evidence to the contrary that marijuana is a gateway drug to the opioid epidemic. This is a viewpoint shared by Jeff Sessions but not by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, generally an anti-marijuana group, which acknowledges \u201cthe observed drop in opioid overdose death rates in states where marijuana use is legal for medicinal purposes. One study found that states with \u2018medical marijuana\u2019 laws had a 24.8 percent lower average annual opioid overdose death rate compared to states without similar laws.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nSince Pete Sessions halted congressional movement on marijuana legalization, the states have steamrolled ahead in perfect disregard of his personal beef with the plant. In November 2016, California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine approved full recreational use. Arkansas, Florida and North Dakota legalized medical marijuana by ballot measure, and Pennsylvania and Ohio approved medical marijuana by state legislation. In 2017, West Virginia became the 29th state to legalize medical marijuana. So far in 2018, Vermont implemented a full legal law, the first state to do so by state legislature. A legalization bill is currently working its way through the New Jersey legislature. In Michigan, full legalization is on the ballot in November, and voters in Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah will have the opportunity to vote their states into the medical marijuana club.\n\nThe signs that the Drug War is thawing even in deep-red Texas are hard to miss In 2015, the Texas legislature passed an extremely limited medical marijuana program that grants access to non-psychoactive CBD concentrates to Texans suffering from epilepsy. Given that the Drug Enforcement Administration still considers non-psychoactive CBD to be a drug with no medicinal value, Texas\u2019 tiptoe into the waters of medical marijuana legalization has been an act of civil disobedience against a federal drug enforcement policy that is staunchly defended by the likes of Pete Sessions. In Dallas County, where the majority of Sessions\u2019 constituents reside, police no longer arrest people caught with up to a quarter pound of marijuana, opting instead for a cite-and-release program meant to unclog the jails and judicial system, following the example of similar programs in San Antonio, Houston and Austin.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sessions finds himself defending his congressional seat in 2018 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by nearly 2 percentage points just two years ago. The Cook Political Report rates the race as leans Republican, but does Sessions\u2019 opposition to marijuana law reform make him more vulnerable to a Democratic challenger in November? Some Republicans fear that medical marijuana might be an effective wedge issue that could steer Republican voters toward a Democrat who supports marijuana law reform at the national level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Republican and will certainly not be voting for [Sessions] ever again,\u201d Mark Zartler told POLITICO Magazine. Zartler and his family are residents of Sessions\u2019 district; they made news when they went public with a video showing them medicating their severely autistic daughter with medical marijuana, which is illegal under Texas and federal law. Their video has been viewed over 88 million times. Mark Zartler sees Sessions as the reason his family has been put in legal jeopardy. \u201cAs you can imagine, he\u2019s not my favorite,\u201d Zartler told me.\n\nColin Allred and Lillian Salerno are the two candidates in the Democratic runoff election in May for the chance to run against Sessions in November. Neither Democrat has the word \u201cmarijuana\u201d on their campaign websites. Yet when asked by POLITICO Magazine, both candidates spoke in favor of medical marijuana legalization at the federal level, and both pointed to Sessions as a part of the problem.\n\nSalerno said, \u201cThe fact that Pete Sessions wants to deny sick kids, seniors and veterans access to the compassionate care they need by blocking medical marijuana is unconscionable. We demand new policy that stops the criminalization of communities of color, and allows states to generate revenue through regulation.\u201d\n\nAllred is on the same page: \u201cI support the use of medical marijuana as an alternative to the habit-forming opioids that have become a national crisis. This common-sense approach to alternative treatments has been opposed by Pete Sessions, and is something I will fight to expand.\u201d\n\nThese Democrats might be late to the pro-marijuana party, but Sessions has made so many enemies among the drug policy reform crowd that they are ready to support whichever Democrat emerges from the May runoff.\n\n\u201cPete Sessions has made himself the No. 1 target of drug policy reformers in the 2018 general election,\u201d Don Murphy of MPP told POLITICO Magazine. \u201cDefeating Pete Sessions in 2018 will send a message to Washington that even the tone-deaf GOP can\u2019t miss.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Murphy\u2019s prediction appears to be taking shape in Texas.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which Democrat wins. Either way, we\u2019re going to un-elect him,\u201d said Rob Kampia, the former executive director of MPP. Kampia\u2019s new venture is the Marijuana Leadership Campaign and its companion Marijuana Leadership PAC. \u201cOur invitation-only launch meeting was held in Dallas,\u201d he told POLITICO Magazine, \u201cand I can safely say we'll be spending $500,000 on this singular congressional race.\u201d\n\nKampia and his crew will need every penny if they want to dislodge Sessions from the House Rules Committee, where he\u2019s been chairman since 2013, which makes this year his sixth, and theoretically final year, but a spokeswoman for Rep. Tom Cole, the Oklahoma Republican and vice chair of the Rules Committee, told POLITICO Magazine that Cole \u201csupports the reappointment of Chairman Sessions should the Speaker do so, and the Congressman [Cole] has no desire to seek the chairmanship himself.\u201d\n\nSessions had $1.2 million cash on hand on February 14, the end of the most recent reporting period, but that doesn\u2019t account for the last month\u2019s worth of spending to win his March 6 primary by nearly 59 points. He declined help from Ryan\u2019s Congressional Leadership Fund, which is a sign of confidence that Sessions feels his reelection is not in doubt, that he can handle this one himself.\n\nSo it\u2019s up to marijuana reform activists and whichever Democrat emerges from the runoff to take the chairmanship of the Rules Committee away from Pete Sessions by getting more votes in November. Kampia told POLITICO Magazine that the two stated goals of his Marijuana Leadership Campaign were \u201cto legalize medical marijuana in Texas and to unseat Congressman Pete Sessions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show them that we are the NRA of marijuana,\u201d he said.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Nahal Toosi", "body": "An email Brian Hook, chief of the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, sent to himself on April 25 included a list of names with questions about their loyalties.

Focusing on her role in the negotiation of Obama\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, the article was headlined, \u201cIran deal architect is running Tehran policy at the State Dept.\u201d \nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Nowrouzzadeh emailed Brian Hook, the new chief of the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, where she worked on Middle East issues, to insist that the article was \u201cfilled with misinformation.\u201d She assured Hook that, since joining the government under George W. Bush in 2005, she had always \u201cadapted\u201d to shifting U.S. policy priorities \u2013 as any career government staffer is expected to do. She asked for his help in correcting the record. \n\nHook was already well aware of the story. The article, which appeared in an obscure online publication called Conservative Review, had caused a stir among conservative activists and incoming Trump officials who were busy trying to establish who Nowrouzzadeh was \u2014 and whether she could be purged. \n\nAccording to emails obtained by POLITICO, the agitators included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who sent the article to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff; and an official who falsely claimed in an email to top Tillerson aides that Nowrouzzadeh \u201cwas born in Iran,\u201d and also that she had wept after Trump\u2019s election.\n\nThe emails show that State Department and White House officials repeatedly shared such misleading information about Nowrouzzadeh, deriding her as an Obama cheerleader and strong advocate for the nuclear deal with Iran, which Trump had repeatedly denounced. Later, after Nowrouzzadeh was reassigned to another job, some State Department officials tried to mislead a POLITICO reporter about whether she\u2019d completed her full tenure in Hook\u2019s policy shop. \n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The Global Politico\n                                Susan B.

In one email, a staffer was described as \u201ca leaker and a troublemaker\u201d while another was branded a \u201cturncoat.\u201d \n\nAlthough career staffers generally observe an ethos of nonpartisanship, many Trump officials saw them as constituting a \u201cdeep state\u201d cabal determined to sabotage the new president\u2019s agenda. The emails also suggest that Nowrouzzadeh may have been targeted in part because of her ethnicity, which would be a violation of federal employment law.\n\nThe emails were the subject of a Thursday letter to the White House and State Department from Rep. Elijah Cummings and Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, respectively. The letter called the emails, provided to Congress by an unnamed whistleblower, \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and demands further documents from the Trump administration.\n\nIn the early months of Trump\u2019s presidency, conservative media organizations such as Breitbart News and the Conservative Review published several stories singling out career civil and foreign service staffers by name. The reports often called such employees \u201cObama holdovers\u201d \u2014 even though many, like Nowrouzzadeh, joined the government well before Obama took office \u2014 and urged their firing. The stories were terrifying to career employees who in some cases had spent decades working out of the spotlight. Nowrouzzadeh, who would not comment for this article, told Hook that she feared for her safety.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that the makeup of the Policy Planning Staff reflects a bias against career civil servants is completely without merit,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told POLITICO. Nauert said that more than half of the office\u2019s current staff members are career professionals from the foreign and civil service and the military. \u201cThe details of Policy Planning's staffing under Director Hook demonstrate that career civil servants continue to play an integral role, as do political appointees,\u201d she added.\n\nThere are currently 14 career professionals on the Policy Planning Staff \u2013 two from the Foreign Service, nine from the Civil Service, and three from the military.\n\n    \n\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                            President Barack Obama is briefed by Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, Director for Iran, NSC, before taping a Nowruz message to the Iranian people in the Blue Room of the White House, March 18, 2016.

She went on to join Obama\u2019s National Security Council staff where she worked on the negotiation and implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. Former Obama officials describe Nowrouzzadeh as a seasoned Iran expert who gave them valuable insights into the country\u2019s dynamics and motivations.\n\nBy the time Trump took office in January 2017, Nowrouzzadeh was on a yearlong detail to the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, a kind of in-house think tank for the secretary of state, where she focused on Iran and the Gulf Arab states. Hook, a former George W. Bush administration official generally considered a moderate, had been tapped to run the office by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \n\nNowrouzzadeh attracted the attention of conservative media outlets during the Obama years after her name, which indicated her Iranian ethnicity, appeared on a public White House document. Conservative reports questioned her national loyalties, and fixated on the fact that she had interned with the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group which strongly supported the nuclear deal and generally favors better U.S.-Iranian relations. The Conservative Review article described NIAC as \u201can alleged Iranian regime lobbying group.\" (NIAC denies such ties, and had regular contact with the Obama White House. Nowrouzzadeh interned for the group as a college student, at a time when it did not take positions on U.S. policy.)\n\nThe story that ran about Nowrouzzadeh in the Conservative Review on March 14, 2017, covered much of that same territory, saying she had \u201cburrowed into the government under President Trump\u201d and had helped craft \u201cfalse narratives on the Iran deal to sell to the American public\u201d while working for Obama. \n\nIt touched off a flurry of activity in conservative circles. Barbara Ledeen, a prominent conservative activist, forwarded the story with an \u201cUgh\u201d in the subject line to a Google Group apparently focused on judicial strategy. David Wurmser, a former Middle East adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, forwarded the Conservative Review story to Gingrich and wrote of the State Department: \u201cA cleaning is in order there.\u201d Gingrich, in turn, flagged the article by email to Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSome emails suggest the conservative outlets were interested in more than publishing provocative stories. Joel B. Pollak, a top staffer at Breitbart News, emailed Tillerson aide Matt Mowers with an offer to supply \u201cadditional background\u201d on \u201cObama holdovers.\u201d \n\nThe same day that the story about Nowrouzzadeh was published, White House and State Department officials were busy exchanging emails about Nowrouzzadeh. In one of then, Julia Haller, whose LinkedIn profile lists her as being a White House liaison to the State Department at the time, incorrectly claimed that Nowrouzzadeh \u201cwas born in Iran,\u201d adding: \u201cupon my understanding [she] cried when the President won.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis initial info is helpful,\u201d Hook replied after that response, along with background on Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s employment status, was relayed to him. Hook said that he had \u201cemailed friends who track the Iran deal for intel on her.\u201d\n\nHook, whom many State employees have described as highly suspicious of the career diplomats around him, also asked his deputy director of the Policy Planning Staff, Edward Lacey, about Nowrouzzadeh. Himself a career official, Lacey used the opportunity to advocate for a house cleaning, noting that several people on the Policy Planning Staff were appointed by Hook\u2019s Obama-era predecessors. \n\n\u201cTheir picks without exception, were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda,\u201d Lacey wrote, adding that \u201call of these detailees have tried to stay on\u201d in Policy Planning. \n\n\u201cEd \u2013 This is helpful. Let\u2019s discuss on Monday,\u201d Hook replied. \n\nIn a later email, Lacey told Hook that Nowrouzzadeh had \u201chelped promote and defend\u201d the Iran deal \u2013 \u201cI would say, with enthusiasm.\u201d \n\nIn her March 15 email to Hook, Nowrouzzadeh tried to set the record straight, calling the Conservative Review story \u201cunfortunate\u201d and full of wrong information. \n\n    \n\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                            An email Brian Hook, chief of the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff, sent to himself on April 25 included a list of names with questions about their loyalties.

In April, Hook pushed Nowrouzzadeh out of his Policy Planning Staff, cutting her yearlong detail short by three months. She was returned to the State Department\u2019s Near East Bureau (NEA), where she was an official permanent employee. \n\nWhen POLITICO began asking questions about her sudden reassignment that same month, some State Department officials wanted to offer misleading statements about what had happened to Nowrouzzadeh. \n\nIn a series of emails on April 17, Lacey urged State Department public affairs officials to tell POLITICO that Nowrouzzadeh had left Policy Planning \u201con the completion of that assignment.\u201d A public affairs official, Justin Reynolds, tried to counter that, saying his unit \u201cwould like to avoid commenting on where she is now and how long details normally last if at all possible.\u201d \n\nBut Lacey insisted: \u201cWe need to counter the notion that she has been forced out of S/P,\u201d a common term for Policy Planning. \u201cHer return to NEA should be characterized as what it is \u2013 the normal return to a parent office of a civil servant at the completion of a detail assignment. A perfectly normal occurrence.\u201d \n\nNowrouzzadeh, who was copied on the exchange, fought back. \n\n\u201cEd \u2013 My assignment was not \u2018completed,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe 3 month curtailment to the duration of my detail was also not handled in accordance with that which was explicitly stated in my [memorandum of understanding].\u201d \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nAt one point, Nowrouzzadeh asks Reynolds: \u201cCan we try to kill the story?\u201d \n\nU.S. law is generally supposed to protect career government employees from politically motivated firings and other retaliation not linked to their work performance. But political appointees of incoming administrations have a lot of latitude when it comes to assigning people or promoting them. That means it\u2019s possible to shuffle people around without necessarily violating any laws.\n\nNowrouzzadeh remains a State Department employee, though she is now on a fellowship at Harvard University. \n\nShe was just one of many people viewed with suspicion by Trump administration officials. An email Hook sent to himself on April 25 included a list of names with questions about their loyalties. One person was listed as a \u201cleaker and troublemaker\u201d and another as a \u201cturncoat.\u201d \n\nThe email\u2019s subject line was \u201cDerek notes.\u201d The reference was to Derek Harvey, who was at the time a senior official at the National Security Council, according to a congressional aide who deals with State Department oversight. Harvey was worried about several career staffers he deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and was behind efforts to sideline them, the aide said. \n\nIn a brief interview, Harvey insisted he\u2019d not removed anyone from their position early and only had concerns about \u201ctwo or three people\u201d who\u2019d acted in a disruptive manner toward his deputies. \u201cBut even those were not removed early,\u201d he said. \n\nPOLITICO\u2019s story about Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s ouster from the Policy Planning Staff was published April 21, 2017. Hook emailed the story out to R.C. Hammond, at that time a communications aide to Tillerson. \n\nThe story, Hook said, was \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

John Culberson (R-Texas) appears to be a shoo-in for reelection. He\u2018s served nine terms in what\u2019s been a GOP stronghold for decades, hasn\u2019t had a serious challenger in years and sits on one of the most powerful committees in Congress.\n\nBut Culberson\u2018s suburban-Houston district went for Hillary Clinton by 1 percentage point in 2016. And when GOP leaders found out last year that he was being outraised by Democrats and barely had a campaign staff, they were exasperated. \nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Get your act together, they warned Culberson in so many words, according to sources familiar with the dressing-down. \n\nCulberson\u2019s slow start to his reelection campaign is what GOP leaders fear most heading into the thick of the midterm elections: incumbents who haven\u2019t seen a real race in years snoozing as a Democratic wave builds. Speaker Paul Ryan and the National Republican Congressional Committee are less concerned about their battle-tested swing-district members \u2014 who face tough races every election cycle \u2014 and more worried about complacent Republicans not prepared for a fight.\n\n\u201cThis is a very tough environment for Republicans. If you\u2019re getting outraised or if you haven\u2019t started your campaign yet, you need to be scared and start today,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Ryan-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019ve never lost before, therefore I can never lose this time\u2019 is not a campaign plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons Ryan\u2019s political team and NRCC officials have started holding a series of meetings with lawmakers from traditionally reliable GOP districts. Their message: Get ready for a roller coaster and begin your campaign in earnest now.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

More than 40 GOP incumbents were outraised by Democratic challengers during the last three months of 2017, a staggering number that senior Republicans said is unacceptable and amounts to nothing short of laziness.\n\nBut GOP leaders aren\u2019t satisfied there won\u2019t be more John Micas. The iconic former Transportation Committee chairman literally laughed at the notion that his Democratic challenger in 2016, Stephanie Murphy, would beat him \u2014 until it was too late. \n\nRepublicans blamed the loss on his blas\u00e9 approach.\n\nOther lawmakers in swing districts have been through this before. They don\u2019t need to be warned about taking victory for granted.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had three very tough races in a row, been a top target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and so I think I\u2019m well defined to the electorate,\" said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who represents a tossup suburban Denver district. But for any Republican from a safer district who \"hasn't had a fight,\" he continued, \"it could be turned into a competitive situation.\"\n\n\u201cMany of our members have not been in Congress during a possible \u2018wave\u2019 election cycle, as happened in 2006 and 2010,\u201d added a Republican campaign staffer. \u201cMembers in Republican-leaning districts should heed the warnings from House leadership and get ready for a fight.\u201d\n\nRep. Glenn Grothman\u2019s team is another office that\u2019s received a talking-to. Ryan is personally helping campaign for the Wisconsin Republican, who hasn\u2019t had a competitive race since he was elected in 2014. His sprawling district partly abutting Lake Michigan has been a Republican stronghold since the 1960s. But Grothman now faces a wealthy Democratic challenger who\u2019s planning to spend hundreds of thousands of his own money on the race.\n\nGrothman acknowledged in an interview the battle he\u2019s in for and said he's doing \"100 percent\" what he can to prepare. The 62-year-old former attorney pulled up his schedule on his phone and read a list of constituent events: a fish fry, a bowl-a-thon, some St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades and Lincoln Day dinners.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cObviously, that\u2019s a bigger problem than the typical year,\u201d Grothman said of his Democratic challenger, Dan Kohl, the nephew of former Milwaukee Bucks owner and ex-Sen. Herb Kohl. \u201cI\u2019ll raise more money, I think, because there\u2019s more a necessity. \u2026 My opponent has a lot of money, and he\u2019s telling people he\u2019s going to spend a lot of money \u2026 so it\u2019s concerning.\u201d\n\nRep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) also hails from a solid Republican district but is facing a well-funded Democratic opponent who last quarter raked in over $100,000 more than the incumbent. His staff, like Grothman\u2019s, has been warned to be ready \u2014 particularly because Pittenger is still introducing himself to constituents after a recent redistricting changed his district\u2019s borders.\n\nAnother North Carolinian on GOP leaders\u2019 radar is freshman Rep. Ted Budd. His well-connected Democratic opponent, philanthropist Kathy Manning, raised $564,000 last quarter, compared to his $183,000 haul. \n\nBudd said he realizes \u201cthe environment is tough this year,\u201d and he just hired a campaign manager who will start next month.\n\nRyan\u2019s political executive director, Kevin Seifert, and deputy executive director, Jake Kastan, are handling many of the reality-check meetings with incumbent Republicans or their staffs. While Ryan\u2019s team often helps incumbents, it's hosting more meetings than usual, and with a greater sense of urgency.\n\nRyan and NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) have also delivered the same message to lawmakers in conference gatherings in recent weeks: Raise money now, be active in your districts, find legislative issues that resonate with constituents and tout your accomplishments constantly. Also, define yourself and your opponent early, and label Democrats as obstructionists.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a million dollars spent attacking [GOP lawmakers] for the first time, a lot can change, and quickly,\u201d Bliss said.\n\nThe warnings from leadership aides are also expected to extend to a handful of Freedom Caucus members who typically feel safe enough to vote with the far right of the House Republican Conference \u2014 if they haven't already. Three Democratic opponents of caucus member Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) outraised him in the last fundraising quarter, two of them by $100,000.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGarrett's district elected a Democrat to the House in 2008, before a Republican reclaimed the seat two years later. And Garrett\u2019s conservative votes could make him more susceptible in a Democratic wave year, senior Republicans said. \n\nDitto, they said, for Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), another Freedom Caucus member, who upset former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary.\n\nBrat declined to discuss his campaign with POLITICO; two Democratic opponents collected more than him in the final three months of 2017 \u2014 including one by nearly $150,000.\n\n\u201cPolicy, policy, policy,\u201d Brat said when asked about his reelection effort. \u201cAll I talk is policy.\u201d\n\nAt least one Republican, Culberson, appears to have heeded the warnings from leadership, aides say. He has hired new staff and outraised his Democratic opponents in the last quarter of 2017, though in the first six weeks of this year, his top two competitors collected more money than him, according to campaign filings. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always ready,\u201d Culberson in a brief interview this week, \u201cand even more so this year.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

President Donald Trump has sought to end the program, although the issue is now likely heading for the Supreme Court.\n \n \u201cThe Republicans could easily have joined us in providing real protection for the Dreamers but refused to do so,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues sent overnight.\n \n Pelosi\u2019s position may be a problem for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his top lieutenants. A number of conservative Republicans, including the House Freedom Caucus, are opposed to the package. Republicans believe some Democrats will support the rule \u2014 despite Pelosi\u2019s push \u2014 because they want provisions in the omnibus.\n \n Trump's apathy toward the omnibus package is also a potential issue. While he has publicly called for its passage, Trump on Wednesday vented to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he wanted more money for his border wall with Mexico. Ultimately, Trump agreed to sign the bill once it\u2019s passed, but only after creating a panic with GOP leaders who had to scramble to convince the president that he had secured real legislative wins.\n \n GOP conservatives have already come out against the bill in droves. It took just minutes after the bill\u2019s release for the House Freedom Caucus to formally oppose it. \n \n Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said he and many of his members are leaning \u2018no.\u2019\n \n \u201cThere\u2019s good and bad and ugly, except the bad and ugly is really bad and ugly, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Walker said Wednesday night.\n \n Congressional leaders considered several options for trading Dreamer protections for wall funding in the omnibus but ultimately couldn\u2019t come to a deal.

Antholis", "body": "The allegations against Rob Porter, the recently departed White House staff secretary, are morally disturbing. Multiple ex-wives have accused him of abusive behavior, and while he disputes those accusations, the FBI found them credible enough to deny him a security clearance \u2013 and there are pictures of one of his exes with a black eye that she claims was delivered by him.\n\nFor White House and the National Security Council staff veterans, the revelation that Porter did not have a full security clearance raises a number of real questions that must be answered. Those questions speak directly to the safety of America\u2019s most sensitive intelligence officers and most dangerous operations.\n\nHaving worked at the White House -- including both at the National Security Council and alongside the staff secretary \u2013 I believe Porter-gate has all the markings either of a very high security breach or a highly unusual staff structure. It also raises real questions about how Trump White House staff under both Reince Priebus and John Kelly managed sensitive information, and what both of them knew about the allegations against Porter and when they knew it.\n\nAs staff secretary, Porter held one of the most important, and under-appreciated, positions at the White House. The staff secretary normally is responsible for managing all information that flows to the president \u2013 usually including the secrets known only to a small handful of people \u2013 principally, President Trump and Chiefs of Staff Priebus and Kelly, and National Security Advisers Michael Flynn and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\nNews reports indicate that Porter was granted an \u201cinterim security clearance.\u201d That certification is, indeed, quite common in the early days of an administration. Likewise, almost any new government employee who comes in contact with classified information \u2013 Secret, Top-Secret, and Top-Secret/Code Word intelligence \u2013 goes through this \u201cinterim\u201d phase.\n\nIf an employee receives an interim security clearance, he or she is allowed by law to serve in positions designated \u201cNational Security/ Non-Critical Sensitive\u201d or \u201cNational Security/Critical Sensitive.\u201d They cannot, however, be given a \u201cSpecial Sensitive\u201d job, which requires a different level of clearance: Top Secret/Special Compartmentalized Information \u2013 also known as TS/SCI or TS/CodeWord.\n\nOnly employees with TS/SCI or CodeWord clearance can see our government\u2019s most important secrets. Typically, the staff secretary is one of those very few people. One of the most important.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means that the most highly classified secrets in the U.S. government are limited to a very finite group of people. U.S. human intelligence sources may be embedded deep in the government offices in Beijing, or Tehran, or Moscow or Pyongyang \u2013 capitals that the Trump administration has identified as America\u2019s prime competitors. If we have sources in those places, they are likely transmitting secrets back through secure channels to Washington. They would typically be given code words \u2014 say, Panda, Minaret, Ballerina and Kimchi.\n\nWithin each of those channels, only a handful of people has access to top secret information. Those pieces of information are the high holy data of intelligence. Like the Host in a Catholic mass, they are the flesh and word of our all-knowing government \u2014 literally, the lives and intelligence of our deepest and most sensitive sources. Each channel is \u201ccompartmentalized.\u201d That is, there are very few people who have access to both the Panda channel and the Ballerina channel.\n\nOnly a very, very select group of people has access to all of those channels, and the information that flows through them. That intelligence gets pulled into a daily intelligence summary that goes to the Oval Office \u2013 the President\u2019s Daily Briefing \u2013 and to a select small group of people. Agents and sources in the field are willing to put their lives at risk only if they believe that the information will be limited to a very limited group of people \u2013 among the most trustworthy in the world.\n\nWho in the White House has access to this information?\n\nIn the White House, other than the president, it likely to only be the national security adviser, his or her deputy, their chief of staff and the NSC\u2019s staff secretary. It would also include the White House chief of staff, perhaps one deputy, and the staff secretary \u2014 the job Porter held. Press reports also indicate that Jared Kushner had access to that information.\n\nThe staff secretary is the person who manages the paper flow to the Oval Office. It is hard to imagine that person does not have TS/SCI level clearance, as that would require the NSC staff to navigate around the staff secretary, rather than through him/her.\n\nIn Porter\u2019s case, the interim security clearances had been temporary: 180 days with the option for extension (another 180 days). Porter appears to have started on January 20, 2017 \u2013 Inauguration Day. Assuming he was given that \u201cinterim\u201d clearance on Day 1, it would have expired on January 15, 2018.\n\nThe fact that Chief of Staff Kelly -- a former military officer and former secretary of homeland security -- would not have seen this as a problem is staggering. He would know better than anyone that managing highly restricted information is essential to American national security.\n\nEvery person who has access to the most sensitive pieces of intelligence must be supremely trustworthy -- capable of being kept in the highest cones of silence. If they leak information, they potentially jeopardize lives of intelligence agents or sources in the field.\n\nSo, in essence, Kelly either (a) allowed a key aide in the chain of information access to TS/SCI information without a clearance, (b) waived the process entirely or (c) created a system that worked around him.\n\nIf Kelly knowingly allowed Porter access to TS/SCI information without formally approving it, that\u2019s an extraordinary security breach.\n\nIf Kelly waived off the TS/SCI restrictions, he likely would have done that formally -- including either with the White House counsel, the FBI, or the president himself. That would require understanding fully the reason Porter was still \u201cinterim\u201d \u2013 a restraining order preventing him from contacting a former wife who alleged that he physically abused her.\n\nMost defendable is that Kelly allowed a system for moving information -- from August 2017 through February 2018 -- that simply worked around the staff secretary. Porter needed to have been kept out of the loop for any truly sensitive material going into the Oval Office. That would have required a highly disciplined NSC staff which, in essence, would have had to have final control over all Oval Office paper flow.\n\nSo, in the coming days, it will be critical to know whether Priebus and Kelly, Flynn and McMaster, and/or the president himself knew about Porter\u2019s security clearance status. Based on that knowledge, did they allow him access to Top Secret/CodeWord intelligence, including the President\u2019s Daily Briefing? If they did know, and they allowed it, what made them feel so secure about Porter?\n\nIf they did not know, then who exactly at the White House is protecting our national secrets?", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Cristiano Lima", "body": "Rep.

She believes her vote for his tax bill is going to be one of her best weapons.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the vulnerability Inslee believes Democrats can hit at, even though he continues to advise them to stay away from talking only about Trump himself all the time.\n\n\u201cWe have Republican governors who are kowtowing to Donald Trump and will continue to do so, who have been lackeys to his abysmal record and his moral depravity and his inhumane policies, and that all across the country they will be called to account for that chaotic behavior,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to me, shocking and disappointing, that we have so many Republicans who now aspire for governor who just are afraid and shaking in their boots and won\u2019t stand up against this man in the White House.\u201d\n\nStanding up to Trump is exactly what Inslee did, literally, last week in the White House, seizing a moment during a meeting of the National Governors Association to chastise Trump for his proposal to arm teachers. \u201cWe need to do a little less tweeting and a little more listening\u201d to educators, Inslee told Trump, in what was the most direct public confrontation any Democratic leader has had with the president to date.\n\nTrump listened, his arms folded across his chest, and moved on.\n\nInslee hasn\u2019t. He wants his candidates to lean hard into pushing for restrictions on magazine size, banning bump stocks, raising the minimum age for buying assault rifles\u2014and make it into an argument for states doing what Trump and the Republicans in Washington haven\u2019t. \u201cIt comes down to Democratic governors who are standing up for action and the Republicans who are standing in the courthouse door just taking orders from the NRA,\u201d said Inslee.\n\nThe difference between gubernatorial races in 2014 and 2018, Inslee argues, is both a wave now running in the other direction\u2014\u201cthe potential tsunami zone,\u201d he predicted\u2014and the lack of many Republican incumbents in an environment when governors have been reelected in 50 of the 58 races since 2010. This year, 12 of the 26 races Democrats are chasing are open seats, and three\u2014Kansas, South Carolina and Iowa\u2014are against Republican lieutenant governors who moved up after their predecessors received appointments to the Trump administration and are now running for governor for the first time as incumbents.\n\nDemocrats have been down this road before. In 2014, they were convinced that the nine states President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012 but which elected Republican governors in between, in the 2010 wave, were theirs for the taking.\n\nWisconsin, Florida, Michigan and Ohio not only reelected Republican governors in 2014, but also went for Trump in 2016. Along the way, Trump picked up Pennsylvania, the sole Democratic gubernatorial flip in 2014.\n\nBut, Democrats argue, what also happened since was Ralph Northam winning Virginia in a blowout last year by talking up progressive issues (including gun control) and projecting an air of calm rejection of the president, while Republican nominee Ed Gillespie never found an answer to the Trump question that worked for both the GOP base and the general electorate.\n\nJust as the Republican wins in 2014 governors races previewed Trump\u2019s strength in key states and helped put in place policies that helped him along\u2014passing right-to-work laws in Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, which undercut union strength on Election Day\u2014Republicans are warning the White House to focus on governors races this year if only for the sake of protecting Trump\u2019s reelection chances in 2020.\n\nThey\u2019re also dismissive of any Democratic effort to nationalize gubernatorial races, pointing out that their own attempt to do that in Montana and West Virginia, two of the heaviest pro-Trump states, didn\u2019t stop the states from electing Democratic governors on the same day in 2016.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in Washington are both anxiously watching the states that put Trump over the edge to see how the dynamics will play out this year.\n\nBill Schuette, Michigan\u2019s Republican attorney general and the front-runner in that state\u2019s gubernatorial primary, dismissed Inslee\u2019s strategy on Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wishful thinking, and I think it really comes with the same strain and premise that said it was going to be Armageddon for Republicans in 2016, and that didn\u2019t occur,\u201d said Schuette, who likes to brag he\u2019s the only candidate the president has tweeted about twice. (\u201cThe first time my name was misspelled. But you know what? Half of Michigan\u2019s taken decades to learn how to spell my name.\u201d)\n\nDemocrats who say that Trump is going to weigh down Republicans aren\u2019t paying attention to what\u2019s happening in Michigan or anywhere else, Schuette said.\n\nNow, Schuette said, he\u2019ll talk up the tax bill that House Republicans still can\u2019t figure out how to message, and remind Michigan voters that Ram truck production has moved from Mexico to Macomb County under Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s a shift of the rotation of the earth on its axis.\u201d\n\nMaybe try the Trump argument in bluer states\u2014though in two of the bluest, Maryland and Massachusetts, Republican incumbents running for reelection have the highest approval numbers in the country\u2014but not in any state where the president is popular.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that this administration is going in the direction that they\u2019re going,\u201d Black said. \u201cI lean into it, and I thank them for who they are.\u201d\n\nInslee boasts not just about what happens when a state elects a Democratic governor, but what happens when a state puts the whole government in Democratic hands\u2014as happened after a special election in the Washington state Senate last year flipped from red to blue\u2014and upends control of the whole chamber.\n\nIn the few months since, Inslee has signed new laws on a clean energy plan, voting rights, pay equity and reproductive rights.\n\nRepublicans say this represents overreach that will flip statehouse seats back in November. Inslee said he\u2019s not worried, and he embraces the contrast with Congress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a debate between Plan A or B. It\u2019s between Plan A and nothing, because that\u2019s what the Republicans have offered,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThey\u2019re not offering us a real solution on infrastructure. They\u2019re not offering us a solution on climate change' they just denied its existence. They\u2019re not offering a plan on really seriously what to do about gun violence. We are.\u201d\n\nThe issue that grabs Inslee the most, though, is climate change. He wrote a whole book about it\u2014\u201cApollo\u2019s Fire\u201d\u2014in 2007, made a green jobs economy the centerpiece of his first gubernatorial campaign in 2012, and has prioritized it the past six years.\n\nHe thinks there\u2019s enough attention to climate change that a candidate could even run on it in 2020 as an almost single-issue campaign.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s points where things change, and I think we\u2019re getting to that tipping point right now on climate change,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cAnd it has to happen now, because we don\u2019t have a lot more time.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t yet say whether that candidate might be him, despite the chatter about his running. His term is, after all, up in 2020, though there are no term limits in Washington.\n\n\u201cMy term could be up as long as the people accept me,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cI have plans to be governor because I love the job and I feel that I\u2019ve brought some things to the table for my state.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Adam Doster", "body": "Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, works on the 14th floor of the County-City Building, a faintly yellowed glass tower. The panoramic views are nothing to sneeze at; from the oval table beside his desk, Buttigieg can spot the hospital where he was born, the leafy middle-class neighborhood where he was raised and the Episcopal church where he worships most Sundays. Still, he concedes, \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly luxury digs.\u201d During downpours, the 36-year-old Democrat has to yank his framed photographs off the window ledge or risk water damage. And right above his head, on the roof, live a pair of mating falcons. This past summer, Buttigieg had a naturalist tag their chicks in a City Hall conference room. (Four hatched; two survived.) \u201cOccasionally, you\u2019ll see a pigeon massacre,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be trying to pay attention and \u2026 you\u2019ll just see feathers, like, drifting by, and guts going down outside the window.\u201d\n\nWhen Buttigieg moved back to South Bend a decade ago, the first place he rented was similarly shabby. Blue floors. Shag carpet. Bee hives. He can\u2019t even show me the actual carriage house he lived in because his old landlord mercifully knocked it down. All it really had going for it was the location (a couple blocks from his mom and dad\u2019s house) and the price (dirt cheap).\n\nDeals can be had in Buttigieg\u2019s hometown, a scrappy blue-collar city in north-central Indiana, 90 miles east of Chicago, best known as the home of the University of Notre Dame, where both of his parents taught. Its population peaked near 132,000 more than a half-century ago, when Studebaker\u2014then an automotive giant, now an anachronism\u2014still employed thousands of Hoosiers; today, the population hovers around 100,000. Roughly 32 percent of residents live below the poverty line, while three-quarters of public school students receive free or reduced lunch. Not even South Bend partisans would characterize it as a bucolic. \u201cIt had the feel of a Rust Belt city,\u201d says Reverend John Jenkins, Notre Dame\u2019s president, who arrived in the 1970s. \u201cIt had a past and was looking for a future.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, in other words, is the type of place that high-achievers tend to flee. \u201cI grew up at a time when people felt like success meant getting out,\u201d Buttigieg says. \u201cIt was made clear to me that there was a big future available to me if I left.\u201d For a while, that\u2019s what he did\u2014to Harvard, where he studied history and literature; to Washington, for a political consulting gig; to England on a Rhodes scholarship; and to the Chicago branch of McKinsey & Co., the prestigious consulting firm. During his McKinsey stint, Buttigieg remembers attending a house party in San Francisco where he casually mentioned he was thinking about relocating to South Bend, with an eye toward public service. \u201cThe assumption was I had a sick relative,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was the only reason I\u2019d be moving home.\u201d\n\nHe did anyway, into the bee-filled carriage house, while still under contract with McKinsey. In 2010, he quit consulting and threw himself into an unwinnable race for state treasurer, shuttling among Indiana\u2019s 92 counties, learning how to fundraise and glad-hand. (Campaign slogan: \u201cMeet Pete.\u201d) The mayor\u2019s seat opened up the following year. \u201cThe way the campaign for mayor really began was 100 cups of coffee with people who cared about the city, finding out what was on their minds, what they thought was working and what wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at the end of every cup of coffee, asking for two or three [more] people who I should have a coffee with, until everybody they named was somebody I\u2019d already met.\u201d He won the crowded Democratic primary by 34 points and the general election by 20 more. He was 29 years old.\n\nPlenty has changed in the intervening years, for Buttigieg personally and for the party he represents. In a term-and-a-half, he has overseen an economic and psychological resurgence in South Bend that few were predicting. In 2014, he served a seven-month tour in Afghanistan with the U.S. Naval Reserves, helping disrupt flows of funding to terrorist groups while monitoring South Bend business over sketchy internet connections. Before his 2015 reelection, he came out publicly as gay, writing in a local newspaper that \u201cit took years of struggle and growth for me to recognize that it\u2019s just a fact of life, like having brown hair, and part of who I am.\u201d (In December, he and his partner, middle-school teacher Chasten Glezman, got engaged.)\n\nThrough it all, Buttigieg established himself as a Democrat worth tracking, at a time when the party was desperate for fresh faces, particularly between the coasts. Howard Dean has called him \u201cthe face of the first global generation.\u201d Frank Bruni, the New York Times columnist, wondered after a 2016 South Bend visit whether he had just met the country\u2019s first gay president. And speaking to the New Yorker three weeks after Donald Trump was elected president, Barack Obama name-checked four gifted pols he trusted to lead Democrats into the suddenly terrifying future. Three were U.S. senators, all in their 50s. Then there was Buttigieg, a boyish municipal servant with a Maltese last name nobody can quite pronounce. (It\u2019s Boot-edge-edge, though South Bend residents just call him Mayor Pete.)\n\nThere is one glaring problem: The routes to higher office that are available to Buttigieg, as a progressive hailing from a state trending in the opposite direction, are winding and pockmarked. He could dither in Congress, if he could win a seat at all in his Republican-leaning home district. He could risk his political hide running statewide in Indiana, even though Trump bested Hillary Clinton there by 19 points. Maybe Buttigieg angles for a Cabinet post in the next Democratic administration? That\u2019s three years away, at minimum. Last winter, he sought to lead the Democratic National Committee, earning endorsements from five former party chairs, but he ultimately ceded to contenders with higher name recognition.\n\nA bitter irony is at play here: At a moment when the faces of the Democratic Party are 67-year-old Chuck Schumer and 77-year-old Nancy Pelosi, when so many novice Democrats are banging at the gate, spurred into action by powerful social currents and opposition to the president, one of the party\u2019s most talented young politicians has nowhere to go. Buttigieg could theoretically lead his party out of the Trump-era wilderness\u2014if only he can find his way out of South Bend.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s New Yorker nod was illustrative. Yes, Democrats hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the Great Depression. Yes, wounds from the 2016 primary cut deep. And yes, the party\u2019s current leadership represents something of a gerontocracy, filled with presidential hopefuls (Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders) who were teenagers when the Beatles played Ed Sullivan. To find an inspiring upstart who could potentially unify the Democratic establishment and its ascendant left wing, Obama had to reach all the way down to South Bend, the fourth-biggest city in the country\u2019s 17th most-populated state. Was there a dogcatcher he overlooked?\n\nOn the other hand, Obama could have named anyone in the entire party; even if the Democratic bench is as thin as some rank-and-file members fear, it\u2019s not barren. That he tossed out Buttigieg as a standard-bearer, without qualification, speaks to the mayor\u2019s combination of life experiences and governing talent. One morning last summer, I trailed Buttigieg on his way to a Rotary luncheon, where he was scheduled to give loosely prepared remarks. He walks quickly and with purpose, almost like a hound dog\u2014head leaning forward, shoulders slightly hunched, his destination never far from mind. He\u2019s both shorter and less naturally charismatic than a typical male politician, with a trim build and a middle-school haircut. (Brad Stevens, the famously youthful head coach of the Boston Celtics, could be his brother.)\n\nWe cut over on Jefferson Boulevard, one of several roads his administration retrofitted as part of a $25 million Smart Streets project. The running joke used to be that a South Bender could fire a shotgun downtown after 5 p.m. and hit nothing; a series of one-way highways stunted pedestrian activity. Buttigieg hosted dozens of public meetings and reviewed land use research from across the world, and then tempered public frustration over two years of heavy construction, during which the city overhauled 15 miles of its streetscape, adding two-ways and dedicated bike lanes. Nearly complete, South Bend\u2019s core now feels like a destination, not somewhere just to pass through anxiously.\n\nIt\u2019s the type of aggressive undertaking that inspired Buttigieg to run in the first place. \u201cThe fundamental project,\u201d he says, \u201cwas to get this city to believe in itself again.\u201d\n\nTwelve months before he took office, Newsweek had listed South Bend as one of America\u2019s 10 \u201cdying\u201d cities. Sure, the methodology was sloppy, but the magazine was tapping into an underlying pessimism that had animated civic life since before Buttigieg\u2019s birth. The once-pristine Chase Tower had fallen into receivership; the old Drewrys Brewery on the Northwest Side, reduced to rubble, looked like somewhere you would take your punk band to shoot cover art. Sometimes Buttigieg uses the terminology of natural disasters to describe the effects of deindustrialization: \u201cThe economic collapse is no different in its physical impact. It just takes longer.\u201d\n\nSeveral people I spoke with compared the 14th floor of the County-City building, where a diverse staff of six and an army of decorated interns work to solve the city\u2019s problems, to a shrunken version of Capitol Hill. (I met one Harvard grad student who, during her summer internship, was using a busted copier as a standing desk.) As an urban petri dish, South Bend itself is an attractive place to put theory into practice\u2014small enough that a topic feels manageable, big enough for the eventual solution to make a difference. Buttigieg sets the tone, fueled by a stream of black coffee, a service member\u2019s discipline and a sincere interest in public policy. He\u2019s a person who will talk with authority and enthusiasm about leaf removal or way-finding signage.\n\nHe can get philosophical about the moral import of local government, too. Essential services should be squared away, freeing people \u201cto work on whatever they think matters in life.\u201d And transparency is both sound policy and politics; a 3-1-1 hotline the city rolled out during Buttigieg\u2019s first term has now taken 1 million calls, giving residents an outlet to air grievances while providing administration officials with extra information to analyze.\n\nThen there\u2019s the economic development piece, in which City Hall plays a key promotional role. Early on, Buttigieg and his team set about demolishing or repairing 1,000 abandoned homes in 1,000 days, an almost asinine goal that required staffers to digitize 8-foot-tall piles of code forms just to figure out which properties they should target and who owned them. Over the years, the administration helped incubate what some are calling the \u201cSilicon Prairie,\u201d reimagining South Bend as a tech hub where startups, some affiliated with Notre Dame, can take advantage of low costs and a concentration of fiber optic cables. (In a poetic turn, a handful of companies have set up shop on the remediated Studebaker site.) The remainder of Buttigieg\u2019s second term will see multimillion dollar investment in parks and trails, along with a push for citywide early childhood education. Unemployment has been cut in half since 2012. Hip restaurants are sprouting. Empty factories are being retrofitted. The population is modestly increasing.\n\nThe trick, Buttigieg found, was to appeal to South Benders\u2019 pride without collapsing into paralyzing nostalgia. Mark Neal, the former deputy mayor, calls his old boss \u201cthe perfect person at the perfect time\u201d to lead a Rust Belt town on the rebound. \u201cHe was young, he was dynamic, he was smart,\u201d Neal says. \u201cHe had ideas.\u201d And he has paired that energy with rigor, says South Bend Common Council President Tim Scott. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything radical,\u201d Scott says. \u201cHe\u2019s always going to have the data behind him. He\u2019s going to do the research 10 times more than anyone else.\u201d\n\nLittle of this work is ideological, at least by the definition traditionally deployed in Washington. Nor is it glamorous. \u201cThey are not calling to ask about Syria or abortion,\u201d Buttigieg says of his constituents. \u201cThey want to know if I can get the dead possum out of the road.\u201d But it is pretty solid training for someone learning the ins and outs of public affairs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re mayor, you have to learn how to listen,\u201d says former Obama consigliere David Axelrod. Buttigieg, in Axelrod\u2019s opinion, \u201chas an enormous facility for listening to people, processing what they say, thinking about it and responding in a genuine way.\u201d\n\nSix years in, Buttigieg has even embraced the ceremonial aspects of his job\u2014he knows his presence and bearing matter. Take the Rotary luncheon, before a hundred or so diners on a dreary Wednesday. Everything is beige: the conference room walls, the table cloths, the lasagna warming on the buffet. The air conditioning is running, unnecessarily, at full blast. There are no television cameras, no radio microphones. If one wanted to mail in a public appearance, this wouldn\u2019t be a bad option.\n\nBut after picking at a side salad, Buttigieg stands at the dais and delivers a polished and witty rundown of his priorities. He admits that, during golf outings, he usually hangs out near the putting green so as to avoid \u201cinjuries or arrests.\u201d Eventually, he lays out \u201cthe big picture, which is that our city is on a roll.\u201d Somewhere during his spiel, the woman who introduced Buttigieg bends over her plate and snaps a commemorative photo, at an angle that could be only described as awkward. And on the way out, as a parting gift, a cheerful Rotarian hands Buttigieg a brick with a plaque on the front and a jar of homemade salsa. Buttigieg has no clue what to do with either, but he accepts both with an eager smile. \n\n\n\nDuring the few days that I hung by as Buttigieg bounced around South Bend last year, he promoted the city\u2019s municipal I.D. cards at a community radio station, gamely dusting off his high school Spanish, one of seven languages he speaks conversationally. He read a Mo Willems picture book to a gaggle of children at a pre-K program, who asked him critical questions afterward, like whether he owned a Lamborghini. (He does not.) I watched him spill a chamoy con mango ice cream bar on his crisp blue suit, nibble on tapas during a happy hour fundraiser and confidently cycle to his favorite bar using South Bend\u2019s dockless bike share system. Without fail, nearly everywhere we went, someone pressed Mayor Pete to run for president.\n\nThe pleas were unprompted and hard to ignore. He claims it\u2019s a recent phenomenon, connected to the jarring turnover in the White House last January. Anxiety over Democrats\u2019 future provides additional fuel. It\u2019s dispiriting to watch Washington insiders flail around for a convincing message, or worse, relitigate the crushing 2016 election. Then someone like Buttigieg arrives on the scene\u2014an urban mayor who can effectively sell progressive policies to neglected working-class voters, and who also happens to be a gay naval reservist with a degree from Oxford?\n\n\u201cWhat are you supposed to say?\u201d Buttigieg asks, about the newfound attention. \u201cThe school newspaper ran a story when I was at Harvard on students who wanted to be president one day. They might have actually called me. Even at that tender age, I had the good sense not to comment.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s started to do, in dribs and drabs, is develop a national profile. There was the DNC race, in which he couched his candidacy as a break from the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton proxy war and introduced himself to a wider swath of Democratic donors. Since then, he has hosted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2014a college acquaintance\u2014along his tour of America, and jumped on the late-night talk show circuit (Seth Meyers, Chelsea Handler). In September, Buttigieg headlined the Progress Iowa Corn Feed, an annual gathering of top Iowa Democrats in that crucial caucus state, and launched Hitting Home, a PAC to make independent expenditures in both federal and statehouse races. (The PAC had raised nearly $200,000 by the end of 2017, according to its year-end disclosure report.) His travel schedule, per the South Bend Tribune, has more than doubled during his second term.\n\nSipping a brown ale last summer at Four Winds Field, home to a Chicago Cubs minor league affiliate, Buttigieg laid out his strategic pitch. Democrats should fight for fairness and their own, pro-government version of freedom\u2014to marry or bargain collectively or switch jobs without fear of crippling medical debt, all with the help of basic public protections. \u201cSome people my age are seduced by this libertarian idea,\u201d he says, \u201c[of] having very little of anything by way of a role for government. I found that in my personal experience, freedom is secured by good government just as it\u2019s threatened by bad government.\u201d\n\nIt is a message that should resonate throughout the country, Buttigieg feels, among voters from diverse racial and socio-economic backgrounds. Targeting discrete slices of the electorate is counterproductive, and Democrats aren\u2019t that effective at it anyhow. \u201cI don\u2019t think the left-versus-center competition is really intelligible anymore,\u201d he adds. For too long, Democratic politics were \u201csimply keyed off whatever\u2019s going on on the Republican side.\u201d Now that the Republican Party is \u201ccompletely scrambled,\u201d a Democratic Party that \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to be anything but [the GOP\u2019s] mirror image is in an equal-but-opposite scramble.\u201d\n\nEverybody in South Bend knows Buttigieg will look for another job someday. \u201cNobody here wants to see Pete leave\u2014that\u2019s a fact,\u201d says Jason Critchlow, chairman of the St. Joseph County Democratic Party. \u201cBut I think a lot of people have come to terms with the fact that this guy can do more. He\u2019s got more to offer.\u201d\n\nWhere he goes is less clear. Buttigieg let pass the chance to primary incumbent U.S. Senator Joe Donnelly, a fellow Democrat from north-central Indiana up for reelection this fall. Biding his time as a backbencher in the U.S. House doesn\u2019t interest him, even a little. \u201cMy paycheck would go up, but I\u2019m not sure my impact would,\u201d he says. He could challenge Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb in 2020. It would be a natural step for an ambitious executive, but, as several Hoosiers told me, a precarious one, too: Holcomb is a well-regarded Republican in a state with Republican supermajorities, and Indiana has never elected an openly gay state legislator, much less a constitutional officer. Winning in South Bend is one thing\u2014only 10,589 people showed up to vote in 2015\u2014but the whole state is another matter.\n\nButtigieg believes Democrats shouldn\u2019t shy away from uphill battles. \u201cIt matters how we compete, even in the areas we\u2019re never going to win,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially if you believe true victory looks less like a day when Democrats are in control everywhere, [and] looks more like a day when Republicans are starting to sound more like Democrats.\u201d Yet the stakes are considerably higher now, with Buttigieg\u2019s career picking up momentum. Is it worth it for him to expend his accumulated capital taking on an incumbent who, under the right conditions, might clobber him? \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t run for governor in 2020, then he has to wait another two years after that for a senatorial seat,\u201d says Brian Howey, a veteran Indiana political reporter. \u201cThere are not many paths for him to emerge.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strange byproduct of our political system that someone like Buttigieg, by virtue of geography, could find himself landlocked. He doesn\u2019t scoff at his current posting, nor should he. After all, the Democratic Party is primarily an urban one now; cities are centers of \u201cresistance\u201d and laboratories for progressives who are serious about effective governance. At the same time, the list of mayors who have jumped straight into presidential politics is short and uninspiring: Sam Yorty, John Lindsay, Rudy Giuliani, to name a few. And as a national launching pad, South Bend\u2014complicated as it might be, and in a swing region where Democrats have lost important ground\u2014doesn\u2019t exactly have the cache of, say, Los Angeles, where Mayor Eric Garcetti is reportedly plotting a presidential run.\n\nWendy Davis ran for governor of Texas in 2014, a year after her career-defining abortion-rights filibuster at the Austin Statehouse. Campaigning from Houston to El Paso, and fighting off a better resourced and more organized state Republican Party, \u201cwas just a wearying task, as you can imagine,\u201d Davis says. (She lost the race by 20 points.) And so, the former state senator understands why someone like Buttigieg, or former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro, also a Democrat, might consider an otherwise premature presidential run. \u201cUnbelievably, in some sense it is more feasible to win nationwide than it is to win within their own states, with the existing infrastructure as it is,\u201d she says. Swing staters get plenty of financial and organizational attention from Democrats in Washington\u2014less so their counterparts in Republican strongholds. \u201cThat should be a wake-up call for us,\u201d Davis adds, \u201cto really think about the investments that ought to be made in these red states.\u201d\n\nAsk Buttgieg himself to forecast the future, and he gets uncharacteristically circumspect. \u201cWhatever the time comes, it will be very hard to step away from this job, just because it\u2019s such a great job,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest job I\u2019ve ever had. But it\u2019s just really rewarding and nourishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy guess is that he does not have a set game plan, which is probably smart,\u201d says Jack Colwell, a veteran political columnist for the South Bend Tribune. \u201cHe\u2019ll see what develops.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore the baseball game at Four Winds Field, we stop by the house Buttigieg shares with his fianc\u00e9, Glezman, so he can change into casual clothes and walk Truman, their rambunctious rescue dog. Buttigieg bought the place in 2009; the previous owner had fallen into foreclosure after her idea for a French-inspired bed and breakfast fell through. It\u2019s beautifully restored, with dark wood molding and a spacious porch overlooking the St. Joseph River. Inside, the couple has crammed an enviable collection of books, totems from Afghanistan (antique guns, intricate rugs) and a salvaged Hanover grand piano. \u201cBit of a money pit,\u201d Buttigieg calls it. His mortgage payment is roughly $450 per month.\n\nAround the block Truman leads us, past Buttigieg\u2019s childhood home and Triangle Park, where the trees served as goalposts for neighborhood football games. There\u2019s no security detail monitoring him, no invasive entourage interfering with his routine, no hassling constituents, no political calculations to make. Demanding as it can be, serving as mayor allows him and Glezman a level of comfort neither is itching to give up.\n\nOn sleepy Marquette Avenue, a middle-aged couple emerges from their garage and hollers to grab Buttigeg\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHow you doing, mayor! What are you doing Friday?\u201d\n\nMore than a hundred people are coming through the house, they tell him. The theme is \u201cMargaritaville.\u201d There will be drinks and music, an easy evening. \u201cWell that sounds fun!\u201d Buttigieg yells back. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s serious about the invitation.

Already, Ponta is emerging as the main counterweight to PSD party strongman Liviu Dragnea, said Magdin.\n\n\u201cThe polarization between the two helps Ponta,\u201d he said. Ponta\u2019s challenge will be to win financial backing from the private sector and woo the public, in a shifting political landscape that Magdin described as \u201ca negative referendum on Dragnea and who will replace him.\u201d\n\nIn the dock\nA more immediate challenge is his sentencing on March 20 on charges of forgery, complicity to tax evasion and money laundering dating back to his time as a lawyer in 2007-2008. The National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA)\u00a0requested\u00a0a jail sentence last month; Ponta denies the charges, which he says are not related to his political activity, but declined to go into the details of the case.\n\nFormer Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta pictured during an interview with journalists at the Romanian government headquarters in Bucharest on June 9, 2015 | Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\u201cI defended myself in court. I haven\u2019t talked about this in public as I didn\u2019t want to be judged on TV, but in court. I will accept the decision, whether I like it or not,\u201d said Ponta, who as prime minister\u00a0proposed current chief DNA prosecutor Laura Codru\u021ba K\u00f6vesi\u00a0(who was\u00a0named by POLITICO as one of 28 individuals\u00a0who would have a major impact on Europe in 2015)\u00a0for the job. Current Justice Minister Tudorel Toader\u00a0wants her out, saying she has overstepped the mark and doesn\u2019t respect parliament\u2019s authority.\n\nPonta defended the DNA\u2019s mission to investigate Romania\u2019s endemic high-level corruption, but feels its powers need fine-tuning to avoid abuse: He cites the anticorruption office\u2019s investigation of his former deputy prime minister, Gabriel Oprea, over a road accident in 2015 that led to the death of a policeman in his motorcade. The DNA said Oprea should not have had a police escort as he wasn\u2019t on official business.\n\nThe former prime minister spoke to POLITICO during a visit to Brussels to prepare for the March 22 conference of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, where he is due to speak. (If sentenced to prison, he intends to appeal.) Ponta was coy about whether his presence at the pre-EU summit conference of a pan-European party whose MEPs include members of Britain\u2019s ruling Conservatives and Poland\u2019s governing Law and Justice party means he hopes to join them.\n\nHowever, Ponta does want his new party to run for the European Parliament election in 2019. Once it has defined its ideology and worked out how best it can contribute to Romanian politics, it can turn to thinking about \u201cthe vision of Europe we find ourselves in.\u201d\n\nThe former prime minister believes the established center-right and center-left parties, such as the Social Democrats he used to represent, have run out of energy and can no longer deliver a vision for a more efficient, reformed European Union.\n\n\u201cSo the first thing is to accept that a cycle has ended and that if Europe is not reformed in the next legislature, we will have more and more anti-European votes and more rebels like Poland, Hungary and more recently Romania,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated stories on these topics:", "link": null, "source": "Politico - EU", "location": []}, {"author": "Jim Saksa", "body": "HOUSTON, Pa. \u2014 \u201cJesus always started out by going and being with a certain group of people,\u201d says Conor Lamb as we\u2019re winding down hilly back roads to the Washington County Gun Show. It snowed a few inches in Southwestern Pennsylvania last night and, other than the highways we\u2019re avoiding, nothing\u2019s been plowed. While I\u2019m silently saying Hail Marys as the campaign staffer driving whips around farms and fields, Lamb calmly continues explaining how his faith informs his politics.\n\nJesus, Lamb tells me, tried to get to know people as people before he tried to win them over with arguments. He \u201cwasn\u2019t asking people where they stood on abortion before they came and sat down with them.\u201d\n\nLamb, the Democratic candidate in a neck-and-neck special election on March 13, has to hope the people of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District will likewise listen to what he has to say before judging him by his party affiliation. In this part of the state, where highway billboards sport Bible verses and the start of deer hunting season is a holiday, Democratic politicians tend to flunk doctrinal tests. Even though registered Democrats technically outnumber Republicans here by 70,000, Trump won the district by nearly 20 percentage points. Mitt Romney and John McCain posted similar margins. Former Rep. Tim Murphy, the outspoken anti-abortion Republican whose seat Lamb is running to fill\u2014Murphy resigned after reports that he encouraged his married mistress to get an abortion after a pregnancy scare\u2014won eight straight elections, the first six by double-digit margins and the last two uncontested.\n\nLamb, a square-jawed 33-year-old Marine Corps officer who resigned from his job as a federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh to run, has a chance to upend the district\u2019s politics\u2014as long as he can avoid being labeled a liberal without discouraging the district\u2019s not inconsiderable Democrat base from turning out. A devout Catholic, Lamb is pro-union and pro-gun, backs bipartisan deals for fixing Obamacare and the nation\u2019s infrastructure, wants more job training and less college debt, and says he\u2019s pro-fracking but pro-environment, too. And he\u2019s betting that this mix of economic populism and moderate social politics can win the predominantly blue collar district. (Full disclosure: Lamb and I both played rugby at the University of Pennsylvania. We overlapped his senior year, 2005-06.)\n\nLamb\u2019s opponent, state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2014best known for sponsoring a bill that would have required posting \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on every school in the Commonwealth\u2014has a simpler message: He was \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump,\u201d and is an enthusiastic supporter of the president\u2019s agenda. But there are signs the president\u2019s popularity is waning here. A Monmouth University poll showed 42 percent of voters in the 18th strongly disapprove of his performance, compared with just 37 percent who strongly approve. When asked if they support the president\u2019s efforts in office, 48 percent said yes, 47 percent said no. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Saccone made 5 percent of respondents say they were more likely to back Saccone; it made 8 percent say they were more likely to support Lamb.\n\nGiven these shifting politics, political observers say Lamb has a tight, but plausible, path to victory in March. He needs suburban women with college educations and moderate social views\u2014both Democrats and Republicans wavering in their party allegiances post Trump\u2014to back him big (which is probably why he praises nurses and teachers in the same breath as veterans and cops). He also needs the district\u2019s 86,000 union households to vote their economic interests, and for enough of the rural, working-class Republican base to find him sufferable to stay home.\n\nThe Republican Party sees this path too\u2014and is pouring resources, both money and manpower, into this Pennsylvania district ahead of March 13. So far, Republican super PACs have thrown millions into the race, opening canvassing offices and flooding Pittsburgh\u2019s airwaves with ads calling Lamb a liberal. Trump himself made a visit to support Saccone\u2014as have Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence\u2014and says he will return.\n\nAfter all, the stakes are enormous. As the polls narrow\u2014the latest has Lamb just 3 points behind Saccone\u2014this race is being closely watched by political seismologists for early tremors of an oncoming blue tsunami in the November midterms. If Lamb, a virtual unknown five months ago, can win this once seemingly impregnable Republican stronghold\u2014one that so overwhelmingly supported Trump just 16 months ago, then other Democratic candidates across the country can do the same.\n\n\n\nOn this frigid Saturday in early January, Lamb has just wrapped up a rally at an American Legion in tiny Houston, Pennsylvania, where around 70 supporters braved snow-covered roads to hear him speak. But the labor leaders and left-leaning vets that filled the hall are already members of Lamb\u2019s growing flock of disciples. There\u2019s more missionary work to be done.\n\n\u201cMy faith tells me where to go and get started and what kind of sympathy to have for people once you get there,\u201d Lamb says. Today, his faith is leading him to the gun show in Washington County. Lamb has plotted a path to victory that runs through places like this, where he can evangelize to voters like Ken Gedeon, who is idling beside a display case full of World War II-era sidearms.\n\nGedeon is a registered Democrat and an avid hunter. The retiree from Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania, is upset at Saccone for supporting a bill to allow the use of automatic rifles during deer season. \u201cWhen I grew up, I was taught: You shoot one shot,\u201d Gedeon says. \u201cYou don\u2019t come get a second or third shot.\u201d\n\nGedeon voted for Trump. \u201cI felt good voting for who I voted for,\u201d he adds, unprompted. And he still feels good about his vote. \u201cYes, 100 percent,\u201d he says. \u201cNo qualms about him at all.\u201d\n\nBut Gedeon votes for the man, not the party. After Lamb introduces himself, Gedeon wastes no time sharing his displeasure with Saccone, practically a neighbor, for never asking him about the hunting bill. Lamb asserts he\u2019s pro-hunter and pro-gun, says he would\u2019ve given Gedeon a call, and asks for his support. (Years ago, at an alumni gathering when Lamb was still a Marine Corps JAG and I was in law school, he and I got into it over gun control, where he questioned why the vast majority of responsible gun owners should have their freedoms burdened by the sins of a few criminals, and the practical improbability of any law managing to significantly reduce the number of guns.) Gedeon ends the short conversation with a handshake, says he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet, but he\u2019s open to voting Democrat in the special election.\n\n\u201cWe can get him,\u201d Lamb says confidently a few minutes later as we walk toward a Marines-themed display case full of combat knives. If he can meet voters, and talk to them\u2014really talk to them honestly and rationally, and not get bogged down by partisan labels and national politics\u2014Lamb\u2019s sure he can win this thing.\n\nTake, for example, immigration. In a district dotted with shuttered steel mills, Lamb believes voters will come around to his position if he can hold an honest, earnest discussion. \u201cI think too often the whole issue gets talked about as if we were writing from a blank slate, or we can pick whatever we want, or the government is all powerful,\u201d Lamb says. \u201cNone of which is true.\u201d\n\nThere are only four real options on immigration, Lamb explains. One, try to kick every undocumented immigrant out. Two, legalize the Dreamers\u2014undocumented immigrants brought here as children\u2014but try to kick out all the other migrants here illegally. Three, \u201cthe Dreamers obviously should stay,\u201d and \u201cthe other 11\u00bd million people, who knows how they got here, but they\u2019re here, they\u2019re in the shadows, that\u2019s not really helping anybody, [so] let\u2019s find a way to pull them out [of the shadows.]\u201d And then there\u2019s four: no change, continue the current policies.\n\n\u201cI really believe that if you present those four options to people, 90 percent choose option three,\u201d he says, adding that he also supports increased border security, but at ports of entry, not a wall.\n\nLamb also believes voters can distinguish between a politician who is pro-coal worker\u2014like he is, backing a federal guaranty miners\u2019 pensions\u2014rather than just pro-coal. The lost mining jobs aren\u2019t coming back, Lamb says. \u201cWe have to get real about what the options are, and make sure the economy is diverse,\u201d which means he\u2019s not ready to trash the Clean Air Act just yet.\n\nAnd Lamb trusts voters can accept that he\u2019s anti-abortion, personally, but respects that choice is the law of the land.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Lamb is taking him head-on, stylistically if not substantively (the candidate is quick to say he\u2019s eager to work on issues like infrastructure and opioids with the president). While Trump and his detractors trade competing narrative volleys, armed with alternative sets of facts to back their differing opinions, Lamb is betting his campaign on his ability to marshal objective truth to cut through the noise and sway voters.\n\nBut Lamb knows no one will listen to his well-argued points if the district\u2019s 93-percent white, predominantly working-class residents dismiss him as just another liberal elitist before he can even open his mouth. \u201cFDR said one time that the true test of government was that people wanted to know that their government walked on the same side of the street that they did,\u201d Lamb says. \u201cSo, that\u2019s the impression I want people to be left with: Not necessarily what my policy papers say, just that I\u2019m accessible and that I\u2019m one of them\u2014that they can always find me, and trust me to at least tell them the truth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a campaign strategy that hinges on how Lamb interacts with voters\u2014something he does pretty well for a novice. He tends to speak with deep resolve in his voice\u2014even his questions seem to end in periods. Like a lot of politicians, Lamb is tall\u20146-foot-3\u2014but he has a habit of leaning in and jutting his head forward a bit when he talks to voters, as if he\u2019s been drawn in by whatever you have to say. He\u2019ll repeat your name before the conversation\u2019s end, and make a lame joke at his own expense about getting lost once in your home town. The body language, the call backs, the self-deprecation all instill the sense that he\u2019s really listening\u2014a useful trick here, where voters have long felt forgotten. \n\n\n\nIf Lamb does retail politics like a natural, it might be because he comes from a political family. Lamb was born and raised in the suburbs of Pittsburgh to a family of Irish Catholic Democrats. His grandfather, Tom, was the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate and his uncle, Michael, is Pittsburgh\u2019s controller. After high school at all-boys Central Catholic, Lamb moved across the state to go to the University of Pennsylvania, where he stayed for law school. After Penn, Lamb eschewed big law for the Marine Corps, which commissioned him as a Judge Advocate in Okinawa, Japan, despite Lamb\u2019s request to go into infantry. (\u201cYou went to Penn Law,\u201d Lamb remembers being told, \u201cI can make anybody an infantry officer, I need you to be a lawyer.\u201d)\n\nHe counts a Lasallian Christian Brother among his closest friends. The two like to critique Sunday liturgy the way movie buffs discuss an actor\u2019s performance, picking apart not just what was said in the homily, but how it was delivered. Such careful focus on how a priest can enliven and update material that\u2019s 2,000 years old has paid off on the trail, where Lamb tends to deliver short, lively speeches heavy on patriotism and optimism and light on legislative proposals, leaving the longer policy discussions for one-on-one chats.\n\nHe\u2019s not afraid to throw some punches, though. As a federal prosecutor, Lamb directed a righteous fury at \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d drug dealers and gun runners. On the campaign trail, it\u2019s mostly Saccone and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan who draw his opprobrium. After the American Legion campaign rally, Lamb grants a series of interviews, fielding questions about abortion, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Trump. For Lamb, nothing good can come from those lines of inquiry, and so he deflects. \u201cI\u2019m not running against the president, I\u2019m running against Rick Saccone,\u201d Lamb likes to say, pivoting to a litany of his opponent\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cHe votes against education funding, he voted against Narcan, the thing that saves people\u2019s lives, and he\u2019s gonna have some explaining about his support for Paul Ryan, who now wants to come after Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nLamb has also run heavily on the Republican tax cuts, calling them a \u201ccomplete betrayal of the middle class.\u201d So too have the super PACs backing Saccone. Their attack on Lamb can be summed up as, \u201cHe\u2019s a liberal who opposes the tax cuts and would support Nancy Pelosi.\u201d The truth is more complicated\u2014Lamb has actually called on Pelosi to step down from Democratic leadership\u2014but it\u2019s difficult to say whether voters will even get to hear those protestations over the massive amounts of super PAC attack ads asserting otherwise. Republican PACs have already spent $4.7 million in support of Saccone since Murphy resigned in October. That\u2019s double what Murphy had to fundraise in any of his races in the 18th.\n\nWhile the Republicans are trying to make all politics national, Lamb\u2019s trying to keep things local. He has foresworn super PAC support and is keeping the fired-up national Democratic groups at arms-length. According to the Washington Post, Republican-linked groups have outspent their Democratic rivals here 17-to-1.\n\nHis campaign says it\u2019s a deliberate move\u2014that he\u2019s worried that outside PAC support would boomerang and bolster the accusations that he\u2019s just another liberal Democrat. His campaign maintains it doesn\u2019t want to fall into the same trap Jon Ossoff did in Georgia, where national groups flooded in and turned the first special election after 2016 into a referendum on the two national parties instead of two individuals running for Congress.\n\nLamb, who managed to raise $560,000 in just two months last year and has spent nearly a million so far in campaign ads, feels he can personally raise enough money to keep the race close, especially given his opponent\u2019s reputation as a weak fundraiser. Saccone raised just $214,000 last year, including $42,000 transferred from a Senate campaign he abandoned to seek the 18th seat, and his campaign has spent less than $100,000 on ads. (Saccone\u2019s campaign did not respond to repeated interview requests.)\n\nLamb has recently accepted outside help from some prominent Democrats, but only those who fit the mold: white, Catholic, pro-union. Rep. Joe Kennedy III made a campaign stop, and Rep. Tim Ryan, who challenged Pelosi for leadership, has sent fundraising appeals on Lamb\u2019s behalf. So, too, did Randy Bryce, the Democratic ironworker challenging Paul Ryan in Wisconsin. Joe Biden will make a visit and his American Possibilities PAC sent out a fundraising letter on Lamb\u2019s behalf. \n\nSome of Lamb\u2019s supporters worry that his overabundance of caution is allowing Republicans to define him\u2014a serious disadvantage for a candidate with little name recognition. The same poll taken in mid-February that showed Lamb within striking distance of Saccone also showed that 20 percent of district voters still had no opinion of him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the campaign is taking advantage of the moment right now,\u201d says a Democratic consultant familiar with the area.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any doubt that [Lamb\u2019s] being significantly outspent on television by the Saccone people and their interests,\u201d says G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College poll and the dean of Pennsylvania political observers. \u201cThe Democrats at a national level and their interest groups don\u2019t seem to be nearly as engaged. \u2026 The Republicans realize how significant this is and they don\u2019t want to risk losing this seat and creating a literal meltdown.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe special election won\u2019t directly affect the outcome of the November midterms. Lamb and Saccone are running to fill the remainder of Murphy\u2019s term, meaning that whoever wins will be up for reelection just seven months later in November. Win or lose, Lamb says he\u2019ll be running again then.\n\nBy then, the district may look radically different than it does today. In January, the state Supreme Court found Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional districts unconstitutional and ordered the General Assembly to draw up new maps in time for the May primary. Republicans in Harrisburg have submitted a new map that would make the 18th District even more rural and place Lamb\u2019s Mount Lebanon home outside of the district. Pennsylvania Democrats immediately decried the new plans, and Gov. Tom Wolf submitted his own in response. The state Supreme Court said it will decide on a map by Monday and may draw its own\u2014a decision that is likely set off another set of legal challenges before any redistricting is finalized.\n\nFor now, Lamb\u2019s focused on the race ahead of him. After a full day on the trail, I meet up with him at a dimly lit corner table at a Hilton Garden Inn just outside Pittsburgh. It\u2019s 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday and I\u2019m nursing a beer. Lamb, who started his day at 5:30 a.m., orders a coffee, black. He has more meetings after this interview.\n\nWe\u2019re joined at the table by Lamb\u2019s younger brother, Coleman, who\u2019s working full time on the campaign for free, lest anyone accuse Conor of nepotism, and Mike Madeo, the candidate\u2019s body man. Madeo, who met Lamb in the Marines, is now playing aide-de-campaign for a guy four years his junior. I ask him why. He leans in and looks me directly in the eye.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the antidote to what is wrong with modern day politics,\u201d Madeo says. \u201cI think he\u2019s actually going to work with people to try to get shit done.\u201d\n\nMinus the swearing, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from a campaign staffer. But it\u2019s also a testament of faith I hear again and again from Lamb\u2019s choir of die-hard supporters: He can transcend this world of partisan hackery, fake news narratives and outrage-driven politics. Just how much of that is actually about Lamb, and how much of that is simply anti-Trump fervor, is hard to tell.\n\nFor his part, the candidate does little to dampen the hopes others place in him to restore politics to some bygone era when morally outstanding men brokered bipartisan deals and used long-winded, in-person arguments to sway voters instead of outrage-inducing tribal appeals on Twitter and TV.\n\nInstead, he sees it as a kind of legacy.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather \u2026 always used to say\u2014I remember it really well\u2014that he was proud to be a politician,\u201d says Lamb, who bought and moved into his grandfather\u2019s Mount Lebanon house last year. \u201cHe wanted to redeem that word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been ashamed to tell anyone that I was interested in this life [running for office], because I saw it [growing up], and I knew it could be good. And, honestly, I probably get more motivated the more maligned and degraded the whole thing has become.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ben White", "body": "Donald Trump swept into the White House on a promise to run the government like a business and stock his administration with titans of industry.\n\nJust over a year into Trump\u2019s presidency, those titans are leaving, driven out by a chief executive who doesn\u2019t want to hear no, doesn\u2019t trust anyone but himself and can\u2019t stand to share the spotlight, even with those he once hailed as \u201cthe best people\u201d on earth for these jobs.\n\nTrump humiliated Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of oil industry giant ExxonMobil whom he once described as \u201cthe embodiment of the American dream,\u201d firing him by tweet. He repeatedly rejected the advice of National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, driving the former president of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs nuts with his stubborn insistence on tariffs and hastening Cohn\u2019s exit.\n\nAnd he went ice cold on Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, reportedly telling the Wall Street legend that his understanding of trade was \u201cterrible,\u201d as West Wing aides leaked stories about Ross dozing off in meetings. Remember those CEO councils Trump initially set up to get advice from America\u2019s top executives? They shut down in August.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for publicly and privately torturing powerful leaders in his administration extends to military brass. National security adviser H.R. McMaster is likely on the way out with chief of staff John Kelly, a retired four-star general, possibly to follow. But it is Trump\u2019s break with his Masters of the Universe that undercuts most clearly a central premise of his appeal as a candidate: He knew what it took to be successful and he would hire people in his own image. The breakup, say White House officials, outside experts and even the president\u2019s close friends, was inevitable.\n\nTrump for decades ran a private real-estate and branding empire where he was the only star. He ran a personality-driven campaign where he said and did whatever he wanted, a strategy that resulted in stunning primary wins and a general election victory that few saw coming. And now Trump is even more fed up with strong-willed advisers who tell him he shouldn\u2019t declare trade wars, or take it so easy on Russia, or decide on a whim to stage a summit with a nuclear-armed North Korean dictator who it turns out might never have extended the invite in the first place.\n\nTrump is simply returning to who he\u2019s always been, a one-man reality show who prefers to be surrounded by admirers who will praise and fawn over him and confirm that all his instincts are correct and brilliant and certain to succeed. The wonder is that anyone is surprised.\n\n\u201cThere is an enormous literature on narcissistic leaders who rise to power because of grandiosity and an overwhelming amount of self-confidence,\u201d Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s business school, told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t tend to get along well with other strong leaders. Trump doesn\u2019t want anyone to stand in his way and he certainly doesn\u2019t want anyone who takes up any of his light or disagrees with him. He wants people who are willing to ingratiate themselves and flatter him. This is the way it was always going to be.\u201d \n\n\n\nWhen Trump hired Cohn away from Goldman Sachs, the president couldn\u2019t stop bragging about what a coup he pulled off by landing one of the top executives from the bluest of blue chip Wall Street firms. Never mind that Trump\u2019s final campaign ad treated Goldman as part of a global cabal out to destroy America.\n\n\u201cAs my top economic advisor, Gary Cohn is going to put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people,\u201d the president said after the hiring. In July of last year, Trump said in Wall Street Journal interview that he was thinking of nominating Cohn to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, possibly the most powerful finance job on the planet.\n\nThen it all came crashing down. Cohn sharply and publicly criticized the president\u2019s equivocating response to a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, leading to a tense Oval Office meeting, resignation threats and the end of Cohn\u2019s Fed chances.\n\nThings improved as Cohn helped drive through Trump\u2019s signature tax cut bill. But then the White House agenda moved on to trade and Cohn began to push back hard against Trump\u2019s instincts to slap giant tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Things came to a head in an Oval Office meeting in January when Cohn told the president his tariffs would crush consumers and industries that rely on imported metals.\n\n\u201cThese are the facts, where are your facts?\u201d Cohn said to Wilbur Ross and Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro, two of the administration\u2019s leading protectionists, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump rejected Cohn\u2019s facts and pushed ahead with tariffs, announcing them in a rushed manner with no actual policy ready to roll out.\n\nDays later, Cohn said he was leaving. And Trump slipped in a parting jab. \u201cHe may be a globalist, but I still like him,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cHe is seriously a globalist. There's no question.\u201d\n\nIn Cohn\u2019s place, Trump has hired former CNBC host and long-time Wall Street economist Larry Kudlow, who is also an avowed free trader and predicted during the campaign that Trump\u2019s trade policies would tank the stock market. In early commentary, Kudlow has moved closer to Trump on trade, applauding the idea of cracking down on China. The former Reagan administration OMB official may yet prove to be just as aggressive as Cohn in resisting Trump\u2019s mercantilist impulses. But the reason Trump hired Kudlow is mainly because he often says nice things about the president on television.\n\n\u201cTrump says he wants to be surrounded by a diversity of opinion but he doesn\u2019t really mean it,\u201d Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution told me. \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to be told that he\u2019s wrong.\u201d \n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s treatment of Tillerson was even more brutal than his clashes with Cohn.\n\nStories began to leak last fall that the president strongly disliked the ExxonMobil CEO, who had different ideas on dealing with Iran, Russia and North Korea. Tillerson, accustomed to being the unquestioned boss himself (after all, he had led a 75,300 employee corporation for 11 years), chafed at Trump\u2019s unwillingness to listen to his ideas or keep him involved in top diplomatic priorities. It was as if Trump was ignoring the very attribute that observers said made Tillerson appealing in the first place: He had negotiated with many key world leaders already\u2014and succeeded at it.\n\nIn late September, after Tillerson said he was working on a dialogue with North Korea about their weapons program, Trump immediately took to Twitter to tell the world his secretary of state shouldn\u2019t bother. \u201cI told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nShortly after this clash, reports emerged that at a July 20th meeting at the Pentagon, Tillerson referred to the president as a \u201cfucking moron.\u201d The secretary of state never denied the remark. He was then left twisting for months amid reports that he would soon be ousted.\n\nThe relationship cratered for good in recent days. While traveling in Africa, Tillerson said the U.S. and North Korea were \u201ca long way\u201d from direct negotiations on the nuclear program. A day later, Trump announced he would hold a summit with the North Korean leader and Tillerson admitted he had no idea the announcement was coming.\n\nOn March 13th, with Tillerson just returning from Africa, Trump fired the secretary of state by tweet, announcing he would be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo. He then also fired Tillerson\u2019s chief spokesman for denying the White House line that Tillerson knew about the firing plans in advance. Trump\u2019s pledge of running the nation like a business had totally gone off the rails.\n\n\u201cNo board of directors at any big company would ever permit this type of treatment or this level of chaos,\u201d says Pfeffer.\n\nFollowing the split with Tillerson and Cohn, some officials inside the administration, on Capitol Hill and in corporate America increasingly fear that the president is entering a period in which he will cast aside any strong advisers\u2014whether top executives or senior military officials\u2014who disagree with him while increasingly making rash decisions on his own.\n\nAnd they say his early hiring of former top executives with strong personalities never really worked because Trump didn\u2019t care very much about what they had to say and didn\u2019t want them taking high-profile roles.\n\n\u201cYou never really could convince him of anything and he doesn\u2019t really listen to anyone but himself,\u201d one senior White House official told me recently. \u201cYou need people around to make these alternate cases, but I don\u2019t think he really wants that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s friends and defenders don\u2019t really deny that the president is moving into a new phase of his presidency where he will naturally be less inclined to rely on executives who have subject-matter expertise like Cohn or Tillerson. The president is growing in confidence, these people say, and increasingly believes he is best served following his own instincts rather than relying on the savvy guidance of former top executives.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that there have been a number of personnel changes in the White House beginning with the first year and continuing,\u201d Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump confidant, told me. \u201cUnderstandably, the president's been going through an adjustment period after he left business life and went into political life. In politics, he started out with people having great credentials, but discovered that track record is a better criteria.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe question now is what the White House will look like once all the business titans are gone.\n\nThe biggest fear in the economic world is that Trump will no longer have any real constraints on his desire to impose major tariffs both on U.S. allies and on sometime-adversaries like China.\n\nCohn managed to get carve-outs for allies Canada and Mexico in the recently announced steel and aluminum tariffs. But once he\u2019s gone, Trump may feel free to be Trump.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman banker and movie producer, comes out of the business world and is generally in favor of free trade. But he\u2019s viewed both inside the White House and outside as someone very disinclined to buck the president, privately or publicly.\n\nWith Cohn gone, the U.S. is now at greater risk of trade wars and the possible end of the North American Free Trade agreement, a development most economists believe would be catastrophic.\n\n\u201cI think we are already marching down that path and it\u2019s not at all clear what will restrain him,\u201d Galston told me. \u201cHe is under the illusion that trade wars are easy to win and there is no historical evidence to support that. And my fear is that rather than back down his inclination will be to plunge forward and double down in the face of adversity.\u201d\n\nThe other major risk is that the exodus of business minds spreads to military and national security advisers and anyone else in the president\u2019s orbit who dares to express a contrary opinion or urge caution to a chief executive who believes his gut instincts turned him into the one of the most successful people in the world.\n\n\u201cI think all of these types of people will be gone soon and all for the exact same reason,\u201d says Pfeffer. \u201cTrump has gotten to where he is by basically being who he is and if you are a strong-minded person yourself and believe you have something substantial to contribute, you don\u2019t want to stick around and keep getting run over by the boss.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Susan B.

Mark Warner (D-Va.) says in an exclusive new interview.\n\nWarner, the intel committee\u2019s top Democrat, says \u201cend-of-the-year document dumps\u201d produced \u201cvery significant\u201d revelations that \u201copened a lot of new questions\u201d that Senate investigators are now looking into, meaning the inquiry into Trump and the Russia hacking\u2014already nearly a year old\u2014will not be finished for months longer. \u201cWe\u2019ve had new information that raises more questions,\u201d Warner says in the interview, an extensive briefing on the state of the Senate\u2019s Trump-Russia probe for The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs.\n\nWarner also warns about a \u201ccoordinated\u201d attack by the president and \u201cTrump zealots\u201d in the House of Representatives to undermine the legitimacy of the investigations against him, an effort Warner says includes the president\u2019s threats to fire special counsel Robert Mueller and other officials as well as a secret Republican memo alleging \u201cshocking\u201d FBI surveillance abuse against Trump that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is now threatening to release. Warner calls out Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in arguably more explicit terms than any Democrat has yet, saying he has read the underlying classified material used in the memo and that Nunes misrepresented it as part of a McCarthyite \u201csecret Star Chamber\u201d effort to discredit the FBI probe of the president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this coordinated effort to try to impede the investigation,\u201d Warner says. The Nunes memo, which is apparently drawn from information contained in the same late-2017 document dumps that has caused the Senate panel to expand its inquiry, is based on \u201cfabrications\u201d and \u201cconnecting dots that don\u2019t connect,\u201d Warner asserts.\n\nMy interview with Warner\u2014and his revelation of the Senate panel\u2019s expanded investigation into Trump\u2014came a few hours before the New York Times reported that the president had threatened to fire Mueller last summer, leading to days of headlines over whether Congress should step in to legislatively block Trump from being able to oust the special counsel investigating him. Warner and other Democrats, joined by a few Republicans, have been urging such a step for months. Although GOP congressional leaders are unlikely to permit a vote, many senators in both parties have signaled to Trump in recent days that a move against Mueller would amount to an explosive escalation. Firing Mueller \u201cwould be the end of his presidency,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been an on-again, off-again ally of Trump\u2019s, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nBeyond the understandable focus on Mueller\u2019s job security, both disclosures struck me as getting at a perilous truth for the Trump White House one year into his presidency: Not only is the Russia investigation not going away, but questions associated with it are multiplying, whether it\u2019s the new evidence Warner says his committee must now investigate or the revelation that the special counsel himself is on the long list of those, like fired FBI director James Comey and the current deputy FBI director and deputy attorney general, that Trump has made very clear he wants out.\n\nAt a minimum, the fact that we continue to learn so much new information after so many months of investigation is a reminder of why it\u2019s important to be cautious about the endless punditry analyzing the prospects of a probe whose substance we still know very little about. For now at least, questions like the ones endlessly debated on cable TV \u2014 Will Trump be impeached if the House is retaken by Democrats in November? When and how will Mueller deliver a final report on the allegations, and will he seek the unprecedented step of trying to indict a sitting president? \u2014 remain almost pointless speculation.\n\nAnd they will continue to be until the basic concerns we started the investigation with are no longer hanging out there, shadowing the Trump White House with serious doubts that clearly infuriate the president: Did Trump or any close advisers actively collaborate with the Russians who sought to sway the 2016 race on his behalf? Did the president or others seek to cover up their dealings with Russians \u2013 or promise them concrete actions, like lifting U.S. economic sanctions on the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in exchange for Kremlin help? Once in office, have the president or members of his inner circle tried to obstruct the investigations into those questions?\n\nWe may not have the public evidence yet to definitely resolve those questions, but Warner offers a provocative rationale for why it is we are now seeing such a stepped-up campaign by Trump and his defenders against those who seek to provide us the answers.\n\n\u201cMueller is getting closer and closer to the truth,\u201d Warner tells me, and \u201ccloser and closer to the truth is getting closer and closer to the president.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee that Warner leads along with Republican Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina has remained a relative outpost of bipartisanship amid the escalating partisan catcalls over Russia, and throughout our nearly hour-long conversation about the investigation, I found Warner, a successful tech entrepreneur before he became a politician, careful to say what he and the committee know -- and don\u2019t know -- about the explosive Trump-Russia allegations.\n\nOn the revelations contained in the latest document dumps, for example, Warner says the panel still cannot attest to their \u201cveracity or truthfulness\u201d and is now \u201ctrying to either corroborate or not\u201d by calling up to a dozen new witnesses. He also says that the allegations contained in the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and made public last year remain neither \u201cproven nor, conversely, disproven\u201d despite the extensive investigations. \u201cThat's pretty amazing,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause as long as that sits out there, there's going to be a cloud that hangs over this administration.\u201d\n\nWarner says he and the Senate panel remain focused almost exclusively on the initial questions surrounding the Russian election intervention and alleged collusion; the senators have decided that questions surrounding possible Trump obstruction of justice, \u201cbecause it falls into criminality,\u201d should remain largely in the \u201cpurview\u201d of Mueller.\n\nWhile he acknowledges that the Senate probe may have months more to run and that no conclusions have been reached on the key question of Trump and collusion, Warner tells me that a bipartisan majority on the panel is now in agreement on the basic facts of the case aside from that. \u201cVirtually every member of our committee, Democrat or Republican, would agree,\u201d he says, that Russia sought to intervene in 2016 on Trump\u2019s behalf with \u201ctraditional spycraft\u201d of stealing information and then releasing it, along with not-so-traditional methods of using social media platforms, compromising state voting systems and offering \u201cdirt\u201d on Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cSenator Burr and my Republican colleagues, they\u2019ve looked at the same facts I\u2019ve looked at, and we may have areas where we disagree on conclusions, but we don\u2019t disagree on facts,\u201d Warner says, still a noteworthy conclusion given that President Trump himself has continued to cast doubt on the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Russians did in fact seek to influence the presidential race to Trump\u2019s benefit.\n\nStill, the spiraling investigation by the senators as well as Mueller suggests there is much we still don\u2019t know about a case that already has, as the Watergate author Elizabeth Drew put it in an interview for The Global Politico last spring, \u201cmore characters than a Russian novel.\u201d\n\nIn our conversation, Warner reels off a few of the characters whose actions he finds particularly significant \u2013 and about which he did not know when the probe started \u2013 including Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s efforts to build a Trump hotel in Moscow, efforts that continued up to the campaign; the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law, and campaign manager, and Russians claiming to have damaging information on Clinton; and the claim to an Australian diplomat by a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser that he\u2019d been offered information by the Russians.\n\nBut mid-investigation, much confusion still abounds. Consider the case of that former foreign policy adviser. The little-known George Papadopoulos emerged as a surprise figure in the Mueller investigation late last year, when it was revealed he had decided to cooperate in the probe and plead guilty to a charge of lying to the FBI. The president\u2019s defenders have characterized him as little more than an obscure junior official, \u201cthe coffee boy,\u201d as one Trump ally put it. But in an interview last week, Papapdopoulos\u2019s fianc\u00e9e spoke out for the first time and insisted that, far from being a coffee boy, he would emerge as a \u201cJohn Dean\u201d-like figure in the Trump case, offering damning revelations akin to those from the Nixon White House counsel that helped bring down that president.\n\nSo which is it, I ask Warner: coffee boy or John Dean? \u201cI don\u2019t know any coffee boy in any campaign that I\u2019ve been involved with,\u201d the senator quickly replies, \u201cthat had direct communications with the absolute senior leadership with the campaign.\u201d\n\nStill, it will be months if not years before we know for sure what George Papadopoulos \u2013 or Donald Trump for that matter -- knew and when he knew it.\n\nIn the meantime, the spectacle on Capitol Hill is sure to continue. In the Senate, Warner and Burr are negotiating over which witnesses to call next, and Warner makes it very clear he does not believe the Senate panel can finish its work without public testimony from key players like Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and lawyer Michael Cohen. Over on the House side, meanwhile, Republican leaders may allow a vote as soon as Monday on whether to publicly release the controversial Nunes memo \u2013 despite fervent objections from Trump\u2019s own Justice Department that doing so could harm national security.\n\nNone of which has all that much to do with the basic, jaw-dropping question that started the investigation off in the first place: just how and why Russia succeeded in intervening in an American presidential election on behalf of one of the candidates. With the 2018 midterm elections set to begin little more than a month from now, Warner says that\u2019s still the big story, even if it\u2019s in danger of being lost in a drumbeat of partisan name-calling.\n\n\u201cIf you add up all of the money Russia spent interfering in our election; if you add on what they spent in the French elections, where Facebook took down 50,000 sites that were connected to Russia because they\u2019d seen the Russian intervention, if you add up what they spent on the Dutch elections, where the Dutch hand-counted all of their ballots because they were so afraid of Russian intervention,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou add all that up and you\u2019re still talking about less money than the cost of one new F-35 airplane.\u201d\n\nRussia, Warner says, is not the only U.S. adversary in the world that can figure out a smart investment in America when it sees one.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Nolan D.

That doesn\u2019t seem to make too much sense.\u201d\n\nSome CBC members also suggested that if the committee gives a formal green light to the practice, the House should provide lawmakers a per diem to help with living expenses, as many state legislatures do across the country, or a cost-of-living salary increase.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cWe think what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander,\u201d Watson Coleman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving members an opportunity to live here rent-free using all the facilities, then perhaps those who are forced to live outside of the campus should have some consideration as well.\u201d\n\nOne CBC member who declined to be named also criticized Republicans for advocating cuts to safety net programs while living rent-free in a government building.\n\n\u201cI think public housing should be for people who need it, not for members of Congress,\u201d the member said, adding that some of the lawmakers who sleep in the Capitol are  the CBC members are growing impatient with the Ethics Committee\u2019s pace in addressing their inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think that two months is more than enough time for the committee to do its work,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNormally, when members inquire of the committee, there\u2019s always a prompt response.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

WITCH HUNT!\u201d A day later: \u201cWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d\n\nRepublicans took to the Sunday shows apparently concerned about where that tweetstorm could be headed. \u201cI mean, talking to my colleagues all along it was, you know, once he goes after Mueller, then we'll take action,\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said Trump firing Mueller would \u201cbe the beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d\n\nBut would he really do it? And what political consequences would he face if he did? We rounded up a handful of political experts to answer that question, and they\u2019re just as confused as we are. Republicans and Democrats, Trump friend and Trump foe alike all agree, more or less, that firing Mueller should be a red line\u2014but they\u2019re not so sure it would be. Here\u2019s what they told us:\n\n\n\n\u2018Republicans will make some initial noise, but ultimately, do nothing.\u2019\n\n Ana Navarro is a Republican strategist and commentator.\n\nRepublicans have become the boys that cried wolf. Time and time again they have remained in complicit silence as Trump attacks American institutions, cyber-bullies the special counsel and law enforcement and one-by-one has fired the people standing in between him and Mueller.\n\nThe warnings on Sunday against such a move, from congressional Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Jeff Flake, ring hollow because the same congressional Republicans haven\u2019t acted on legislation that might actually protect the American people from obstruction of justice by their own president. These lawmakers would be a lot better off protecting the country and themselves from such an action by passing the Graham-Booker legislation, which would check the executive branch\u2019s ability to remove a special counsel and give an added layer of protection to a possible politically motivated, self-interested firing of Mueller.\n\nBut Congress hasn\u2019t acted on it. Even the bill\u2019s co-author, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, said in January that while he would \u201cbe glad to pass it right now,\u201d he also didn\u2019t think it was necessary. This inaction tells us all we need to know about what the GOP will do if Trump fires Mueller\u2014make some initial noise, but ultimately, do nothing.\n\n\u2018A House more willing to impeach, but a Senate less willing to convict.\u2019\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to believe Republicans would abandon Trump if Mueller was fired. Trump and his allies have been disparaging the investigation as a political witch hunt from the start, which has successfully sullied Mueller\u2019s reputation among Republican base voters. In both the POLITICO/Morning Consult and the USA Today/Suffolk University poll, a strong plurality of Republicans distrust and disapprove of Mueller. These base voters won\u2019t flinch if Trump whacks Mueller, but they would punish any Republican officeholder open to impeachment and conviction.\n\nFiring Mueller would also supercharge the Democratic base; Democratic voters would not only be fired up for the election, they would be fired up for impeachment. But that\u2019s not all bad news for Trump: Several Democratic congresspeople up for re-election represent states and districts Trump won, including 10 senators and nine House members (including newly elected Conor Lamb). They and some other Democrats don\u2019t want the midterms to be a referendum on impeachment; they want to emphasize pocketbook issues. But impeachment talk could crowd everything else out. Perhaps that wouldn\u2019t stop a \u201cBlue Wave\u201d giving Democrats the House, but it could hamper the already uphill battle for Democrats to claim the Senate.\n\nThe net result could be a House more willing to impeach, but a Senate less willing to convict.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t seen Republicans in Congress, as a whole, standing up to the president.\u2019\n\n Katie Packer Beeson is a commentator and the founder of Burning Glass Consulting. She has managed several campaigns, from state legislative to presidential, and was the deputy campaign manager for the Mitt Romney campaign in 2012.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, I think most reasonable people would consider it to be obstruction of justice. And I hope that Republican leaders and members of Congress would see that as a red line and get serious about their own investigation.\n\nThat said, I haven\u2019t seen Republicans in Congress, as a whole, standing up to the president and his bullying, self-interested behavior in a way that gives him any pause. So I would be pleasantly surprised to see that happen.\n\nIf Congress abdicates its role in our system of checks and balances and acts only with partisan interest, then we may as well kiss our Constitution goodbye. I hope we\u2019re not there yet, but if Trump does fire Mueller, the political aftermath might tell us if we are.\n\n\u2018Another FBI firing would make an obstruction of justice case more clear-cut than it was in Watergate.\u2019\n\nDouglas Schoen is a political analyst and former adviser to President Bill Clinton.\n\nFiring Mueller would almost certainly lead to the impeachment of President Trump and a trial in the Senate where the chance of removal from office would be very real, because another FBI firing would make an obstruction of justice case more clear-cut than it was in Watergate.\n\nThe firing of Mueller would cross a red line for legislators of both parties, and I believe the consequences would be even direr than they were for former president Nixon when he fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in October 1973, which prompted the resignations of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. A week after those resignations, a plurality of Americans favored impeachment, and soon afterward, a number of impeachment resolutions were introduced in Congress.\n\nIt would mean a 1974-style blow in the 2018 midterm elections for the Republicans, and it would severely weaken President Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, should he somehow stay in office until then.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure there are plenty of historians around the president who will remind him of the consequences.\u2019\n\nFrank Luntz is a Republican pollster.\n\n \n\nWe saw what firing the special prosecutor and the attorney general did to Richard Nixon. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of historians around the president who will remind him of the consequences.\n\n\u2018The tidal wave of leaks from the FBI and intelligence community would be astounding.\u2019\n\nRick Wilson is a GOP operative.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, Trump fires Mueller, triggers the constitutional crisis that stains his presidential legacy forever and brings down the Republican majority.\n\nHere\u2019s what would happen immediately: nothing. The GOP would go into \u201cFurrowed Brows and Deep Concern\u201d mode, and pretend it didn\u2019t happen. Republicans fear Trump\u2019s tweets, Fox News and his base more than they revere the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution. I\u2019ve said this before, and the joke is less of a joke and more of a caution at this point, but Trump could kill and eat a live baby on the South Lawn of the White House and the GOP caucus would shrug and say, \u201cWell, he\u2019s new at this. He\u2019s not a traditional politician.\u201d\n\nI think it would almost certainly make the 2018 election a referendum the GOP\u2019s support of Trump. We\u2019d see a replay of the \u201cscandal turnover\u201d elections where one party was marked by political corruption and blown out of office.\n\nIn 1973, Republicans were screaming about fake news and witch hunts. In 1974, many of those same people were looking for jobs: The Republicans lost 48 House and 8 Senate seats that year, and Democrats made large gains in state legislatures. Twenty years later, in 1994, Democrats lost in a landslide in midterm races dominated by the issue of corruption. The GOP took that ride in 2006 in the wake of the Mark Foley congressional page scandal and the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.\n\nWhat happens after the firing? Mueller is smart, and I presume he has a lot of the process set to continue on autopilot in the event that he gets taken off of it himself unexpectedly. Most of the FBI\u2019s work will continue regardless of whom the president fires.\n\nOh, and one thing Trump might not be anticipating as he considers the possibility of firing Mueller: The tidal wave of leaks from the FBI and intelligence community would be astounding.\n\n\u2018It will be a lot like 1974\u2014even without a presidential resignation.\u2019\n\nMichael Kazin is the editor of Dissent.\n\nSince taking office, Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on anyone who alleges that the Russians may have helped him win the presidency\u2014or even that they tried\u2014have failed to dent his popularity among the large majority of Americans who voted for him. And hardly any Republican politicians (and no Fox hosts) have broken with him over his charges.\n\nWhy would this change if he fired Mueller? Unless the special counsel presents unimpeachable evidence of collusion, which seems doubtful, his firing may actually fire up Trump\u2019s core voters more than it alienates them. Most already think he is being hounded unfairly and like it when he fights back.\n\nOn the other hand, the controversy over the firing (depending when it occurs) will likely dominate politics until the midterm elections and make it impossible to pass any legislation of significance in the Senate if not the House. And because of it, Republicans will lose the House and quite a few governorships in the fall. It will be a lot like 1974\u2014even without a presidential resignation.\n\n\u2018All of this would only hurt GOP chances in the midterms.\u2019\n\nScottie Nell Hughes is a political strategist and former surrogate for the Trump campaign.\n\nIf President Trump fired Mueller, vindication from the charges of Russian collusion in the court of public opinion would be almost inconceivable regardless of the truth. His opponents would cry obstruction, corruption and cover-up while doing everything they could to paint those aligned with President Trump as accomplices. Headlines, which could otherwise reflect the positive results of the Trump agenda, would be replaced with a sensationalized focus on the Russia investigation.\n\nAll of this would only hurt GOP chances in the midterms. Those who did survive would be too bruised or bitter to come to President Trump\u2019s defense after 2018.\n\nPresident Trump would do himself, the GOP and the country more of a favor by keeping Mueller but setting a reasonable time limit for the investigation to be completed.\n\n\u2018We are already in a constitutional crisis.\u2019\n\nSophia Nelson is author of E Pluribus One: Reclaiming Our Founders\u2019 Vision for a United America.\n\nWe are already in a constitutional crisis. The red line was crossed long ago.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, Congress will have no choice but to act and start impeachment proceedings. The president of the United States does not have unlimited power. We have a system of checks and balances that have worked for over 240 years. I hope that the Republican majority understands that it and it alone is the only thing that stands between \u201cwe the people\u201d and tyranny.\n\n\u2018Firing Mueller should come with serious consequences.\u2019\n\nDonna Brazile is the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAll these attacks on Special Counsel Mueller are leading to something.

The president\u2019s attacks have once again stirred speculation that he might try to fire Mueller and end his investigation, which Trump has long labeled a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n \u201cIf the president reaches out and stops this investigation, that is a constitutional crisis in this country.

In an email to The Daily Beast, Dowd praised Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s decision to fire Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and said: \u201cI pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nRosenstein, who appointed Mueller and oversees his investigation because Sessions has recused himself from investigations related to the 2016 campaign, said last week that he does not believe \u201cthere is any justification at this point for terminating the special counsel.\u201d \n\nStill, Durbin, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sunday that Congress should take steps to protect Mueller.\n\n\u201cYou think about the obvious, there are two bills before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been absent without leave on this issue, two bills before the committee, bipartisan bills to protect the special counsel.

While their efforts may have succeeded in narrowing the tariffs' impact, Trump is pressing ahead \u2014 leaving Republicans pondering how to check the leader of their own party.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   Senate Republicans discussed the matter in depth on Thursday, just hours before Trump announced he would go through with his crackdown on imported metals. And they are gearing up for an open clash with Trump over economic policy, with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) telling reporters that he will introduce legislation to nullify the tariffs.\n \n \u201cIf it\u2019s anything approximating what he\u2019s talking about, introduce legislation to nullify it. I\u2019m assuming I\u2019m not going to be the only one doing that,\u201d Flake told reporters before the plan was formally issued. \u201cNobody knows what it is, so we can\u2019t do anything until we know what it is.\u201d\n \n On Thursday, Trump announced the United States would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports, with provisional exceptions for Canada and Mexico.\n \n Asked if he could support what Flake is talking about, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) replied: \u201cI could, yeah.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

I\u2019d look at it for sure,\u201d Corker said.\n \n Whether Republican leaders attempt to muster a veto-proof level of support for legislation limiting Trump's tariff remains an open question. That would require at least 16 Senate Democrats supporting a GOP override of Trump \u2014 a potentially difficult number to come up with given that Democrats are less enthused with free-trade policies than Republicans.\n \n Republicans have another chance at reining in the president on trade later this spring, when Trump faces a key deadline to seek renewal of fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals. But GOP leaders are not bullish about winning a legislative fight with Trump and have instead sought to get him to narrow his trade policies.\n \n Winning a veto-override fight would be \u201ca double bank shot,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican. Others think the battle is best won in the court of public opinion. \n \n Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) made a rare appearance in front of the Hill press corps to scorch Trump\u2019s trade policy.\n \n \u201cThis is a really stupid policy. It\u2019s going to hurt American consumers and it\u2019s going to hurt American workers. If the administration goes through with this policy, this policy will kill American jobs, lots of them,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cI\u2019ve wrestled with the president with this on this very topic.\u201d\n \n Indeed, the appetite appeared to be growing among GOP senators to try to claw back some power over trade policy from Trump, who has crowed that \"trade wars are good, and easy to win.\"\n \n Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told reporters that \"maybe we\u2019ve delegated too much authority to the presidency. I\u2019m not just saying to Trump.\"\n \n The power to slap national security-related tariffs \"could be abused by other presidents, past and future, and maybe we\u2019d better take a look at the trade laws,\" added Grassley, who joined the rest of his state's bipartisan congressional delegation in a Wednesday warning that the tariffs could prompt retaliation against U.S. agricultural interests.\n \n The Iowan described legislation from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would require congressional review of tariffs as a \"stopgap measure,\" saying that \"I think we had better be very careful how much power we delegate on trade issues to the president in the future.\"\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who also has urged Trump to consider the tariffs' effect on farmers, reiterated Thursday that \"I don\u2019t think our trade policy ought to be used as a playing card.\" Roberts added that \"on this issue, [Trump is] paying attention to Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro\" \u2014 the Commerce Department chief and trade adviser who have nudged Trump toward a more hardball trade agenda.\n \n No matter how Republicans respond next, their decision-making appeared slowed by the lack of specificity coming from the White House on which nations might be exempted from the tariffs. Lawmakers were also considering other strategies to try to narrow the penalties.\n \n Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was unsure about a legislative response, telling reporters that \"I\u2019m hoping that the president will rethink the breadth of\" the tariffs plan.\n \n \"I\u2019m going to look at it first, as to what his final decision and his recommendation is, and then we\u2019ll listen to what the alternatives are,\u201d she said.\n \n Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a former U.S. Trade Representative who earlier Thursday urged Trump to hone the tariffs' impact on electrical steel, told reporters that \"it sounds like\" the president is embracing some changes.\n\n \"You never know what he\u2019s going to actually say in terms of the final announcement, so we need to be careful here. But I think it looks like it\u2019s going to be more focused, more targeted,\" Portman told reporters. \"And that\u2019s a good thing.\"\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

It was documented in an email then-national security adviser Susan Rice sent to herself on Jan. 20, the day of Trump's inauguration. Story Continued Below\n\n Portions of the email were released Monday by Sens.

In the portion of the email the Republicans released, Rice recounted Obama making explicitly clear that he was not attempting to influence an ongoing federal probe into Russian election disruption.\n\"The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book,\" Rice wrote.\n\"From a national security perspective, however, President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming [Trump] team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.\"\nIt is unclear what the officials might have said in response.

Story Continued Below\n\n It also amounted to a suggestion that witnesses \u2014 potentially including Donald Trump Jr., who sat for an interview in September \u2014 may have made false statements to the committee. In a recent interview, Blumenthal predicted the Trump Jr. transcript would be \u201cexplosive\u201d if released. \nThe Democrats recalled the early-January decision of Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to refer Christopher Steele, the author of the controversial intelligence dossier on Trump's alleged Russia ties, to the FBI for criminal investigation into possible false statements.  \n\"You have stated publicly that you believe it is important for the Special Counsel to carry his investigation through to completion and determine the facts,\" the Democratic duo wrote to Grassley. \"It is hard to see how withholding the transcripts achieves that goal.\"\n\"The transcripts of congressional testimony may reveal other, and better-founded, concerns about witness false statements,\" they wrote. \nThe Democrats also said they believe panel members in both parties already have \"agreed in principle\" on sharing testimony with Mueller's team to aid its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 including potential collusion with President Donald Trump's campaign. \nThe Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, angered Grassley earlier this month when she unilaterally released the transcript of the panel's interview with Glenn Simpson, co-founder of the firm that commissioned the Trump-Russia dossier Steele compiled. \nBeyond their request that Mueller receive Judiciary Committee transcripts, both Whitehouse and Blumenthal have said in recent interviews that they would like to see the transcript of the panel's interview with the president's eldest son get publicly released.  \nTrump Jr. took a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin, also attended by Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The Russian lawyer had offered the Trump campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, though Trump Jr. and others have said she provided no useful information. \n\"I think all these transcripts should be released \u2014 it's just a question of how and when,\" Blumenthal said in a recent interview. \"And the Donald Trump Jr. interview transcript will be explosive when it sees the light of day.\"\nWhitehouse agreed in a recent interview, saying that senators \"also need to rethink, if there isn\u2019t going to be a public hearing, why would we not release that transcript?

Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a Foreign Relations Committee member, told POLITICO that he has \u201csome major concerns\u201d about the bid.\n\n\u201cThe intel position is so different than being the chief diplomat,\u201d Kaine said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd his track record as a House member was not pro-diplomacy, his track record was anti-diplomacy \u2014 and, I think, preferring war first. \u2026 That could exacerbate some major concerns I have about the president\u2019s attitude.\u201d\n\nWith Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) absent and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) opposed to Haspel and Pompeo, the Trump White House is likely to need Democratic votes to win confirmation. That means a handful of senators are in line for a maximum pressure campaign from the left.\n\nThe intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, was among 15 members of the minority to support Pompeo\u2019s CIA nomination last year. He\u2019s declining to tip his hand on Haspel, however, telling reporters late last week that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a lot of legitimate questions that need to be answered, and I hope that she will be as forthcoming as possible while protecting sources and methods.\u201d\n\nLiberal and civil rights groups would like to see Warner join Feinstein and other Democrats in asking for the declassification of CIA records on Haspel\u2019s role in the George W. Bush administration\u2019s use of brutal interrogation tactics, including waterboarding.\n\nWarner said that \u201cwithin the bounds of protecting sources and methods, yes, I want to see as much declassified as possible\u201d about Haspel\u2019s past activity. But that may not be enough for advocates who warn that the agency is unlikely to act without a more direct edict from the Senate.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cI don\u2019t think CIA will agree to it if the committee doesn\u2019t force the issue, and I don\u2019t think the committee will force the issue unless Warner is willing to tell Burr that it needs to happen,\u201d Project on Government Oversight investigator Katherine Hawkins said in an interview. \n\nPOGO joined more than two dozen liberal and civil liberties groups in a Friday plea for the Senate to declassify Haspel material. Amnesty International went further on Monday, urging Trump to withdraw her nomination outright and launch an investigation into her past.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who began pressing for the declassification of Haspel records last year alongside Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), said that \u201cother members will have the opportunity to see the intelligence. She\u2019s going to get some tough questions at this hearing.\u201d\n\nFeinstein raised alarms on the left last week by telling reporters that Haspel had been \u201ca good deputy director,\u201d citing a personal dinner with the three-decade agency veteran. But within days, after taking a hit from her primary challenger Kevin de Leon, Feinstein was aligning with Wyden and Heinrich in pushing for declassification.\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Marc Short didn\u2019t rule out giving lawmakers access to some material, telling CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m sure that we\u2019re going to want to provide as much information as necessary, without compromising any international secrets.\u201d\n\nTwo more Democrats getting watched by advocacy groups are Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who opposed Pompeo for CIA but appeared open to Haspel last week, and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who last year shifted from \u2018yes\u2019 to \u2018no\u2019 on a Trump nominee involved in the Bush-era legal memos that cleared the use of the interrogation tactics.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nManchin, an intelligence committee member, changed his stance on Steven Bradbury\u2019s nomination to be Department of Transportation general counsel after getting a personal appeal from McCain. Given that Manchin opposed Bradbury for a DOT role that\u2019s not connected to national security, activists are hopeful that the red-state Democrat and frequent Trump ally will also nix Haspel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rational argument for opposing Bradbury\u2019s nomination and not opposing Haspel\u2019s,\u201d Scott Roehm, Washington office director for the nonprofit Center for Victims of Torture, said in an interview.\n\nManchin has declined to indicate how he\u2019ll vote on Haspel or Pompeo ahead of meetings with the nominees. Pompeo is expected to meet on Monday with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who is eyeing a confirmation hearing next month.\n\nAnother Senate Democrat the left is closely watching on the nominations: Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who told POLITICO in a Friday statement that \"neither confirmation is a sure thing.\"\n\nSchumer told reporters on the day Pompeo and Haspel were tapped, however, that he's not yet urging his caucus to come out in opposition. And if he doesn\u2019t whip against the nominees, the grassroots activists the party is counting on to come out in November are likely going to be disappointed.\n\n\"The short answer is no \u2014 there is no reason for any Democrats to vote to confirm either Pompeo or Haspel,\" said Elizabeth Beavers, policy manager for the liberal group Indivisible.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Friday delivered a subtle but stinging rebuke to House Republicans over their move to release a classified memo alleging misconduct at the FBI, urging President Donald Trump and other Republicans to stop \"manufacturing partisan sideshows\" that benefit Russia.\nThe statement from McCain, who is away from Washington undergoing treatment for brain cancer, came minutes after Trump signed off on the release of the memo crafted by Republicans on the House intelligence committee. McCain directly connected his fellow Republicans' campaign to undercut the FBI with Russian President Vladimir Putin's meddling in the 2016 election.Story Continued Below\n\n \"The latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests \u2014 no party's, no president's, only Putin's,\" McCain said. The Arizonan, a longtime Russia hawk who helped shape a bipartisan package of sanctions against Moscow last year, added that \"Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller's investigation must proceed unimpeded.\"\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThe memo at issue charges the FBI with mishandling the surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser by using an unverified dossier bankrolled by Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Democrats have warned that Trump is poised to use the memo to strike back at Mueller's probe of his ties to Russia.\n\"Our nation\u2019s elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows,\" McCain wrote in his statement. \"If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin\u2019s job for him.\u201d\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

And now Schumer wanted to hear what was on the mind of one of his most prominent senators, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n   \u201cThis is what I said I was going to do,\u201d Warren told the Senate minority leader in a lengthy conversation last Wednesday, the person said. \u201cThis is why I ran for the Senate.\u201d\n \n Schumer didn\u2019t tell Warren to stop attacking the bill or to dig in. But he urged her to focus her opposition on the bill\u2019s policies \u2014 not individual Democratic senators, as her fundraising plea had done, said a second person briefed on the conversation. Still, Warren largely stuck to her hard-edged tactics in the days afterward, regularly lashing what she calls the \u201cBank Lobbyist Act\u201d and those who support it.\n \n For Schumer, the banking bill and its rollback of some of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law\u2019s regulations has been quite the tightrope to walk. The minority leader has to balance the needs of moderate caucus members who are desperate for a bipartisan accomplishment heading into brutal reelection races, and the priorities of liberals like Warren who believe they are fighting for the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. Plus, the New Yorker is already viewed with suspicion by liberals for his own ties to Wall Street.\n \n Though Schumer opposes the banking bill, the typically chatty senator has been remarkably quiet about it. He\u2019s said very little publicly about the legislation since it was introduced four months ago, and privately has not whipped against it or tried to stop it, according to senators and aides. Instead, as he did with Warren last week, Schumer has been mostly listening and counseling his members behind the scenes.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

This is really the first time since he\u2019s been Democratic leader that there\u2019s been a significant split in the caucus. And it\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s awkward.\u201d\n \n POLITICO first inquired about Schumer\u2019s position on the legislation in November, as the bill was changing and winding through committee. Finally, in March he came out in opposition to the bill as it came to the floor. People who speak frequently with Schumer argue that he\u2019s always been in a no-win situation and that trying to derail it now would serve only to trample on what might be his moderate members\u2019 signature bipartisan law in an election year.\n \n The minority leader has essentially been playing to both sides of the banking debate, caught between competing factions of his caucus and seemingly unable to head off the warring Democrats, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic senators of all ideological stripes.\n \n Asked about the issue Tuesday, he avoided attacking the bill or its critics, focusing instead on procedure and ignoring the lingering tension within his ranks.\n \n \u201cThere\u2019s broad agreement in our caucus that community banks deserve some [regulatory] relief,\u201d Schumer told reporters.\n \n \u201cBut Republicans forced other amendments not related to community banks,\u201d he added, saying that he opposed ending debate on the bill \u201cbecause I want to see amendments.\u201d\n \n Warren is also pushing for votes on 17 separate amendments she has offered intended to crack down on big banks and protect consumers. But GOP leaders are eager to move on to a final vote this week after spending nearly two weeks of floor time on the measure. The far-reaching bill would relax rules for a range of small and large lenders. It's the biggest change to financial regulations since Democrats enacted Dodd-Frank in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street meltdown.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n Meanwhile, the brutal fight over the legislation continued in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic caucus meeting, according to senators. Democrats readily admit this has been perhaps the toughest internal battle of Schumer\u2019s 15-month tenure as leader, worse even than when Democrats stumbled into a three-day government shutdown over immigration, though they say the party will get over it.\n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not for Chuck to cause us not to disagree, it\u2019s for Chuck to make sure we keep our disagreements within certain boundaries,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who opposes the bill. \u201cThis will pass, which is not to say tempers didn\u2019t flare.\u201d\n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot worse, and we\u2019ll get through this,\u201d Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) said of the caucus\u2019 charged climate surrounding the banking bill. Carper supports it. \n \n Schumer was warned by liberals, particularly Warren, early on that they would forcefully make the case against legislation they argue would risk another financial crisis, according to Democratic sources. And on a conference call on Tuesday, Warren defended Schumer as a stalwart foe of the measure.\n \n \u201cHe has spoken against the bill in caucus meetings and he voted against moving the bill forward,\u201d Warren said. \"He has pushed against this bill from the very beginning.\"\n \n The idea of helping out community banks that argue post-financial crisis regulations imperiled their ability to make loans has long been popular in both parties. But though Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and ranking member Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) began talking about a bipartisan solution last year, the talks broke down. \n \n After that impasse, Schumer gave the banking bill\u2019s Democratic backers the green light to continue working with the GOP, according to moderate senators. He never told them to stop working on the bill. His message to the caucus was: \u201cEverybody do what they got to do,\u201d according to moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).\n \n \u201cSen. Schumer said, 'Look, if you guys can get it out of committee, you guys can get great bipartisan support, we\u2019ll facilitate a floor vote,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.).\n \n Privately, some Democrats argue that at the very least, Schumer should have tried to shut down the battles between Warren and moderates like Heitkamp and Manchin who face tough reelection races this year. Those critics say that Warren has made misleading arguments against the bill and that Schumer could have stopped it.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n But publicly, none of the 16 Democrats who voted to advance the bill last week have had a harsh word for their leader's handling of it. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) suggested that Schumer had staved off long-term damage, saying Schumer \"worked very hard to find a path forward here that allows the caucus a chance at being unified as we face other legislative challenges.\"\n \n Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who opposes it, agreed: \u201cI\u2019m against the bill, but when there are different voices, I think the leadership has allowed all voices to be heard.\"\n \n Meanwhile, some liberals off the Hill questioned the political wisdom of Schumer freeing up so many Democratic votes to loosen bank regulations. As the party pitches itself to voters with a promise to fight for their interests, liberal activists say the banking bill sends the wrong, pro-corporate message and argue Warren's argument is in line with the Democratic base.\n \n But given that the bill had 10 Democratic Caucus co-sponsors as of November, Schumer would have struggled to block the bill even if he tried, senators said.\n\n \u201cThe power of Wall Street and the way that Wall Street convinced community bankers that they should have a bill that included breaks for Wall Street made it very hard to defeat,\u201d Brown said. He added it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say Schumer didn\u2019t try to stop the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

To us, they are linked.\u201d  \n The division among Democrats is complicating negotiations, as lawmakers in both parties face intense pressure \u2014 and a two-week time crunch \u2014 to show progress on government funding, immigration and a raft of other outstanding issues that have resulted in the government operating on stopgap spending bills since September. \n Both parties are eager for a long-term budget agreement, with GOP defense hawks furious about uncertainty for the Pentagon and liberal Democrats concerned about deep cuts to domestic programs. But any legislation to boost spending by upwards of $250 billion over two years would likely need broad bipartisan backing in both chambers, as House conservatives have already hinted they\u2019ll balk. \n Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), another member of Democratic leadership, said that while she preferred a deal to protect young undocumented immigrants be part of budget negotiations, the agreement reached with McConnell could make that impossible. The Kentucky Republican has said the Senate would turn to an immigration bill only if the government is still funded, and few Democrats seem to want another shutdown. \n \u201cFeb. 8 we\u2019re going to have another [stopgap bill]. But we have to have that budget agreement in order to move forward. \u2026 That\u2019s the goal,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd then the deal is that if DACA is not part of that, then it will be the next thing considered.\u201d \n \u201cEveryone\u2019s first preference is to get it all done by the 8th,\u201d a Senate Democratic aide said on Wednesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t speculated on what happens if it doesn\u2019t all come together.\u201d \n If Democrats are indeed willing to deal on spending caps without a firm commitment on DACA, it would represent a significant shift in the budget talks, which have stalled for months over immigration. \n \u201cI think everybody has a pretty general idea about where it\u2019s going to end up. But this has been again another casualty of the DACA issue, that they\u2019ve refused to conclude those,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Wednesday when asked how close leaders are to a spending caps deal. \n \u201cThere\u2019s gonna have to be some agreement on the spending caps I believe [by Feb. 8] because I am skeptical whether the House in particular will vote for another continuing resolution. That\u2019s the dilemma created by our Democratic colleagues,\u201d Cornyn added.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n Without a solution for Dreamers, Democrats have largely refused to acknowledge that they are making progress on a spending deal. But sources familiar with the talks say the distance between Republicans and Democrats has been narrowing for weeks. \n Negotiators have already agreed to a massive boost to the Pentagon\u2019s budget. While the figures are still in flux, multiple sources say Congress would raise military spending by at least $70 billion above the caps for fiscal 2018 and $80 billion in fiscal 2019. \n That huge increase, far above the White House\u2019s most recent budget request, would deliver assurance to the GOP\u2019s long-suffering defense hawks who have grudgingly voted for four short-term funding bills this fiscal year alone. \n What remains is how much to spend on domestic programs, including everything from homeland security to the Department of Education. \n GOP leaders have pitched a deal that would boost domestic agencies\u2019 budgets by between $45 to $50 billion over the caps for the next two years, sources say. Democrats, however, are insisting on at least $60 billion. \n Under the current spending caps, military funding would be limited to $549 billion in fiscal 2018. Domestic funding would be capped at $516 billion. \n As Democrats have insisted on \u201cparity\u201d between the defense and non-defense spending boosts, GOP negotiators are eyeing creative budgetary maneuvers to get there. \n Republican leaders are proposing tens of billions of dollars in extra domestic spending that wouldn\u2019t count towards the caps, sources say. That would likely include billions in emergency funding to address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic, which both parties have called a priority. \n Rep. Tom Cole, an ally of House GOP leadership, said in a phone interview Wednesday that opioid funding would be included \u201cfor sure\u201d \u2014 likely in a way that wouldn\u2019t count toward the caps. \n Negotiators are also floating potential changes in mandatory spending \u2014 another budgetary gimmick \u2014 to further dodge the strict caps on discretionary spending. That could mean programs with bipartisan support like VA Choice, the private-sector health care program for veterans, would be moved to the mandatory side of the budget for good.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n \u201cThey\u2019re so close on these numbers,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a former top Senate staffer now with the Bipartisan Policy Center. \n Publicly though, House and Senate spending talks have been stalled since Thanksgiving, when Senate and House Democrats declared they wouldn\u2019t agree on spending until Dreamers were helped. \n \u201cIn some way, the most important budget negotiations are the negotiations on DACA,\u201d added Cole, a senior appropriator who writes the House\u2019s health, education and labor spending bill. \n \u201cThe phrase used to me [is], \u2018We\u2019re six inches away from a spending deal.\u2019 It\u2019s just simply the DACA issue and the immigration question.\u201d\nSeung Min Kim and Connor O'Brien contributed to this report.\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Rush Limbaugh went on Fox News, right after an interview with several Parkland survivors critical of the gun lobby, to scold those who \u201cbash the NRA\u201d and insist the only solution to school shootings is \u201cconcealed carry in the schools.\u201d The NRA\u2019s 24-7 streaming network NRATV echoed the sentiment with the familiar refrain, \u201cwe need more good guys with guns.\u201d Hosts complained that the school only had one armed guard, while advertising the NRA\u2019s \u201cSchool Shield\u201d security initiative to freshly terrified school administrations.\n\nWhy does the NRA always win, despite the repeated national traumas, and despite poll after poll showing a majority in favor of stronger gun control measures? It\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s because the NRA has built a movement that has convinced its followers that gun ownership is a way of life, central to one\u2019s freedom and safety, that must be defended on a daily basis.\n\nThe gun control majority only gets worked up in the days after public mass shootings, even though such events only accounted for 71 of the 38,658 annual gun fatalities in 2016. Then the news coverage shifts, political prospects for action diminish, and the majority gravitates to other political matters while guns continue take lives in suicides, domestic violence incidents, other crimes and accidents every day.\n\nSince the progressive political prism views campaign cash as the scourge of democracy, gun control proponents are quick to blame NRA donations for why Congress seems immune to public opinion. In a powerful speech last week in Florida, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior Emma Gonazlez excoriated \u201cpoliticians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this\u201d and added, \u201cTo every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s a mistake to attribute the NRA\u2019s success entirely to its campaign spending. The dollar amount was considerable in 2016: $54.4 million. But that money was not spent on the entire Congress. Thirty million went to Donald Trump, the rest mainly to six Republican Senate candidates in competitive races, five of whom won. For most members of Congress, the amount of money they get from the NRA is a tiny percentage of their overall hauls. If money were the only reason for their gun rights stances, Michael Bloomberg could offer to double whatever the NRA gives them and flip their votes.\n\nTo beat the NRA at its own game, the gun control movement needs to better understand how the NRA has built an army of single-issue voters.\n\nNRATV is a new piece of the puzzle, having been launched only in late 2016. But it\u2019s a window into the culture that the NRA has nurtured for decades. Every minute, the network pumps out a message that can be delivered regardless of external events: Liberal elites want to take away your guns and freedom. Terrorists and criminals lurk everywhere and you need to know how to defend yourself. And by the way, look how cool guns are and how powerful they make you feel!\n\nSome shows are standard conservative political talk show fare, with hosts who wear T-shirts emblazoned with \u201cSocialist Tears\u201d and mock mainstream media figures for alleged bias (the network is particularly obsessed with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon).\n\nOther shows are more like reality TV, such as \u201cLove at First Shot,\u201d which follows women novices as they get firearms training for \u201chunting, personal protection and competition\u201d and learn the \u201clifestyle and cultural elements of being a gun owner.\u201d The show \u201cNoir\u201d recently offered a slow-motion tutorial on how to be that \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d if you\u2019re in a movie theater when a mass shooter enters. \u201cThey don\u2019t always talk about gun issues,\u201d gun policy expert Dr. Robert Spitzer said of the network to Time magazine, \u201cIt\u2019s about beliefs and how people view the world.\u201d\n\nWho knows how many watch NRATV\u2014the point is that it\u2019s a distilled version of the message the gun lobby has been pushing into the culture for decades. That worldview keeps the NRA on-message when events don\u2019t cooperate. But for frustrated and desperate gun control advocates, mass shootings goad them into chasing marginal proposals that have a real, or perceived, link to the immediate crime.\n\nThe Columbine school shooting prompted activists to prioritize the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d since the killers bought guns at a gun show where a background check wasn\u2019t required. The Charleston church massacre led to calls to close the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d which allows someone to get a gun if a background check isn\u2019t completed after three days. After the Las Vegas massacre, many demanded a ban on \u201cbump stocks\u201d that allow for more rapid firing.\n\nNot only did activists fail to enact these policy ideas, the ideas, however laudable, don\u2019t have much relevance to the vast majority of gun deaths. They can\u2019t help motivate people after memories of the last massacre fade.\n\nGun control proponents don\u2019t necessarily have to emulate the NRA and, say, launch a TV network. But they might consider marshaling the financial resources of Bloomberg, and other multimillionaires, and emulating one of the most successful public service advertising campaigns in history: the anti-tobacco \u201ctruth\u201d campaign.\n\nHundreds of millions have been spent since 2000 by what is now called the \u201cTruth Initiative\u201d on edgy ads that turned teenage perception of what smoking represents from cool rebellion to corporate dishonesty. The ad campaign is not the sole reason, but it is widely credited for helping drive smoking levels among teens down from from 23 percent to 6 percent.\n\nLike the tobacco industry, the NRA has been cultivating an image of guns as a source of freedom and cool, with the extra value of protection from grievous harm. A large-scale counter-campaign could help reverse that image, highlighting the damage guns do every day: the depressed never getting another chance for mental health services, the children dying from home accidents, the domestic abuse victims who never could escape. Other spots could depict life where guns are controlled around the world, to show what is possible. A partnership with Hollywood could bring gun issues into more TV shows and movies, similar to how Hollywood was successfully pressured to stop making cigarettes look cool.\n\nSuch a campaign would have two main objectives: in the short run, keep the gun control majority engaged on a daily basis, and in the long run, reduce the demand for guns in areas where the NRA exerts political influence.\n\nAs heartwarming as it is to see high school students organize anti-gun marches, they are no more likely to be successful in busting the NRA narrative, or separating politicians from NRA money, than the parents of Columbine and Sandy Hook. The gun rights community is steeled against succumbing to sympathetic victims, as they have convinced themselves that they are above the politics of knee-jerk emotion.\n\nSocial conservatives are fond of the insight, \u201cPolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d There is a big gun-rights culture that has a grip on our politics. Until there is a gun-free culture that can rival what the NRA has cultivated over decades, no national trauma, no matter how searing, is going to move the political needle.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Carpenter", "body": "The Trump administration\u2019s stunning decision this week to forgo mandatory sanctions on individuals doing business with Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors and its failure to publicly name and shame corrupt Kremlin insiders only underscores its dereliction of duty and disregard for our national security. With fitting symbolism, the administration chose instead to invite the directors of the three Russian intelligence services\u2014the very agencies responsible for carrying out an attack on our election\u2014for an unprecedented joint visit to Washington. To repeat: This is something that has never happened before in American history.\n\nTrump officials falsely argued that sanctions on Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors were unnecessary because the mere threat of sanctions was sufficient to deter businesses from doing deals. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert claimed, for example, that \u201cforeign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. But aside from the fact that the sanctions, which passed last summer by an overwhelming margin in Congress, were not optional, the evidence suggests Russia\u2019s defense industry is not being deterred from entering new markets. Far from it: Russia is currently in talks with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar\u2014both traditional U.S. arms purchasers\u2014to supply sophisticated S-400 air defense systems, while Russia\u2019s United Aircraft Corporation, a major defense contractor, decided just this month to market new airplanes in Europe and North America. Financial markets also read the administration\u2019s decision to forgo sanctions as a green light, with yields on Russian bonds sinking to the lowest point since the 2014 invasion of Crimea.\n\nRegarding the requirement to compile a \u201cKremlin list\u201d of corrupt officials, the administration decided to take the easy way out, and simply released a list of officials that could easily have been a copy-and-paste job of the Kremlin phone book and the Forbes Top 100 list of Russian oligarchs. No details on corruption were made public, thereby completely defeating the purpose of the report\u2014naming and shaming those enabling bad behavior in Moscow, and thus establishing a basis for future sanctions against them.\n\nDespite having enormous asymmetric power at its disposal, including the power to block all transactions going through the U.S. financial system, this White House has proven completely unwilling to impose meaningful costs on Russia in response to its assault on our institutions. Meanwhile, the Kremlin\u2019s war machine is still operating in full swing in Ukraine and Syria while defense-sector revenues support Russia\u2019s military modernization, including the development of new systems like treaty-banned intermediate-range cruise missiles that could target U.S. forces and allies in Central Europe and East Asia.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nFirst, we have to wake up to the fact that the United States is a financial superpower and that we have the ability to impose costs on Russia in a way that could permanently change the Kremlin\u2019s calculus. In the financial sector, for example, the U.S. market is so vast that any \u201cblocking sanctions\u201d on Russia\u2019s banks would have an immediate impact by forcing them to withdraw from international markets. Strangely, the United States has decided to take such sanctions entirely off the table, even as the Kremlin doubles down on election interference efforts across Europe, including the recent Czech presidential elections and the March 4 Italian parliamentary elections. Currently, full blocking sanctions, which block all transactions by entities that do business through the U.S. financial system, have been imposed on exactly one Russian bank, Bank Rossiya, which does not even rank in the top 10 Russian financial institutions.\n\nThe Trump administration has ignored and subverted the clear will of Congress\u2014and lawmakers therefore have no choice but to respond. They should consider passing an amendment to the Russia sanctions law specifying that unless the administration certifies that Russia has ceased interfering in our democratic institutions, full blocking sanctions will be applied iteratively to a list of select Russian banks according to a fixed schedule\u2014say, every six months. These sanctions would kick in automatically, and the Treasury Department would be able to waive them only if there were evidence of a serious risk of financial contagion.\n\nThe goal of such measures is not to crater Russia\u2019s economy but to show that the United States takes an attack on its democracy seriously and will respond with meaningful measures. (The measures the previous administration applied to Russia in December 2016, such as designating Russian Embassy personnel as persona non grata and confiscating Russian diplomatic facilities, were largely symbolic and had no impact on the Kremlin\u2019s long-term calculus.) Until the costs of its subversive measures outweigh the benefits, the Kremlin will keep trying to sow chaos and widen the political, social and ideological divisions within our country. Since the president and his team are unwilling to defend us from Russia\u2019s efforts to weaken our democracy, Congress must step in.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Blake Hounshell", "body": "When it comes to Russia, there is the Trump administration \u2014 and there is the president.\n\nThe Trump administration denounces Russia for using nerve agent on British soil.

Trump won\u2019t even convene a meeting on the subject.\n\nThe Trump administration reassures NATO countries that America has their back against Russian intimidation. Trump complains incessantly that they need to pay more for their own defense.\n\nAdd it all up, and it amounts to the deepest national security breach between a president and his own advisers in memory \u2014 a bizarre disconnect between an administration scrambling to respond to Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist assault on the West, and a chief executive who openly admires the Kremlin leader and has yet to allay suspicions that his relationship with Russia was not on the level. It\u2019s the greatest mystery in American politics: What, exactly, explains Donald Trump\u2019s love affair with Moscow?\n\n\u201cThere has always been a gap between what the U.S. government \u2014 whether it\u2019s the State Department, Defense Department, intelligence agencies, Treasury Department \u2014has been saying to steadily increase pressure on the Russian government and what the president has said,\u201d said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt is obvious there is pent-up frustration between the agencies to push forward.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, that frustration has begun to translate into an increasingly confrontational posture toward Putin\u2019s Russia. On Friday, the Treasury Department slapped sanctions on several Russians for interfering in the 2016 election. The White House\u2019s January national security strategy slammed Moscow as a threat to global stability and a political meddler that \u201cchallenge[s] American power, influence, and interests.\u201d And a Pentagon national defense strategy released soon after declared that Russia is \u201cundermining the international order.\u201d\n\nOn March 1, the Trump administration even took a step vetoed by President Barack Obama. State Department notified Congress that it intends to sell some $47 million in antitank missiles to Ukraine for use against Russian aggression. When some top Obama national security officials recommended a similar step, Obama rejected the idea.\n\nMeanwhile, the headlines are awash with officials not named Trump slamming Russia on several fronts.\n\nOn Thursday, national security adviser H.R. McMaster tore into Russia, saying it was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Syrian regime \u201catrocities\u201d and warning that \u201call nations must respond more forcefully than simply issuing strong statements.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the United Nations, ambassador Nikki Haley has denounced the Kremlin so many times it has stopped being news, on issues ranging from Syria to Ukraine, over which Haley recently demanded \u201cclear and strong condemnation.\u201d\n\nAs for cyber and political meddling, during Senate testimony last month, Mike Rogers, the departing head of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command, re-affirmed the conclusion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election and warned that Putin would \u201ccontinue this activity\u201d if he doesn\u2019t meet a firmer U.S. response.\n\nAnd after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee declared on Monday that the Kremlin wasn\u2019t trying to help Trump get elected after all \u2014 but rather just seeking to sow chaos \u2014 a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community stands by its October 2016 findings to the contrary.\n\nFinally, there was Rex Tillerson, who took the secretary of state job last year speaking hopefully of better dialogue with Russia \u2014 but closed out his tenure with several shots at Putin\u2019s government, including a Monday statement saying he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the nerve agent attack and a warning, in his farewell remarks, that Moscow\u2019s \u201ctroubling behavior\u201d invited further isolation.\n\nA day after Tillerson\u2019s sacking, his department also released a withering statement about Russia\u2019s \u201csham\u201d annexation of Crimea that declared that Russia \u201cdisdains the international order and disrespects the territorial integrity of sovereign nations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump has had to sign off on his administration\u2019s tough policy actions. But that makes his refusal to criticize Putin all the more curious.\n\nThere have been some recent signs of a hardening, even on Trump\u2019s part. Twice this week in remarks to reporters, Trump echoed the British government\u2019s charges that Russia was behind the poisoning with nerve agent of a Russian double agent in London this month. \u201cIt certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office Thursday.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t linger long on the subject, and didn\u2019t summon anything like the outrage expressed by Tillerson and Haley, who called at the U.N. this week for \u201cimmediate concrete measures\u201d against Moscow and warned that its next attack could come in New York City.\n\nPerhaps the most deafening silence of all involves Trump\u2019s non-response to Putin\u2019s remarkably bellicose February national address in which he announced the development of new nuclear weapons \u2014 including one that \u201cflies to its target like a meteorite like a ball of fire\u201d \u2014 that he claimed can defeat U.S. defenses. An accompanying video Putin played showed one of the weapons slamming into southern Florida, in the approximate area where Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort is located.\n\nConley recalled Trump\u2019s reaction after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened, in a January address, that he could strike the U.S. with nuclear weapons. Trump angrily tweeted in response: \u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his.\u201d\n\nIn this case, a State Department spokeswoman mocked Putin\u2019s video as \u201ccheesy,\u201d Defense Secretary James Mattis called the chest-thumping \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a mild critique of the weapons as \u201cdestabilizing.\u201d\n\nBut more than two weeks after Putin\u2019s threat, Trump has publicly said nothing.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Bill Scher", "body": "The results aren\u2019t yet official, but Conor Lamb\u2019s apparent nail-biter special election win in a Western Pennsylvania congressional district that two years ago favored Donald Trump by 20 points is an unmistakable good sign for Democrats heading into the November midterm elections. Republican Rick Saccone couldn\u2019t be saved by Trump\u2019s tax reform bill or $10 million in outside campaign cash. And there are more than 100 Republican-held House seats in districts less conservative than this one. Many incumbents in those districts will likely choose retirement over getting soaked by a \u201cblue wave.\u201d\n\nNo wonder Republicans are worried.\n\nYet the way Lamb won does little to help Democrats adjudicate the raging debate on the left over how should they run in November: as proud left-wing populists or relative moderates willing to reach across the aisle. The 33-year-old Marine vet, federal prosecutor and Allegheny County political progeny didn\u2019t pick a side. He took some positions from out of each camp\u2019s bucket, all while brandishing his assault rifle.\n\nThe populist wing can point to Lamb\u2019s unapologetic defense of Social Security and Medicare from Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s long-standing goal of cost-saving \u201centitlement reform.\u201d In a district full of working-class people, Lamb pledged to defend \u201cunion rights\u201d while Saccone had a record of support for anti-union \u201cright to work\u201d laws. Trump arguably levied tariffs on steel last week in part to help Saccone with the district\u2019s Pittsburgh-area workers, but Lamb celebrated the new trade barriers, as have other protectionists on the left. He rejected Trump\u2019s tax reform as a giveaway to the rich, and one ad touted Lamb as an antidote to a Congress that \u201ccare[s] more about the corporations and the wealthy than the normal people.\u201d\n\nBut Lamb was hardly a poster child for democratic socialism. He did not campaign on the left\u2019s most cherished policy plank of a single-payer health insurance system. In fact, he followed the advice of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s cautious health care polling memo, which said, \u201cThe American people overwhelmingly want Congress to improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it or replace it with something radically different.\u201d\n\nThat memo, upon being leaked, attracted criticism for suggesting \u201cMedicare for All\u201d was a liability, and not, as progressive populists insist, an idea with the political juice necessary to boost base turnout. Yet Lamb did just fine defending the \u201cprogress\u201d made by the ACA and promising to \u201cfix what isn't working, and make the law better.\u201d\n\nLamb stayed away from another major progressive populist goal, a $15 minimum wage, which he said \u201csounds high based on what I\u2019ve been told by many small-business owners in our area.\u201d He did not endear himself to some environmentalists when he supported natural gas fracking, siding with energy industry workers still reeling from the decline of the coal industry.\n\nSince the Parkland massacre, progressive populists have been pushing Democrats to embrace gun control (though last year, many on the left excused candidates who married economic populism with gun rights such as Montana\u2019s Rob Quist). Lamb began his campaign with a biographical spot showing him with an AR-15 and letting voters know he \u201cstill loves to shoot.\u201d While he backed \u201cuniversal background checks\u201d after Parkland, he also reiterated his opposition to an assault weapons ban.\n\nHe also emphasized bipartisanship, much like Sen. Doug Jones did in Alabama, running ads promising to \u201cend the partisan divide,\u201d venting about a \u201cCongress where no one works together\u201d and even throwing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi under the bus as an example of failed congressional leadership. Progressives often chafe at paeans to bipartisanship, believing Republicans should be painted as corporate-backed impediments to populist goals. Establishment Democrats tend to view such rhetoric as the political castor oil one must take to pick off seats on red turf.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why the DCCC was comfortable looking past Lamb\u2019s dig at Pelosi and quietly funneling $1 million into his campaign that funded field staff and get-out-the-vote efforts, while the committee\u2019s progressive critics\u2014such as Our Revolution, Democracy for America, Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Justice Democrats\u2014left Lamb off their endorsement lists. Lamb got robust support from labor unions, despite some early grumbling over his minimum wage position, and they deserve a healthy share of credit. But so does the oft-maligned DCCC. It might have flopped in last week\u2019s Texas primary, but it recovered ably in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nThe DCCC is inclined to favor candidates it considers to be good fits for their districts; if a district tilts right, the DCCC will be hesitant to spend a lot of campaign cash on a candidate who swerves left. Many progressives have a different view\u2014they insist that proud, authentic populists can win anywhere, especially in working-class districts that sided with Trump.\n\nLamb\u2019s \u201cpopulism lite\u201d approach doesn\u2019t definitively disprove that argument, but after a year of special congressional elections in reddish areas, the progressive populists lack a model case of their own. Their preferred 2017 candidates, Quist in Montana and James Thompson in Kansas, fell short, while the more moderate Jones triumphed in Alabama. While some credited Roy Moore\u2019s scandals more than Jones\u2019 positions for the victory, Lamb\u2019s similar performance augurs otherwise.\n\nLamb\u2019s apparent victory doesn\u2019t prove that every Democrat on the ballot in November should run just like him. Many competitive races will be in districts with markedly different demographic profiles. Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District was heavily white and rural with a low percentage of college graduates. Other districts targeted by Democrats will be less culturally conservative, more racially diverse and more educated. Single-payer may strike a bigger chord in other contests, while support of gun rights and fracking may not, and disparaging Pelosi\u2014which, if it became a trend, could wreak havoc with party unity\u2014may not be necessary.\n\nBut Lamb\u2019s performance does suggest that Democratic candidates can tailor their messages to their home districts, appeal to swing voters and pacify the Republican base, while still generating strong Democratic base turnout. Republicans were able to nationalize some of last year\u2019s elections and fire up Trump supporters, pegging Montana\u2019s Quist and Georgia\u2019s Jon Ossoff as rubber stamps for Washington Democrats. Lamb\u2014perhaps because he came from a political family with deep roots in the area\u2014successfully defined himself on his own terms.\n\nProgressive populists have their midterm election hopes invested in primary candidates like Laura Moser in Texas\u2019 7th and Marie Newman in Illinois\u2019 3rd. In all likelihood, there will be some general election House candidates in their mold, who can fully test their propositions come November. But as the primary season gears up, those preaching electoral pragmatism, policy restraint and a bipartisan veneer have high-profile special election success stories to cite. Progressive populists are still waiting.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John A. Cassara", "body": "These days, a money launderer has to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught.\n\nIn fact, data suggests the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to enforce America\u2019s money-laundering laws fail 99.9 percent of the time. As financial crime expert Raymond Baker notes, \u201cTotal failure is just a decimal point away.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes it all the more surprising that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and his deputy, got busted last week. Special Counsel Robert Muller accused Manafort, with Gates\u2019s help, of laundering approximately $30 million\u2014an effort that, according to the indictment, began years ago but continued through their time on the Trump presidential campaign. The charges do not involve the president or his campaign.\n\nHad Trump lost the election, Manafort and Gates might have gotten away with their alleged crimes. But now they\u2019re caught up in Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and they have the misfortune of being pursued by skilled and motivated prosecutors with deep expertise in financial crimes and almost unlimited resources. Mueller\u2019s team includes Andrew Weissmann, who no less than former White House strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly dubbed \u201cthe LeBron James of money-laundering investigations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think of money laundering as a victimless crime. Who cares if Paul Manafort was able to buy himself some fancy rugs and a nice brownstone in Brooklyn? So what if Rick Gates bought himself a nice house and sent his kids to private schools?\n\nThat view couldn\u2019t be more wrong. I spent 26 years in the U.S. government, much of it fighting the scourge of money laundering. It\u2019s a crime that sustains devastating drug epidemics\u2014opioids, methamphetamines, cocaine. Gang violence, fraud in government programs, corruption, internet scams, identity theft and so many other crimes affect our daily lives. Terrorism\u2014made possible in part by money laundering\u2014threatens our national security.\n\nMany of the ills we face come back to money. And money laundering\u2014the hiding or disguising of the proceeds of any form of criminal activity\u2014is the essential component of transnational crime. Without the ability to move money around, pay their foot soldiers and profit from their illegal activities, criminal networks wither and die. It shouldn\u2019t take a national political scandal to crack down on their misdeeds.\n\n\n\nHow big is the world\u2019s money-laundering crisis? It\u2019s hard to say for sure, because precise data doesn\u2019t exist. The IMF believes money laundering makes up about 2 to 5 percent of the world\u2019s GDP, or approximately $1.5 trillion to $3.7 trillion in 2015. Similarly, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime found criminal proceeds in 2009 amounted to 3.6 percent of global GDP or roughly $2.1 trillion. Using these guesstimates, the amount of international money laundering today is approximately the same as the annual U.S. federal budget.\n\nDepending on what is included in the count, the reality is much higher. For example, there is an international movement to recognize tax evasion as a predicate offense to charge money laundering. The Tax Justice Network, an NGO that advocates against tax evasion, estimates that between $21 and $32 trillion is hiding in more than 80 international tax havens.\n\nThe scope of the problem is breathtaking, as the release of the \u201cPanama\u201d and \u201cParadise\u201d papers showed. Those records, millions of financial documents leaked from the files of Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, show the extraordinary lengths legitimate businesses, criminals, corrupt government officials, celebrities and common taxpayers go to hide their income and wealth. According to the Panama papers, Mossack Fonseca set up more than 200,000 shell corporations over the years, with registration in places with particularly lax money-laundering laws\u2014the kind of offshore web allegedly used by Manafort and Gates.\n\nThe IMF and UNODC don\u2019t count trade-based money-laundering, either. When you include all its various forms, this technique is probably the world\u2019s most common way to launder money. It is poorly understood, investigated or enforced\u2014and therefore escapes our traditional countermeasures. Here\u2019s one way it works: trade misinvoicing, an oft-used method of moving value illicitly across borders. Conspirators deliberately misrepresent the value of a commercial transaction on an invoice by misreporting the quantity, quality, price per unit and/or description of a good that results in the shipment being over or under-invoiced or other fraudulent schemes. The potential scale here is enormous, given that the amount of average annual global merchandise trade is approximately $20 trillion. According to some estimates, 80 percent of the world\u2019s illicit money flow stems from trade-related activities.\n\nSo out of the multiple trillions of dollars that are laundered internationally every year, how much of the proceeds of crime are actually seized and forfeited? According to the UNODC, the answer is less than 1 percent.\n\nThe other bottom-line metric that matters is the number of successful anti-money laundering convictions. The State Department tracks these statistics on a yearly basis. They vary markedly from country to country. Yet a review of the overall reporting shows that the actual numbers of convictions are miniscule in comparison to the magnitude of transnational criminal activity. Many countries\u2019 anti-money laundering efforts are essentially worthless. Some countries, the Philippines for example\u2014have never had a money laundering conviction. Criminals are attracted to the weak link; when one country fails to crack down on money laundering, it affects many others.\n\nBy looking at the bottom line numbers, unfortunately the United States is also a weak link. Manafort and Gates were allegedly able to exploit vulnerabilities for years until they were caught because of unique circumstances.\n\nThe total amount of money laundered annually in the United States is conservatively estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. According to the IRS, tax evasion is skyrocketing\u2014and \u201cmoney laundering is in effect tax evasion in progress.\u201d While tax evasion is not yet considered to be a \u201cspecified unlawful activity\u201d to charge money laundering in the U.S., related crimes are. For example, identity theft connected to tax fraud is rampant.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. \u201cconfiscated\u201d approximately $4.4 billion. While this appears to be an impressive number, it is not certain what percentage was actually forfeited instead of ultimately released. Let us approximate $3 billion. The UNODC estimated proceeds from crime in the U.S. (excluding tax evasion, many forms of trade-based money laundering, cybercrimes, the use of new payment methods, etc.) was $300 billion in 2010, about 2 percent of the U.S. economy. If we use the conservative UNODC estimate (a more accurate estimate would be much higher), that means we are recovering less than 1 percent of the illicit money generated by criminal activity every year.\n\nIn one illustration, a few years up to $39 billion of illicit proceeds were smuggled annually across our southern border in the form of bulk cash. Analysis showed that for every $100 smuggled across our southern border we are recovering a quarter! Literally one quarter\u2014as in 25 cents, not 25 dollars.\n\nWe often forget about the money made on the money that is successfully laundered. Although this is simplistic, let\u2019s assume the $39 billion is accurate and the cartels simply invest the illicit proceeds at a 5 percent annualized rate of return; after 20 years, just that one year has mushroomed into a $1.7 trillion problem! And that represents just one year and one straightforward money laundering methodology limited to one geographic area.\n\nSome apologists in government or industry will have you believe that countering money laundering is all about \u201cdisruption,\u201d or \u201cdeterrence\u201d or the number of financial intelligence reports filed by financial institutions. These platitudes are ridiculous. Stopping money laundering ultimately all comes down to enforcement\u2014and America is doing a lousy job of it.\n\nCurrently, there are about 1,200 money-laundering convictions a year at the federal level. That seems like a large number and undoubtedly some money launderers plead to other charges. But if we factor in the amount of criminal activity and the multi-hundreds of billions of illicit proceeds generated, it\u2019s just a drop in the ocean.\n\n\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the U.S. government\u2019s primary model for stopping money laundering, was enacted almost 50 years ago. Our financial intelligence countermeasures were primarily designed to stop the money laundering of cowboy cocaine dealers operating in Miami. The model is outdated, inefficient and expensive. Financial institutions and money service businesses in the United States spend approximately $8 billion a year to comply with money-laundering rules \u2013 more than twice the amount of criminal proceeds forfeited. As Ron Pol, a respected money laundering expert, recently put it, \u201cAnti-money laundering legislation is the least effective of any anti-crime measure, anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut we have to try. The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings aimed at modernizing laws against money laundering. Other committees are active as well. Government and industry representatives should work together and design and implement a modern, robust, efficient, effective and near real-time system for detecting money laundering that incorporates the necessary privacy safeguards and oversight.\n\nWe can do far better than a 1 percent success rate. It shouldn\u2019t take a special counsel\u2019s investigation to detect and prosecute money laundering.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Joanna Weiss", "body": "It\u2019s tough to lose an election for student council, let alone for president. So it made sense that, after November 2016, Hillary Clinton would have spent some time wallowing in the past, howling at the universe with a side of Chardonnay. That\u2019s the frame of mind she described in What Happened, her post-campaign memoir that came out in September, which was more of an angry play-by-play of how she was wronged than a clear-headed self-assessment of the race. Now, five months after the book came out, 15 months after the election, Clinton\u2019s been spotted promoting family friend Lanny Davis\u2019 new book, The Unmaking of the President 2016: How FBI Director James Comey Cost Hillary Clinton the Presidency.\n\nWe just passed Groundhog Day on the calendar, but it feels like we\u2019re still living it; we can\u2019t break free from the gnashing and rehashing of the 2016 election. It\u2019s not just the Mueller probe and legitimate questions about Russian influence. It\u2019s the emotional notes of triumph and defeat. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t dropped the subject, which is as perplexing as anything else Trump has done. But Clinton hasn\u2019t dropped it, either. And at this point, she should.\n\nI feel little nervous saying that, knowing what backlash will come: Clinton won the popular vote, she made history, she\u2019s double-ultra-accomplished, and suggesting that she sing a different tune is really just trying to silence her. Her fans are highly sensitive about critiques, and their fury reached a crescendo in December, when Vanity Fair posted a snarky video suggesting New Year\u2019s resolutions for Clinton\u2014including \u201cput away your James Comey voodoo doll\u201d and take up knitting\u2014and then, after a Twitter frenzy, sort of apologized.\n\nKnitting was a little much\u2014I\u2019m not suggesting Clinton retreat from public life to a domestic one, unless that\u2019s what she wants. But let\u2019s put the video in context: The media are often unkind to losing candidates of every gender. In March 2013, four months after he lost to Barack Obama, the Atlantic ran a snarky piece about the \u201cBizarre Post-Election Life\u201d of Mitt Romney, caught in such shocking acts as pumping his own gas, ordering McDonald\u2019s and going to Costco. Around that time, Romney did his first major post-election interview on \"Fox News Sunday\"; a Washington Post story about it began, \u201cOne hundred seventeen days later, Mitt Romney still isn\u2019t over it.\u201d Ever since his gut-piercing loss in 2000, writers have pop-psychologized over Al Gore\u2019s weight gain and post-election facial hair. \u201cIt is the beard of the hermit,\u201d one Guardian columnist wrote, \u201ca former warrior sorely done by and meditating in his manly cave until the people realise their folly.\u201d\n\nWhat Gore and Romney have managed to do, though, is move on\u2014or at least make it look like they have\u2014and reinvent. Romney has made his way back to the arena, after finding a new state in which to run for office and distinguishing himself as a rare Republican politician who criticized Trump flat out (with a brief interlude when he tried to position himself to be Trump\u2019s secretary of state). Gore turned the 2000 race into a throwaway punch line and embarked on a second act as an investor, climate-change Cassandra and Nobel laureate. This is what many of Clinton\u2019s critics want for her: Not to be silent, but to say something different. She\u2019s missing an opportunity to define herself beyond being the candidate who\u2014fairly, unfairly, or both\u2014lost a seemingly winnable election to Trump.\n\nSelf-definition, reinvention, self-improvement; those ideas sound like the stuff of Oprah, the  2020 presidential candidate. In fact, the internet is clogged with advice about what to do after a painful defeat. A 2016 piece of aggregated wisdom in Business News Daily, \u201cHow Successful Leaders Recover from Failure,\u201d wraps it up in bullet points: \u201cApologize quickly and own up,\u201d \u201cAnalyze what went wrong,\u201d and \u201cMove on.\u201d The job search website Ladders recently posted a list of \u201c10 things smart people never say,\u201d from \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault\u201d to \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u201d to \u201cHe\u2019s lazy/incompetent/a jerk.\u201d\n\nHow is it that Clinton, who is successful and smart, hasn\u2019t followed the most basic, Goop-like advice? For one thing, self-reflection isn\u2019t easy or natural, which is why there are so many of these lists in the first place. Plus, it\u2019s harder to let go when a mob of people\u2014from inner-circle loyalists like Lanny Davis to the internet hordes\u2014are egging you on while rending their garments over Trump.\n\nBut the irony is that Clinton has done it right before, handling past adversity in ways that were productive and inspired. In one of the feminist triumphs of modern politics, she refused to lock herself into the \u201cwronged wife\u201d story line, launched an ambitious bid for U.S. Senate from New York, and began a soaring political career. In 2008, after a tight loss to Obama in the Democratic primary, she graciously accepted his offer to be secretary of state, where she oversaw Washington\u2019s \u201creset\u201d with Moscow, managed sanctions in Iran and crises in Pakistan, and launched the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative.\n\nPerhaps Clinton was able to bounce back so quickly because she knew the presidency was still within reach. Now that goal is off the table, and she has yet to fully embrace a cause or future that can separate her from her loss. Finding the right path, among many possible options, is surely a challenge. But if she does commit herself to reinvention, Clinton will find that she is better-positioned than ever to make a difference. She\u2019ll be free from the daily trench warfare of Washington. Her every move will still attract attention. And her experiences as senator and secretary of state have prepared her for roll-up-your-sleeves work on policy issues, from the child-welfare matters that started her career to the status of women worldwide. Clinton has taken baby steps in that direction: This week, at a Georgetown University event, she spoke about how climate change will disproportionately affect women.\n\nShe could dive into the private sector, creating a market solution for any number of problems. She could follow Gore\u2019s path and take on a single cause as a public advocate. Naysayers be damned, she could run for office again. She\u2019s the same age as Romney\u2014and younger than Joe Biden.\n\nThe point is to drop any public grumbling about the past, or calling out of Trump in outraged tweets, or stirring up partisan fury by mocking Trump in public. (Though at least her cameo at the Grammys, reading a passage from \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d redeemed itself with a self-deprecating joke: \u201cThe Grammy\u2019s in the bag?\u201d) There are plenty of people willing and able to analyze the 2016 race and point out the absurdities of Trump. Clinton doesn\u2019t need to be a voice in that mix. She has the chance to go down in history as much more than the almost-first-woman-president.

They\u2019ve spent more than five years trying to cajole the 65-year-old Virginia Republican to take up consequential legislation. Instead, Goodlatte has moved slowly or not at all, his GOP colleagues say, often stalling until lawmakers move on. \n\nAt times, his tactics have created tension and ill will with leadership and Republican members of his own committee. In the process, they say, Goodlatte has squandered the power of the Judiciary Committee, which has among the most expansive jurisdictions of any committee in Congress.\n\nIn interviews with more than a dozen lawmakers, aides and White House officials, the same phrase was used to describe Goodlatte\u2019s tenure, which will come to a close when he retires at the end of this year. His committee, they said, is where \"bills go to die.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to kick him in the shorts on the way out the door, but there were a lot of missed opportunities,\u201d said former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who served with Goodlattee for years on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cIt was very frustrating because people wanted to move forward. But on some of the more difficult issues, Chairman Goodlatte chose to stay silent and not do anything.\u201d \n\nThe complaints abound. Some Republicans are unhappy that Goodlatte hasn\u2019t had a hearing on his own DACA bill. Others are upset he hasn\u2019t done more to respond to Russia\u2019s election meddling or the FBI\u2019s investigation of the matter, as his Senate counter, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, has done. \n\nIn recent months, some Republicans wanted a hearing to publicly examine bump stocks, the device a Las Vegas gunman used to mow down dozens of country concert-goers last October. Democrats also pleaded with Goodlatte to hold a hearing on domestic terrorism following the neo-Nazi rally last summer in Charlottesville last summer, a city in his own state.\n\nBut nothing happened. \n\n\u201cThis guy just refuses to move legislation,\u201d said a senior Republican lawmaker. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single thing he\u2019s actually accomplished,\u201d added a top GOP Republican aide.\n\nIn the wake of the Florida school shooting last month, GOP leaders implored Goodlatte to hold a hearing on how the gunman, who\u2019d been flagged by the FBI and local police, slipped through the cracks. Goodlatte initially hesitated to schedule one, according to two sources familiar with the matter. That prompted Republican leaders to ask Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy to consider holding a hearing if Goodlatte refused, even though the Judiciary Committee technically has jurisdiction.\n\nShortly before this story published, Goodlatte's office told POLITICO that he would, in fact, conduct a hearing on the shooting. \n\nGoodlatte, in an interview, rejected the notion that he hasn\u2019t done enough with his chairmanship. He argued that he can\u2019t possibly take up every lawmaker\u2019s pet legislation. Rather, Goodlatte said he\u2019s focused on holding hearings on issues that will yield concrete results.\n\nHis committee has been \u201cone of the busiest, most productive in the House,\u201d Goodlatte said. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had over 300 hearings \u2026 so we\u2019re not short of hearings by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to gauge what we think is going to be most likely to yield a productive change in policy. \u2026 I respect people wanting to [take action on] issues, but if they don\u2019t have a majority to move that issue, then I\u2019m not interested in having a platform for something that isn\u2019t going to change public policy or result in legislation.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nGoodlatte also denied that he wasn\u2019t willing to negotiate on how to deal with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for Dreamers. The chairman pointed to changes he\u2019s made recently to try to win over the agriculture sector. And his committee staff sent POLITICO a list of changes he\u2019s made to the bill since the legislation was introduced in mid-January.\n\nGoodlatte also ticked off legislation the committee has passed over the years, including a permanent ban on taxing internet access and an overhaul to the nation\u2019s intelligence-gathering programs. He said his committee passed about a dozen criminal justice reform bills only to see them die in the Senate.\n\nJust last week, Goodlatte joined with Gowdy to ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel to investigate any potential FBI bias against Trump \u2014 a move to mollify conservatives on his panel who have become more vocal in pushing him to subpoena former FBI officials. On Tuesday, Goodlatte also held a news conference with conservative immigration groups and said he will continue to work on DACA. \n\nGoodlatte has some defenders, who praise his temperament and smarts. They say he never raises his voice and rarely tells colleagues \u201cno\u201d to their faces. They say he\u2019s only deliberate because the matters his committee deals with are so controversial.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows he thinks about the issues and that may leave people to say he\u2019s too cautious,\u201d said Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), a longtime friend of Goodlatte\u2019s. But \u201che thinks the issues through for good cause and he\u2019s just trying to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s supporters also note that arch-conservatives on his panel make it all but impossible for him to easily advance leadership\u2019s priorities. On some matters, they said, Goodlatte wouldn't have the votes if he tried to round them up.\n\nA native of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Goodlatte had a modest beginning, working at Friendly\u2019s and painting buses to make ends meet. He became politically active at Bates College in Maine, leading the College Republicans before graduating from Washington and Lee University School of Law. \n\nIn the late 1970s, he worked as district director for the late GOP Rep. Caldwell Butler (R-Va.) before running for another House seat. He has won reelection handily since.\n\nGoodlatte took the reins of the Judiciary Committee in early 2013. President Barack Obama had just won a second term, all but assuring that any partisan bill Goodlatte passed would be vetoed. \n\nBut tensions over Goodlatte\u2019s tenure flared early because some of his own party's members felt he wouldn\u2019t even try. Chaffetz said he tried for years to persuade Goodlatte to take up his online sales tax bill. The issue of how to tax online purchases had long stumped states and retailers, and many lawmakers, including GOP leaders, wanted the matter resolved. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nBut Chaffetz said Goodlatte would regularly cancel or fail to show up for meetings he\u2019d scheduled on his bill. \n\n\u201cHe was trying to avoid it, and he was trying to be nice and polite about it, but it was frustrating,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cIt is a difficult, thorny and complicated issue. But Congress is supposed to deal with those things.\u201d\n\nChaffetz said he also felt the panel relinquished its oversight authority over the FBI and Justice Department. When the bureau didn\u2019t respond to a joint request from Chaffetz and Goodlatte to look into whether Hillary Clinton lied to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, Chaffetz said, Goodlatte \u201cjust sat on his hands.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s staff contends that the panel has spent \u201cliterally thousands of hours\u201d on the online tax issue but has argued that ongoing litigation has complicated negotiations. \n\nGoodlatte\u2019s alleged intransigence came to a head in 2015, when Republican leaders were deciding whether to reappoint their committee chairmen to another term. Then-Speaker John Boehner lashed out at Goodlatte, warning him that he needed to do more with his gavel. \n\n\u201cBoehner just kind of took him on for everything he promised to get done,\" and he didn't, said one Republican who witnessed the exchange. Goodlatte, the person added, will \u201cgive you a white paper on [an issue], but he never plans to produce anything.\"\n\nGoodlatte acknowledged the upbraiding but dismissed Boehner\u2019s remarks, arguing that he has a \u201cvery good\u201d relationship with leadership.\n\n\u201cSometimes you can do [what leadership wants] and sometimes you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \"You know, the committee has its own jurisdiction, its own structure. And we have to work the will of the committee.\u201d \n\nMost recently, Goodlatte\u2019s work has come to the forefront on immigration. He, like many other House Republicans, was strongly opposed to the Senate\u2019s plan to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. \n\nBut Goodlatte's bill went even further right than Trump\u2019s plan. It included a controversial provision requiring all employers to certify that their workers are here legally \u2014 a burdensome mandate for many businesses, according to critics of the idea. Multiple House GOP and White House sources told POLITICO that the administration tried to persuade Goodlatte not to include so-called E-Verify in his bill. \n\nAt one point, the White House also tried to help facilitate negotiations between Goodlatte and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a leading moderate who tried to bridge the divide within the Republican Conference.\n\nBut Goodlatte rejected the changes. To the chagrin of a number of Republicans, he later left town for a congressional trip instead of staying in town to work on the bill.

In December, she won her first term, making her both the most prominent black woman to win a major election since Donald Trump was inaugurated and the most prominent black female executive in the South\u2014and one of the few in the entire country.\n\nThere will be more, she said\u2014and soon.\n\n\u201cBlack women are realizing the power of their vote and of their influence,\u201d Bottoms told me in an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken what we are dealing with on a national level, I think, to really get us energized and not taking anything for granted, but I do think we are recognizing and exercising our power in a way that we\u2019ve never done before, and that\u2019s exciting,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cWe are becoming engaged, and we realize the danger of staying home.\u201d\n\nBlack women pouring out in big numbers already put Ralph Northam in Virginia and Doug Jones in Alabama over the top. There\u2019s a reason Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called them the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the party back in December.\n\nBut with Bottoms winning\u2014and black women also winning historic races for mayor in Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans in 2017\u2014Bottoms and others warn Democrats not to misread what\u2019s driving them, or fall back into taking them for granted. They can\u2019t stand Trump, but they\u2019re going to need more than that to keep showing up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge we\u2019ve seen in the Democratic Party. Black women are treated as monolithic, but then they receive underinvestment or very superficial investment,\u201d said Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic leader in the Georgia state House and a candidate for governor who is a black woman herself. \u201cThe question is not who they will vote for. The question is how many will vote. The party and too many candidates have stopped at the beginning of that equation.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are immediate across the midterms, at home in Georgia, too: Democrats see the glimmering of a path in the governor\u2019s race\u2014with Abrams in a primary against Stacey Evans, the star of a viral announcement video about growing up poor and making it as a lawyer, and who is white but has support from prominent black leaders like former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, and Bottoms suggesting she might be on board, too. But Democrats locally and nationally are still burned by putting their hopes in winning the House special election in the Atlanta suburbs last year which went national, brought in $50 million, and which Republican Karen Handel won anyway.\n\nThough Bottoms has now signed on to the Georgia Democratic Party\u2019s executive committee and pledged to campaign for statewide officials, she\u2019s privately expressed surprise when people have pushed her to realize her responsibility to the party as the most prominent elected Democrat in the state.\n\n\u201cShe understands Atlanta\u2019s potential,\u201d said DuBose Porter, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, who pointed out that Democrats have registered 200,000 voters since losing the 2014 gubernatorial and Senate races by about 200,000 votes. \u201cAnd she understands what her role now has the potential of being.\u201d\n\nBottoms\u2019 election was a rough one. Though she had the support of outgoing Mayor Reed, eight candidates made it to the last debate of the first round of voting, including the Bernie Sanders-backed state Sen. Vincent Fort, who slammed her for personal financial issues and for having a policy vision for the city which he deemed as not progressive enough. In the runoff in December, she faced an independent white woman with ties to Republicans, and won by all of 821 votes out of about 90,000 cast. More stark was how the election results looked on a map, with the city visibly divided north to south\u2014the wealthier, whiter parts of the city going for her opponent, and the blacker, less affluent part of the city pulling for Bottoms.\n\nThat an election in a heavily Democratic city was ever that close shows just how deep the fights dividing the party nationally affect races locally. Progressives and those voters who backed other candidates stayed home in the runoff, as Bottoms\u2014who is neither a fire-breather nor a firebrand\u2014failed to ignite movement enthusiasm.\n\nBottoms says she was never going to pretend to be something she\u2019s not. And she chalks up some of the struggles she faced as a candidate to an insidious mix of tacit sexism and racism.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of critiques and criticisms toward me that just would not have been thrown towards a man: \u2018Will she be her own person?\u2019 \u2018Can she lead?\u2019 \u2018Will she be a puppet?\u2019 Things that I know are never asked of men or weren\u2019t asked during this race, and in my own right, I\u2019ll put my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and my professional accomplishments up against anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s often perpetuated against African-American leaders, that you can\u2019t be accomplished and you can\u2019t drive a nice car\u2014you must be corrupt; there has to be something to it. And that was more concerning to me, just the underlying code words and language that was used.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s literally impossible to drive through Atlanta without thinking of the civil rights movement, taking Andrew Young International Boulevard or passing signs for the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial on the way to the National Center for Civil and Human Rights.\n\nBottoms has lived the recent history of the city. Her father, Major Lance, was an R&B sensation when she was a girl. She remembers seeing women scream when they saw him on stage\u2014which puzzled her, because in her eyes, he wasn\u2019t the Jackson 5. She also remembers coming home one day at 8 years old and seeing police swarming the house, arresting him for selling drugs when his music career hit the skids, and then visiting him in jail over the next three years.\n\n\u201cWhat always struck me is \u2026 the prisons were full of men who looked just like my Dad,\u201d she remembered.\n\nBottoms\u2019 mother was and is a more looming presence in her life, who was so broke after separating from Lance that she couldn\u2019t afford to buy new clothes and went to work as a file clerk dressed in the Ultrasuede suits she\u2019d stocked her closet with to look the part of a musician\u2019s wife. When her mother was working a second job, she\u2019d curl up in her bed to feel close to her, and learn with her older brother and sister how to stretch the couple of dollars left for lunch.\n\nAt first, she was reluctant to go public with many personal details, and though she told part of the story during the campaign, she went deeper in the Off Message interview than she ever had before.\n\nShe became a lawyer, worked her way up to be a local judge, realizing one day that she was serving alongside a man who\u2019d been the prosecutor who sent her father to jail. After a brief stint on the Atlanta City Council, she jumped into the mayor\u2019s race, backed by Reed, as he had been backed by outgoing Mayor Shirley Franklin eight years earlier.\n\nShe\u2019s eager to return the favor, boosting the much-rumored idea that Reed will run for Senate in 2020 against David Perdue, capitalizing on presidential election-year coattails\u2014\u201cwhatever he runs for, I think that it will be a nice next chapter, whatever it may be,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she\u2019s hoping that Democrats are fighting hard in Georgia\u2019s presidential race by then. \u201cI don\u2019t think the resources have ever been put into the state in the way they need to be to make us truly competitive,\u201d Bottoms said.\n\nPut the money in, Bottoms said, and \u201cabsolutely\u201d Georgia will be competitive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to realize that it\u2019s different than in Alabama, where Trump carried it with 65 percent. He carried Georgia by 51 percent. Georgia\u2019s in play, the numbers are there if we turn out our base,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAfrican-American women have always been a big part of it, and they definitely will be this year.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who for years has argued that Georgia could be competitive by lighting up voters who are already in the state, is hoping for a major turnout in her race this year, putting in the effort to appeal to black female voters she says other campaigns haven\u2019t shown up with.\n\n\u201cThe numbers bear out the capacity\u201d for Democrats to win she said. \u201cThis is not a far-fetched idea.

And at first blush, the idea of a Soviet-style military procession down Pennsylvania Avenue plays into an unhelpful narrative for the president. This is a man after all who is routinely accused of trying to recreate his own gilded banana republic right here at home.\n\nBut as his ideas go, and admittedly he\u2019s had some doozies, this actually may be one of Trump\u2019s canniest.\n\nAs with many of his Republican predecessors, Trump has effectively tapped into the sense among millions of Americans that pride in the United States is diminishing, not only abroad but at home. Many of his supporters share a sentiment that D.C., N.Y. and L.A. \u201celites\u201d are embarrassed about our country and our achievements. This is why, as a candidate for the White House, Trump frequently lambasted President Barack Obama for his alleged global \u201capology tour.\u201d It\u2019s why he\u2019s waded into the protection of confederate monuments and claimed that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln might be the next to go. This is why he literally embraced the American flag. It\u2019s why he made such a big deal about NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem, so much so that he\u2019s almost achieving the unthinkable\u2014turning some red-blooded Republican men against football.\n\nThe president\u2019s State of the Union was pockmarked with so many tributes to American symbols\u2014our flag, our motto, our anthem\u2014that you almost expected him to bring out a freshly-baked apple pie and start eating it mid-speech. So much of what Trump does seem random, but all of this has a clear purpose. Trump understands, perhaps instinctively, that an appeal to national pride like calling for a gleaming, glorious military spectacle touches a nerve with many Americans.\n\nAt the same time, the president is overtly tying his administration to the most popular institution in our nation\u2014perhaps the only popular institution left\u2014the United States military. More to the point, he\u2019s daring the Democrats, and their allies in the media, to stand apart and oppose it. By doing so, Democratic leaders appear either as killjoys complaining about excessive costs (as if frugality were a Democratic Party hallmark) or as diminishing the achievements of the military or the need to publicly extol them. All in all, it\u2019s a pretty clever trap.\n\nIs an expensive display of American military hardware necessary? Of course not. But financial responsibility has never been Trump\u2019s primary concern. As a proposal, it\u2019s also not without some historical precedent, though typically these sort of things have followed an armed conflict. After the Civil War, for example, Washington, D.C., saw a Grand Review of the Armies. There was another military parade at the close of World War II. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush convened a National Victory Celebration parade after America\u2019s win in the Gulf War. And, as Trump is aware, other nations that are not thuggish dictatorships\u2014such as France\u2014have put their military might on display for various occasions, such as Bastille Day.\n\nWere he to pull off this event\u2014ostensibly to commemorate the 100th anniversary of our victory in World War I (and who can argue with that?) but in reality to commemorate the greatness of Donald Trump\u2014he would command center stage in the greatest tribute to the military most Americans have ever seen. News outlets will breathlessly cover the plans and preparations\u2014and of course, the main event\u2014giving Trump hours of free airtime while men and women in uniform visibly salute him. That\u2019s a free commercial for him and the GOP\u2014not to mention a timely and helpful distraction from the Russia probe or Cabinet members calling him stupid. Pretty smart.\n\nAnd who\u2019s going to complain when it\u2019s over? The parade might boost the D.C. economy, and will have put the nation\u2019s capital and its military capabilities, at least for a day, in the international spotlight. The only ones who will be sour are the Democrats, who will have discovered that Trump, contrary to their beliefs and hopes, is not a buffoon.

The push to publish it only a day after sharing it with the FBI director \u2014 who was appointed by President Donald Trump \u2014 reflects the extent of the House GOP\u2019s suspicions toward the bureau, as well as the influence of Republicans outside Congress who pressed to make the document public.\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n                    \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Obtaining a warrant under FISA requires the FBI to present an application to a court with evidence that indicates the target is acting on behalf of a foreign power. \nThe GOP has complained that the FBI included in its evidence material culled from a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that described illicit connections between Trump and Russia. Steele compiled the dossier in 2016 on behalf of research firm Fusion GPS, which was being paid by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. \nThe New York Times reported Monday that the memo also reveals that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved an application to extend the surveillance of Page in early 2017. \nThough Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, helped craft the memo and has championed its public release, he said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he believed the FBI should see the memo before it comes out.

Over the weekend, the indictment spurred intense reactions from President Donald Trump, who complained that the FBI is \u201cspending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nLike many of Trump\u2019s outbursts, that tweet could be used by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to show that Trump had \u201ccorrupt\u201d intent, which would be needed to prove obstruction of justice. After all, Trump admits in the tweet that he wants the Russia investigation to end, a desire that appears to be fueled by Friday\u2019s indictment. But was the indictment really bad news for Trump?\n\nThe indictment could not have come as much of a surprise. Back in September 2017, I wrote in this publication that the Facebook search warrant obtained by Mueller indicated he was investigating whether \u201cforeign individuals committed a crime by making a \u2018contribution\u2019 in connection with an election and that evidence of that crime existed on Facebook.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Mueller\u2019s indictment was more conservative than expected. He did not charge the foreign interference itself as a crime\u2014the indictment focused on efforts by the Russians to hide their activities from the U.S. government, along with the fraud they engaged in to do so. The indictment also did not allege wrongdoing by Trump\u2019s campaign or his associates, even though it indicates that the Russians supported Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nBut beneath the surface, it makes it harder for the president to undermine the Mueller investigation, which as I\u2019ve explained elsewhere, is his best strategy. Friday\u2019s indictment established that Mueller gathered substantial evidence establishing a Russian scheme to influence our election. When he announced the indictment, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was careful to state that \u201cthere is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\u201d and \u201cthere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThis careful approach makes it harder for Trump and his allies to attack Mueller\u2019s investigation as a waste of time, a hoax, or a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d On its face, this indictment and its announcement was not aimed at Trump and reached a nonpartisan conclusion, which is why Trump initially quoted Rosenstein\u2019s announcement in a tweet. It is now harder for Trump to claim that Rosenstein and Mueller are out of control.\n\nBut while the indictment undercuts Trump\u2019s arguments against the investigation, it does not reduce the potential liability of Trump or his associates. Mueller could still charge Americans in a future indictment with aiding and abetting the Russian operation if they knew of the criminal activity and helped make it succeed. Nothing in Friday\u2019s indictment forecloses that possibility, and one American, Richard Pinedo, has already pleaded guilty to helping the Russians to fraudulently obtain U.S. bank accounts.\n\nBased on what we know publicly, Trump\u2019s greatest legal liability appears to be for obstruction of justice\u2014not for aiding the Russians. As I\u2019ve explained in this publication, it appears likely that Mueller will conclude Trump obstructed justice, yet at this time there is not sufficient public evidence to prove that Trump or his close associates aided a Russian operation.\n\nTime will tell whether Mueller can prove that anyone associated with the Trump campaign assisted the Russian operation. Friday\u2019s indictment suggests that charges would involve knowledge of the Russian attempts to hide their tracks, not the Russian influence operation itself. But the lasting legacy of Friday\u2019s indictment may be its impact on Trump and on opinion within the Republican Party, either by buying time and space for Mueller to continue investigating obstruction or by generating more evidence (like this weekend\u2019s tweets) that aid Mueller's investigation.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ryan Heath", "body": "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair  | Carl Court/Getty Images\n        \n        \n                        Tony Blair: Just weeks left to stop Brexit\n                        The former prime minister will say in a speech Thursday that the EU should reform to provide an alternative to Brexit.\n\n                    \n                \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBy\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRyan Heath\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t3/1/18, 12:01 AM CET\n\n\t\t\tUpdated 3/1/18, 3:54 AM CET\n\n\t\t\n\n     Blair believes there are just weeks left to stop Brexit and will argue in a speech in Brussels Thursday that EU reforms centred on immigration control are\u00a0key to persuading Britons to change their mind in a second Brexit vote.\n\nIn a speech at a European Policy Center event, the former U.K. prime minister\u00a0will say the Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, in effect, lied to British voters and left them with an impossible-to-deliver vision of Brexit.\n\nInstead of the U.K. government delivering a complicated Brexit and EU supporters offering \u201cpassive acquiescence,\u201d Blair suggests that a \u201ccomprehensive plan on immigration control\u201d across Europe could sit at the core of an alternative to Brexit.\n\nBlair believes the Brexit vote is an unambiguous warning to the EU to reform, that puts responsibility on the shoulders of EU leaders to help all of Europe to escape the Brexit \u201ccul-de-sac.\u201d\n\nIf they fail, the competitive pressure a desperate Britain places on the EU will diminish both the EU and U.K., and potentially lead to race-to-the-bottom policies. \u201c[Brexit] weakens Europe\u2019s standing and power the world over.

No matter how we try, it will create a competitive pole to that of Europe, economically and politically to the detriment of both of us.\u201d\n\nRunning with the Brexit cake metaphor loved by the European Council president Donald Tusk, Blair also predicts it will be hard for the U.K. government to win a parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal. \u201cOutside commentary underestimates the fact that at some point this year the Government have got to put a vote to Parliament and win it.

That is who we are. And it's time to fight for it.\u201d\n\nKennedy, who delivered his speech in the auto shop of a technical school at the south end of his district in Fall River, was praised by a range of people for his speech but mocked by some\u2014including a number of prominent Republicans\u2014for the shininess in one corner of his mouth throughout the 10-minute speech.\n\nIt was a classic example of an issue that appeared only on television: the reflection of the lights wasn\u2019t visible to anyone in the room, and he and staff became aware of it only after the broadcast was done.\n\nIt was also a classic example of how the peanut gallery nature of Twitter can shape perceptions across the wider media. Kennedy painted a dark portrait of America on the brink, Nazi marches and mass shootings, \u201cand that nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs, \u2018This is not right. This is not who we are.\u2019\u201d\n\nKennedy wasn\u2019t defensive. He sees the hubbub over his shiny lips as another symptom of his larger argument: that when \u201cfar bigger\u201d issues are actually at stake, it can seem like everything is the chaos, partisanship and politics of the past year.\n\n\u201cAll of us bear some responsibility for that too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a fractured and divided country. There are undeniably a sizable percentage of our population that steadfastly supports the president. People who don\u2019t support the president have to acknowledge that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s even more a measure, he said, of how nervous the attacks show some of the president\u2019s supporters to be.\n\n\u201cThey can point out too much Chapstick all they want\u2014it doesn\u2019t mean that the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice isn\u2019t rolling back civil rights protections. It doesn\u2019t mean that an economic plan put forth by this administration is largely zero sum\u2014that it is benefiting somebody at the expense of somebody else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not get away from the fact that the tone and the rhetoric our president has used has continued to divide America. And it\u2019s not going to stop the fact that I think that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s started tossing back mentions of the episode with self-effacing promises to use less Chapstick, and added, \u201cI like to think that if I can learn that lesson that quickly, some of the folks that are criticizing me can as well.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and others also criticized Kennedy\u2019s selection as showing the dearth of Democratic stars and ideas, dismissing him as either a white man, a Massachusetts liberal, a dynastic politician\u2014he is the grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy\u2014or some combination of the above.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, all those things are more or less true,\u201d Kennedy said of the japes at his privileged background. \u201cPart of what I tried to point out last night was that there\u2019s far more issues, opportunities, obstacles, challenges that unite those various identity groups than divide them, and I think this administration is using some cheap form of exploiting those divisions to exercise their own political agenda. That might work in the short term. I\u2019ve never seen that work in the long run in our country.\u201d\n\nMouth glare aside, Kennedy\u2019s speech earned high marks from across the political spectrum, from former Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes, who tweeted while watching, \u201cKennedy is accomplishing something very hard\u2014fighting back while offering a unifying message,\u201d to Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who followed up a tweet about the \u201cdrool-mouth\u201d by writing, \u201cJoe Kennedy did a better job drawing a sharp contrast with the GOP than any Democratic SOTU response since Tim Kaine 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nKennedy said he knew what he was getting into when he agreed to do the response, and that he\u2019d face attacks, adding, \u201cNobody doing that speech is going to be able to match the circumstance and the ceremony.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leadership put choosing the location and drafting of the speech\u2014as well as all the logistics for the event\u2014in his hands. On just one week\u2019s notice, his staff reviewed previous response speeches and decided he needed to be in front of a crowd.\n\n\u201cThere might be some compelling speakers out there that can hold a televised crowd for seven, eight, 10 minutes, direct to camera, but I\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do it for 30 seconds, 45 seconds\u2014unless you\u2019re Robert De Niro or Al Pacino, it gets pretty tough.

Phil Bredesen (D) narrowly edging out Blackburn in a hypothetical match-up. With Republicans controlling just 51 seats, a loss in Tennessee and other competitive races could put the Senate in play \u2014 despite an electoral map tilted heavily in the GOP\u2019s favor.  \nThe poll, conducted by Glen Bolger of Public Opinion Strategies for a Tennessee business group and obtained by POLITICO, shows Bredesen up 47 to 45, despite a sample that was overweighted with Republicans. The survey shows that voters preferred a generic Republican over a Democrat and strongly approved of Trump, signs that even in a Republican-leaning state like Tennessee, Blackburn is in for a tough race. \nAsked to respond to Corker\u2019s second thoughts and the coterie of Republicans pushing him to run again, Blackburn\u2019s campaign insisted she was in the race to stay, whether Corker runs or not. Blackburn\u2019s allies argue she will unite the GOP in the conservative state and crush Bredesen in the fall.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s well past time for the good old boys\u2019 club in Washington D.C. to quit thinking they know who the best candidate and conservative leader is for Tennessee families,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Blackburn. \nPublic polls show Blackburn is a heavy favorite over former Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) in the primary to succeed Corker, and her allies argue the state is so Republican that she can\u2019t lose after winning the primary. Trump won nearly 2-to-1 against Hillary Clinton in Tennessee. She also raised $2 million in her first quarter as a candidate, a significant haul. Meanwhile, a Club for Growth poll from January showed Blackburn trouncing Corker.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nThe Club for Growth, which has spent millions in past elections to defeat more moderate Republicans, will stick with Blackburn regardless of whether Corker reverses course. Their poll showed Blackburn beating Fincher by more than 50 points and also showed Blackburn trouncing Corker. \n\u201cThe message that I\u2019d want to give to the folks trying to entice Corker into running: You shouldn\u2019t do it, he\u2019s gonna lose,\u201d said Club President David McIntosh. \u201cIt would be a sad way for him to end his career to end up being defeated. We will continue to support Marsha.\u201d \nMcIntosh also argued that Corker re-entering the race would only weaken the GOP by reopening ideological chasms within the party. Indeed, there is a long running feud between Tennessee\u2019s more moderate Republicans and conservatives like Blackburn. \nModerates in Tennessee had been aligning with Fincher, but Blackburn has outraised him and Fincher has failed to get traction in the polls. Fincher\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. \nVictor Ashe, a former GOP mayor of Knoxville, prefers Fincher but said he\u2019s \u201cnot sure that he\u2019s a candidate, based on his inactivity.\u201d If he was left to choose between Blackburn and Bredesen, Ashe said he would not commit to endorsing Blackburn. \u201cI could go either way,\u201d Ashe said. \n\u201cAnyone seriously sizing it up would have to say Mrs. Blackburn would be somewhat ahead of Bredesen but not a lot,\u201d Ashe said. \u201cDepending on how the national situation goes, it could be extremely competitive. It would be hard to attack [Bredesen\u2019s] record as governor because so many Republicans like him.\u201d \nFormer Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist (R) was blunt when asked about Blackburn: \u201cYou can say on the record I\u2019m not supporting her.\u201d Blackburn worked in Sundquist\u2019s administration and the two do not get along. \nThe distaste for Blackburn in some corners of the party is driving the campaign to recruit Corker to get back in. Those Republicans argue that she could blow a winnable race, pointing to Bredesen\u2019s coalitions of Republican supporters when he won two governors races. \n\u201cTennessee by any normal standard is a Republican state. I think it\u2019s only close with Blackburn,\u201d said a top Tennessee Republican urging Corker to get back in. \u201cThe problem is Marsha\u2019s a polarizing force. Her nomination is the only path to put this race in play.\u201d \nYet Corker would almost certainly need a blessing from Trump to have any hope of beating Blackburn, who has received money from Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s political action committee. Corker has reached out to the White House to gauge Trump\u2019s support, according to a source familiar with those conversations. And almost all of the dozen Republican officials and operatives interviewed for this story say Corker would need a presidential endorsement to have any chance against Blackburn. \nFurthermore, the electorate in Tennessee is so overwhelmingly Republican now that several strategists said Blackburn would be fine once she wins the August primary and shifts gears ahead of the general election. \nBlackburn launched her campaign attacking GOP leadership and had an early campaign ad pulled from Twitter for being \u201cinflammatory\u201d \u2014 and that rubs some Tennessee Republicans the wrong way. \n\u201cIt\u2019s as much about taste as it is about electability for some people,\u201d said a strategist following the race. \nThe last-gasp effort to recruit Corker is an awkward topic in the Senate GOP right now. Senate GOP campaign chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) attended a political event with Blackburn in New York on Monday, even as his colleague Corker mulled getting back in the race, according to two sources with knowledge of the event. \n Plus, Blackburn would be just the sixth female senator in the GOP caucus if she were to win. \n\u201cThis situation is baffling since we need more Republican women in the Senate \u2014 not less,\u201d said a senior Senate GOP aide.\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). has spoken to Corker about whether he should reconsider his retirement, but the leader told Corker he needed to work it out with the president, a source with direct knowledge of the conversation said. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander has also discussed the race with Corker, but is not explicitly pushing Corker to run again, said a Republican familiar with those talks. \nYet clearly some Senate Republicans are excited by the Senate Foreign Relations chairman\u2019s fresh look at his decision to retire. Corker\u2019s departure, along with uncertainty about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and the retirement of House Foreign Relations Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.), would further drain the party of senior foreign policy voices. \n\u201cThat would be terrific,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). \u201cWe need to hold that seat. I don\u2019t have any doubt\u201d that Corker would win. \n Such a move would not be unprecedented. \nTwo years ago, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) reversed his plans to retire from the Senate despite denying any second thoughts for weeks. One of the key people who convinced Rubio to run? Sen.

Many Republicans say their memo, released with Trump\u2019s backing, demonstrates anti-Trump bias at the FBI and Justice Department that calls into question the entire Russia investigation. Democrats call that a highly misleading effort to taint the Russia probe.\nIf the House votes to release the Democratic memo, Trump will have five days to review it and either support its release \u2014 as he did the Republican memo \u2014 or object. White House officials have not committed to releasing the Democratic version. \nAt issue is an October 2016 application to a federal judge for a Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act (FISA) warrant against Page. That FISA application \u2014 and whether the FBI was fully transparent with a federal court that approved it in October 2016 \u2014 is at the heart of mounting allegations by President Donald Trump and allies in Congress that the FBI abused its spying authority during the 2016 campaign. \nBut Friday\u2019s memo also acknowledged that the Page warrant only came months after the FBI had already opened an investigation into Russian influence over the Trump campaign because of information it had received about another Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadapoulos, whom the New York Times has reported learned in early 2016 that the Russians had stolen Clinton campaign emails.\nThe memo released Friday by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee excoriated FBI leaders for what it described as a crucial omission in that application: the fact that the dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele \u2014 was financed by the campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.\n\u201cNeither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,\u201d the memo alleged.\nBut in an appearance on Fox  Friends, Nunes was asked about reports over the weekend that the FBI application did refer to a political entity connected to the dossier. It is unclear precisely what language the application might have used. \nNunes conceded that a \"footnote\" to that effect was included in the application, while faulting the bureau for failing to provide more specifics.\n\"A footnote saying something may be political is a far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant on an American citizen to spy on another campaign,\" Nunes said on Fox  Friends.\nThere's no evidence that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign itself. Rather, the warrant for Page was issued in October 2016, a month after he left the campaign \u2014 and after Trump campaign officials denied he played a central role. But the surveillance of Page was part of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump associates coordinated with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\nPage is a key figure in the dossier, which makes the unsubstantiated allegation that he held a secret meeting with a top Russian oil executive and a close Putin ally to discuss helping to lift U.S. sanctions against Russia in return for a financial windfall. Page had also been investigated by the FBI in 2013, after he was the target of a recruitment effort by Russian spies in New York City. And the former investment banker and energy consultant also made a summer 2016 trip to Moscow where, after shifting explanations, he now admits he met with Kremlin officials. (Page says the meetings were brief and denies any wrongdoing.)\nThe intelligence committee's memo, which Trump declassified Friday, casts Steele\u2019s dossier as a key component of the Page FISA warrant. But the memo doesn't clarify what other evidence might have been used to convince a court to grant its application, which was renewed several times, including once by Trump's own Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\nThe memo notes that the government must provide \"information potentially favorable to the target of a [surveillance] application,\" but charges that FBI agents \"withheld\" their knowledge that Steele\u2019s work had Democratic funding, and that Steele had openly expressed dislike for Trump.\nNunes' comments follow a similar acknowledgment on Sunday by Gowd, who also said the footnote revealed a possible political bias behind the dossier but called it convoluted.\n\"I read the footnote. I know exactly what the footnote says,\" Gowdy said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"It took longer to explain it the way they did, than if they just come right out and said, 'Hillary Clinton for America and DNC paid for it.' But they didn't do that.\" \nTrump may have provided a window into his thinking when he unleashed a Twitter attack on the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Monday morning. If Trump opposes the Democratic memo's release, the committee may then refer it to the full House of Representatives for a vote to overrule him.\n Among Schiff's complaints about the GOP memo: he says the application to spy on Page only included snippets of the controversial dossier -- and that those aspects may have been \"subject to corroboration\" by the FBI. \n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

We just know too much.\n\nEarlier this week, the editor of this magazine, Blake Hounshell, laid out the case for skepticism, centering on President Donald Trump\u2019s incompetence and the apparent lack of a smoking gun. He argues that the Trump campaign\u2014run by a first-time politician with no filter, aided by a bumbling staff of amateurs who leaked like sieves\u2014was simply too incompetent to have colluded with Russia and kept it a secret. Hence, we would have the smoking gun by now if there was one.\n\nNone of his arguments withstands a skeptical eye. Instead, they require disassembling, isolating and explaining away an array of damning information.\n\nThe first claim is that Trump is too undisciplined to hide this caper.\n\nThe Trump campaign was certainly a chaotic and leaky affair, but when something damaging needed to be kept quiet they certainly knew how to cover it up and keep quiet\u2014at least, temporarily. If anything, they have a lot of practice in coping with scandal. Trump has been silent on: cash payments to hide alleged extra-marital affairs, never revealed during the campaign; all those non-disclosure agreements he has signed over the decades; and his tax returns, despite immense pressure to release them. In the face of significant political or legal pressure he\u2019s had the message-discipline to stick to a line or keep quiet, such as by saying his taxes were under \u201croutine audit\u201d and therefore could not be released.\n\nThis same pattern exists in the Russia scandal. Since the campaign ended, more than 50 contacts between Trump\u2019s team and Russian operatives\u2014which the campaign repeatedly, and for a time successfully, lied about and covered up\u2014have been revealed. All the while, Trump stays on message, insisting, in all caps, there was no collusion and attacking those investigating him.\n\nIt is also true that colluding with a foreign government without getting exposed would require a certain crafty competence. But the Trump team\u2019s incompetence is exactly why we know so much already.\n\nThis gets to the second claim of the skeptics: Why has there been no smoking gun? In fact, there have already been several.\n\nTrump campaign and administration officials have been indicted and pleaded guilty. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman and his deputy, the national security adviser, and a campaign volunteer have all been charged with crimes as a result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nFor skeptics, Mueller\u2019s indictments don\u2019t yet provide anything truly damning. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos are just charged with lying to the FBI, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are in trouble for their work in Ukraine, and the 13 Russian indictments implicate Russia, not Trump. However, this is exactly how a veteran prosecutor would conduct an investigation against someone with pardon power and the ability to fire the investigator: Tread lightly and reveal only what you absolutely need to reveal.\n\nA skeptic will rightly say this is all tea-leaf reading. While Mueller\u2019s indictments might be suggestive, they do not yet implicate Trump. That\u2019s true, in isolation. But it raise the question: What are Flynn, Papadopolous, and now potentially Gates cooperating about, then? The answer is that they have information that Mueller finds valuable enough to grant them leniency.\n\nIn demanding a smoking gun, skeptics also ignore the obvious one: the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Trump\u2019s campaign leadership and Russian operatives. In June 2016, PR man Rob Goldstone offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton as \u201cpart of Russia and it\u2019s government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u201d in an email, to which Donald Trump Jr. responded, not to ask what Goldstone was talking about but to say, \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d He then brought in the campaign chairman and Trump\u2019s son-in-law to discuss both the dirt and Russian sanctions\u2014the quid and the quo.\n\nThis meeting is the Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition of collusion: \u201csecret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose.\u201d That these details have been public knowledge for months doesn\u2019t make them any less incriminating. This meeting demonstrates that the Trump campaign knew of the Russian government\u2019s support for Trump and was willing to collude. The Russians were offering information and capabilities that would have been of tremendous value to a political campaign. And the Trump campaign wanted what the Russians were offering.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. The big reveal from the memo by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes was that the FBI had reason to believe that one of Trump\u2019s first five foreign policy advisors, Carter Page, might be a Russian agent. Page had previously bragged about being an \u201cinformal adviser\u201d to the Kremlin and had been recruited by Russian spies who said of Page, \u201chis enthusiasm works for me.\u201d During the campaign he met top Putin allies and gave a pro-Kremlin speech in Moscow; upon returning, he spoke directly with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Republican National Convention. More recently, Trump\u2019s own Justice Department had sufficient evidence to monitor Page and then gained enough evidence to renew the surveillance warrant multiple times.\n\nMeanwhile, Papadopoulos, another one of Trump\u2019s first foreign policy advisers, was approached by people claiming to represent the Kremlin who offered \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails\u201d; Papadopoulos subsequently sent multiple emails to campaign higher-ups in the campaign about his Russian contacts. Afterwards, he stayed with the campaign for several months, during which he did interviews as a campaign surrogate and helped edit Trump\u2019s foreign policy addresses.\n\nSkeptics claim that much of what we know is built on these \u201chapless\u201d volunteers and \u201cattention-seeking wannabees.\u201d But intelligence agencies almost never recruit the best people, targeting instead individuals who are compromised, bitter, or overly ambitious, and, most importantly, who have access. It is now clear, as shown by the emails between Papadopolus and Trump campaign leadership referenced in the indictment, that these \u201chapless\u201d volunteers had access.\n\nMueller\u2019s latest indictments further spell out what the intelligence community asserted in January 2017: There were two campaigns to elect Trump, one based in Trump Tower and the other in the Kremlin. Insisting there was no collusion requires then imagining a bright line between the two and ignoring dozens of interactions between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and Kremlin-linked individuals, often discussing campaign strategy and shared goals.\n\nFaced with this evidence, arguing there was no collusion is no longer the position of a skeptic, but of someone in denial. It is the refusal to acknowledge what is staring us all in the face: The president of the United States and his campaign colluded with a foreign adversary to defeat his political opponent.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Seung Min Kim", "body": "Rand Paul and Nancy Pelosi have virtually nothing in common.

Even a bipartisan deal blessed by the leaders of both chambers can get caught up in extraneous drama.\nPaul\u2019s sideshow wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. The arch-conservative has frequently used procedural delay tactics to gum up legislation he opposes, particularly on spending and spying powers, when his opposition was plainly in vain.

I know your business is now doing very well.\u201d He later singled out Harley-Davidson as a \u201cgreat American company\u201d in his first address to Congress, vowing to help it again by persuading foreign countries to cut tariffs on its motorcycles.\n\nBut Harley-Davidson did not make Trump\u2019s list of corporations benefiting from his presidency during his State of the Union address Tuesday night. That may be because Tuesday morning, Harley-Davidson announced plans to close a Kansas City factory and lay off 800 employees after weak fourth-quarter earnings, capping off a rough 2017 that saw its worldwide sales drop 6.7 percent. The company\u2019s CEO has said publicly that part of the problem was Trump\u2019s decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal: \u201cThat would have helped us a lot.\u201d\n\nIt would be silly to portray Harley-Davidson\u2019s current troubles as a reflection of the economy, which is doing just fine after Trump\u2019s first year in office. But it was even sillier to portray Harley-Davidson\u2019s successes as a reflection of his instant rescue of the economy, which was also doing just fine before Trump took office. He loves to use corporations as props in his own heroic economic narrative, a narrative that depends on national amnesia about the state of the economy he inherited.\n\n\u201cFor many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us,\u201d Trump declared last night. \u201cBut now they are coming back!\u201d\n\nUm\u2026no. It\u2019s good that the U.S. economy created 2.4 million jobs in the last year, as Trump boasted last night, but it created 16 million jobs in the six years before that. The president provided an inadvertent reminder with his shoutout to Corey Adams, \u201can all-American worker\u201d whose bosses at Staub Manufacturing in Ohio used their tax cuts to give him a raise. Trump noted that Adams \u201clost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub,\u201d so he was presumably one of the 16 million who left the unemployment rolls under President Barack Obama.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s great that the African-American unemployment rate dropped from 7.9 percent to 6.8 percent in 2017, which Trump noted is \u201cthe lowest rate ever recorded,\u201d but that was after dropping from 16.1 percent to 7.9 percent since 2009. Trump also hailed how the stock market \u201chas smashed one record after another,\u201d and indeed it has, but it also nearly tripled on Obama\u2019s watch, which doesn\u2019t quite fit Trump\u2019s mythology of America rising from the ashes. Trump even took credit for the resurgence of U.S. auto manufacturing, \u201csomething we have not seen for decades.\u201d In fact, Obama inherited an auto industry in shambles, but auto sales and employment nearly doubled on his watch\u2014and have actually declined slightly on Trump\u2019s.\n\nLast night, Trump spent a lot of time advertising that \u201cmassive tax cut\u201d he signed last month\u2014and at $1.5 trillion it really is big, although not, as he claimed, the biggest in American history. And it is true, as he said, that 3 million workers have received bonuses that companies like Staub attributed to his corporate tax cuts. But if the point of the legislation had been to get money to workers, the Republicans who wrote it could have just given money to workers. Instead, they poured most of the money into permanent tax relief for corporations and wealthy heirs, while the relief for the middle class was much more modest and temporary.\n\nThose bonuses, of course, will also be temporary, but they gave employers an opportunity to play their beneficent roles in Trump\u2019s economic theater. With great fanfare, AT&T attributed its $1000 employee bonuses to the tax cuts, even though it had been discussing them with its unions for months, then unveiled major layoffs with no fanfare. Wal-Mart paired a $300 million wage increase for its workers with a $4 billion stock buyback for its investors, while also shuttering stores and firing workers. Kimberly-Clark, abandoning the Trump script, actually announced that it would use its tax-cut windfall to shut down factories and lay off 5,000 workers. One consulting firm surveyed 333 large employers about what they planned to do with their tax cuts, and only 7 percent said they were planning any kind of wage increase.\n\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of Trump\u2019s early days in office, when he kept touting big expansion plans from companies like Charter Communications, General Motors, and Intel that had been in the works long before he arrived in Washington. Or his post-election public-relations coup when he supposedly saved the jobs at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis from relocating to Mexico; that factory announced 300 layoffs in July and another 200 this month. Obviously, Carrier didn\u2019t fit last night\u2019s New American Moment theme\u2014the Democratic group American Bridge ran digital ads featuring angry Carrier workers accusing Trump of betraying them during the speech\u2014so Trump bragged about Apple instead, crediting its new $350 billion investment strategy to his tax cuts, even though the company has not.\n\nIt must be said that Trump misleading his audience about the economy was not exactly playing against type. What seemed unusual last night was Trump boring his audience about the economy. Whatever you thought of his muscular economic nationalism on the campaign trail, with his fiery rants about the nefariousness of China and Mexico and the stupidity of U.S. negotiators, he always put on a good and original show. Last night, most of the policy statements he read off the TelePromter were studiously bland and content-free politician-talk: \u201cFrom now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and reciprocal.\u201d Or: \u201cI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\u201d Perhaps he paid his speechwriters by the clich\u00e9.\n\nIn fairness, it\u2019s hard to craft an original or indelible State of the Union address. Obama\u2019s annual exhortations about \u201cwinning the future\u201d or \u201can economy built to last\u201d were pretty forgettable, too; the most memorable line in an Obama speech to Congress was \u201cYou lie!\u201d\u2014and it wasn\u2019t his. The public quickly forgot the promises Trump made about the economy last year, and last night\u2019s promises probably won\u2019t matter much, either.\n\n But Trump has committed pretty ferociously to his heroic narrative of resurrection. If the stock market or the labor market ever departs too dramatically from that narrative, if the rest of the economy follows the path of Harley-Davidson\u2014well, that might matter.", "link": null, "source": "Politico", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachael Bade", "body": "Minutes into Donald Trump\u2019s renegade embrace of the left\u2019s wish list for gun control, Republican Rep.

The GOP has its rifts on hot-button issues like immigration and health care. But its devotion to expansive gun rights has been close to absolute. As Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) put it, \u201cEveryone says it\u2019s the NRA\" that explains the GOP's devotion to the cause. \"No. It\u2019s your constituents.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle\n                                A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Steve Daines (R-Mont.), a staunch gun rights advocate. \n\n\"When it comes down to it, his administration will have a problem,\u201d Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said of Trump\u2019s call to increase the age for some firearm purchases or to seize weapons in some cases without a court order.\n\nBut Trump is still president. So they were more prone to rationalize or explain away his apparent openness to an assault weapons ban and more background checks \u2014 among other items on gun control advocates\u2019 policy menu \u2014 than to go after him directly.\n\nMaybe Trump didn\u2019t mean what he said, some of them said, or perhaps was misunderstood. Others held out that he would come to his senses and quickly end his flirtation with Democrats.\n\n\u201cThat was yesterday. This is today,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a state that overwhelmingly supported Trump.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have somebody wanting to take away life, liberty or property without due process, that is a concern,\u201d added Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). \u201cI would like to figure out what he meant.\u201d\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much thought he put into what he actually was saying, in terms of the details of it,\u201d offered Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) \n\nRepublicans have adopted a strategy of not necessarily taking what Trump says in showman mode at face value. Meeting with Democrats and Republicans at the White House in January, he talked up liberal immigration proposals only to later backpedal when conservatives howled. \n\nIt doesn't do much good, Republicans reason, to attack the leader of their party over a position he may not hold for more than a couple days. \n\nAnd practically speaking, it will be nearly impossible for Congress to pass much more than a bill to improve background checks, given the hardened GOP opposition. Even a modest background checks bill is being held up by Lee and other like-minded conservatives, who say it would trample the due process rights of veterans. \n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has balked at a guns debate in the immediate aftermath of the massacre of 17 people in Florida, a delay that could sap the energy of gun control activists. \n\n\u201cIf he embraces some of the things he talked about yesterday, a lot of folks up here on our side are not going to be for some of that stuff,\u201d Thune said of Trump\u2019s gun push. \n\nWhile Republicans think it\u2019s important to discourage the president from upsetting his rural, gun-loving base, most have taken to privately registering those feelings of discomfort with the White House rather than dressing down the president publicly. It's courtesy they never extended to President Barack Obama after his calls for tougher background checks. \n\nInstead, most Republicans spent Thursday highlighting the problems with Trump\u2019s seeming support for proposals advocated by the likes of Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that due process means that you get a lawyer, a trial, a hearing, an impartial court making a decision before any of your rights taken away,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of Trump's call to \"take the gun first, go through due process second.\"\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) similarly shied away from criticizing Trump personally, while firmly rejecting the bulk of the ideas the president floated Wednesday. Jordan emphasized similarities with Trump\u2019s viewpoints on arming teachers, and turned his criticisms toward Democrats instead of the White House.\n\n\u201cOn the most fundamental level in Florida we had the most systemic failure of government to deal with this bad guy, and now we\u2019re supposed to say the answer is more government?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe premise that so many on the left have \u2014 so many Democrats \u2014 I just don\u2019t buy into that premise.\u201d\n\nBut didn\u2019t Trump buy that premise?: \u201cAll I know is the answer is not more government,\u201d Jordan replied. \n\nThere\u2019s a smaller faction of Capitol Hill Republicans who\u2019ve attacked the president personally on guns. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who leads the House\u2019s gun caucus, tweeted Thursday that \u201clike liberals, @realDonaldTrump mentions Columbine, Pulse, Sandy Hook to motivate gun control, but totally ignores how guns were acquired: columbine: straw purchases, pulse: registered security guard, sandy hook: stolen. DISGRACEFUL!\u201d\n\nThere were a few Republicans who applauded Trump. They included Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who are pushing proposals to raise the age limit for buying some rifles and to enforce background checks for Internet and gun show sales. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\u201cHe was enthusiastic about it,\u201d beamed Toomey after Trump lavished praise on his background checks plan. \n\nThe pair of GOP senators and some Democrats, meanwhile, held out hope that perhaps Trump could finally break the entrenched politics of gun control by getting behind \"common sense\" regulations. It's one thing for a Democratic president calls for stricter gun rules; it's a different equation when a pro-NRA Republican president does so.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one concerned about Donald Trump taking their Second Amendment rights away,\u201d Manchin said. \n\nThat still might be wishful thinking. Senators said Trump would struggle to move all but a handful of Republicans in the Senate. And in the more conservative House, prospects for new gun laws look even bleaker.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no changing minds,\u201d said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). \n\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Britain was due to take over responsibility for providing the battle-ready force in the second six months of 2019, during the Brexit transition period.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s decision to withdraw from the roster of EU countries offering to lead battlegroups is likely to spark concern on the Continent that London\u2019s commitment to European security is now also uncertain,\u00a0despite May\u2019s repeated reassurance that this is not the case.\n\n\u2018Clarity of purpose\u2019\nIn the letter informing Brussels of the U.K.\u2019s decision, Britain\u2019s Lieutenant General George Norton said the decision to withdraw from the program was because of the logistical problems caused by Brexit, and insisted\u00a0Britain could still remain part of the program further down the line if a political agreement could be struck.\n\nWriting to General\u00a0Mikhail Kostarakos, chairman of the EU military committee, Norton said the U.K. is prepared to offer a battlegroup for the EU rota in future once the Brexit uncertainty had been cleared.\u00a0He added the U.K.\u2019s offer had always been \u201cprovisional.\u201d\n\nNorton said that while Britain\u2019s withdrawal had been under discussion since September last year, it was important to clarify the decision to give the EU time to prepare.\n\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Greece are the only other countries with national headquarters having sufficient capacity to command a European operation.\n\n\u201cMilitary activities, however, require clarity of purpose, and planning; not least of which involves the time that is necessary to force generate credible capabilities,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe U.K. believes that, for the practical purposes of the time needed for the EU and member states to identify and assign a stand-by battlegroup for the second half of 2019, a decision should not be delayed. Consequently we formally withdraw our provisional offer of a battlegroup for the period 2019-20.\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on: \u201cOur prime minister\u2019s unconditional commitment to European security of course stands, but the offer of a battlegroup in the period immediately following our exit strikes us an unnecessary complication.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment before this article was published.\n\nAny decision to deploy the battlegroup would be made by EU leaders at the European Council, which Britain will leave in March 2019. However, all lead battlegroup countries retain a veto over deployment.\n\nThe U.K. is one of only a handful of EU countries capable of providing battlegroup headquarters.\n\nBritain also currently leads the EU\u2019s counter-piracy mission \u201cAtlanta\u201d off the coast of Somalia, commanding the operation out of Northwood military headquarters in Hertfordshire.\n\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Greece are the only other countries with national headquarters having sufficient capacity to command a European operation.\u00a0The U.K., for example, is providing the headquarters for a Dutch/Belgian battlegroup in 2018.\n\nLondon also plays an important role in Operation Sophia \u2014 the counter-smuggling operation in the Mediterranean that is commanded from Italian national headquarters \u2014 as well as stationing troops in Estonia to act as a deterrent to any military action by Russia.\n\nWhether Britain continues its involvement in the EU battlegroup program after Brexit will depend on whether the U.K. can negotiate more involvement in decision-making and control of missions than is normally offered to third countries, U.K. officials said.\u00a0If this proves impossible, officials say it is unlikely Britain will continue to take part in EU missions in the  stories on these topics:", "link": null, "source": "Politico - EU", "location": []}, {"author": "Burgess Everett", "body": "Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n        \n    \n            \n                \n                    Republicans throw in the towel on Obamacare\n                        \n\n                \n                        Most GOP lawmakers aren\u2019t interested in another failed effort to repeal the health law in an election year.\n                \n            \n    \n                \n                \n            \n        \n            By BURGESS EVERETT\n    02/01/2018 11:45 AM EST\n                    \n\n        \nWHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. \u2014 Republicans are giving up on their years-long dream of repealing Obamacare. \n Though the GOP still controls both chambers of Congress and maintains the ability to jam through a repeal-and-replace bill via a simple majority, there are no discussions of doing so here at House and Senate Republicans\u2019 joint retreat at The Greenbrier resort. Republicans doubt they can even pass a budget providing for the powerful party-line \u201creconciliation\u201d procedure used to pass tax reform last year, much less take on the politically perilous task of rewriting health care laws in an election year.Story Continued Below\n\n   \u201cI don\u2019t think leadership wants to,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who worked with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on a last-ditch repeal effort last fall. \u201cIn the sense of Graham-Cassidy, a partisan exercise? Doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d \n Republicans' decision to abstain from another attempt at gutting Barack Obama\u2019s health law \u2014 at least this year \u2014 goes back on a pledge the party has made to voters since 2010. And it underscores how Republicans overpromised in their ability to reform the nation\u2019s health care and never fully recognized how divided the party is over key Obamacare planks like protecting pre-existing conditions and preserving the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \n And now the GOP is facing reality. Senate Republicans would struggle to pass a bill slashing at Obamacare under the best circumstances this year. They lost a Senate seat in Alabama in December and are down another vote as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) undergoes cancer treatment. GOP leaders would rather put the debacle of last year\u2019s failed attempt behind them. \n \u201cIt would be a heavy lift. I think everybody knows,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 GOP leader. \u201cWe sort of tested the limits of what we can do in the Senate last year. And we\u2019re one vote down from where we were then.\u201d \n Republicans very well may lose the House or Senate this fall, which would officially stick a fork in their efforts to move a partisan agenda item like Obamacare repeal while President Donald Trump is in office. But there appears to be no urgency to capitalize on unified Republican control: None of the lawmakers interviewed for this story believe that Congress will pass a budget this year that would allow Republicans to use reconciliation to evade the Senate\u2019s supermajority requirements. \n And rather than make a major play to the frustrated conservative base on health care, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has charted a bipartisan approach in his comments when asked about the matter. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a budget. And without a budget I don\u2019t think we can do reconciliation,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). \u201cWhen you hear the leader speak, he\u2019s speaking about bipartisanship. So I think that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going to go in this year.\u201d \n The news is not being taken well in some corners of the party. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, winced when reminded of the party\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare and the lack of formal discussion on undermining the law at the retreat. \n Yet he was hopeful that Republicans can pick up Senate seats in November and try again with a bigger Senate majority. \n \u201cDo I see a full repeal of Obamacare happening on a reconciliation vehicle this year? No. And to suggest otherwise would be to ignore 51 votes in the Senate,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cIf we keep the majority in the House and they get a larger majority in the Senate then you might look at a reconciliation vehicle after November.\u201d \n Republicans took some heart in having recently passed laws that repealed Obamacare's individual mandate and delayed some Obamacare taxes. And most GOP lawmakers said that they believed those provisions are as far as they can go given the political constraints and the ugly nature of last year\u2019s attempt, including a failed Senate vote and months of party infighting. \n But Graham, for one, is not willing to give up. After a herculean, if failed, effort in September to push legislation repealing Obamacare and block granting federal health care funds to the states, Graham said the GOP will be savaged by its voters if it tries to give up on fully scuttling the law. \n \"We're coming back at it. Republicans have no choice but to try to replace Obamacare after repealing the individual mandate,\" he said, citing an obligation to GOP voters to try again. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not giving up without a fight. And to any Republican who thinks you can avoid the consequences of Obamacare collapsing, you're kidding yourself.\" \n Asked about Graham\u2019s latest push, Thune responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll believe it when we see it.\u201d \n \u201cIf he\u2019s got 50 for it, more power [to him],\u201d Thune said. \u201cThe leader\u2019s not going to bring that up if he can\u2019t get it through.\u201d \n In the meantime, some members of both parties are pushing bills to help stabilize the insurance markets, hoping to bring down premiums after Trump eliminated key payments to health insurers. But even that effort has flagged in recent weeks as conservatives have fought any effort seen as propping up Obamacare, most notably the stabilization bill written by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.). \n \u201cIt\u2019s on the backburner too,\u201d Capito said. Altering Obamacare is \"still being looked at. But not with the intensity it was.\"\nJennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), was joined by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) in requesting that DOJ name a special prosecutor to zero in on possible mishandling of the FBI's Russia investigation prior to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Specifically, the quartet raised concerns about the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier of verified and unverified intelligence alleging a Russian effort to compromise now-President Donald Trump.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n Grassley and Graham, who previously requested that the DOJ open a criminal probe of Steele's conduct, on Feb. 28 asked DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz to probe the department's handling of investigations into Trump transition or campaign officials, as well as the Trump administration before Mueller's appointment. Horowitz has been investigating possible DOJ misconduct related to the Hillary Clinton email investigation since early 2017.\n\nThe Republican senators noted in their Thursday letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that under current law, \"the Inspector General does not have the tools that a prosecutor would to gather all the facts, such as the ability to obtain testimony from essential witnesses who are not current DOJ employees.\"\n\n\"Thus, we believe that a special counsel is needed to work with the Inspector General to independently gather the facts and make prosecutorial decisions, if any are merited,\" the Republicans continued. \"The Justice Department cannot credibly investigate itself without these enhanced measures of independence to ensure that the public can have confidence in the outcome.\"\n\nSessions is currently weighing whether to heed an internal recommendation to terminate Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director whom House Republicans say testified in December that a warrant to monitor former Trump campaign aide Carter Page would not have been sought without the Steele dossier. (House Democrats have disputed that characterization of McCabe's testimony.) \n\nIf McCabe is not fired, he is scheduled to retire from DOJ on Sunday. Another central player in the dossier timeline is Bruce Ohr, who was recently demoted from a top DOJ post. \n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

The Government Accountability Office late last month added the clearance process to its high-risk list of \u201cfederal areas in need of either broad-based transformation or specific reforms to prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\u201d\nSenate Democrats wrote a letter last week asking for an investigation of security clearance procedures under President Donald Trump. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is reportedly still working with an interim clearance.\n\u201cTo have so many, dozens of people who are on an interim clearance over an extended period of time that are certainly viewing and considering classified material is a problem,\u201d Flake said. \u201cThis current situation shouldn\u2019t continue.\u201d\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nQuestions have also been raised about former White House aide Rob Porter, who resigned last week after news broke of allegations by his ex-wives of domestic abuse. Reports indicate he was granted an interim clearance.\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney (R-N.Y.), on ABC's \"This Week,\" expressed worry that Porter was allowed to see classified documents even though he had been denied a full security clearance.\n\"The idea that someone without a security clearance was allowed to be there in the first place, despite these allegations, and was allowed to stay there with no plan for getting him a clearance, is not the normal process,\" Maloney said.\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?

The bill, which has been drafted already, will end freedom of movement, impose new national laws on immigration and allow the U.K. to crack down on fraudulent use of European ID cards.\n\nAssuming there is a Brexit deal this year, the changes will not come into effect until the end of a post-Brexit transition period \u2014 which will finish most likely in December 2020.\n\nBorder control check point in Portsmouth, England | Matt Cardy/Getty Images\n\n\nAccording to one U.K. official familiar with the progress of the bill, Rudd was called to a meeting of the parliamentary business and legislation committee (PBL) on February 27 to provide an update on the progress of the bill. If no deal can be reached with the EU, the U.K. would crash out on March\u00a029, 2019 without a transition period, so the new immigration system would need to be in place much earlier than expected.\n\nThe delay to the immigration bill being brought before parliament until late this year or even early 2019 \u2014 leaving a matter of just a few months to get the bill onto the statute book \u2014 is having a knock-on effect on the crucial \u201caccess to benefits bill\u201d which had been pencilled in to be published in the spring after the EU summit later this month.\n\nThe benefits bill, which has been drafted for publication by David Gauke\u2019s Department for Work and Pensions, will need to be rewritten if the immigration bill is not introduced at the same time. Without the immigration bill, new clauses will be needed to deal with the entitlement to benefits of EU citizens in the U.K. after Brexit, which should have been covered by the Home Office legislation.\n\n\u201cThe point we are at now is we are expecting a note on why the Home Office does not think the bill is needed now,\u201d said one official from the committee.\n\nThe committee expects the note to set out how the Home Office is preparing for a no deal without an immigration bill given that the U.K.\u2019s official leaving date is now just over 21 months away. Rudd has already written to the Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom to set out her plans.\n\nAccording to the official who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity, Rudd wants three non-Brexit bills brought before MPs before the immigration bill.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about this. There are a few ministers who have concerns about it\u201d \u2014 Senior government official\n\nSome Brexiteer ministers are concerned that Rudd is delaying in an attempt to scupper preparations for no deal \u2014 something they regard as key to bolstering the U.K.\u2019s negotiating position. Rudd supported Remain in the referendum.\n\nOne minister, who confirmed the delay to the immigration bill, said there was widespread frustration at the home secretary. Williamson, the defense secretary, for example, is angry at the uncertainty faced by servicemen and women whose partners are from outside the U.K. and are waiting to see what system will be put in place after Brexit, although like other EU citizens they are covered by the agreement reached with the EU on citizens\u2019 rights in December.\n\nA senior government official said: \u201cThere has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about this. There are a few ministers who have concerns about it. Gavin is keen that there is clarity on this issue for servicemen and women and their families.\u201d\n\nMinisters believe the benefits bill may have to be changed to accommodate for the lack of an immigration bill, opening up the possibility of hostile amendments between the government and opposition \u2014 further complicating the government\u2019s plans.\n\nBritain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May | Frank Augstein/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\u201cThe Home Office believes it\u2019s too difficult so doesn\u2019t want to bring it forward,\u201d said one official. \u201cBut it will always be difficult. It needs to be in place in case we can\u2019t get a deal.\u201d\n\nThe FT reported last month that the delay to the government\u2019s immigration bill was to allow the Home Office to take in the conclusions of the Migration Advisory Committee\u2019s inquiry into the costs and benefits of European migrants to the U.K. economy, due to be announced in September.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \u201cWe are confident that our immigration systems will be ready for Brexit and have been working to develop the details of the settlement scheme for the\u00a0three million EU citizens already in the U.K. \u2014 as well as the registration of new EU arrivals after March 2019.\n\n\u201cWe will publish further details of this over the coming months, but the Government is currently\u00a0focused on successfully negotiating the terms of the Implementation Period with the EU.\u00a0The Immigration Bill will be introduced when Parliamentary time allows,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThis article has been updated with a response from the Home  stories on these topics:", "link": null, "source": "Politico - EU", "location": []}, {"author": "Kyle Cheney", "body": "Mistrust, anger and charges of skullduggery between Democrats and Republicans have hobbled the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia investigation for months. \n\nHope Hicks and a pair of frustrated senators may have finally broken it.\nStory Continued Below\n\n\n There are new signs that Republicans may soon conclude a probe that Democrats call far from complete following Wednesday\u2019s testimony by Trump\u2019s confidante, Hicks. Leaks revealed that Hicks had admitted to sometimes telling white lies on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2014 a fact that Republicans called an unfair distortion of the departing White House communications director\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe next day, House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office confirmed that the top two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee paid an extraordinary visit to Ryan to express their \u201cconcerns\u201d about how the House panel is operating \u2014 and, according to one report, to accuse Republicans of their own dishonest leaking.\n\n\"I want [the House investigation] to end because we have gone off the rails of being able to objectively do our job,\" Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) said Friday. Rooney said that other GOP committee members agree with him, though he did not name them.\n\nThe partial leak of Hicks\u2019s testimony \u201cwas the tipping point for me,\u201d Rooney said, adding he had \u201cfinally come to the realization that we are not going to put together any kind of a bipartisan product that\u2019s going to help the national security apparatus we oversee or to find out objectively what happened in the last election.\"\n\nRooney has urged the panel's lead investigator, Mike Conaway (R-Texas), to shut down the probe, which another GOP committee member describes as \u201cnearly\u201d complete. But Democrats insist that dozens more witnesses must testify, including several top Trump associates such as the president\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    The most reliable politics newsletter.\n                                Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n                            By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It also escalates pressure on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has largely operated free of political drama, to serve as Congress' definitive assessment of the Russian plot.\n\nAt the same time, it underscores the fact that Capitol Hill is largely relying on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal investigation to produce the most meaningful account of Russian interference \u2014 and whether any Trump associates or other Americans conspired to assist the Kremlin.\n\nThe committee itself is facing an existential crisis of sorts. Members of both parties worry that the acrimony and charges of leaks will deter witnesses from cooperating \u2014 and could even scare U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies from sharing information.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan has largely taken a hands-off approach, meanwhile, deferring to committee leaders to resolve confrontations with the FBI and, more recently, with the Senate. \n\nThe day after Hicks testified, Ryan's office revealed that the top Senate Intelligence Committee members, Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), had met with him to discuss unspecified \u201cconcerns\u201d about the House panel\u2019s handling of the investigation.\n\nThe discussion, first revealed by The New York Times, came soon after a set of Warner's text messages that had recently been supplied to the panel were leaked to Fox News, which cited a \"Republican source\" for providing the messages. Ryan, according to a spokeswoman, told the two of them to work it out with Schiff and the committee's chairman, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).\n\nFor now, Conaway says he has no imminent plans to end the investigation until all leads have been explored. But he's expressed hope that the end is near, despite Democrats' protestations.\n\nOther GOP members of the panel increasingly say they\u2019re satisfied with the probe\u2019s thoroughness and expect it to wrap up soon. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) has said he hoped the Hicks interview, following closely on a limited interview of former Trump aide Steve Bannon, might be the panel\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cThe Intelligence Committee should continue our investigation until we have completed our work, which we nearly have,\u201d added Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah).\n\nAfter the leaks about Hick\u2019s testimony, even the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, chided colleagues for the disclosures amid a creeping realization that the GOP appears to be preparing to pull the plug: \"I think it was unfair to Hope Hicks that conversations, as part of her testimony were leaked out of the committee,\" Schiff said on CNN Thursday. \n\nAmid the anticipation of a GOP push to wind down the probe, Schiff also released a list of Democrats\u2019 outstanding requests for subpoenas that Republicans have failed to grant. He accused GOP members of constructing the fa\u00e7ade of a thorough probe but allowing recalcitrant witnesses to avoid answering central questions and refusing to deploy the committee\u2019s vast subpoena power to compel crucial information. \n\nSchiff said the committee failed to exercise this power despite unanswered questions from figures like Hicks, Donald Trump Jr. and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. He noted that Republicans never even attempted to broach potential financial ties between Trump associate and Russian interests. \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \nEven a rare moment of bipartisan agreement has yielded nothing: After former Trump aide Steve Bannon refused in two recent interviews to answer questions about his post-campaign work for Trump on the grounds that it was covered by executive privilege, the committee voted to subpoena him. \n\nBut Bannon has held his ground \u2014 and so far, committee Republicans have not followed through on threats to hold him in contempt of Congress. \n\nConaway said Thursday the matter is still under review and he expects to discuss it with Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nSidelining the committee further has been the increasingly aggressive parallel probe driven by the committee's chairman, Nunes, into what he alleges are a series of abuses by Obama administration appointees in the Justice and State Departments aimed at the Trump campaign in 2016. \n\nNunes removed himself from the committee's Russia probe nearly a year ago, after a controversial late-night visit to the White House to examine classified documents, about which he later briefed Trump. Since December, he has aggressively sought to change the narrative of the Russia investigation by spotlighting alleged wrongdoing on the part of senior Justice Department and FBI officials. \n\nThe committee was thrown into turmoil last month after Nunes orchestrated the public release \u2014 with Trump\u2019s approval \u2014 of a classified memo alleging anti-Trump bias on the part of FBI and Justice Department officials. Democrats called it a cynical and misleading attempt to protect Trump and issued a strong rebuttal.\n\nRooney is one of four Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee who are quitting Congress at the end of the year. He told POLITICO that his departure isn\u2019t related to his frustration with the panel \u2014 but that he isn\u2019t sorry to be leaving it, either. \n\nHe noted that as many as 70 of his colleagues were on a waiting list to fill opening slots in the next Congress.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some members that wish they were part of this,\" he said. \"Not me.\n\n\n        \n            This article tagged under:\n                        \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n         \n            \n                Missing out on the latest scoops?
