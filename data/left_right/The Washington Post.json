They remain critically ill. \n Trump told reporters that he had offered his well wishes on Putin\u2019s new six-year term during a conversation on a range of topics, including arms control and the security situations in Syria and North Korea. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Skripal\u2019s case was not discussed. Information on Syria and North Korea were also provided to the president in writing before the call, officials said.\n    In this file photo taken on Friday, July 7, 2017, President Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany. (Evan Vucci/AP) \n \u201cWe\u2019ll probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future,\u201d Trump said of Putin, though Sanders emphasized that nothing was planned.\n  [Trump congratulates Putin on reelection, discusses \u2018arms race\u2019] \n The White House press office declined to comment on the briefing materials given to Trump. Two people familiar with the notecards acknowledged that they included instructions not to congratulate Putin. But a senior White House official emphasized that national security adviser H.R. McMaster did not mention the issue during a telephone briefing with the president, who was in the White House residence ahead of and during his conversation with Putin. \n  It was not clear whether Trump read the notes, administration officials said. Trump, who initiated the call, opened it with the congratulations for Putin, one person familiar with the conversation said. \n The president\u2019s tone drew a rebuke from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election.\u201d\n But Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appeared less concerned, noting Trump has also offered congratulations to other leaders of more totalitarian states. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read much into it,\u201d Corker said. \n Putin\u2019s latest consolidation of power came in what foreign policy analysts said was a rigged election in which he got 76 percent of the vote against several minor candidates. Some world leaders have hesitated to congratulate Putin, since his reelection occurred in an environment of state control of much of the news media and with his most prominent opponent barred from the ballot.\n   \n  While Russian President Vladimir Putin was reelected in a landslide victory on March 18, videos emerged of alleged ballot-stuffing at polling stations across Russia. (The Washington Post) \n \n Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s phone call, national security aides provided Trump with several handwritten notecards filled with talking points to guide his conversation, as is customary for calls with foreign leaders, according to the officials with knowledge of the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n The notecards are similar to the one Trump was photographed clutching during a White House meeting with students and parents after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., officials said.\n  [The Fix: This photo of Trump\u2019s notes captures his empathy deficit better than anything] \n Trump\u2019s failure to raise Moscow\u2019s alleged poisoning of the former Russian spy in Britain risked angering officials in London, who are trying to rally Britain\u2019s closest allies to condemn the attack. Russia has denied involvement in the March 4 poisoning, but the attack has badly damaged British-Russian relations and British Prime Minister Theresa May last week announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation.\n Putin denied that Russia had any role and called the claim \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n Asked about McCain\u2019s criticism, Sanders noted that the leaders of France and Germany also called Putin this week and pointed to former president Barack Obama, who congratulated Putin on an election victory in 2012.\n  \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear in the actions that we\u2019ve taken that we\u2019re going to be tough on Russia, particularly when it comes to areas that we feel where they\u2019ve stepped out of place,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve placed tough sanctions on Russia and a number of other things where we have shown exactly what our position is.\u201d\n She emphasized, however, that Trump is determined to establish a working relationship with Putin to tackle global challenges, including confronting North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. \n  Asked whether the Trump administration believes Russia conducted a \u201cfree and fair\u201d election, Sanders said the administration is focused on U.S. elections.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t get to dictate how other countries operate,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that\u2019s not something that we can dictate to them how they operate.\u201d\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also distanced himself Tuesday from Trump\u2019s congratulatory remarks. \n \u201cThe president can call whomever he chooses,\u201d McConnell said at his weekly news conference Tuesday. \u201cWhen I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results. I\u2019m always reminded of the election they used to have in almost every communist country where whoever the dictator was at the moment always got huge percentage of the vote.\u201d\n  Trump has largely refrained from criticizing Putin amid the ongoing investigation into the 2016 election meddling by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who in February indicted 13 Russian nationals on conspiracy charges. His tone has at times been at odds with his administration, which has taken stronger actions to counter Russian aggression, including Trump\u2019s authorization of new sanctions against Russia and additional support Ukrainian troops in their fight against Russian-backed forces in Crimea.\n  [Video: Trump discusses call with Putin] \n  \u201cIt\u2019s blatantly obvious that he has just an inexplicable level of support for President Putin,\u201d said Julie Smith, a European security expert who served as deputy national security adviser for former vice president Joe Biden. \u201cYou keep thinking it will change as he sees his own administration take action \u2014 that this never-ending well of support for Putin will some how subside. It\u2019s disheartening at a time when our trans-Atlantic partners really need a boost. Europe is looking to us for leadership on Russia in particular and they\u2019re not getting it.\u201d\n  Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, said Trump\u2019s actions were \u201ca sign he wants a pro-Russia foreign policy,\u201d which conflicts with the harder line from his administration.\n \u201cEveryone is trying to figure out what does this mean,\u201d Wright said. \u201cRussia hawks say, pay attention to us, but not to the president or to the tweets. But the reality is, his reaction is policy. The fact that there hasn\u2019t been a stronger sanctions response to the poisoning so far is policy.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s applause of Putin\u2019s victory was in line with other congratulatory calls he has made, including to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for winning a much-disputed referendum that increased his already autocratic powers and to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping for his \u201cextraordinary elevation\u201d after Xi last month engineered the Communist Party\u2019s elimination of presidential term limits.\n \u201cI think it\u2019s great. Maybe we\u2019ll have to give that a shot some day,\u201d Trump said in a closed-door speech to Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida several weeks ago, a recording of which was obtained by CNN.\n  \n  \nKaren DeYoung, John Hudson and Jenna Johnson in Washington, and Anton Troianovski in Moscow, contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "George F. Will", "body": "Newly named national security adviser John Bolton. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) \n   \n  Because John Bolton is five things President Trump is not \u2014 intelligent, educated, principled, articulate and experienced \u2014 and because of Bolton\u2019s West Wing proximity to a president responsive to the most recent thought he has heard emanating from cable television or an employee, Bolton will soon be the second-most dangerous American. On April 9, he will be the first national security adviser who, upon taking up residence down the hall from the Oval Office, will be suggesting that the United States should seriously consider embarking on war crimes. \n The first two charges against the major Nazi war criminals in the 1945-1946 Nuremberg trials concerned waging aggressive war. Emboldened by the success, as he still sees it, of America\u2019s Iraq adventure that began 15 years ago this month, Bolton, for whom a trade war with many friends and foes is insufficiently stimulating, favors real wars against North Korea and Iran. Both have odious regimes, but neither can credibly be said to be threatening an imminent attack against the United States. Nevertheless, Bolton thinks bombing both might make the world safer. What could go wrong?\n Much is made of the fact that Bolton is implacably hostile to strongman Vladimir Putin, whom the U.S. president, a weak person\u2019s idea of a strong person, admires. And of the fact that the president has repeatedly execrated the invasion of Iraq that Bolton advocated. So, today among the uneducable, furrowed brows express puzzlement: How can the president square his convictions with Bolton\u2019s? Let\u2019s say this one more time: Trump. Has. No. Convictions. \n Even this scatterbrain\u2019s Swiss cheese-style tariffs are too sloppy to reflect forethought. He has sentiments, and visceral reactions to which he is attentive. But to speak of, say, a sincere sofa is to commit what philosophers call a \u201ccategory mistake\u201d \u2014 sofas are incapable of sincerity \u2014 and to speak of this president\u2019s convictions (or plans, or policies) about this or that is a category mistake. \n It is frequently said that the decision to invade Iraq was the worst U.S. foreign policy decision since Vietnam. Actually, it was worse than Vietnam, and the worst in American history, for two reasons. One is that so far we probably have paid no more that 20\u00a0percent of the eventual costs of that decision that enhanced Iran\u2019s ascendancy. The other reason is that America gradually waded waist deep into Vietnam without a crossing-the-Rubicon moment \u2014 a single clear, dispositive decision. In contrast, the protracted preparation for invading Iraq was deliberative and methodical. It is not true that, as the current president and the virulent left insist, President George W. Bush and his senior advisers \u201clied\u201d about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. They simply got things wrong, which conservatives, especially, understand was an event not without precedent in the annals of government. \n For the first time since World War II, when the mobilization of U.S. industrial might propelled this nation to the top rank among world powers, the American president is no longer the world\u2019s most powerful person. The president of China is, partly because of the U.S. president\u2019s abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without an alternative trade policy. Power is the ability to achieve intended effects. Randomly smashing crockery does not count. The current president resembles Winston Churchill\u2019s description of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles \u2014 \u201cthe only bull I know who carries his china closet with him.\u201d \n Like the Obama administration, whose Iran policy he robustly ridicules, Bolton seems to believe that the United States has the power to determine who can and cannot acquire nuclear weapons. Pakistan, which had a per capita income of $470 when it acquired nuclear weapons 20 years ago (China\u2019s per capita income was $85.50 when it acquired them in 1964), demonstrated that almost any nation determined to become a nuclear power can do so. \n Bolton\u2019s belief in the U.S. power to make the world behave and eat its broccoli reflects what has been called \u201cnarcissistic policy disorder\u201d \u2014 the belief that whatever happens in the world happens because of something the United States did or did not do. This is a recipe for diplomatic delusions and military overreaching.\n Speaking of delusions, one died last week \u2014 the belief that this president could be safely cocooned within layers of adult supervision. Bolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R. McMaster, wrote a brilliant book (\u201cDereliction of Duty\u201d) on the failure of officials, particularly military leaders, who knew better but did not resist the stumble into the Vietnam disaster.

To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren\u2019t picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.\u201d\n \u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the burden \u2014 continuing on as a representative of the agency and charged with upholding integrity, knowing that information was false,\u201d he told CNN.\n ICE could not immediately be reached for comment by The Post regarding Schwab\u2019s assertions that it had released false and misleading information. The Chronicle quoted unnamed ICE officials confirming Schwab\u2019s resignation but declining to discuss specifics, citing confidentiality for personnel matters. A Justice Department spokesperson could not immediately be reached.\n According to ICE, of the 232 people picked up in the raid, 115, or roughly half, had felonies or misdemeanors on their records.\n When Schwab insisted on setting the record straight and correcting the idea that hundreds of dangerous criminals got away, he said ICE officials told him to direct reporters to statements ICE or Homan had already made.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the job of a public affairs officer to offer transparency for the agency you work for,\u201d he told the Chronicle. \u201cI felt like we weren\u2019t doing that.

Trump was awestruck by the tableau of uniformed French troops marching down Avenue des Champs-Elysees with military tanks, armored vehicles, gun trucks and carriers \u2014 complete with F-16 fighter jets flying over the Arc de Triomphe and painting the sky with streaks of blue, white and red smoke for the colors of the French flag.

Officials are weighing weather patterns as well as competing events, such as the massive annual Independence Day celebration on the Mall. Trump officials had discussed Memorial Day on May 28, and July 4, but the Pentagon prefers Veterans Day on Nov. 11 \u2014 in part because it would coincide with 100th anniversary of the victorious end of World War I and therefore be less associated with the president and politics. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone is hoping,\u201d said the military official. It is unclear what role Trump would play, whether he may perhaps serve as a grandmaster or observe the spectacle from a reviewing stand.

Bush\u2019s 1991 parade down Constitution Avenue celebrating victory in the Persian Gulf War \u2014 presidents have avoided displays of military hardware that are more associated in the American mind with the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Square celebrations or, more recently, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s efforts to show off his Taepodong missiles. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lack of love and respect for our armed forces in the United States,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cWhat are they going to do, stand there while Donald Trump waves at them? It smacks of something you see in a totalitarian country \u2014 unless there\u2019s a genuine, earnest reason to be doing it.\u201d The White House official rejected the suggestion that some associate a military parade with strongmen, saying it would be a \u201ccelebration of the men and women who give us freedom.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of a totalitarian government,\u201d the official said.

(Doug Mills/AP)  Weaponry on the streets of Washington is not unheard of. President Truman and President Kennedy had military equipment during their inaugural parades, in 1949 and 1963 respectively, during key junctures in the Cold War, said Michael Beschloss, another presidential historian. \u201cSet against the backdrop of American history, it does seem to hark back to the harsh days of the Cold War,\u201d Beschloss said. \u201cThose parades were a counterpoint to the parades in front of Lenin\u2019s tomb at Red Square .\u2009.\u2009. One reason the Soviets had those parades was to distract the world from the fact that the Soviet military was actually much weaker than the Soviets were claiming.\u201d But generally, the United States has shied away from parading its military assets, calculating that doing so was not necessary for the world\u2019s preeminent superpower. There is no law or regulations preventing Trump from putting on a military parade, but there are plenty of potential complications that military leaders are likely to raise with the president. One worry is practical: that 70-ton tanks built for the battlefield would chew up Pennsylvania Avenue blacktop.  The military might also want to weigh in on the kind of equipment on parade. One concern is that big displays of missile launchers might evoke Pyongyang-style nationalism more than American patriotism.  [Military leaders consolidate power in Trump administration]  A parade would likely be interpreted as another stroke of nuclear gamesmanship. Tensions between North Korea and the United States have risen over the past year as Trump and Kim have taunted each other with playground nicknames and threats.  After Kim warned last month that he had a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk, Trump replied: \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger  more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d The White House official said a parade would have nothing to do with Trump\u2019s feuds with Kim, but would be designed as a broad show of strength to send a warning to all of America\u2019s adversaries.

(ED JONES/AFP/Getty Images)  Then there are the domestic pitfalls. At a time when Mattis and his top generals have been complaining about the state of military readiness and lobbying Congress for more money, pulling equipment off line for a costly parade could send the wrong signal. There are personal risks for Trump as well. Though he attended a military high school, Trump did not serve in the armed forces, avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War by claiming bone spurs. Critics have previously criticized Trump as disingenuous for basking in the military\u2019s glory. Honoring the troops without politicizing their service has long been a dilemma for presidents. President Obama\u2019s frequent focus on wounded troops fighting to resume their lives struck the wrong chord with some conservatives.  One of George W. Bush\u2019s biggest blunders as president came in 2003 when commander in chief landed on an aircraft carrier bearing a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner to claim victory in the Iraq War. Former aides say Bush would have loved a big parade but they recognized a problem: the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan never ended. Such subtleties \u2014 the U.S. is currently dropping bombs in seven countries \u2014 don\u2019t seem to have factored into Trump\u2019s calculations.  With the midterm elections approaching and Trump\u2019s approval ratings at historic lows, the lure of honoring the troops is powerful.  \u201cWho flipped the coin for the Super Bowl on Sunday?\u201d asked Peter Feaver, a former Bush White House official and professor at Duke University. \u201cIt was Medal of Honor winners. Why? The military brings us together.\u201d But Feaver also issued a warning for Trump, who is known for his excesses. \u201cA military parade,\u201d he said, \u201cis the kind of thing that can easily be overdone.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Ashley Parker", "body": "President Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser and is actively discussing potential replacements, according to five people with knowledge of the plans, preparing to deliver yet another jolt to the senior ranks of his administration.\n Trump is now comfortable with ousting McMaster, with whom he never personally gelled, but is willing to take time executing the move because he wants to ensure both that the three-star Army general is not humiliated and that there is a strong successor lined up, these people said.\n The turbulence is part of a broader potential shake-up under consideration by Trump that is likely to include senior officials at the White House, where staffers are gripped by fear and un\u00adcertainty as they await the next move from an impulsive president who enjoys stoking conflict.\n For all of the evident disorder, Trump feels emboldened, advisers said \u2014 buoyed by what he views as triumphant decisions last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and to agree to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The president is enjoying the process of assessing his team and making changes, tightening his inner circle to those he considers survivors and who respect his unconventional style, one senior White House official said.\n Just days ago, Trump used Twitter to fire Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state whom he disliked, and moved to install his close ally, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, in the job. On Wednesday, he named conservative TV analyst Larry Kudlow to replace his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who quit over trade disagreements.\n   National Security Adviser H.R.

At times, they say, they are anxious and nervous, wondering what each new headline may mean for them personally.\n But in other moments, they appear almost as characters in an absurdist farce \u2014 openly joking about whose career might end with the next presidential tweet. Some White House officials have begun betting about which staffer will be ousted next, though few, if any, have much reliable information about what is actually going on.\n Many aides were particularly unsettled by the firing of the president\u2019s longtime personal aide, John McEntee, who was marched out of the White House on Tuesday after his security clearance was abruptly revoked.\n \u201cEverybody fears the perp walk,\u201d one senior White House official said. \u201cIf it could happen to Johnny, the president\u2019s body guy, it could happen to anybody.\u201d\u00a0\n   President Trump watches as Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin speaks during a White House event in August. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n Trump recently told White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly that he wants McMaster out and asked for help weighing replacement options, according to two people familiar with their conversations.\u00a0The president has complained that McMaster is too rigid and that his briefings go on too long and seem irrelevant.\n Several candidates have emerged as possible McMaster replacements, including John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Keith Kellogg, the chief of staff of the National Security Council.\n Kellogg travels with Trump on many domestic trips, in part because the president likes his company and thinks he is fun. Bolton has met with Trump several times and often agrees with the president\u2019s instincts. Trump also thinks Bolton, who regularly praises the president on Fox News Channel, is good on television. \n Some in the White House have been reluctant to oust McMaster from his national security perch until he has a promotion to four-star rank or other comfortable landing spot. They are eager to show that someone can serve in the Trump administration without suffering severe damage to their reputation.\n  [Trump Cabinet members accused of living large at taxpayer expense] \n McMaster is not the only senior official on thin ice with the president. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has attracted Trump\u2019s ire for his spending decisions as well as for general disorder in the senior leadership of his agency. \n Others considered at risk for being fired or reprimanded include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who has generated bad headlines for ordering a $31,000 dining room set for his office; Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has been under fire for his first-class travel at taxpayer expense; and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose agency spent $139,000 to renovate his office doors.\n Meanwhile, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos drew attention this week when she stumbled through a pair of high-profile television interviews. Kelly watched DeVos\u2019s sit-down with Lesley Stahl of CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with frustration and complained about the secretary\u2019s apparent lack of preparation, officials said. Other Trump advisers mocked DeVos\u2019s shaky appearance with Savannah Guthrie on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.\n Kelly\u2019s own ouster has been widely speculated for weeks. But two top officials said Trump on Thursday morning expressed disbelief to Vice President Pence, senior advisers and Kelly himself that Kelly\u2019s name was surfacing on media watch lists because his job is secure. Trump and Kelly then laughed about it, the officials said.\n The widespread uncertainty has created power vacuums that could play to the advantage of some administration aides.\n Pompeo, who carefully cultivated a personal relationship with the president, had positioned himself as the heir apparent to Tillerson, whom Trump had long disliked.\n Similarly, Pruitt has made no secret inside the West Wing of his ambition to become attorney general should Trump decide to fire Jeff Sessions, who he frequently derides for his decision to recuse himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n White House officials have grown agitated that Pruitt and his allies are privately pushing for the EPA chief to replace Sessions, a job Pruitt has told people he wants. On Wednesday night, Kelly called Pruitt and told him the president was happy with his performance at EPA and that he did not need to worry about the Justice Department, according to two people familiar with the conversation.\n With Hope Hicks resigning her post as communications director, the internal jockeying to replace her has been especially intense between Mercedes Schlapp, who oversees the White House\u2019s long-term communications planning, and Tony Sayegh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s top communications adviser.\n Trump enjoys watching his subordinates compete for his approval. Many of the rumors are fueled by Trump himself because he complains to aides and friends about other staffers, or muses about who might make good replacements.\n \u201cI like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view,\u201d Trump said last week, rapping his fists toward one another to simulate a clash. \u201cI like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it\u2019s the best way to go.\u201d\u00a0\n Shulkin, meanwhile, is facing mounting trouble after The Washington Post first reported that he and his wife took a sightseeing-filled trip to Europe on taxpayer funds, including watching tennis at Wimbledon. Shulkin is now facing an insurrection at his own agency, with tensions so high that an armed guard stands outside his office.\n Another episode haunting Shulkin was a trip to the Invictus Games in Canada last September with first lady Melania Trump\u2019s entourage. Shulkin fought with East Wing aides over his request that his wife accompany him on the trip because he was eager for her to meet Prince Harry of Wales, who founded the games, according to multiple officials familiar with the dispute.\n The first lady\u2019s office explained there was not room on the plane for Shulkin\u2019s wife, and officials said the secretary was unpleasant during the trip.\n  [\u2018It was a different mind-set\u2019: How Trump soured on Tillerson as his top diplomat] \n Shulkin said in an email sent by a spokeswoman: \u201cThese allegations are simply untrue. I was honored to attend the Invictus Games with the First Lady and understood fully when I was told that there wasn\u2019t any more room for guests to attend.\u201d\n A leading contender to replace Shulkin is Pete Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran and Fox News personality who is a conservative voice on veterans policy, officials said.\n White House officials said there are several reasons Trump has not axed Cabinet members with whom he has grown disenchanted: the absence of consensus picks to replace them; concern that their nominated successors may not get confirmed in the divided Senate; and reluctance to pick allied senators or House members for fear of losing Republican seats in special elections, as happened last year in Alabama. \n Also, Trump has sometimes expressed confusion about what agencies and secretaries are in charge of what duties, a senior administration official said. For example, this official said, he has complained to Pruitt about regulatory processes for construction projects, although the EPA is not in charge of the regulations.\n Amid the disarray, White House staff are training Cabinet secretaries and their staffs on ethics rules and discussing new processes to prevent mistakes. William J. McGinley, who runs the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs, and Stefan C. Passantino, a deputy White House counsel, have met individually and in groups with Carson, Pruitt, Shulkin, Zinke and other Cabinet secretaries to impress upon them the importance of changing behavior.\n Simply following the letter of the law is not enough, administration officials said. Trump and Kelly demand that their Cabinet secretaries be mindful of political optics and the bad headlines that come with misbehavior.\n \u201cEven if the legal guys sign off on it,\u201d one official said, \u201cyou still step back and say, \u2018Does this make sense optically?\u2019\u200a\u201d\n   \nGreg Jaffe contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Ruth Marcus", "body": "Back in April 2016, when the notion of Donald Trump in the White House still seemed fanciful, The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Bob Woodward sat down with Trump, and Costa, at one point, raised the subject of the nondisclosure agreements for employees of which the candidate was so fond.\n Costa: \u201cOne thing I always wondered, are you going to make employees of the federal government sign nondisclosure agreements?\u201d \n Trump: \u201cI think they should. .\u2009.\u2009. And I don\u2019t know, there could be some kind of a law that you can\u2019t do this. But when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don\u2019t like that. I mean, I\u2019ll be honest. And people would say, oh, that\u2019s terrible, you\u2019re taking away his right to free speech. Well, he\u2019s going in.\u201d \n Reader, it happened. In the early months of the administration, at the behest of now-President Trump, who was furious over leaks from within the White House, senior White House staff members were asked to, and did, sign nondisclosure agreements vowing not to reveal confidential information and exposing them to damages for any violation. Some balked at first but, pressed by then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, ultimately complied, concluding that the agreements would likely not be enforceable in any event.\n The nondisclosure agreements, said a person who signed the document, \u201cwere meant to be very similar to the ones that some of us signed during the campaign and during the transition. I remember the president saying, \u2018Has everybody signed a confidentiality agreement like they did during the campaign or we had at Trump Tower?\u2019\u2009\u201d\n At that time, in February or March of 2017, the source said, \u201cThere was lots of leaking, things that just weren\u2019t true, and a lot of things that were true and should have remained confidential. The president\u2019s point was that they [staff] would think twice about that if they were on the hook for some serious damages.\u201d\n Moreover, said the source, this confidentiality pledge would extend not only after an aide\u2019s White House service but also beyond the Trump presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be constrained by the four years or eight years he\u2019s president \u2014 or the four months or eight months somebody works there. It is meant to survive that.\u201d\n This is extraordinary. Every president inveighs against leakers and bemoans the kiss-and-tell books; no president, to my knowledge, has attempted to impose such a pledge. And while White House staffers have various confidentiality obligations \u2014 maintaining the secrecy of classified information or attorney-client privilege, for instance \u2014 the notion of imposing a side agreement, supposedly enforceable even after the president leaves office, is not only oppressive but constitutionally repugnant. \n Unlike employees of private enterprises such as the Trump Organization or Trump campaign, White House aides have First Amendment rights when it comes to their employer, the federal government. If you have a leaker on your staff, the cure is firing, not suing.\n \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d said attorney Debra Katz, who has represented numerous government whistleblowers and negotiated nondisclosure agreements. \u201cThe idea of having some kind of economic penalty is an outrageous effort to limit and chill speech. Once again, this president believes employees owe him a personal duty of loyalty, when their duty of loyalty is to the institution.\u201d\n I haven\u2019t been able to lay hands on the final agreement, but I do have a copy of a draft, and it is a doozy. It would expose violators to penalties of $10 million, payable to the federal government, for each and any unauthorized revelation of \u201cconfidential\u201d information, defined as \u201call nonpublic information I learn of or gain access to in the course of my official duties in the service of the United States Government on White House staff,\u201d including \u201ccommunications .\u2009.\u2009. with members of the press\u201d and \u201cwith employees of federal, state, and local governments.\u201d The $10 million figure, I suspect, was watered down in the final version, because the people to whom I have spoken do not remember that jaw-dropping sum.\n It would prohibit revelation of this confidential information in any form \u2014 including, get this, \u201cthe publication of works of fiction that contain any mention of the operations of the White House, federal agencies, foreign governments, or other entities interacting with the United States Government that is based on confidential information.\u201d\n As outlined in the document, this restriction would cover Trump aides not only during their White House service but also \u201cat all times thereafter.\u201d\n The document: \u201cI understand that the United States Government or, upon completion of the term(s) of Mr. Donald J. Trump, an authorized representative of Mr. Trump, may seek any remedy available to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement.\u201d\n This is so ridiculously excessive, so laughably unconstitutional, that I doubted, when it first came my way, that anything like it was ever implemented \u2014 only to do some reporting and learn otherwise.\n Ordinarily I would insert a response from the White House, but this is no ordinary White House: It dealt with my numerous requests for comment, to the press office and the counsel\u2019s office, with complete silence.\n The draft made its way to me after I wrote a column observing that Trump\u2019s silence-buying and silence-compelling days were done. Now we know that he imported these bullying tactics into the White House. Which raises the obvious question: Why is he so consistently frantic to ensure that no one knows what goes on behind closed doors?\n  Read more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Craig Timberg", "body": "LONDON \u2014 Conservative strategist Stephen K. Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s early efforts to collect troves of Facebook data as part of an ambitious program to build detailed profiles of millions of American voters, a former employee of the data-science firm said Tuesday.\n The 2014 effort was part of a high-tech form of voter persuasion touted by the company, which under Bannon identified and tested the power of anti-establishment messages that later would emerge as central themes in President Trump\u2019s campaign speeches, according to Chris Wylie, who left the company at the end of that year.\n Among the messages tested were \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and \u201cdeep state,\u201d he said.\n Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, is now facing questions about alleged unethical practices, including charges that the firm improperly handled the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. On Tuesday, the company\u2019s board announced that it was suspending its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after British television released secret recordings that appeared to show him talking about entrapping political opponents.\n More than three years before he served as Trump\u2019s chief political strategist, Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the financial backing of the wealthy Mercer family as part of a broader effort to create a populist power base. Earlier this year, the Mercers cut ties with Bannon after he was quoted making incendiary comments about Trump and his family.\n In an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post at his lawyer\u2019s London office, Wylie said that Bannon \u2014 while he was a top executive at Cambridge Analytica and head of Breitbart News \u2014 was deeply involved in the company\u2019s strategy and approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014.\n \u201cWe had to get Bannon to approve everything at this point. Bannon was Alexander Nix\u2019s boss,\u201d said Wylie, who was Cambridge Analytica\u2019s research director. \u201cAlexander Nix didn\u2019t have the authority to spend that much money without approval.\u201d\n Bannon, who served on the company\u2019s board, did not respond to a request for comment. He served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica from June 2014 to August 2016, when he became chief executive of Trump\u2019s campaign, according to his publicly filed financial disclosure. In 2017, he joined Trump in the White House as his chief strategist.\n Bannon received more than $125,000 in consulting fees from Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and owned \u201cmembership units\u201d in the company worth between $1 million and $5 million, according to his financial disclosure.\n  \n Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment about Bannon\u2019s role.\u00a0\n  [Cambridge Analytica whistleblower to testify to House Democrats on Facebook data operation] \n It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the data, which allegedly was collected through an app that was portrayed as a tool for psychological research but was then transferred to the company.\n Facebook has said that information was improperly shared and that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica officials said that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.\n Wylie said that both Bannon and Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert Mercer, financed the company, participated in conference calls in 2014 in which plans to collect Facebook data were discussed, although Wylie acknowledged that it was not clear they knew the details of how the collection took place.\n Bannon \u201capproved the data-collection scheme we were proposing,\u201d Wylie said.\n The Mercers did not respond to a request for comment.\n The data and analyses that Cambridge Analytica generated in this time provided discoveries that would later form the emotionally charged core of Trump\u2019s presidential platform, said Wylie, whose disclosures in news reports over the past several days have rocked both his onetime employer and Facebook.\n \u201cTrump wasn\u2019t in our consciousness at that moment; this was well before he became a thing,\u201d Wylie said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a client or anything.\u201d\n The year before Trump announced his presidential bid, the data firm already had found a high level of alienation among young, white Americans with a conservative bent.\n In focus groups arranged to test messages for the 2014 midterms, these voters responded to calls for building a new wall to block the entry of illegal immigrants, to reforms intended the \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington\u2019s entrenched political community and to thinly veiled forms of racism toward African Americans called \u201crace realism,\u201d he recounted.\n The firm also tested views of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n \u201cThe only foreign thing we tested was Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out, there\u2019s a lot of Americans who really like this idea of a really strong authoritarian leader and people were quite defensive in focus groups of Putin\u2019s invasion of Crimea.\u201d\n The controversy over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data collection erupted in recent days amid news reports that an app created by a Cambridge University psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, accessed extensive personal data of 50 million Facebook users. The app, called thisisyourdigitallife, was downloaded by 270,000 users. Facebook\u2019s policy, which has since changed, allowed Kogan to also collect data \u2014including names, home towns, religious affiliations and likes \u2014 on all of the Facebook\u00a0\u201cfriends\u201d of those users. Kogan shared that data with Cambridge Analytica for its growing database on American voters.\n Facebook on Friday banned the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie for improperly sharing that data.\n The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook to determine whether the social media platform violated a 2011 consent decree governing its privacy policies when it allowed the data collection. And Wylie plans to testify to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as part of their investigation of Russian interference in the election, including possible ties to the Trump campaign.\n Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News aired a video Tuesday in which Nix was shown boasting about his work for Trump. He seemed to highlight his firm\u2019s secrecy, at one point stressing the need to set up a special email account that self-destructs all messages so that \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence, there\u2019s no paper trail, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u00a0\n The company said in a statement that Nix\u2019s comments \u201cdo not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\u201d\u00a0\n Nix could not be reached for comment.\n Cambridge Analytica was set up as a U.S. affiliate of British-based SCL Group, which had a wide range of governmental clients globally, in addition to its political work.\n Wylie said that Bannon and Nix first met in 2013, the same year that Wylie \u2014 a young data whiz with some political experience in Britain and Canada \u2014 was working for SCL Group. Bannon and Wylie met soon after and hit it off in conversations about culture, elections and how to spread ideas using technology.\n  [The Mercers and Stephen Bannon: How a populist power base was funded and built] \n Bannon, Wylie, Nix, Rebekah Mercer and Robert Mercer met in Rebekah Mercer\u2019s Manhattan apartment in the fall of 2013, striking a deal in which Robert Mercer would fund the creation of Cambridge Analytica with $10 million, with the hope of shaping the congressional elections a year later, according to Wylie. Robert Mercer, in particular, seemed transfixed by the group\u2019s plans to harness and analyze data, he recalled.\n The Mercers were keen to create a U.S.-based business to avoid bad optics and violating U.S. campaign finance rules, Wylie said. \u201cThey wanted to create an American brand,\u201d he said.\n The young company struggled to quickly deliver on its promises, Wiley said. Widely available information from commercial data brokers provided people\u2019s names, addresses, shopping habits and more, but failed to distinguish on more fine-grained matters of personality that might affect political views.\n Cambridge Analytica initially worked for 2016 Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who was backed by the Mercers. The Trump campaign had rejected early overtures to hire Cambridge Analytica, and Trump himself said in May 2016 that he \u201calways felt\u201d that the use of voter data was \u201coverrated.\u201d\u00a0\n After Cruz faded, the Mercers switched their allegiance to Trump and pitched their services to Trump\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale. The company\u2019s hiring was approved by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was informally helping to manage the campaign with a focus on digital strategy.\u00a0\n Kushner said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Forbes magazine that the campaign \u201cfound that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. .\u2009.\u2009.We brought in Cambridge Analytica.\u201d Kushner said he \u201cbuilt\u201d a data hub for the campaign \u201cwhich nobody knew about, until towards the end.\u201d\u00a0\n Kushner\u2019s spokesman and lawyer both declined to comment Tuesday.\u00a0\n Two weeks before Election Day, Nix\u00a0told a Post reporter\u00a0at the company\u2019s New York City office that his company could \u201cdetermine the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.\u201d\u00a0\n The claim was widely questioned, and the Trump campaign later said that it didn\u2019t rely on psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica. Instead, the campaign said that it used a variety of other digital information to identify probable supporters.\u00a0\n Parscale said in a Post interview in October 2016 that he had not \u201copened the hood\u201d on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s methodology, and said he got much of his data from the Republican National Committee. Parscale declined to comment Tuesday. He has previously said that the Trump campaign did not use any psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica.\u00a0\n Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL Group, has an ongoing contract with the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center. The company was paid almost $500,000 to interview people overseas to understand the mind-set of Islamist militants as part of an effort to counter their online propaganda and block recruits.\n Heather Nauert, the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Tuesday that the contract was signed in November 2016, under the Obama administration, and has not expired yet. In public records, the contract is dated in February 2017, and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear.

Today, I feel that Fox is assaulting our constitutional order and rule of law, while fostering corrosive and unjustified paranoia among viewers. Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association. Now I am ashamed.\u201d\n He added: \u201cWhen prime-time hosts \u2014 who have never served our country in any capacity \u2014 dismiss facts and empirical reality to launch profoundly dishonest attacks on the FBI, the Justice Department, the courts, the intelligence community (in which I served) and, not least, a model public servant and genuine war hero such as Robert Mueller \u2014 all the while scaremongering with lurid warnings of \u2018deep-state\u2019 machinations \u2014 I cannot be part of the same organization, even at a remove. To me, Fox News is now wittingly harming our system of government for profit.\u201d\n In an interview, Peters, 65, who lives in Warrenton, Va., said he never intended his email to become public and that he wasn\u2019t trying to \u201cgrandstand\u201d about his differences with the network, which he joined as a contributor in 2008. But he offered no apologies.\n Instead, he said he wrote the email because Fox\u2019s hosts \u2014 whom he did not single out by name \u2014 are \u201churting the country.\u201d\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It may sound corny to say I took an oath as an officer, but it\u2019s true. I just feel for their selfish reasons, they\u2019re doing damage to the country.\u201d\n In a statement in reply to Peters, Fox said, \u201cRalph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he\u2019s choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention. We are extremely proud of our top-rated prime-time hosts and all of our opinion programing.\u201d\n To which Peters replied: \u201cIf I\u2019m seeking attention why the [expletive] did I just quit Fox and the chance to speak to millions every day?\u201d\n Peters appeared frequently on both Fox News and its sister channel, Fox Business Network, over the past decade to discuss military topics and foreign affairs, including U.S.-Russia relations. He estimates that he averaged more than 200 appearances a year during the past five years.\n During that time, he said, Fox\u2019s producers never instructed him what to say. But in the past year, as questions arose about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, he said Fox wouldn\u2019t let him engage on the topic, in which he holds considerable expertise as a former intelligence officer.\n In recent months, Peters said he \u201cedged\u201d toward criticizing Trump on the air, but \u201cas a matter of courtesy,\u201d he didn\u2019t let loose. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the king\u2019s shilling, you do the king\u2019s service,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t embarrass the host on the air. I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n By contrast, Peters was frequently blunt in his comments about the Obama administration\u2019s relations with Russia. In 2014, he said that President Obama got \u201cdate raped\u201d in his efforts to negotiate with Putin. On Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program in late 2015, Peters called Obama\u2019s Syria strategy \u201cinept, ineffective and cowardly,\u201d and described Obama as a \u201cterrified little man in a great big job he can\u2019t do.\u201d\n He apparently went too far a few weeks later on Fox Business Network when he called Obama \u201ca total pussy \u201d for his administration\u2019s counterterrorism policies, earning a two-week suspension. Peters apologized for his language but not the criticism, saying \u201cmy choice of words was incorrect, but my sentiment, I think, is shared by many.\u201d\n Peters retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 1998 after serving for 22 years.

Trump sought to block the legal action, but New York Supreme Court Judge Jennifer G.

Her lawsuit followed on the heels of a suit filed by Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who said she was paid to keep quiet about her own alleged affair with Trump long before he took office.\n The Zervos ruling, along with the cases filed by McDougal and Daniels, added to the mounting legal headaches facing Trump regarding his history with women.

(Reuters) \n \n Trump has repeatedly said that all of the women who accused him of touching them inappropriately were lying \u2014 a sentiment his White House reiterated as questions resurfaced about these allegations. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n Though Trump insisted during the campaign he had proof these women were all lying and vowed to sue them, no lawsuits materialized. Instead, the only court action to stem from these allegations has been Zervos\u2019s claim that he defamed her and his other accusers by branding them liars.\n Trump\u2019s attorneys argued that the president cannot be sued in state court and also said the comments he made were political opinion and, as a result, \u201csquarely protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n  \n Marc Kasowitz, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the ruling Tuesday.\n Mariann Meier Wang, co-counsel for Zervos with women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, wrote in an email: \u201cThe rule of law and sound reason have prevailed today. We are grateful for the opportunity to prove that the Defendant falsely branded Ms. Zervos a phony for telling the truth about his unwanted sexual groping.\u201d\n In an email, Allred wrote: \u201cI am very happy.\u201d\n At least a dozen women aired complaints about past sexual misconduct by Trump before the election, although Zervos is the only one to bring court action.

It is settled that the President of the United States has no immunity and is \u2018subject to the laws\u2019 for purely private acts.\u201d\n Schecter referred to a court case involving Clinton and Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who accused Clinton of sexual harassing her while he was serving as the state\u2019s governor. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Jones\u2019s lawsuit against Clinton could proceed, arguing that sitting presidents could be sued for private actions that predated their time in office; Trump\u2019s attorneys have argued that case applied to federal litigation and did not apply in state courts.\n In her ruling, Schecter also dismissed a request that the case be stayed for the duration of Trump\u2019s time in office, saying that such \u201ca lengthy and categorical stay is not justified\u201d just because a president can be called away to attend to a crisis. If that happens, Schecter wrote, Trump\u2019s federal responsibilities would be given priority.\n Schecter wrote that Trump\u2019s comments calling Zervos a liar \u201ccannot be characterized simply as opinion, heated rhetoric or hyperbole.\u201d\n Maria Glover, a law professor at Georgetown University, said that the decision will almost certainly go to appeal.\n \u201cThe issue of whether a president can have rights and liabilities adjudicated in state court is likely to reach the highest court in New York, in Albany,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom there, it could \u2014 and perhaps likely will \u2014 be appealed to the Supreme Court. This lengthy set of appeals means that we won\u2019t be getting Trump\u2019s deposition quite so fast.\u201d\n Even as they considered an appeal, lawyers representing Trump also had to monitor another lawsuit \u2014 this one filed in early March in Los Angeles Superior Court by Daniels, who has said Trump sought to silence her shortly before the 2016 election. The $130,000 hush agreement was intended to prevent her from speaking out about an alleged affair that began, Daniels said, at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006.\n    Daniels shared her story with InTouch magazine in 2011, but the interview was not published until the Wall Street Journal reported on the affair and payout earlier this year. She took a polygraph examination as part of that interview process, the magazine\u2019s editorial director said.\n A court document provided to The Post on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Daniels, describes the polygraph examination, which concluded that Daniels was being \u201ctruthful\u201d about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n Zervos first made public her claims against Trump at an October 2016 news conference as one of a parade of women who accused him of misconduct after the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording capturing the future president boasting in graphic language about groping women. At a presidential debate, Trump denied ever doing the things he described in the recording, which some of his accusers said prompted them to come forward.\n Zervos has accused Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts while she was pursuing a job at his company, charges he said were untrue.\n In January 2017, Zervos filed a suit in New York State Supreme Court against Trump, arguing that Trump defamed her by denying her account and calling his accusers \u201cliars.\u201d Attorneys for Trump pushed back on multiple fronts, arguing that the suit was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and was built around \u201callegations of events that never occurred.\u201d\n  \nBeth Reinhard contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "John Wagner", "body": "President Trump talks during a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in the Oval Office at the White House on Tuesday.

Mueller III, Trump officials have sought to paint the 30-year old energy consultant as a low level volunteer whose outreach to Russia was not authorized by the campaign \u2014 and in some cases, was actively discouraged.\n But emails described to The Washington Post, which are among thousands of documents turned over to investigators examining Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign, show that Papadopoulos had more extensive contact with key Trump campaign and presidential transition officials than has been publicly acknowledged. \n Among those who communicated with Papadopoulos were senior campaign figures such as chief executive Stephen K. Bannon and adviser Michael Flynn, who corresponded with him about his efforts to broker ties between Trump and top foreign officials, the emails show.\n As late as December 2016, as President-elect Trump was preparing to take office, Papadopoulos tried to serve as a conduit for the defense minister of Greece, transmitting what he said was a proposal for a strategic alliance from the Russian-allied Greek official that was reviewed by both Bannon and Flynn, then in line to be national security adviser.\n  [\u2018Anyone .\u2009.\u2009. with a pulse\u2019: How a Russia-friendly adviser found his way into the Trump campaign] \n The previously undisclosed emails paint a portrait of a young researcher who demonstrated an early and intense interest in joining Trump\u2019s presidential bid, beginning in July 2015, just weeks after the celebrity mogul announced his candidacy \u2014 eight months before his name first publicly surfaced. \n Thomas Breen, an attorney for Papadopoulos, declined to comment. A White House spokesman declined to comment.\n In a tweet after Papadopoulos pleaded guilty, President Trump wrote that \u201cfew people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.\u201d Another Trump campaign staffer dismissed Papadopoulos as a mere \u201ccoffee boy\u201d during the campaign.\n Papadopoulos is the only Trump associate known to have told prosecutors that he had advance warning the Russians held emails that could be damaging to Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. A London-based professor told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, according to his plea agreement.\n It is not known if Papadopoulos relayed that information to other campaign officials. \n The young aide was not a central player in Trump\u2019s inner circle. At times, he appeared as a supplicant to his superiors on the campaign, who occasionally ignored his notes or appeared to rebuff him, the emails show. Shortly after joining the campaign, Papadopoulos was rebuked by campaign officials for giving an unauthorized interview to a British newspaper, The Post previously reported.\n But the documents also indicate that amid Papadopoulos\u2019s advocacy of closer ties to Russia, he retained access to top officials \u2014 even after Trump\u2019s victory. \n  [For \u2018low level volunteer,\u2019 Papadopoulos sought high profile as Trump adviser] \n A former intern and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute, Papadopoulos was living in London when the 2016 presidential race kicked off. Less than a decade out of college, he had never worked for a campaign before.\n In July 2015, Papadopoulos contacted then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski about his interest in joining Trump\u2019s campaign, according to an email he sent the following month to deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner, now executive director of Trump\u2019s reelection effort.\n \u201cThe reason for my message is because I have been in touch with Mr. Corey Lewandowski since early last month about obtaining an advisory role to Mr. Trump on matters of energy security and U.S. policy in the Eastern Mediteranean,\u201d he wrote to Glassner. \n He corresponded for months with both Lewandowski and Glassner, according to the emails. The two campaign officials responded politely, but initially told him no job was available.\n Glassner and Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment.\n In December 2015, Papadopoulos went to work for the campaign of neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who was then challenging Trump for the GOP nomination.\n After several months, Papadopoulos reached out again to the Trump campaign to inform them he would be leaving the flagging Carson campaign. \n \u201cI wanted to let you know that I stopped working as Ben Carson\u2019s principle foreign policy adviser. I\u2019d be interested in getting on board with the Trump team. Is the team looking to expand?\u201d Papadopoulos wrote to Glassner early in March 2016. \n At the time, Trump was surging in the polls, and the real estate developer was under increasing pressure to name foreign policy advisers to his team.\n Glassner quickly connected Papadopouloswith campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis.\n Clovis and Papadopoulos spoke by phone four days later, a conversation in which Clovis said improving relations with Russia was a top campaign foreign policy goal, according to what Papadopoulos later told prosecutors. Clovis, who did not respond to a request for comment, has previously denied that account.\n Later that month, Trump himself named Papadopoulos among a list of five people advising his campaign on foreign policy during a meeting with The Washington Post editorial board. \u201cExcellent guy,\u201d the candidate said.\n At the end of March, Papadopoulos attended a meeting of Trump\u2019s newly named national security advisory group at Trump\u2019s not-yet-opened hotel in Washington. After introducing himself, the young adviser announced that he could organize a meeting between Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and Trump, according to court documents. \n The following month, he intensified his outreach to new Russian contacts he had met through the London professor, Joseph Mifsud. They included a woman who had been introduced to him as a Putin relative and Ivan Timofeev, a director of a Moscow think tank. Papadopoulos highlighted these contacts in numerous emails to campaign officials disclosed by prosecutors and described previously to the Post.\n  In May, Papadopoulos forwarded to campaign officials a note he received from Timofeev informing him that Russian foreign ministry officials were open to a Trump visit. That idea was batted down by campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who emailed his associate Rick Gates: \u201cWe need to communicate that DT is not doing these trips.\u201d \n Still, Papadopoulos persisted and was encouraged by Clovis in August to pursue meetings on his own \u201cif feasible,\u201d according to court documents. A lawyer for Clovis has said he was merely being polite and did not authorize Papadopoulos to represent the campaign abroad.\n  That spring, Papadopoulos spoke to a group of researchers in Israel, where he announced that Trump believed Putin was a \u201cresponsible actor and potential partner,\u201d according to The Jerusalem Post.\n Several months later, Papadopoulos alerted the campaign that he had an opportunity to speak to the Russian news outlet Interfax.\n \u201cReceived a request from Interfax Russian News Agency with Ksenia Baygarova on U.S.-Russia ties under a President Trump. What do you think?\u201d he wrote to Lanza on September 9, 2016. \u201cIf the campaign wants me to do it, can answer similar to the answers I gave in April while in Israel.\u201d\n Lanza gave the go-ahead, citing the conflict in Syria as a reason to work the Russians. Papadopoulos then offered to send the campaign a copy of the interview after it was published.\n \u201cYou\u2019re the best. Thank you!\u201d Lanza responded.\n Lanza declined to comment.\n In the interview, published Sept. 30, 2016, Papadopoulos told the Russian media outlet that Trump had been \u201copen about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in U.S.-Russia ties,\u201d specifically citing the need for cooperation in Syria.\n According to prosecutors, Papadopoulos also sent the Interfax story to Mifsud after its publication.\n Baygarova, the Interfax reporter who interviewed Papadopoulos, said in an email to The Post that she reached out to Papadopoulos after being assigned to interview a representative of both presidential campaigns. She said she sent messages to each person on a list of Trump foreign policy advisers.

There was a good chemistry there,\u201d Trump told Fox Business\u2019 Lou Dobbs the next day.\n William Burck, an attorney for Bannon, declined to comment.\n Papadopoulos continued to position himself as a go-between for Trump\u2019s top staff and key foreign officials after Trump\u2019s victory.\n In December 2016, Papadopoulos alerted Bannon that he had recently been in contact with Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, a pro-Russian Greek nationalist who has met with Putin. \n \u201cThey want to sign a government-to-government agreement with the USA for all rights to all energy fields offshore, strategic foothold in the Mediterranean and Balkans,\u201d Papadopoulos wrote in an email.\n Bannon forwarded the message to Flynn and Flynn\u2019s deputy, KT McFarland.\n \u201cWill work this one,\u201d Flynn responded.\n It is not clear if Flynn pursued the Greek offer. In late December, Flynn wrote in an email to Papadopoulos that he believed the young adviser\u2019s suggestions presented \u201cgreat opportunities.\u201d\n \u201cWe will examine these and determine if this is something we should take on early. Stay in touch and, at some point, we should get together.\u201d\n He signed the email, \u201cMike.\u201d\n Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, declined to comment. An attorney for McFarland did not respond to a request for comment.\n In an interview, Kammenos said he did not seek Papadopoulos\u2019s help in reaching Trump\u2019s aides. He said that before the election, Papadopoulos sent him an energy proposal that he thought had merit.\n But by Trump\u2019s election, he said he had concluded Papadopoulos was not a major figure in Trump\u2019s world and established his own contact with the presidential transition.\n Kammenos added: \u201cI think Mr. Papadopoulos is a very young person with dreams.\u201d\n tom.hamburger@washpost.com\n  \nEllen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Philip Rucker", "body": "President Trump fired off angry tweets Sunday morning railing against the Justice Department special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation and attacking the integrity of former FBI director James B.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n \n One hundred years ago this week, the founder of modern American conservatism was born into poverty in Plymouth, Michigan. Russell Kirk\u2019s \u201cThe Conservative Mind,\u201d published in 1953, laid the foundations of a modern conservative movement that dominated the second half of the American Century. But 65 years later, Kirk\u2019s classic work reads instead as a damning indictment against the very movement he helped launch.\n The central thesis of Kirk\u2019s philosophy was that \u201cthe conservative abhors all forms of ideology\u201c and subscribes to principles \u201carrived at by convention and compromise\u201d instead of \u201cfanatic ideological dogmata.\u201c Six decades of Republican overreach and corrosive causes have instead led to the rise of Donald Trump and a foreign policy run by John Bolton, an economy guided by Larry Kudlow and a legal team led by conspiracy theorist Joseph DiGenova.\n Bolton\u2019s elevation to the position of national security adviser is a fitting coda for a movement whose adherents spent decades throwing themselves on an endless array of ideological barricades while vilifying opponents whose responses to Soviet Russia or Islamic fundamentalism were deemed insufficiently harsh. Bolton\u2019s selection will not disappoint these same GOP militants whom Kirk battled until his death in 1994. Trump\u2019s third national security advisor in 14 months has called for the preemptive bombing of both North Korea and Iran, while defending his role in the worst U.S. foreign policy disaster since Vietnam. Of America\u2019s military misadventure in Iraq, Bolton pleads innocence on all counts while shamelessly calling Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 decision to bring American troops home \u201cthe worst decision\u201d made in that debacle.\n In the forward to the seventh edition of \u201cThe Conservative Mind,\u201d Kirk predicted with precision the rise of political players like Bolton and Trump and foresaw a time when America would \u201cfall into the hands of merciless ideologues or squalid oligarchs.\u201d He also repeated Swedish philosopher Tage Lindbom\u2019s warning of the bleak harvest coming from a \u201csecularized generation for which material existence is everything and spiritual life is nothing.\u201d\n This was the predictable outcome of my Republican Party aligning its interests with the most cynical political operators of our time. The Atwaters, Manaforts, Gingriches and Roves leveraged a weaponized media culture that reduced politics to a secularized religion and consolidated political power and material wealth in the hands of its richest donors.\n Yes, the Soviet Union is in the dustbin of history, Osama bin Laden is dead and ISIS is \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 on its heels. But the inner chaos that Kirk warned of so many years ago runs rampant in a country dominated by the bloated presence of a man who embraces dictators, vilifies the free press, corrupts religious leaders, absolves white supremacists, degrades women and continues a life\u2019s work defined by little more than the amoral pursuit of material wealth.\n Remarkably, order could be pulled from this culturally calamitous crisis if\u00a0just two GOP senators had the moral courage to deprive Donald Trump of a ruling majority until he agreed to bring to heel his most destructive instincts.

We are on the cusp of change of a magnitude not seen since the 1960s, at least, and not just on guns but on immigration, race, health care, diplomacy, the role of government and America\u2019s place in the world.\n This is a paradox of the Trump era, which every day brings more calamity: a trade war, dramatic debt expansion during an economic boom, tax cuts that expand the gap between rich and poor, the arrival of a dangerous ideologue as national security adviser, a president aligning himself with a hostile foreign power trying to disrupt U.S. democracy with an assist from America\u2019s own Facebook empire, a sprawling criminal inquiry of top presidential advisers, a leader turning Americans against each other by race, gender and religion and attacking the pillars of democratic governance.\n And yet it could not be clearer that the power structure that created this mess is on its way out. Millennials will sometime next year become the largest living generation, and Generation Z is poised to be even larger. Together, they will resoundingly repudiate the status quo. Just 27\u2007percent of millennials approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, according to the Pew Research Center, which says the generational gap in political views is wider than at any point since Pew began examining it in the early 1990s.\n This is related to rapidly changing racial demographics (millennials are more than 40 percent nonwhite, Gen Z even more so), but, even controlling for racial diversity, Pew reported in a study this month that young Americans are markedly more liberal than older cohorts.\n Seventy-nine percent of millennials say immigrants strengthen America (vs. 47 percent of the oldest, Silent generation). Seventy-seven percent of millennials say good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace (vs. 43 percent of the Silent). There are similar gaps in views of free trade, universal health care, welfare and racial discrimination, and liberal millennials outnumber conservative millennials 57 percent to 12 percent; among the oldest generation it\u2019s almost the reverse: 28 percent liberal to 40 percent conservative.\n The kids might even save us from Facebook, a creation of millennials that is now being turned into an anti-democratic weapon. The research firm eMarketer found that the number of 12-\u2007to 17-year-old American users of Facebook declined 9.9 percent in 2017, part of a drop of 2.8 million U.S. users of Facebook under age 25. The firm expects Facebook to shed another 2.1 million this year, as young people switch to other platforms.\n On gun control, there is broad and growing support across generations. But the issue of mass shootings is the \u201cdefining fear\u201d for the youngest Americans, according to an attempt by USA Today and Ipsos to poll 13- to 24-year-olds. The survey, released this  week, found that gun violence eclipses all other worries, including terrorism, racism, college affordability and climate change. Nearly one-fifth don\u2019t feel safe at school.\n This will change. The zeitgeist is already changing, as seen in recent actions by Delta Air Lines, Hertz, MetLife, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Walmart, Citigroup and others.

Among them: evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts, evidence of work displayed at artistic exhibitions and evidence of original contributions to a field.\n  \u201cWhat did she submit?\u201d asked David Leopold, an immigration lawyer and a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThere are a lot of questions about how she procured entry into the United States.\u201d \n The process of deciding who meets the \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d standard is subjective, said Sarah Pierce, an immigration expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

Aides said it was hypocritical for Democrats, after months of complaining about the $1.5 trillion deficit impact of the tax bill, to take two-thirds of that cost and devote it to infrastructure.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) scoffed at the proposal in floor remarks Wednesday.\n \u201cRepeal all these bonuses, pay raises, new jobs, and new investments? Talk about a nonstarter,\u201d he said.\n Before Trump\u2019s election, Schumer and many other Democrats had previously endorsed infrastructure plans that would have raised funds by forcing American companies to move their overseas profits back to the United States and taxing them at a discounted rate. But Republicans used that maneuver, known as repatriation, to help offset the cost of their tax cuts.\n That has left little choice, Schumer said, to finance a big infrastructure plan. Democratic leaders, like their Republican counterparts, have rejected one obvious alternative: raising the federal gasoline tax for the first time since 1993.\n \u201cWe\u2019d rather have the very wealthy and corporations pay for it than average folks who drive,\u201d he said.\n  Read more at PowerPost", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Sari Horwitz", "body": "Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has gathered evidence that a secret meeting in Seychelles just before the inauguration of Donald Trump was an effort to establish a back channel between the incoming administration and the Kremlin \u2014 apparently contradicting statements made to lawmakers by one of its participants, according to people familiar with the matter.\n In January 2017, Erik Prince, the founder of the private security company Blackwater, met with a Russian official close to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and later described the meeting to congressional investigators as a chance encounter that was not a planned discussion of U.S.-Russia relations.\n A witness cooperating with Mueller has told investigators the meeting was set up in advance so that a representative of the Trump transition could meet with an emissary from Moscow to discuss future relations between the countries, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n George Nader, a Lebanese American businessman who helped organize and attended the Seychelles meeting, has testified on the matter before a grand jury gathering evidence about discussions between the Trump transition team and emissaries of the Kremlin, as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election.\n Nader began cooperating with Mueller after he arrived at Dulles International Airport in mid-January and was stopped, served with a subpoena and questioned by the FBI, these people said. He has met numerous times with investigators.\n  [Businessman cooperating with Mueller probe] \n Last year, Prince told lawmakers \u2014 and the news media \u2014 that his Seychelles meeting with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of a Russian government-controlled wealth fund, was an unplanned, unimportant encounter that came about by chance because he happened to be at a luxury hotel in the Indian Ocean island nation with officials from the United Arab Emirates.\n In his statements, Prince has specifically denied reporting by The Washington Post that said the Seychelles meeting, which took place about a week before Trump\u2019s inauguration, was described by U.S., European and Arab officials as part of an effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and the incoming administration.\n Prince told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that he did not plan to meet Dmitriev in Seychelles but that once he was there discussing possible business deals with UAE officials, they unexpectedly suggested that he visit the hotel bar and meet Dmitriev.\n \u201cAt the end, one of the entourage says, \u2018Hey, by the way, there\u2019s this Russian guy that we\u2019ve dealt with in the past. He\u2019s here also to see someone from the Emirati delegation. And you should meet him, he\u2019d be an interesting guy for you to know, since you\u2019re doing a lot in the oil and gas and mineral space,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Prince told lawmakers.\n The two men, he said, spoke for no more than 30\u00a0minutes, or about the time it took him to drink a beer.\n \u201cWe chatted on topics ranging from oil and commodity prices to how much his country wished for resumption of normal trade relations with the USA,\u201d Prince told lawmakers. \u201cI remember telling him that if Franklin Roosevelt could work with Joseph Stalin to defeat Nazi fascism, then certainly Donald Trump could work with Vladi\u00admir Putin to defeat Islamic fascism.\u201d\n Prince said he went to Seychelles as a private businessman, not as an official or unofficial emissary of the Trump transition team. During the congressional interview, which became testy at times as Democratic lawmakers pressed him to be more specific in his answers, Prince repeatedly complained that he had reason to believe U.S. intelligence agencies were leaking information about his activities.\n Asked to comment on assertions that new evidence appears to contradict Prince\u2019s description of the Seychelles meeting, a spokesman for Prince referred to his previous statements to the committee and declined further comment.\n A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.\n  [Blackwater founder held secret meeting in Seychelles] \n Prince has known Nader for years and once hired him to try to generate business from the Iraqi government in the years after the U.S.-led invasion of that country. That effort was not successful, according to Prince\u2019s statements in a subsequent deposition.\n Nader, according to current and former officials, was known to Trump transition and administration officials as someone with political connections in the Middle East who could help navigate the tricky diplomacy of the region.\n Nader had also attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between senior Trump advisers and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n While Mueller is probing the circumstances of the Seychelles meeting, he is also more broadly examining apparent efforts by the Trump transition team to create a back channel for secret talks between the new administration and the Kremlin. Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, whether any Americans assisted in such efforts, and any other matters that arise in the course of his probe.\n Investigators now suspect that the Seychelles meeting may have been one of the first efforts to establish such a line of communications between the two governments, these people said. Nader\u2019s account is considered key evidence \u2014 but not the only evidence \u2014 about what transpired in Seychelles, according to people familiar with the matter.\n Nader has long served as an adviser to the UAE leadership, and in that role he met more than once with Trump officials, including Stephen K. Bannon and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to people familiar with the matter. After the Seychelles meeting, Nader visited the White House several times, and met at least once there with Bannon and Kushner, these people said.\n Nader could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer declined to comment.\n Nader \u2014 and the Seychelles meeting \u2014 are also of interest to Mueller\u2019s team as it examines whether any foreign money or assistance fueled the Trump campaign, and how Trump officials during the transition and early days of the administration communicated with foreign officials, particularly Russians.\n Nader\u2019s cooperation with the special counsel was first reported by the New York Times. \n The UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. Such a concession by Moscow would have been likely to require the easing of U.S. sanctions on Russia, which were imposed for Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine in 2014, those officials said.\n Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition. However, according to people familiar with the Seychelles meeting, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his discussion with the Russian official.\n  Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the meeting in the Seychelles took place in January 2017, not 2016. \n  \nCarol D.

Schiff (D-Calif.), who told reporters last month that based on what he had seen, there was \u201cample evidence\u201d of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n Democrats and Republicans on the committee have interviewed the same 73 witnesses and viewed the same 300,000-plus documents, according to the tally Conaway gave reporters on Monday.

She was 88 and the oldest sitting member of Congress.\n Rep. Slaughter had been hospitalized and treated for a concussion after falling at her home in the District, The Washington Post reported Wednesday .\n The daughter of a blacksmith in a Kentucky coal mine, Rep. Slaughter traced her lineage to Daniel Boone and attacked her political opponents with a marksman\u2019s accuracy and, not infrequently, a disarming grin. \u201cShe\u2019s sort of a combination of Southern charm and back-room politics, a Southern belle with a cigar in her mouth,\u201d Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women\u2019s Campaign Fund, told The Post in 1992.\n A microbiologist with a master\u2019s in public health, she moved to western New York with her husband in the 1950s and entered politics two decades later, after fighting to preserve a stand of beech-maple forest near their home in the Rochester suburbs. She served in the Monroe County Legislature and New York State Assembly before being elected to Congress in 1986, and soon established herself as a defender of blue-collar constituents who worked for Xerox or Kodak. \n Breaking with Democratic Party leaders, she argued that international trade agreements did little more than drain the United States of manufacturing jobs. When President Bill Clinton asked her to support the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), according to the Almanac of American Politics, she replied, \u201cWhy are you carrying George Bush\u2019s trash?\u201d\n   U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter (Matthew Staver/BLOOMBERG) \n Initially one of just 29 women in the House of Representatives, Rep. Slaughter was a flinty advocate of women\u2019s access to health care and abortion. She was a co-author of the landmark Violence Against Women Act, a landmark 1994 law aimed at staunching domestic abuse and aiding its victims, and in 1991 was part of a group of seven Democratic congresswomen who marched to the Senate to demand a delay in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. \n In a legislative assault she later likened to the World War II battle of Iwo Jima, she and her fellow legislators prevailed on their Senate colleagues to hear testimony from Anita Hill, a former Thomas aide who had accused him of sexual harassment. \n \u201cThere\u2019s no monolithic way that women respond to this,\u201d she said at the time, referring to the harassment allegations. \u201cBut we are the people who write the laws of the land. Good lord, she should have some recourse here.\u201d\n Rep. Slaughter was the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, which determines when and how bills reach the House floor, and was elevated to chairman after Pelosi became the first female House speaker in 2007. For four years, she marshalled legislation that included an ethics bill to tighten lobbying rules and a bill prohibiting discrimination on the basis of genetic information. \n The latter, co-authored by Rep. Slaughter, was designed to prevent insurance providers from rejecting coverage for healthy people predisposed to cancer and other diseases.\n Among her greatest achievements was helping shepherd the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, during which she said she received a death threat and her district office window was smashed with a rock. She remained nonchalant, however, even while inspiring Republican rage over a short-lived proposal known as \u201cthe Slaughter Strategy,\u201d in which she considered passing the Senate version of Obamacare without an up-or-down vote \u2014 a tactic, she noted, that her Republican colleagues had sometimes used themselves.\n \u201cWe are about to unleash a cultural war in this country!\u201d Rep.

Slaughter described herself as the only microbiologist on Capitol Hill, and in recent years fought to establish stringent restrictions on the use of antibiotics in healthy cattle \u2014 a leading factor, she argued, in the rise of drug-resistant bacteria. She often pointed toward a Food and Drug Administration report which found that in 2009, out of all the antibiotics sold for use by people and livestock, 80 percent went to cattle.\n \u201cThese statistics tell the tale of an industry that is rampantly misusing antibiotics in an attempt to cover up filthy, unsanitary living conditions among animals,\u201d she told the New York Times in 2011. \u201cAs they feed antibiotics to animals to keep them healthy, they are making our families sicker by spreading these deadly strains of bacteria.\u201d\n Rep. Slaughter was unable to pass restrictive antibiotics legislation. But her proposal, introduced in each congressional session since 2007, helped draw national attention to the issue. In 2015, President Barack Obama announced a $1.2 billion, five-year plan to identify emerging \u201csuperbugs\u201d and increase funding for new antibiotics and vaccines.\n Dorothy Louise McIntosh was born in Harlan County, in southeastern Kentucky, on Aug. 14, 1929.

Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told a press gaggle Tuesday night, \u201cEvery time you talk with Putin and you give him a pass, that emboldens him.

Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. \u201cThe United States should recognize Putin as the leader of a repressive government that seeks to export its model of denying fundamental freedoms, and its intolerance of opposition.\u201d\n Likewise, David Kramer, former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, wryly observed, \u201cIf he had to call at all, Trump should have called Putin on Saturday, the day before the so-called election, to congratulate him since the outcome was already known, with Putin having ensured \u2018victory\u2019 with the murder in 2015 of one leading Russian opposition figure (Boris Nemtsov) and the disqualification of another ([Alexei] Navalny) on an absurd conviction.\u201d He cautioned, \u201cNo Western leader should have congratulated Putin because Russia didn\u2019t hold an election in any true sense of that word.

Research on gun violence is notoriously underfunded, but the data we do have shows that lawmakers can act to save lives from gun violence.\n\nThousands of people will descend on the Mall this week to protest gun violence in the United States. This movement should be informed by science, with specific policy proposals that could make a real impact.\n\nThe Las Vegas massacre. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. The Virginia Tech slaughter. The massacre at the Texas First Baptist Church.\n\nThese are the five highest-casualty mass shootings in modern American history. And what did they all have in common? Semiautomatic weapons that allowed the shooter to fire into crowds without reloading.\n\nBased on the evidence we have, banning these weapons probably won\u2019t do too much to curb overall gun deaths. We know this because in 1994, Congress passed legislation to outlaw the sale of certain types of semiautomatic guns and large-capacity magazines, and the effect was unimpressive. Gun homicide rates declined during the ban, but they also fell after the ban expired in 2004. One federally funded study of the ban found that the effect on violence was insignificant, partly because it was full of loopholes.\n\nBut banning so-called assault weapons was never meant to reduce overall gun deaths. It was meant to reduce gun deaths from mass shootings \u2014 even if these represent a small portion of gun violence.\n\nAnd in fact, mass shooting casualties dipped during the ban, although a review of studies by the Rand Corporation found the effect of the ban on mass shootings to be inconclusive. We need to know more.\n\nBut research shows that semiautomatic weapons and weapons with high-capacity magazines are more dangerous than other weapons in shooting events. One older study of handgun attacks in New Jersey shows that gunfire incidents involving semiautomatic weapons wounded 15 percent more people than shootings with other weapons. Another more recent study from Minneapolis found that shootings with more than 10 shots fired accounted for between 20 and 28 percent of gun victims in the city.\n\nSo how do we keep such dangerous weapons from being used in crime? A ban on assault weapons might help, as data from a few cities during the 1994 ban suggest:\n\nBut experts say focusing on reducing large-capacity magazines might be more effective. Simply put, gunmen are less deadly when they have to reload.\n\nSuch a ban might take time to have an effect, as a Post investigation shows. But it would be worth it. Alarmingly, local crime data suggest that crimes committed with high-powered weapons have been on the rise since the 1994 ban ended.\n\nAgain, mass shootings account for a small piece of the puzzle, so any ban on these weapons and magazines would result in marginal improvements, at best. But even if this step reduced shootings by 1 percent \u2014 far less than what the Minneapolis study suggests \u2014 that would mean 650 fewer people shot a year. Isn\u2019t that worth it?\n\nKeep guns away from kids\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve heard proposals to raise age limits for semiautomatic weapons. Taken alone, this would do very little. Since 2009, men under 21 committed two mass shootings with semiautomatic rifles. And one of those shootings involved a gun purchased illegally.\n\nBut expanding existing age limits to all guns might be more effective, since young people are far more likely to commit homicide than older ones. One survey of inmates found that setting a minimum age requirement of 21 could have prohibited gun possession in 17 percent of cases in which people legally owned a gun and used it to commit a crime.\n\nOf course, keeping guns out of the hands of young shooters would be difficult, because it\u2019s so easy for people to obtain guns illegally. But age limits in general have proven to be effective in limiting bad behavior, so it\u2019s worth trying.\n\nThere\u2019s another reform that could be even more effective at keeping guns from kids: requiring gun owners to securely store firearms in a locked container or with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock.\n\nNearly 2 million minors in the United States live in homes where firearms are loaded and easy to access. And alarmingly, one study found that of the teens who had guns in their home who had attempted suicide in the past year, 40 percent had easy access to the firearm. Another study from the federal government shows that 68 percent of school shootings are perpetrated by shooters who obtain a gun from their homes or the homes of relatives.\n\nIn Massachusetts, which has the strictest safe-storage laws in the country, guns are used in just 9 percent of youth suicides, compared with 42 percent nationally. The suicide death rate among youth in the state is 38 percent below the national average.\n\nThe Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence also reports that states requiring locks on handguns in at least some circumstances have 40 percent fewer suicides per capita and 68 percent fewer firearm suicides per capita than states without such laws.\n\nMeanwhile, another safety innovation is being developed: smart guns. These are guns that use fingerprint recognition and other means so that only their owners can fire them. The technology is still relatively new, but it\u2019s promising. One small study found that over seven years, 37 percent of gun deaths could have been prevented by smart guns. Lawmakers could encourage their use by incorporating them into laws regulating safe storage.\n\nHere\u2019s a general rule: The more guns there are, the more gun deaths there will be.\n\nIt holds across countries (note how much the United States stands out):\n\nAnd across states. One 2013 study from Boston University found that for every percentage point increase in gun ownership at the state level, there was a 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.\n\nSo how do we reduce the steady flow of guns? Three ideas:\n\nIn the 1990s, Australia spent $500 million to buy back almost 600,000 guns. Harvard University researchers found that the gun homicide rate dropped 42 percent in the seven years following the law and the gun suicide rate fell 58 percent.\n\nAn Australian study found that for every 3,500 guns withdrawn per 100,000 people, the government was able to achieve a 74 percent drop in gun suicides.\n\nIn fact, since the ban, the country has not experienced another mass shooting. That doesn\u2019t proves causation. But the likelihood it\u2019s due to chance? Roughly 1 in 200,000, according to a recent paper.\n\nOf course, the United States is different from Australia. The Australian buyback was mandatory, which would probably run into constitutional problems here. Plus, we have way more guns per capita, so the United States would have to spend exponentially more to make a significant difference.\n\nStill, given Australia\u2019s trends, it\u2019s worth at least experimentation. Perhaps the government can use buyback programs to target specific kinds of weapons, such as semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity magazines.\n\n2. Limit the number of guns people can buy at one time\n\nFederal gun enforcers have long warned that state laws allowing bulk purchases of guns enable crime. Older studies from what is now called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that as many as 1 in 5 handguns recovered in a crime were originally purchased as part of a sale in which multiple guns were purchased.\n\nTo combat this behavior, some states have instituted \u201cone handgun a month\u201d policies, such as Virginia in 1993. At the time, Virginia was the top supplier of guns seized in the Northeast. Three years later, the state dropped to eighth. Research also shows that the Virginia law was effective in reducing criminal firearms sent to nearby states. It also led to a 35 percent reduction in guns recovered anywhere in the United States that were traced back to Virginia.\n\nSuch a policy isn\u2019t going to solve gun trafficking. The Virginia law didn\u2019t prevent \u201cstraw purchases\u201d in which traffickers pay people to buy guns legally so they can be sold elsewhere. In fact, Virginia remained the eighth-top supplier of illegal guns even after it repealed its one-handgun-a-month law in 2012.\n\nBut experts say one-gun-a-month laws make it more costly for criminals to traffic guns. And given the success in the past, such policies are worth promoting.\n\nResearch has shown that in some cities, guns used to commit crimes often come from a small set of gun dealers. In Milwaukee, for example, a single dealer was linked to a majority of the guns used in the city\u2019s crime.\n\nSo how do we stop the flow of those guns? Hold dealers accountable.\n\nIn 1999, the federal government published a report identifying gun shops connected with crime guns, including that Milwaukee dealer. In response to negative publicity, that dealer changed its sales practices. Afterward, the city saw a 76 percent reduction in the flow of new guns from that shop to criminals and a 44 percent reduction in new crime guns overall. But in 2003, Congress passed a law prohibiting the government from publishing such data, after which the rate of new gun sales from that dealer to criminals shot up 200 percent.\n\nStudies show that regulation of licensed dealers \u2014 such as record-keeping requirements or inspection mandates \u2014 can also reduce interstate trafficking. So can litigation against gun dealers that allow their guns to enter criminal markets. One sting operation conducted by New York City reduced the probability of guns from the dealers they targeted ending up in the hands of criminals by 84 percent.\n\nFederal law requires background checks to obtain a gun, but those checks are extremely porous.\n\nUnder federal law, only licensed gun dealers have to perform these background checks. Private individuals and many online retailers don\u2019t. That leaves a lot of gun owners \u2014 about 42 percent, according to one survey published in 2017 \u2014 who didn\u2019t undergo a background check for a gun purchase. So what happens when states go beyond federal laws and require all handgun sales to undergo a background check? Fewer gun deaths.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, those states had 35 percent fewer gun deaths per capita than those without the requirement. Those states also have 53 percent fewer firearm suicides and 31 percent fewer overall suicides per capita.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t prove causation. In fact, a few states with expanded background checks have relatively high gun-death rates.\n\nBut we do know most gun offenders obtain their weapons through unlicensed sellers. One survey of state prison inmates convicted of offenses committed with guns in 13 states found that only 13 percent obtained their guns from a seller that had to conduct a background check. Among those who were supposed to be prohibited from possessing a firearm, nearly all of them got their hands on one through suppliers that didn\u2019t have to conduct a background check. Closing that loophole might help, although it\u2019s questionable to what degree, since black markets already feed the flow of crime.\n\nWhat else can we do to strengthen background checks? Three possibilities:\n\nMost gun background checks are instant. But some \u2014 around 9 percent \u2014 take more time, and federal law says if it takes more than three business days, the sale can proceed. As a result, thousands of people who were not supposed have access to guns ended up getting them, as the Government Accountability Office reported.\n\nAmong the people who benefited from this loophole? Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. Ending this practice would save lives.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2014, an average of 760 Americans were killed with guns annually by their spouses, ex-spouses or dating partners, according to an Associated Press analysis.\n\nFederal law prevents anyone with domestic violence misdemeanors from having a gun, but that law is defined narrowly and doesn\u2019t include all domestic violence perpetrators \u2014 for example, boyfriends. More specifically, the law doesn\u2019t keep guns from abusers who are not married, do not live with their partner or do not share a child with them.\n\nSome states have expanded on federal law \u2014 and it works. One study found that domestic-violence-related homicide rates decline 7 percent after a state passes such laws.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that waiting periods reduce violent crime. But we\u2019re pretty sure they prevent suicides.\n\nResearch shows that people who buy handguns are at higher risk of suicide within a week of the purchase, and that waiting periods can keep them from using guns to commit suicide. In fact, one study found that when South Dakota repealed its 48-hour waiting period in 2012, suicides jumped 7.6 percent in the following year.\n\nMental illness is associated with a relatively small portion (around 5 percent) of gun homicides. Federal law already prohibits anyone committed to a mental-health facility or deemed dangerous or lacking all mental capacities through a legal proceeding from having a gun.\n\nBut mental-health records are notoriously spotty. There\u2019s limited evidence that improved reporting at the state level might reduce violent crimes. Connecticut started reporting mental-health data to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2007, and one study found that violent crimes committed by people with mental illness there significantly decreased.\n\nWe can also make it easier for family members to help loved ones with mental illness, by letting them seek court orders to disarm relatives who might do harm to themselves. In Connecticut, which has allowed this since 1999, one study estimates that the law averted 72 suicide attempts through 2013 from being fatal.\n\nConsider two data points: first in Connecticut, then in Missouri.\n\nIn Connecticut, state lawmakers required people to get a license and safety training for a gun, just as we do for cars. In the decade after, it saw a drop in both gun homicides and suicides \u2014 at faster rates than other states without similar laws. And at the same time, Connecticut saw no significant drop in homicides not related to guns.\n\nIn Missouri, the state legislature repealed its licensing requirements in 2007.\n\nA study found that the law change was associated with an additional 55 to 63 homicides in each of the five years following the repeal \u2014 even as homicides committed without guns dropped.\n\nIn both cases, it\u2019s hard to prove a connection. But these experiences do strongly suggest something we learned in our decades-long efforts to reduce vehicle-related deaths: Regulation saves lives.\n\nIt can also deter crime. Research from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns has found that guns sold in states with licensing laws \u2014 which are sometimes paired with mandatory registration of guns with local police \u2014 end up being exported for criminal activity at one-third the rate of states without the laws.\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s much harder to feed guns into illegal markets if police can trace them to their legal gun owners.

The idea of arming some teachers has been controversial and has drawn sharp opposition from the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers lobby, among other groups.\n Many of the student survivors have urged Washington to toughen restrictions on gun purchases, but such measures are fiercely opposed by the National Rifle Association, and the Trump plan does not include any substantial changes to gun laws.\n Rather, the president is establishing a Federal Commission on School Safety, to be chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, that will explore possible solutions, such as the age requirement for purchases, officials said.\n DeVos characterized the administration\u2019s efforts as \u201ca pragmatic plan to dramatically increase school safety.\u201d\n   President Trump watches as Julia Cordover, Parkland student body president, speaks during a listening session on gun violence at the White House on Feb. 21, (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) \n \u201cWe are committed to working quickly because there\u2019s no time to waste,\u201d DeVos said on a Sunday evening conference call with reporters. Invoking past mass school shootings, she continued, \u201cNo student, no family, no teacher and no school should have to live the horror of Parkland or Sandy Hook or Columbine again.\u201d\n The administration\u2019s proposals come after 17 people were shot and killed last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., a massacre that spurred officials in Washington to reevaluate gun laws.\n Trump has said he was personally moved by the shooting \u2014 and by the persistent and impassioned calls for action from some of the teenage survivors as well as parents of the victims \u2014 and elevated the issue of school safety in his administration. He has called for raising the minimum age for purchasing an AR-15 or similar-style rifles from 18 to 21 years old.\n \u201cNow, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I\u2019m saying it anyway,\u201d Trump said in a Feb. 28 meeting with lawmakers. \u201cYou can buy a handgun \u2014 you can\u2019t buy one; you have to wait until you\u2019re 21.\u00a0But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18.\u00a0I think it\u2019s something you have to think about.\u201d\n But the White House plan released Sunday does not address the minimum age for gun purchases. Pressed by reporters about the apparent backtracking, a senior administration said the age issue was \u201ca state-based discussion right now\u201d and would be explored by DeVos\u2019s commission.\n  [\u2018I love this place.\u2019 Trump campaigns for Pa. candidate but keeps spotlight on himself] \n At a political rally Saturday night in Pennsylvania, Trump mocked the idea of commissions to solve the nation\u2019s drug epidemic.\n \u201cDo you think the drug dealers who kill thousands of people during their lifetime, do you think they care who\u2019s on a blue-ribbon committee?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness.\u201d\n Administration officials demurred Sunday night when asked why Trump found commissions an inadequate response to the drug epidemic but an appropriate way to respond to gun massacres. \n \u201cThere are not going to be one-size-fits-all approaches and solutions, and I think that that is a very cogent argument for having a commission,\u201d said a senior administration official, who would only answer questions from reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n The centerpiece of the administration\u2019s plan is Trump\u2019s vow to \u201charden our schools against attack.\u201d Since almost immediately after the Parkland shooting, the president has advocated arming some teachers as a solution to stopping future massacres.\n \u201cA gun-free zone to a maniac \u2014 because they\u2019re all cowards \u2014 a gun-free zone is, let\u2019s go in and let\u2019s attack, because bullets aren\u2019t coming back at us,\u201d Trump said during a Feb. 22 listening session at the White House with teachers, students and parents.\n The administration will start working with states to provide \u201crigorous firearms training\u201d to teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to be armed, said Andrew Bremberg, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. The White House has not proposed offering states new funding for this training.\n Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the NEA, the teachers\u2019 lobby, said last month that \u201cbringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms.\u201d\n The NRA supports the idea of allowing armed teachers in schools.\n Bremberg said the administration is backing two pieces of legislation: A bipartisan bill by Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that is designed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System; and the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize state-based grants to implement violence prevention training for teachers and students.\n The administration also is urging all states to pass risk protection orders, as Florida recently did, allowing law enforcement officers to remove firearms from individuals who are considered a threat to themselves or others and to prevent them from purchasing new guns, Bremberg said.\n Lastly, the administration wants to better integrate mental health, primary care and family services programs, and the president has ordered a full audit and review of the FBI tip line, he said. The FBI has said it ignored a warning that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz might attack a school just weeks before he allegedly carried out the rampage in Parkland.\n \u201cThe president is determined to get to the root of the various societal issues that lead to violence in our country,\u201d Bremberg said. \u201cNo stone will be unturned.\u201d\n At the Department of Justice, meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Saturday took an incremental step toward banning bump stocks, devices that can make semiautomatic weapons fire like fully automatic firearms.\n Sessions submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a proposed regulation on bump stocks. The proposal still requires that office\u2019s approval, and once that is complete, it must be published and public comments considered before it becomes reality. \n While some gun control advocates welcomed the move, others argued that it would still be better for Congress to pass legislation banning the devices. Federal officials had in years past concluded they could not legally regulate bump stocks, and the new move to do so is likely to be met with lawsuits from manufacturers of the devices.\n For its part, the NRA does not oppose regulating bump stocks under existing law, but does object to new legislation.\n In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott (R) defied the NRA last Friday by signing into law a new set of gun regulations that imposes a three-day waiting period for most purchases of long guns, raises the minimum age for buying those weapons to 21 and bans the possession of bump stocks.\n \u201cI am going to do what I think are common-sense solutions,\u201d Scott said after the signing. \u201cI think this is the beginning. There is now going to be a real conversation about how we make our schools safe.\u201d\n  [Florida Gov. Rick Scott breaks with NRA to sign new gun regulations] \n But the new Florida restrictions have drawn opposition from some Republicans nationally. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he does not support raising the age to purchase long guns, such as AR-15 rifles that have been used in many of the recent mass shootings.\n \u201cWe send our sons and daughters over to Afghanistan, in Iraq,\u201d at age 18, Johnson said. \u201cThey defend our freedoms. I think if they do that, they ought to be able to buy a hunting rifle.\u201d\n Trump has vacillated in his public pronouncements about guns. He and Republican leaders in Congress have been afraid to cross the National Rifle Association ahead of the November midterm elections because the gun lobby has long been a powerful force mobilizing conservative activists in elections.\n At his Feb. 28 meeting with lawmakers, Trump sounded open to new restrictions on gun purchase. \u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d he said, winning the approval of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and other Democrats who have long sought to toughen gun laws and ban semiautomatic assault rifles.\n But NRA leaders then met privately with Trump and the president had an apparent change of tune and backed off more restrictive proposals. Last week, Trump met personally in the Oval Office with Kyle Kashuv, a Stoneman Douglas student who has become one of his school\u2019s few pro-gun rights activists with his frequent appearances on Fox News Channel.\n Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Eli Rosenberg", "body": "Rep.

But I also agree with what Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his majority opinion in 2008\u2019s landmark Heller case: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d It is \u201cnot a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d\n It is clear we have a problem with the gun laws in this country.

Following each of these senseless, tragic events there\u2019s a great deal of idle, fruitless talk in the halls of Congress, and then the conversation quickly comes to an end. \n It\u2019s our great hope and belief that this time will be different. It has to be different.\n Maybe it\u2019s because the survivors of the Parkland, Fla., massacre \u2014 and the thousands of students who made their feelings known for 17 minutes last week \u2014 are standing up and shouting \u201cenough is enough\u201d and \u201cnever again.\u201d They are demanding that our elected officials come together to find solutions.

We have met with a number of lawmakers and have talked with many of our peers in the retail industry. We have spoken with strong-willed advocacy groups and visited with families in Parkland.\n It is becoming increasingly apparent through our conversations that there continues to be deep skepticism that anything of substance will be done.\n Some members of Congress are committed to change, but not enough are willing to set aside partisanship to find a solution.

(Joshua Roberts/Reuters).\n \n Politicians, economics and\u00a0executives agree China isn't playing fair on trade. But there's a lot of disagreement about whether President Trump's hefty tariffs are the right weapon for fighting back. American farmers and Walmart shoppers are\u00a0likely to feel pain in this fight, and a lot of them voted for Trump.\n There are two ways Americans are highly likely to get hurt in a U.S.-China trade spat. First, prices on a lot of items will almost certainly rise and second, China is going to hit back with tariffs on American products.\n In many U.S. stores, \u201cMade in China\u201d labels and stamps are on tons of T-shirts, shoes, plastic Easter eggs and water bottles, among other goods. Tariffs are basically taxes that mean Americans will pay more when they shop. That's especially true for low-income families\u00a0who spend a higher share of their paycheck on goods, and often buy the cheapest products, families that Trump often thinks of as his base.\n \u201cLots of stuff we import from China is for the Walmart shopper,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIf you start to increase the price of clothing, sheets, etc., lower-income households would feel it more.\u201d\n Top retailers from Walmart to Apple have sent letters to Trump urging him not to do this because it would worsen inequality and\u00a0 \u201cpunish American working families with higher prices.\u201d The Tax Foundation pointed out that Trump's tariffs on China would cancel out about 20 percent of the benefits of the recent GOP tax cuts.\n [ Trump goes after China, announcing $50 billion of new tariffs ]\n The other knock is expected to come when China fights back. Senior Chinese officials have made it clear they'll take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to retaliate for Trump's tariffs. All indications from Beijing are that China's counter-tariffs will\u00a0target goods and jobs in parts of America that voted for Trump. At the top of China's list are agricultural products likes soybeans and hogs.\n Soybeans and grains are the second largest U.S. export to China. Trump carried eight of the top 10 soy-producing states, and the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin are both in the top 15 soybean producers, according to USDA data. Airplanes, the top U.S. export to China, could also end up on the Chinese hit list.\n  \u201cThere is virtually certain to be Chinese retaliation aimed largely on U.S. agriculture,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. \u201cMost of Trump's policies hurt his base, and this could be a real problem in places like the Midwest.\u201d\n In a best-case scenario, Trump does his tariffs, China responds with its tariffs and then the two sides decide to cool down and talk. The whole ordeal is short-lived. But the reason the stock market fell sharply \u2014 with the Dow down about 500 points at one point on Thursday \u2014 is that this trade spat could turn into an all-out trade war. That would last longer and make the pain far more widespread on consumers and specific U.S. industries and workers.\n The U.S. may \u201cjust be warming up here and we would hit them again,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has advised the administration on China trade policy. \u201cI think it will end up being Round 1.\u201d\n Trump fanned those concerns Thursday when he signed the tariff announcement and told the crowd of onlookers, \u201cThis is the first of many.\u201d\n Consider the numbers: Trump is starting with tariffs on\u00a0 at least $50 billion of Chinese goods or about 10 percent of the roughly $500 billion worth of Chinese goods and services that come to the U.S. (White House officials have put the figure at $50 billion although Trump himself has mentioned $60 billion).\u00a0\u00a0The bigger tariff figure gets, the more it will be felt by people on both sides of the Pacific.\n Trump and his top advisers dismiss such concerns. They argue that even if consumers have to pay a bit more, it's worth it because it would save U.S. jobs and industries.\n \u201cIt's important to put this action in context. As a practical matter, China benefits far more from the U.S.-China trade relationship than the U.S. does,\u201d said Peter Navarro, a senior Trump adviser who has been driving trade policy. \u201cThe trade deficit results in 2 million more jobs in China and 2 million less here.\u201d\n What has stopped trade spats in the past is foreign countries hitting back at politically sensitive industries located in parts of America that the president and his party want to keep happy. In 2002,\u00a0 President George W. Bush's steel tariffs ended early after the European Union readied tariffs on Florida oranges and North and South Carolina textiles. Bush didn't want to anger voters in Florida, a state he narrowly won in his first election by\u00a0only a few hundred votes.\n The Chinese are eyeing soybeans and pork products, and with good reason. Heading into the midterms 2018 elections, Trump might have a hard time convincing voters in the top 10 soybean-exporting states that tariffs are a good idea.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n The controversies surrounding members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet have caused upheaval within the administration, prompting White House officials to scramble in an effort to avert any further political fallout and to summon agency leaders for face-to-face ethics meetings. \n Revelations about repeated use of chartered airplanes forced the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in September. More recently, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has continued to wrestle with the fallout of news that taxpayers covered the expenses for his wife during a 10-day trip to Europe last year \u2014 and more recently that his chief of staff doctored an email and made false statements to justify the payments. \n Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has faced public criticism and the scrutiny of government investigators for his own frequent first-class travels and for other expenditures he made using public funding. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that new records showed a soundproof phone booth installed in Pruitt\u2019s office cost $43,000 \u2014 $18,000 more than previously disclosed. \n At the Interior Department, Secretary Ryan Zinke has faced inquiries about his travel practices, and last fall an official in the agency\u2019s inspector general office wrote that he had failed to properly document his trips since taking office. \n And at HUD, public records released this week detail how Carson\u2019s wife was closely involved in the redecorating of his office at the agency, including the purchase of a $31,561 dining set. \n Barry Bennett, who served as Carson\u2019s presidential campaign manager and then informally advised Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, wrote in an email that in many instances Cabinet members are unaware of the actual costs stemming from their actions. He said Carson often complained about staying in fancy hotels on the campaign trail because their rooms didn\u2019t readily offer an ironing board and iron \u2014 which he relied on to press his own clothes.\n Still, Bennett added, \u201cthese are unforced errors\u201d that the White House needs to halt. \n   Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke speaks during the daily briefing at the White House on April 3, 2017.

At their power, level anything is possible.\u201d\n Even as new revelations have surfaced, in part through numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, Trump\u2019s deputies have pushed back against accusations that they have misspent taxpayer funds.\n During a hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Zinke defended his use of charter planes for various trips, including to Montana, Alaska and the U.S. Virgin Islands. He labeled questions about this travels as \u201cinnuendos,\u201d arguing that his predecessor at the department took similar trips at taxpayer expense. \n \u201cI resent the fact of your insults. I resent the fact they\u2019re misleading,\u201d Zinke told Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who had asked him about a $12,375 flight Zinke chartered from Las Vegas to near his home in Montana. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, added later, \u201cI\u2019ve been shot at before, I\u2019m very comfortable with it. Do right, fear no man, do the best you can.\u201d\n Carson has used his personal Twitter account to defend his family\u2019s integrity, including after The Post reported that HUD lawyers warned him he risked running afoul of federal ethics rules by allowing his son and daughter-in-law to help organize a listening tour to Baltimore last summer.\n Referring to a complaint to HUD\u2019s special counsel about redecorating his office, Carson tweeted on Feb. 28, \u201cWe suspect, based on past attempts, that they will continue to probe and make further accusations even without evidence or substantiation. We will continue to ask for God\u2019s guidance to do what is right.\u201d\n Last month, at least four Cabinet members \u2014 Carson, Pruitt, Shulkin and Zinke \u2014 met separately with White House Cabinet Secretary William McGinley to discuss proper ethics practices, according to multiple administration officials familiar with the sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. \n The meetings, first reported by CNN, included handouts with ethics advice and a discussion about how not to violate federal laws when traveling to campaign for political candidates. The tips included, \u201cYou are the best guardian of your reputation. Your record-keeping practices must be designed with a purpose to prove innocence at the complaint phase or with the press,\u201d and \u201cEven if legal, does not mean you should do it \u2014 always consider optics.\u201d \n The sessions \u201cwere not confrontational, were not adversarial,\u201d said one White House official.\n \u201cWe are in the process of meeting with all of the Cabinet for discussions,\u201d the official added, \u201cjust so they can understand that the level of scrutiny is so high that they need to be aware of perception, in addition to ethical and lawful behavior.\u201d\n At times, White House officials have made it clear to outsiders that they are scrutizing Cabinet members closely. Two weeks ago, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with veterans service organizations to discuss the current turmoil at the VA. Several representatives told him that Shulkin was being undermined at the department by an insurrection of high-level White House appointees who disagree with many of his policies, according to three people in attendance. \n They expected to get sympathy from Kelly. But Kelly told the representatives that from his perspective, their observations made a good case that Shulkin should be fired, because the secretary had not been able to keep his troops in line.\n Singleton, a conservative political commentator who serves as communications director for Howard Stirk Holdings, said some of the conservatives he spends time with have \u201clowered\u201d expectations of Trump given the recent spate of scandals, \u201cbecause the president promised he would not do things the way they had been done in the past.\n \u201cThere is some disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those people remain particularly loyal to him,\u201d he said.\n  \nLisa Rein contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "John Kiriakou", "body": "I was inside the CIA\u2019s Langley, Va., headquarters on Sept. 11, 2001. Like all Americans, I was traumatized, and I volunteered to go overseas to help bring al-Qaeda\u2019s leaders to justice. I headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan from January to May 2002. My team captured dozens of al-Qaeda fighters, including senior training-camp commanders. One of the fighters whom I played an integral role in capturing was Abu Zubaida, mistakenly thought at the time to be the third-ranking person in the militant group. \n By that May, the CIA had decided to torture him. When I returned to CIA headquarters that month, a senior officer in the Counterterrorism Center asked me if I wanted to be \u201ctrained in the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d I had never heard the term, so I asked what it meant. After a brief explanation, I declined. I said that I had a moral and ethical problem with torture and that \u2014 the judgment of the Justice Department notwithstanding \u2014 I thought it was illegal.\n Unfortunately, there were plenty of people in the U.S. government who were all too willing to allow the practice to go on. One of them was Gina Haspel, whom President Trump nominated Tuesday as the CIA\u2019s next director.\n Putting Haspel in charge of the CIA would undo attempts by the agency \u2014 and the nation \u2014 to repudiate torture. The message this sends to the CIA workforce is simple: Engage in war crimes, in crimes against humanity, and you\u2019ll get promoted. Don\u2019t worry about the law. Don\u2019t worry about ethics. Don\u2019t worry about morality or the fact that\u00a0torture doesn\u2019t even work. Go ahead and do it anyway. We\u2019ll cover for you. And you can destroy the evidence, too.\n Described in the media as a \u201cseasoned intelligence veteran,\u201d Haspel has been at the CIA for 33 years, both at headquarters and in senior positions overseas. Now the deputy director, she has tried hard to stay out of the public eye. Mike Pompeo, the outgoing CIA director and secretary of state designee, has lauded her \u201cuncanny ability to get things done and inspire those around her.\u201d \n I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true for some. But many of the rest of us who knew and worked with Haspel at the CIA called her \u201cBloody Gina.\u201d\n The CIA will not let me repeat her r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u00a0or the widely reported specifics of how her work fit into the agency\u2019s torture program, calling such details \u201ccurrently and properly classified.\u201d But I can say that Haspel was a protege of and chief of staff for Jose Rodriguez, the CIA\u2019s notorious former deputy director for operations and former director of the Counterterrorism Center.\u00a0And that Rodriguez\u00a0eventually\u00a0assigned Haspel to order the detruction of\u00a0videotaped evidence of the torture of Abu Zubaida. The Justice Department investigated, but no one was ever charged in connection with the incident. \n CIA officers and psychologists under contract to the agency began torturing Abu Zubaida on Aug. 1, 2002.\u00a0The techniques were supposed to be incremental, starting with an open-palmed slap to the belly or the face. But the operatives\u00a0where he was held decided to start with the toughest method. They waterboarded Abu Zubaida 83 times. They later subjected him to sleep deprivation; they kept him locked in a large dog cage for weeks at a time; they locked him in a coffin-size box and, knowing that he had an irrational fear of insects, put bugs in it with him.\u00a0\n Rodriguez would later tell reporters\u00a0that the torture worked and that Abu Zubaida provided actionable intelligence that disrupted attacks and saved American lives. We know, thanks to the\u00a0Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on CIA torture and the personal testimony of\u00a0FBI interrogator Ali Soufan , that this was false.\n  [Torture is not a public relations problem] \n I knew what was happening to Abu Zubaida because of my position in CIA operations at the time. I kept my mouth shut\u00a0about it,\u00a0even after I left the CIA in 2004. But by 2007, I had had enough.\u00a0\n President George W. Bush had steadfastly denied to the American people that there was a torture program. I knew that was a lie. I knew torture didn\u2019t work. And I knew it was illegal. So in December 2007, I granted an\u00a0interview to ABC News in which I said that the CIA was torturing its prisoners, that torture was official U.S. government policy and that the policy had been personally approved by the president. The FBI began investigating me immediately.\u00a0\n A year later, the Justice Department concluded that I had not committed a crime. But CIA leaders were still furious that I had aired the agency\u2019s dirty laundry. The CIA asked the new Obama Justice Department to reopen the case against me. It did, and three years later, I was\u00a0charged with five felonies , including three counts of espionage, resulting from that ABC News interview and\u00a0a subsequent interview with the New York Times . Of course, I hadn\u2019t committed espionage, and the charges were eventually dropped, but only after I agreed to plea to a lesser charge. I served 23 months in prison for my whistleblowing.\n It was worth every day. Largely because the CIA\u2019s conduct became public, Congress has specifically prohibited waterboarding and other techniques that the agency used at the secret sites. A ban on torture is now the law of the land. \n  [Psychologists are facing consequences for helping with torture. It\u2019s not enough.] \n But while I went to prison for disclosing the torture program, Haspel is about to get a promotion despite her connection to it.\u00a0Trump\u2019s move hurts morale among CIA officers who recognize that torture is wrong. It comforts people at the agency who still believe \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d is somehow acceptable. I spoke with a senior officer this past week who said, \u201cThe more things change, the more they stay the same.\u201d There\u2019s an attitude of defeatism among opponents of torture.\n And the\u00a0message\u00a0it sends to our friends and allies (and the\u00a0countries we criticize in the State Department\u2019s annual\u00a0human rights reports) is this:\u00a0We say we\u2019re a shining city on a hill, a beacon of respect for human rights, civil rights, civil liberties and the rule of law.\u00a0But actually,\u00a0that\u2019s nonsense. We say those things when it\u2019s expedient. We say them to make ourselves feel good. But when push comes to shove, we do what we want, international law be damned.\n  [Trump will have vast powers. He can thank Obama for them.] \n The meaning of Haspel\u2019s nomination won\u2019t be\u00a0lost on our enemies, either. The torture program and similar abuses at military-run prisons in Iraq were among the greatest recruitment tools that al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other bad actors ever had, according to legal experts, U.S. lawmakers and even to the militants themselves. It energized them and gave them something to rally against. It sowed an even deeper hatred of the United States among militant groups. It swelled their ranks. It was no coincidence that the Islamic State paraded its prisoners in front of cameras wearing orange jumpsuits (like those worn by Guantanamo Bay detainees) before beheading them. Haspel and the others at the CIA who engineered and oversaw the torture program are at least partially responsible for that, because they showed the world how the United States sometimes treats captives.\u00a0\n Do we\u00a0Americans\u00a0want to\u00a0remain a nation\u00a0that tortures people, like North Korea, China and Iran?\u00a0Are we proud of the era when we\u00a0snatched people from one country and\u00a0sent\u00a0them to another to be interrogated\u00a0in secret prisons? Do we want to be the country that cynically preaches human rights and then violates those same rights when we think nobody is looking?\u00a0\n Our country cannot afford that. We cannot look the other way. We cannot reward the torturers.

And, as those long-sought dreams come to life, America\u2019s role as a defender of democracy and freedom is fading fast.\n Here are the facts: Putin is a ruthless despot. His regime murders political rivals, dissidents, and journalists. Russia has no genuinely independent media, and state-controlled outlets endlessly parrot Putin\u2019s chosen messages. Russian elections are clearly rigged.\n Those domestic tactics reverberate globally. Putin is complicit in facilitating war crimes in Syria. He snatched Crimea from a sovereign Ukraine, stoking conflict with covertly deployed Russian troops. And in the West, the Kremlin attacked democracy in America and in Europe, using a sophisticated blend of hacking and information warfare to sow chaos and undermine confidence in democratic institutions.\n Now Putin\u2019s regime appears to have used a chemical nerve-agent in an assassination attempt within Britain, America\u2019s closest and most powerful ally.\n Apparently none of this had any impact on Trump, who has savagely insulted those who defend America \u2014 the FBI, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Gold Star families \u2014 while relentlessly praising a foreign dictator who attacked the United States.\n In response to Putin\u2019s rigged reelection, Trump uncritically congratulated Putin, despite advice from his national security team that should have been difficult to misinterpret (\u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE,\u201d the guidance read). Worse, when White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether the Russian election was free and fair, she dodged, simply saying it wasn\u2019t America\u2019s place to \u201cdictate\u201d what happens in other countries.\n The correct response should have been \u201cNo.\u201d It would have been even better if she had added something along these lines: \u201cWe won\u2019t dignify Putin\u2019s sham \u2018election\u2019 with comment as it has no legitimacy. In the meantime, we stand with our ally, the United Kingdom, in solidarity against Russian aggression and unequivocally condemn their deployment of chemical weapons. We know friend from foe. Britain is our friend. And until the Kremlin stops its unacceptable attacks against the United States and its allies, Russia will be our foe.\u201d\n Of course, such a statement would require principled, moral leadership \u2014 which is about as plentiful in the White House these days as oxygen is in outer space.\n So, instead we got \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a presidential tweet praising Putin: \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n I guess we should just make nice with a world power that seeks to harm the United States and its allies at every possible opportunity? The Tweeter in chief has spoken.\n Trump made similar statements during the 2016 campaign. And yet, as Putin\u2019s aggression becomes increasingly brazen, Trump\u2019s embrace of him is unshakably enthusiastic. That is the very definition of appeasement. And as history teaches us, appeasement emboldens tyrants.\n Trump\u2019s praise for Putin also sends a clear signal to the rest of the world. The president of the United States openly admires dictators and despots, from the Philippines to Turkey to Egypt and China. Worse, Trump doesn\u2019t just praise them \u2014 he mimics what they do: Attacking the press. Threatening to jail his political rivals. Surrounding himself\u00a0in the West Wing with family members and unqualified cronies.\n How is the State Department supposed to promote freedom of the press abroad when Trump refers to journalists at home as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d? How are our diplomats supposed to press for the release of political prisoners overseas when Trump incessantly talks about jailing his own opponents? And just imagine trying to lecture another country about the dangers of nepotism.\n Well, apparently Trump realized that glaring hypocrisy, so instead of fixing it, he just stripped the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d from the State Department mission statement altogether.\n The modern Republican Party used to be the Party of Reagan, which depicted America as a \u201cshining city upon a hill\u201d that stood for democracy and freedom. \u201cAnd she\u2019s still a beacon,\u201d President Ronald Reagan said in his farewell address, \u201cstill a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.\u201d\n The Republican Party is now the Party of Trump. The \u201cbeacon\u201d is being snuffed out as America hurtles into its own darkness.

Haspel\u2019s selection faced immediate opposition from some lawmakers and human rights groups because of her prominent role in one of the agency\u2019s darkest chapters.\n Haspel was in charge of one of the CIA\u2019s \u201cblack site\u201d prisons where detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harrowing interrogation measures widely condemned as torture. \n When those methods were exposed and their legality came under scrutiny, Haspel was among a group of CIA officials involved in the decision to destroy videotapes of interrogation sessions that left some detainees on the brink of physical collapse.\n Trump announced the move on Twitter on Tuesday, saying that Pompeo would move to the State Department and that Haspel would \u201cbecome the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!\u201d\n Jameel Jaffer, formerly deputy legal director of the ACLU, said Tuesday on his Twitter feed that Haspel is \u201cquite literally a war criminal.\u201d\n  Haspel spent much of her 33-year CIA career in undercover assignments overseas and at CIA headquarters, including serving as the agency\u2019s top representative in London and as the acting head of its clandestine service in 2013.\n Current and former U.S. intelligence officials who have worked with Haspel praised her as an effective leader who could be expected to stand up to the pressures that Trump has often placed on spy agencies \u2014 including his denunciations of the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n Officials described Haspel as a consummate \u201cinsider\u201d and said CIA employees would greet her appointment with some relief, because an intelligence veteran would be back in charge. \n \u201cThe building will love the fact that she\u2019s an insider,\u201d said Mark Lowenthal, a former senior CIA officer. \n Pompeo, a former member of Congress who spent his early career in business, had no profile in the intelligence community apart from his leading role on a congressional committee investigating the terrorist attacks on a U.S. government facility in Benghazi, Libya. Career CIA officers have seen Pompeo as one of the most overtly political directors in the agency\u2019s history and a staunch public defender of the president.\n Haspel, by contrast, has almost no public profile. But she is a visible presence inside CIA headquarters, running day-to-day operations while Pompeo handles the public-facing aspects of the job, making speeches and media appearances, and meeting with the president. \n \u201cThis is not someone who has sharp elbows, but she is a sharp competitor,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss Haspel.\n Rumors of Pompeo\u2019s departure have flared up several times in recent months, and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) had often been mentioned as a leading replacement. Current intelligence officials reacted with alarm to that prospect. \u201cDisastrous\u201d is how one described a possible nomination of Cotton, who is widely seen as too political and inexperienced for the job. \n Pompeo\u2019s appointment inspired some of those same concerns, but he has been a staunch defender of the agency, and that has bolstered his credibility among career intelligence officers. \n Pompeo also had a strong rapport with the president, a quality that always makes a director valuable to the rank-and-file. But it\u2019s not clear that Haspel has the same close relationship with Trump. \n \u201cShe does bring continuity after Pompeo,\u201d said the former senior intelligence official, noting that the two were in accord on strengthening the agency\u2019s counterterrorism operations. \u201cThe question is, how much juice does she have in the White House?\u201d \n Inside CIA, Haspel has advocated a more aggressive approach to overseas operations. She had also led the agency\u2019s work on Russia, which could put her at odds with a president who has accused intelligence officials of trying to undermine his election by stating that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help get Trump elected.\n Her extensive involvement in a covert program that used harrowing interrogation measures on al-Qaeda suspects resurfaced last year when she was named deputy director of the CIA after Trump had signaled as a presidential candidate that he would consider reestablishing agency prisons and resuming interrogation methods that President Obama had banned. Trump never followed through on that plan, which was opposed by senior members of his administration including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.\n Haspel ran one of the first CIA black sites, a compound in Thailand code-named \u201cCat\u2019s Eye,\u201d where al-Qaeda suspects Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, better known as Abu Zubaida, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri were subjected to waterboarding and other techniques in 2002.\n An exhaustive Senate report on the program described the frightening toll inflicted. At one point, the report said, Zubaida was left \u201ccompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.\u201d \n Internal CIA memos cited in a Senate report on the agency\u2019s interrogation program described agency officials who witnessed the treatment as distraught and concerned about its legality. \u201cSeveral on the team profoundly affected,\u201d one agency employee wrote, \u201c...some to the point of tears and choking up.\u201d\n Haspel later served as chief of staff to the head of the agency\u2019s Counterterrorism Center, Jose Rodriguez, when he ordered the destruction of dozens of videotapes made at the Thailand site.\n Rodriguez wrote in his memoir that Haspel \u201cdrafted a cable\u201d ordering the tapes\u2019 destruction in 2005 as the program came under mounting public scrutiny and that he then \u201ctook a deep breath of weary satisfaction and hit Send.\u201d\n The Justice Department spent several years investigating alleged abuses in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes, but no charges were ever filed.\n When she was named deputy CIA director last year, the agency took the unusual step of soliciting testimonials from seven former top intelligence and congressional officials. Their statements of support were included in the agency\u2019s release. Former CIA director Michael Hayden described Haspel as \u201ca trusted friend, lieutenant and guide to the sometimes opaque corridors of American espionage.\u201d\n Some believe she had been unfairly penalized for her role in counterterrorism operations that were launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and carried out with the legal approval of the Justice Department.\n  Haspel was passed over in 2013 for a permanent assignment as head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service, although agency officials said the decision was not driven by her connection to the prisons controversy.\n  \nJulie Tate contributed to this report.\n   Read more: \n  In the end, no one was more surprised that Tillerson was fired than Tillerson", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "William Booth", "body": "LONDON \u2014 After asserting on Monday that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Russia was behind a poison attack against a former double agent in a quiet English town, Prime Minister Theresa May gave the Russian government a deadline to explain itself and where the rare and powerful \u201cweapons-grade\u201d nerve agent came from.\n As expected, May\u2019s deadline passed on Wednesday and Russia did not respond \u2014 or did not respond with the details or explanations that Britain sought.\u00a0\n Instead, Russian officials and state media assailed the British for whipping up \u201canti-Russia hysteria.\u201d The Kremlin rejected the \u201cunfounded accusations\u201d and shrugged off British demands.\n May vowed that without a \u201ccredible response\u201d from Moscow, she would return to Parliament on Wednesday \u201cto set out the full range of measures we will take.\u201d Her office declined to give a time for May\u2019s announcement of reprisals.\n British politicians and commentators said May could employ a range of diplomatic and financial sanctions \u2014 from clamping down on Russian oligarchs\u2019 property-buying binge in London to tossing out embassy staff.\u00a0\n May could also ask the European Union, or even NATO, to join in a response to what she described as a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate\u201d attack, which not only endangered the lives of its two principal victims, the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, but also potentially exposed scores of others to the nerve agent, including a police officer who remains hospitalized.\n Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006 for selling state secrets to British intelligence for 10 years, but he was released in 2010 as part of a high-profile spy swap. He and his daughter remain in critical condition at a Salisbury hospital.\n A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said the British leader discussed the attack with President Trump, who said Washington was \u201cwith the U.K. all the way\u201d that Russia \u201cmust provide unambiguous answers as to how this nerve agent came to be used.\u201d\n In his last remarks, just hours after being fired by Trump via Twitter, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned, \u201cmuch work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.\u201d\n Tillerson warned, \u201cRussia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone\u2019s interest.\u201d\n May also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cThey agreed that the international community should coordinate closely as the investigation developed and in the wake of Russia\u2019s response,\u201d said her spokesman.\n Russia essentially blew off May\u2019s midnight deadline for an explanation of how deadly Novichok nerve gas appeared on the streets of the quiet medieval town of Salisbury, famous for its nearby ruins of Stonehenge.\n Various officials and commentators made it clear that Moscow would call her bluff.\n After Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the U.K. on Tuesday that Moscow had no intention of responding to May\u2019s ultimatum, the ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, dialed up the heat on an evening talk show on one of the leading state-run channels.\n \u201cNo one can come before their national parliament and say: I give Russia 24 hours,\u201d said Zakharova, \u201cWhat kind of conversation is that in principle?\u201d She then appeared to chastise London for not behaving like a nuclear power, and took a shot at Boris Johnson.\u00a0\n \u201cWhen a country\u2019s Foreign Ministry is led by people who have absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy, who have built their career around populism, they have no idea either about the organization for the prohibition of nuclear weapons or the relevant [chemical weapons convention].\u201d\n \u00a0\u201cTo them, it is normal to go out and start intimidating,\u201d Zakharova said. \u201cDon\u2019t.

He reiterated that Moscow\u2019s official position, that it was not involved and demands proof, has been delivered through diplomatic channels.\n Peskov said that Moscow does not accept London\u2019s accusations and hopes the West will come to their senses and engage Russia in a joint investigation into the poisoning of Skripal.\n Regarding possible British actions against Russia today, Peskov said that \u201cany unlawful actions against any Russian media outlets in the UK will, of course, lead to reciprocal measures backed the principle of reciprocity.\u201d So far, no one in Russia has specified which outlets a response would apply to, thought they have suggested that every British outlet could be targeted.\n \u00a0So far, Foreign Minister Lavrov is the most senior Russian official to comment on May\u2019s ultimatum.

The decision amounts to a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of those involved with the new policy.\n The new plan will be challenged in court, just as the full ban that Trump issued last summer was, in at least four separate cases that are still ongoing. Federal judges allowed transgender service members to continue serving under the old ban and permitted transgender recruits to join the military as well. \n The Justice Department filed a copy of Mattis\u2019s recommendations in at least one of those legal battles Friday.\n \u201cIn service to the ideological goals of the Trump-Pence base, the Pentagon has distorted the science on transgender health to prop up irrational and legally untenable discrimination that will erode military readiness,\u201d said Aaron Belkin, who has studied transgender issues for the Palm Center, a think tank that had worked with the Obama administration in repealing the previous ban. \u201cThere is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy. Our troops and our nation deserve better.\u201d \n In his memo to the president, Mattis specifically challenged the thinking of the Obama administration when it repealed the ban in 2016. Mattis said that he found a Rand Corp. study \u2014 commissioned by the Pentagon under Obama that became a backbone of the repeal process \u2014 to be flawed.\n \u201cIt referred to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cIn short, this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or RAND assumed.\u201d\n The new direction comes after months of the Pentagon\u2019s grappling with how to change its policy after Trump unexpectedly tweeted July 26 that he was banning all transgender people from serving in the military. The president, without any plan in place, cited the \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d that he believed transgender military service would cause, and said that he had consulted with \u201cmy Generals and military experts.\u201d \n A day later, Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, released a memo effectively stopping the military from making any changes until a new policy was adopted, and Mattis backed the move.\n In August, Trump issued a presidential memorandum providing more detail. He accused the Obama administration of allowing transgender military service without identifying a \u201csufficient basis\u201d that doing so would not \u201chinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources,\u201d and he directed Mattis to have the Pentagon adopt a new ban similar to the military\u2019s former policy by Friday. \n The Obama administration began allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military in June 2016, following a review that dragged out months longer than expected amid internal conflict in the Pentagon over how the change would be made. Until then, the Pentagon considered gender dysphoria a disqualifying mental illness. \n In removing the ban, then-Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter stopped the military from involuntarily separating anyone in the service, and gave the service branches a year to iron out how they would begin processing transgender recruits. A year later, Mattis delayed allowing transgender recruits for an additional six months as the deadline neared, saying the issue needed more study. \n Trump\u2019s tweets came a few weeks later.\n Federal judges required the military to allow transgender recruits beginning Jan. 1, and the Pentagon signaled in December that it would not stand in the way of the courts\u2019 rulings. Instead, it issued new policy guidance to recruits to explain how to enlist transgender men and women, and stated in a policy paper that the guidance \u201cshall remain in effect until expressly revoked.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Ashley Parker", "body": "Over just a few days last week, the essence of Trumpism was on global display: The president ignored his advisers by congratulating Vladi\u00admir Putin, took the first steps toward imposing tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods and signed a huge $1.3 trillion spending bill that will balloon the federal deficit.\n In each case, President Trump cast aside years of Republican orthodoxy \u2014 and most of the party followed right along. The raw, undefined brand of populism that Trump rode into office is now hardening into a clearer set of policies in his second year, remaking the Republican Party and the country on issues ranging from trade and immigration to spending and entitlement programs.\n Even amid persistent unpopularity and the chaotic din of his White House, Trump has used a mix of legislation and unilateral actions to successfully push ahead with key parts of his vision \u2014 tariffs that have rocked global markets; harsh crackdowns on illegal immigrants; a nationalistic foreign policy that spurns allies while embracing foes and costly policies with little concern for the growing national debt.\n The spending legislation\u00a0\u2014 which puts the deficit on track to pass $1 trillion in 2019 \u2014 faced little meaningful opposition from Republican lawmakers despite years of GOP complaints that federal expenditures were out of control. Trump called the bill \u201cridiculous,\u201d but focused on issues other than the amount of spending.\n It was another example of how Trump seems to have overtaken his party\u2019s previously understood values, from a willingness to flout free-trade principles and fiscal austerity to a seeming abdication of America\u2019s role as a global voice for democratic values.\u00a0\n   President Trump speaks after signing a $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress early Friday, averting a government shutdown. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \u201cWhile the president\u2019s vision of pro-American immigration, trade and national security policies may not have had widespread support in Washington, they are widely supported by the American people,\u201d said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. \u201cThis is President Trump\u2019s Republican Party.\u201d\n A tweet Friday, in which Trump threatened to veto the spending bill, also underscored another tenet of Trumpism \u2014 a state of continuous uncertainty about where he will land on key policies. In the tweet, Trump said he was frustrated with the legislation both because it\u00a0\u201ctotally abandoned\u201d young undocumented immigrants known as \u201cdreamers\u201d (long a Democratic priority) and because it failed to\u00a0\u201cfully\u201d fund his controversial border wall (now a Republican priority). \u00a0\n \u201cThere has certainly been a wholesale repudiation of many core principles that have guided the Republican Party\u2019s thinking over the years,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\u00a0\u201cTheir willingness to accept certain victories on their agenda in return for the acceptance of Trumpism more broadly \u2014 that seems to be the guiding principle of Republican Party leaders.\u201d\n Trump allies and advisers say that while he has in some ways reshaped the Republican Party, he rose to power by understanding where the party\u2019s base already was and channeling those existing worries and desires.\n \u201cI would argue that Trump is more a reflection of where the voters are today,\u201d said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think he persuaded them into these stances. That\u2019s where they were. He\u2019s merely being a mirror to them. .\u2009.\u2009. He heard what the voters were talking about, what they feared, the pain that they had, and he immediately championed it.\u201d\n White House officials also stressed that Trump\u2019s professed\u00a0\u201cAmerica First\u201d theme serves as a kind of connective ideology, whether in prioritizing American workers over foreign workers on immigration or calling for NATO members to spend more on a shared defense. They said that on many regulatory and economic issues, such as last year\u2019s tax cuts,\u00a0the president and Republican lawmakers remain naturally aligned.\n For many pro-Trump voters, one senior White House official said, the actual policies are less important than the principle \u2014 and the principal, Trump himself, promising to stand up and fight for them.\n   President Trump shows off posters as he talks with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia at the White House on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who\u00a0decided to retire this year after periodically sparring with Trump, described Trump\u2019s support in stark terms:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s more than strong, it\u2019s tribal in nature,\u201d Corker said.\n \u201cPeople who tell me, who are out on the trail, say, \u2018Look, people don\u2019t ask about issues anymore. They don\u2019t care about issues. They want to know if you\u2019re with Trump or not,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said.\n An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week illustrated the point, finding that 59 percent of registered Republican voters said they consider themselves more a supporter of Trump than the Republican Party.\u00a0\n The question is whether Republican lawmakers and party leadership are compromising long-held values \u2014 or simply racing to catch up to a president and a party that has shifted underneath them.\u00a0\n \u201cObviously, the president has a bully pulpit and he\u2019s got a towering Twitter account,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump\u2019s closest allies on the Hill. \u201cBoth of those allow him to communicate directly with some 49 million people each and every day. And it does affect policy, without a doubt.\u201d\n Even while flouting GOP tenets on issues such as trade, Trump has embraced conservative positions on many social issues \u2014 keeping him in good stead with one of his strongest constituencies, evangelical voters. On Friday, for instance, the White House announced a policy to ban most transgender troops from serving in the military. Trump also retreated to default conservative positions on gun control after suggesting broader restrictions in the wake of the shooting massacre in Parkland, Fla.\n The shift to Trumpism is perhaps most stark on trade. Trump\u2019s protectionist moves\u00a0\u2014 including a series of proposed tariffs, withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and threats to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement\u00a0\u2014 have quickly been embraced by a party that for years extolled the virtues of open markets.\n In a\u00a0Quinnipiac University poll earlier this month, 58 percent of Republican voters supported imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. During the 2016 election year,\u00a0Pew tracked a massive drop in the share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying that free trade agreements had been a \u201cgood thing\u201d for the United States, from 56 percent in early 2015 to 29 percent in October 2016.\n Stephen Moore, a former Trump campaign adviser and senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said some of the realignment is a natural outgrowth of the fact that Trump\u00a0\u2014 an unconventional leader not steeped in decades of GOP orthodoxy\u00a0\u2014 is now the leader of the party.\n \u201cThat\u2019s just political realism,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0\u201cA lot of my conservative friends say,\u00a0\u2018Well, I don\u2019t agree with him on trade or immigration or infrastructure spending or whatever it may be,\u2019 and my response is, it\u2019s a package deal here. You can\u2019t just pick out what you like and don\u2019t like.\u201d\u00a0\n Corker, who has seesawed in his support for the president, voted against the spending bill and excoriated it as \u201cgrotesque\u201d Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor.\u00a0\u201cThere are a lot of discussions about the fact that maybe the Republican Party has lost its soul,\u201d he said, adding that the specter of a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican president\u00a0\u201cgetting ready to pass a bill that adds $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years\u201d should serve as\u00a0\u201ca wake-up call to people as to whether that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n Trump has upended his party on other issues as well. On immigration, although many GOP voters already shared Trump\u2019s restrictionist impulses, his policies and hard-line rhetoric are at odds with long-standing attempts by Republican leaders to attract more Hispanic voters. After the 2012 presidential election, when Mitt Romney won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, a report by the Republican National Committee declared that the party \u201cmust embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n On entitlements, too, a number of rising Republican stars \u2014 such as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \u2014 have vowed to overhaul the existing system to save the government money. Yet Trump has made no serious moves to change Medicare or Social Security.\n Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) described the return to deficit spending as \u201cscary\u201d and said the solution was to tackle entitlements. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019ve got to get entitlements under control,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s driving the debt and deficit more than anything else.\u201d\n But the problem, Simpson said, is Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a president who said he won\u2019t touch it,\u201d he said. \u201cMakes it kind of difficult, you know.\u201d\n Similarly,\u00a0Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said Trump \u201cmost definitely has, in part, given cover to congressional Republicans to drive up spending.\u201d\u00a0\n \u00a0\u201cWe had the president during the campaign saying he wasn\u2019t going to touch the main drivers of our fiscal problems: Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare,\u201d Flake said. \u201cBut this, we can\u2019t blame this on our president. A lot of this is being driven by Congress, and a lot of this went on long before the president got here.\u201d\n Asked if there were any other notable areas\u00a0\u2014 aside from spending, immigration and trade\u00a0\u2014 where Trump had significantly remade the party, Flake chuckled.\n \u201cOn the kind of decency stuff, certainly,\u201d Flake said, before offering the flip side:\u00a0\u201cAnd creating a safe space for indecent discourse.\u201d\n  \nScott Clement, Paul Kane, Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Lindsey Bever", "body": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.

In a statement to\u00a0the liberal outlet ThinkProgress, the spokesman had called the\u00a0contract \u201croutine\u201d for large groups, adding that it \u201chas more than 2,000 such contracts in place.\u200b\u201d\n The NRA claims\u00a05 million members, takes in tens of millions of dollars each year through memberships, and devotes massive resources to fighting gun regulations in the name of constitutional protections that guarantee Americans\u00a0the right to bear arms.\n The group has faced public anger before \u2014 after the massacre of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, for example. But it\u00a0has always fought back against pushes for gun-law reform, and efforts to significantly restrict firearms\u00a0inevitably die out as public fury over the shootings ebbs.\n But outrage over the Parkland shooting \u2014 sustained in part by politically active teenagers who survived the massacre \u2014 has shown no signs of dying out.\u00a0Police say a former student killed 17 people with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle, one of at least 10\u00a0gun he owned.\u00a0\n As calls for gun\u00a0control spread, the\u00a0NRA has increasingly become a target of activists,\u00a0with social media hashtags\u00a0urging boycotts of\u00a0any\u00a0corporation\u00a0found to be linked with it.\n Delta\u00a0and United are\u00a0the latest to submit to the pressure.\n  First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private U.S. banks, may\u00a0have been the first to respond publicly to the boycott calls. The bank had previously advertised\u00a0the \u201cOfficial Credit Card of the NRA,\u201d according to the Omaha World-Herald\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0Visa card\u00a0with\u00a05 percent back on gas and sporting goods.\n \u201cCustomer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,\u201d the bank said in a statement published Thursday, eights days after the Parkland shooting. \u201cAs a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card.\u201d\n Enterprise followed suit a few hours later. \u201cAll three of our brands have ended the discount for NRA members,\u201d effective March 26,\u00a0the car rental company wrote\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0Thursday afternoon.\u00a0Hertz, Avis Budget Group and TrueCar\u00a0would soon join Enterprise and end their NRA discounts.\u00a0 So did movers\u00a0North American Van Lines and Allied Van Lines.\n On\u00a0Friday morning, Symantec announced that the boycott movement had spread to the software industry. NRA members will now have to pay the same price for its anti-virus software as everyone else.\n   Symantec has stopped its discount program with the National Rifle Association.\n\u2014 Symantec (@symantec) February 23, 2018  \n \n On the same day,\u00a0Chubb Limited\u00a0announced\u00a0that it will stop underwriting \u201cNRA Carry Guard,\u201d a policy marketed to NRA members who face legal or civil lawsuits after they shoot someone, which gun opponents sometimes\u00a0call \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d\u00a0A spokesman for Chubb told Reuters that the company had made the decision months ago, but its announcement of the fact on Friday only increased the perception of a boycott movement swelling against the NRA.\n It has now spread across multiple industries and affected some of the world\u2019s largest corporations. The global insurance company\u00a0Metlife said it has terminated discounts\u00a0for\u00a0NRA members. The hotel chains Best Western and Wyndham Hotels\u00a0announced they are no longer affiliated with the NRA.\n  Many of these companies, including Delta and United, have faced a backlash from NRA supporters. And the gun lobbyist, which is funded largely by its own members, is\u00a0unlikely to be moved by\u00a0snubs from\u00a0companies with which it had only loose and peripheral ties.\n Nor has the boycott movement been entirely successful. FedEx, for example, still\u00a0gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount\u00a0on shipping expenses.\n Gun-control organizations Moms Demand Action and Everytown sent a letter Friday asking five companies \u2014 Google, Amazon, Apple, ATT and Roku \u2014 to cease streaming NRATV, saying \u201cit\u2019s time for tech leaders to acknowledge their role in helping the NRA spread this dangerous content.\u201d\n But as more and more corporations break with the NRA, there are\u00a0signs that the movement is swaying lawmakers as well as corporations. For example, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and other Republicans have endorsed banning rifle sales to anyone under 21 \u2014\u00a0which the NRA opposes.\u00a0Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, on the other hand, was jeered at a recent town hall for accepting political contributions from the gun group.\n The NRA has not\u00a0commented on the boycott movement. But its leaders spoke\u00a0defiantly\u00a0at public appearances this week, blaming the public groundswell on media manipulation.\n \u201cMany in legacy media love mass shootings,\u201d NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Thursday at\u00a0a conservative political conference. \u201cCrying white mothers are ratings gold.\u201d\n \u201cThey want to make us all less free,\u201d NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said when he took the microphone after Loesch.\n The correct response to the Florida shooting, he said, was more armed security on school campus \u2014 not fewer guns in the United States.\n T.J.

Mueller III is now directly gunning for President Trump \u2014 and not just on one front. It appears that Mueller is investigating whether Trump himself committed misconduct or possible criminality on two fronts, and possibly more.\n NBC News is now reporting that Mueller has sent a subpoena to an unnamed witness\u00a0that appears to hint at just how wide a net Mueller has cast. NBC reports that the subpoena suggests Mueller is focused, among other things, on determining what Trump himself knew about Russian sabotage of the 2016 election as it was happening.\n The subpoena demands a range of documents that involve Trump himself, in addition to\u00a0nine\u00a0of his top campaign advisers and associates. The documents solicited include emails, texts, work papers, and telephone logs dating back to November of 2015, four months after Trump declared his presidential candidacy.\n This builds on NBC\u2019s previous report that Mueller\u2019s investigators are asking witnesses questions that indicate that Mueller is examining whether Trump knew that Democratic emails had been hacked before that became public, and whether he was somehow involved in their \u201cstrategic release.\u201d\u00a0As NBC\u2019s new report puts it:\n  The subpoena indicates that Mueller may be focused not just on what Trump campaign aides knew and when they knew it, but also on what Trump himself knew.\n  In a certain sense, it isn\u2019t that surprising to learn that Mueller is focused on what Trump knew about Russia\u2019s hacking of emails and interference in the election, and any potential conspiracy with them. Mueller is charged with investigating \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\u201d with Trump\u2019s campaign, as well as any other matters that arise from that line of inquiry. This was inevitably going to include what Trump himself knew and when.\n But the subpoena\u2019s search for documents dating all the way back to November of 2015, and its demand for documents relating to\u00a0so many of Trump\u2019s top associates \u201cindicates just how wide a net Mueller is casting,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig, a special counsel for Ken Starr\u2019s investigation into Bill Clinton, told me today.\n Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel under President Obama, added in an interview with me that the subpoena may serve as a reminder of Trump\u2019s centrality to the collusion tale.\n Indeed, as Bauer noted, the publicly known facts already point to Trump\u2019s centrality.\u00a0Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. eagerly held a meeting in June of 2016 with Russians in the full expectation that he\u2019d be getting dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. It has not been established whether Trump knew about that meeting. But recall that Trump himself helped draft the initial statement misleading the nation about the real purpose of that meeting.\n Also recall that former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon told author Michael Wolff that, in his view, the \u201cchance that Don Jr. did not walk\u201d the Russians \u201cup to his father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.\u201d (Bannon is one of the advisers the subpoena seeks documents about.)\n \u201cWe have the president apparently involved in drafting a fallacious statement on behalf of Don Jr. about what actually happened in the Trump Tower meeting,\u201d Bauer told me. \u201cWe have Bannon speculating \u2014 and I think this only stands to reason \u2014 that Don Jr. would never have arranged this meeting without his father knowing that it was coming. It\u00a0is known that the Trump campaign was communicating with the Russians about help for the campaign and that Trump was personally involved in an effort to conceal information about these contacts from the public.\u201d\n \u201cThe president in particular is right in the middle of questions about Russian interference,\u201d Bauer said.\n Also recall that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos\u2019 plea agreement with Mueller indicated that he had been informed in April of 2016 that the Russians collected \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. What\u2019s more, Dem Rep. Adam Schiff \u2014 the ranking Dem on the House Intelligence Committee probe \u2014 has now openly stated that information gathered by the committee shows that \u201cthe Russians previewed to Papadopoulous that they could help with disseminating these stolen emails.\u201d The question is whether Trump campaign higher-ups\u00a0were told of these things \u2014 and whether Trump knew of them.\n We don\u2019t know the answer to those questions, and again, it must be stressed that Mueller may find no evidence of coordination. But the already known facts are troubling enough on their own. And it\u2019s obvious that Mueller knows a lot more than we do.\n Trump has acted methodically to hamstring the Mueller probe\n Indeed, this feeds into the second way that Mueller is investigating Trump \u2014 for possible obstruction of justice. We learned last week that Mueller is closely scrutinizing Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of mind during his repeated efforts to push out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to determine whether the goal was to replace him with someone who would better protect him from the Mueller probe (Sessions had recused himself, enraging Trump). Mueller is trying to determine whether this conduct, along with Trump\u2019s firing of his FBI director, establishes a pattern that constitutes obstruction of justice. As I have argued, we know beyond any doubt that Trump has acted methodically, again and again and again, to constrain or derail the investigation, and only pulled back after those efforts were foiled.\n That particular conduct can potentially be explained by Mueller\u2019s scrutiny of what Trump and/or his associates knew and when about Russian efforts to sabotage the election on his behalf. This confluence doesn\u2019t prove anything, of course. But as Bauer put it to me:\u00a0\u201cTrump came into office frantic to deny any collusion with the Russians during the campaign, and from the beginning, he is apparently maneuvering to choke off an investigation by pressuring and then firing Comey, and attacking Sessions over the recusal. And so he added an obstruction inquiry to his problems.\u201d\n Beyond all this, we also know Mueller is scrutinizing whether\u00a0any White House policies might have been shaped by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s business discussions with foreigners during the transition. And who knows where that might lead.\n * NOTHING FROM CONGRESS ON ELECTION SECURITY: On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s former chief of staff\u00a0accused Republicans of refusing to forcefully condemn Russian sabotage of the 2016 election. The Post adds this:\n  Not one congressional panel looking into the Russia probe has released a bipartisan plan for how to strengthen election security, even though the 2018 primary season begins in certain states this month. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russian intervention, is expected to release recommendations later this month, though that will not mark the end of its probe.\n  And we have heard very little from the administration about its plans, ever since it was reported that Trump has not held a single cabinet meeting on the threat of more sabotage.\n * NOTHING FROM STATE DEPARTMENT ON ELECTION SECURITY: The New York Times reports that the State Department has spent none of the $120 million allotted to it for countering foreign sabotage of our elections:\n  As a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department\u2019s Global Engagement Center \u2014 which has been tasked with countering Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign \u2014 speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts. The delay is just one symptom of the largely passive response to the Russian interference by President Trump.\n  Is anyone else seeing a pattern here?\n * GOWDY: WE MAY GET ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL:\u00a0Some Republicans want a second special counsel to examine alleged Hillary Clinton wrongdoing in the fake Uranium One scandal, among other things. Rep. Trey Gowdy, the House GOP Oversight Committee chair,\u00a0told Fox News: \u201cI think we\u2019re trending perhaps towards another special counsel.\u201d\n We learned last fall that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is evaluating whether a second special counsel is merited, obviously in response to Trump\u2019s relentless demands that Sessions target Clinton. When are we going to hear back from Sessions on that?\n * GOP UNLEASHES AD BLITZ ON TAX PLAN: The Washington Examiner reports that American Action Network, the outside group allied with House GOP leaders, is unleashing a $1 million ad blitz touting the GOP tax cuts in 24 competitive House districts:\n  Republicans \u2026 want voters to make a direct connection between the tax bill and accelerated job and wage growth. \u2026 AAN and its sister organization, the super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund, are investing tens of millions of dollars to improve the image of the tax bill, viewing it as the key to any success Republicans might have in holding the party\u2019s 24-seat House majority.\n  But in the special election just outside Pittsburgh, Republicans have shifted away from tax cut messaging and towards attacks over illegal immigration, suggesting the tax message may be a bust.\n * STATES PRESS FORWARD WITH GUN-RIGHTS BILLS:\u00a0Talking Points Memo reports that numerous states have pressed forward with bills loosening regulations on firearms in the wake of the Parkland massacre. Note this:\n  Even as gun control legislation remains stalled in Congress, the NRA has campaigned for 15 measures in 11 states that would further loosen gun restrictions. Among other things, the bills would\u00a0strengthen existing stand-your-ground laws (Wyoming and Idaho), allow people to carry handguns without a permit (Oklahoma), and expand the list of places where people can carry guns (numerous states).\n  This is yet another reminder that if you want new gun regulations, you should channel some energy into Democratic efforts to win back ground on the state level.\n * DACA DEADLINE IS TODAY, AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN: Today is the day that the protections for the \u201cdreamers\u201d expire, and CNN reports that nothing is going to happen to protect them in Congress today or in the near future:\n  March 23 is the next government funding deadline, and some lawmakers have suggested they may try to use the must-pass package of funding bills as a point of leverage. But sources close to the process say it\u2019s more likely that efforts will be made to keep a bad deal out of the omnibus spending measure than to come up with a compromise to attach to it, as no solution has a clear path to passing either chamber.\n  The courts have put Trump\u2019s move on hold and have ordered the restarting of the program, so today\u2019s deadline means less. But make no mistake: The dreamers\u2019 future is still very much in limbo.\n * QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND, TRUMP-IS-A-DECISIVE LEADER EDITION: On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was pressed to say whether Trump\u2019s decision on tariffs is final. He replied:\n  \u201cWhatever his final decision is, is what will happen. \u2026 If he says something different, it\u2019ll be something different. I have no reason to think he\u2019s going to change. \u2026 He has made a decision at this point \u2026 If he for some reason should change his mind, then it\u2019ll change.\u201d\n  The most senior members of Trump\u2019s administration haven\u2019t got any earthly clue where the strong and decisive businessman president will end up.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Fred Barbash", "body": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.

A spokesman for Chubb told Reuters that the company informed the NRA of the decision three months ago; the policy has\u00a0faced criticism from gun-control groups who called it \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d\n The decisions came as the names of companies with NRA associations began circulating widely on the Internet and social media under the #BoycottNRA hashtag after the deadly Valentine\u2019s Day attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n A gunman wielding an AR-15 rifle killed 17 people and wounded at least 14 others, drawing anguished calls for a ban on assault weapons from students and families.\n The mass killing\u00a0focused renewed attention on the NRA, which is credited with blocking gun-control measures for years through millions of dollars in political campaign contributions and pressure from its large membership base.\n American businesses have become increasingly politically aware and have participated in boycotts over the past few years against states over LGBT rights. But the NRA is a well-funded membership operation devoted to a single cause\u00a0\u2014 guns\u00a0\u2014 and unlikely to be moved by the actions of companies with which it has such loose and peripheral ties.\n Like many other organizations, the NRA has benefit deals with companies designed to make membership more appealing. The\u00a0NRA \u201cmember benefits\u201d page\u00a0offers\u00a0savings on a credit card, hearing\u00a0aids, car rentals, travel, car purchases\u00a0and prescription drugs.\n FedEx, for example, gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount\u00a0on shipping expenses.\n FedEx has not said anything publicly about its NRA association in recent days; when reached around 4:30\u00a0ET on Friday afternoon, a company spokesperson said he had no information to provide.\n  Hashtags urging boycotts of specific companies involved in the deals have sprouted up across social media over the past several days.\u00a0People then started posting comments on the social media platforms of many of the companies urging them to take action.\n The Omaha bank appears to have been the first to respond publicly.\n   Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA.

On Friday evening, Alice Pereira, a spokeswoman for Avis Budget Group \u2014 the company mark for Avis, Budget and Zipcar\u00a0brands \u2014\u00a0confirmed that it will no longer provide the NRA member discount as of March 26.

Indiana got hit hard by threatened boycotts in 2015 when Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed legislation allowing businesses and individuals to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The Indiana legislature and Pence reversed the measure within two weeks.\n In 2016, North Carolina was the target of a business boycott after it enacted a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their assigned gender at birth. After the NCAA canceled tournaments in the state and PayPal decided not to build a new facility in the state, the legislation was partially repealed.\n The NRA claims\u00a05 million members and corporate allies in the gun industry that provide the organization with tens of millions of dollars per year.

Or was Hicks simply exhausted?\n Porter\u2019s job involved controlling the flow of paperwork, some of it classified and extremely sensitive, to the president. Because of those abuse allegations, however, he couldn\u2019t get a permanent top-secret security clearance. That was bad enough, but later we learned that dozens of White House officials, perhaps 100 or more, were working with only interim clearances, not permanent ones. Their access to secret information was cut off by Chief of Staff John F. Kelly \u2014 but only after all of this had become public.\n Among those now with limited access is Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose heavily indebted real estate empire and grudging disclosure of his many foreign contacts worried FBI investigators. Kushner is a senior adviser to the president whose many assignments include forging peace in the Middle East \u2014 but who now is not cleared for documents or meetings that discuss what\u2019s really happening in the Middle East or anywhere else. So why is he still there?\n Why was he there in the first place? Because of Trump\u2019s appalling nepotism.\n Trump also brought his daughter Ivanka into the White House as an adviser. What does she do? What qualifies her to do it? In a real administration, conservative or liberal, Kushner\u2019s office and Ivanka Trump\u2019s office would be occupied by experienced professionals who actually know something about diplomacy or administration or some government function.\n According to the New York Times, Kushner set up White House meetings for two business executives whose private equity firm and bank later made loans to the Kushner Companies real estate firm totaling more than $500 million. Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d was a cruel joke. He has expanded it into a vast protected wetland, to be enjoyed by friends and family.\n Never before have we had a president openly at war with his own attorney general. The Post reported Wednesday that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is investigating whether Trump\u2019s attempts to force Attorney General Jeff Sessions out of his job last summer were part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice. According to The Post, Trump\u2019s private name for Sessions is \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d a baby-boomer reference that younger readers will have to Google. \n Trump began his day Wednesday by tweeting that a decision Sessions recently made was \u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d Sessions responded by issuing a statement strongly rebutting Trump\u2019s criticism. And that evening, Sessions was photographed at a posh Washington restaurant dining with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein \u2014 who oversees the Mueller investigation \u2014 and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. If it wasn\u2019t a deliberate display of unity at the Justice Department, it sure looked like one.\n Also on Wednesday, Trump convened a televised negotiating session with members of Congress on the subject of gun violence. To the escalating horror of Republicans present, he heartily endorsed several Democratic gun control proposals \u2014 and then went much further, saying that in the case of individuals who are mentally unstable, authorities should \u201ctake the guns first, go through due process second.\u201d\n If President Barack Obama had ever said such a thing, we\u2019d be in the middle of Civil War II.\n Any other president who displayed such cavalier disregard for previous policy positions and total ignorance of basic facts would have provoked an uproar. Trump barely gets a shrug. Nobody expects him to be consistent. Nobody expects him to know anything about anything. He is defining the presidency down in a way that we must not tolerate.\n I spent years as a foreign correspondent in Latin America.

The real estate magnate, who owned the Miss Universe pageant, wrote the note at a time when he was looking to expand his brand to Russia.\n The letter, the first known attempt at direct outreach by Trump to Putin, has been turned over to investigators probing Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign. It is unclear whether Trump\u2019s missive was ever delivered to the Russian president \u2014 and if so, whether Putin responded.\n John Dowd, an attorney for President Trump, said he was not familiar with the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s all nonsense,\u201d he said. A White House spokesman and attorneys for the Trump Organization declined to comment.\n At the time, Trump made no secret that he hoped Putin would attend the Miss Universe pageant, which was being held in Russia for the first time.\n In a June\u00a018, 2013, tweet, Trump wrote: \u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow \u2014 if so, will he become my new best friend?\u201d\u00a0\n His letter to Putin was written that month, according to the people familiar with the document.\n The pageant was part of a years-long effort to bring the Trump name to Russia. Trump has repeatedly sought to build a tower in Russia since the late 1980s, without success.\n But in 2013, a new opportunity emerged through another business he owned: the Miss Universe pageant.\n Trump was approached by billionaire Moscow developer Aras Agalarov and his pop star son, Emin, who said they would pay to bring Miss Universe to the Russian capital.\n  [Inside Trump\u2019s financial ties to Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin] \n Trump was eager for Putin to attend the event, but the Russian president canceled a planned appearance at the last minute, Aras Agalarov told The Washington Post in a 2016 interview.\n \u201cThat was a very complicated situation then, because I promised Trump he would meet Putin,\u201d Agalarov said.\n Instead, Putin sent a \u201cfriendly\u201d letter and a gift of a Russian lacquered box, he said. \u201cSo he was leaving with very warm feelings,\u201d Agalarov said. \u201cHe was very happy.\u201d\n During the pageant, Trump suggested that Putin was following the event and Trump\u2019s role in it. \u201cI do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today,\u201d Trump told MSNBC while in Moscow.\n Investigators for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III have asked witnesses questions about the Miss Universe pageant and Trump\u2019s interest in having Putin attend the event, according to people familiar with the inquiry.\n Mueller\u2019s team also has examined Trump\u2019s relationship with the Agalarovs, which extended beyond the 2013 pageant.\n In June 2016, a music promoter representing Emin Agalarov emailed one of Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr., and asked if he would meet with a Russian lawyer who the promoter said could give him damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\u201d Trump Jr. responded. Days later, he met with the lawyer at Trump Tower in New York. A U.S.-based employee for the Agalarovs also attended, as did Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump Jr. has said that no information about Clinton was provided at the meeting.\n Over the years, Donald Trump has offered inconsistent stories about whether he met Putin before he became president.\n In October 2013, a month before the Miss Universe pageant, he told late-night host David Letterman that Putin was a\u00a0\u201ctough guy\u201d and that he had \u201cmet him once.\u201d\u00a0\n During a Republican primary debate in November 2015, Trump said that he knew Putin\u00a0\u201cvery well.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n But in July 2016, he told a CBS affiliate in Miami, \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do, I never met Putin, I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0\n By that time, Russia was widely suspected of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, which had been published by WikiLeaks.\u00a0\n \u201cI don\u2019t know who Putin is,\u201d Trump said at a news conference the same day. \u201cHe said one nice thing about me.

The 2011 map that has been used this decade has resulted in Republicans consistently winning 13 of the state\u2019s 18 congressional seats.\n Monday\u2019s action was the second time that the court declined to get involved in the partisan battle that has roiled Pennsylvania politics. The commonwealth\u2019s highest court earlier this year ruled that a map drawn by the Republicans leaders in 2011 \u201cclearly, plainly and palpably\u201d violated the Free and Equal Elections Clause of the Pennsylvania constitution.\n  [Supreme Court declines to get involved in Pennsylvania gerrymandering case] \n The U.S. Supreme Court deliberated nearly two weeks before turning down the request to stop the map from being used in this fall\u2019s elections.

There were no noted dissents. \n  Under a new map drawn by a nonpartisan expert and adopted by Democratic justices of Pennsylvania\u2019s elected supreme court, analysts say Republicans start with an edge in 10 of the 18 districts. Pennsylvania traditionally is a purple state, and currently has a legislature controlled by Republicans, a governor who is a Democrat and a U.S. senator from each party.\n Candidates face a Tuesday deadline to qualify to run for the redrawn seats.\n Political analysts say the changes in Pennsylvania might aid national Democrats in their attempt to flip the House from Republican control. Democrats need to take about two dozen seats to win the majority, and Pennsylvania could provide some of that total. Six incumbents, five of them Republicans, have said they will not be on the fall ballot.\n Pennsylvania\u2019s top Republicans have fought the imposition of a new plan since the state supreme court ruled. They have received encouragement from President Trump, who tweeted they should challenge the new map \u201call the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\u201d\n \u201cYour Original was correct!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes  waste money!\u201d\n Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. turned down the state\u2019s first request on Feb. 5, after the state supreme court ordered a new map.\n After the map was adopted, the legislative leaders were back, renewing their plea that the Pennsylvania justices were taking away the power that rightfully belongs to the state legislature to draw congressional lines.\n \u201cThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court conspicuously seized the redistricting process and prevented any meaningful ability for the legislature to enact a remedial map to ensure a court-drawn map,\u201d said state House Speaker Michael C. Turzai and Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph B. Scarnati III.\n But those who challenged the 2011 map as an improper partisan gerrymander said the state was making arguments the U.S. Supreme Court already has rejected.\n \u201cTheir latest stay application is just another ploy to preserve congressional districts that violate Pennsylvania\u2019s Constitution for one more election cycle,\u201d said a brief for the League of Women Voters, adding, \u201cIt would be unprecedented for this Court to interfere with the state court\u2019s determination about its own state\u2019s law.\u201d\n The challengers pointed out that qualifying has already begun under the new map, and \u201cat least 150 candidates in all 18 new districts have begun collecting voter signatures on nomination petitions\u201d for May 15 primaries.\n Pennsylvania election officials have said changing the process again would require postponing the primaries and could cost the commonwealth $20 million.\n The victory in Pennsylvania for opponents of partisan gerrymandering suggest a new mode of attack, by challenging redistricting in state courts under state constitutions.\n The U.S. Supreme Court has never thrown out a state\u2019s redistricting plan because it has found it so infected with partisan bias that it violates voters\u2019 constitutional rights.\n  But the court has on its current docket two cases--one from Wisconsin and one from Maryland--that raise the question.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Eli Rosenberg", "body": "Former Senate\u00a0candidate Roy Moore (R) in December 2017 after his loss to Doug Jones (D) in the special U.S. Senate race in Alabama.

But never has Kudlow been as spectacularly wrong as he was before the signal economic event of our time. If you heeded Kudlow\u2019s advice in the months before the 2008 crash, you would have been ruined.\n Even as trouble became clear, Kudlow, a CNBC pundit who is not trained in economics, wrote a Feb. 5, 2008, column in National Review saying he was \u201cstill betting on and buying Goldilocks [a just-right scenario] for the long run.\u201d He wrote, \u201cMaybe we are going to have a mild correction.

It\u2019s nothing to get up in arms about.\u201d\n Move along. Nothing to see here.\n When the economy didn\u2019t rebound and housing continued its collapse, Kudlow pronounced, in a CNBC column on July 24, 2008, that he saw in the data \u201can awful lot of very good new news, which appear to be pointing to a bottom in the housing problem; in fact, maybe the tiniest beginnings of a recovery.\u201d Stocks lost nearly half their value in the coming months.\n All of this is to say Kudlow should fit right in with his new colleagues in the Trump administration.\n This is the same president, after all, who tapped to be the chief scientist at the Agriculture Department a talk-radio host who is not a scientist, named a brain surgeon to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development and floated the idea of his personal pilot as head the Federal Aviation Administration.

He added that the president had phoned him a few hours earlier when the news broke of his selection to be director of the National Economic Council. \u201cThe president called and he said, \u2018It\u2019s out,\u2019\u201d Kudlow recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018You\u2019re on the air\u2026 I\u2019m looking at a picture of you\u2026 Very handsome!\u2019 So Trumpian.\u201d\n   Then-Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland watches Jeff Sessions get sworn in as attorney general in the Oval Office last year. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n \n -- But installing cable pundits in decision-making jobs has not worked out very well for Trump thus far. Foreign policy pros were aghast when Trump named K.T. McFarland as his deputy national security adviser during the transition. She had appeared frequently on Fox as an analyst and anchored her own program called \u201cDEFCON3.\" But the last time she\u2019d worked in government was more than three decades earlier, as a junior Pentagon spokeswoman and speechwriter.\n McFarland got marginalized after Michael Flynn went down. Then Trump nominated her to be ambassador to Singapore, but her nomination needed to be withdrawn when damning emails implicated her in the Russia scandal and imperiled her Senate confirmation.\n Trump initially named another Fox talking head, Monica Crowley, as the senior director of strategic communications for the NSC. He stood by her for more than a week as news stories revealed egregious examples of plagiarism over several years, from a 2012 book to her PhD dissertation and op-eds. Just before the inauguration, under pressure, the president-elect dumped her.\n Former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie, 34, was forced to resign two months ago as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service after CNN uncovered bigoted statements he had made about African Americans, immigrants and gays as the host of an Internet radio show. He got the patronage because he had been a go-to Trump defender on Fox, CNN and MSNBC during the 2016 campaign.\n America First Priorities, a Trump-sanctioned outside group, hired the 34-year-old on Thursday as its new advocacy director, with the expectation that he\u2019ll again appear on TV to promote the president. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m coming back into the fray does not mean that the president endorses those comments by any stretch,\u201d Higbie told the Hartford Courant yesterday. \u201cWe\u2019ve all said something we\u2019ve regretted. I just happened to say it on the radio. \u2026 But I\u2019m committed to this administration and its policies.\u201d\n   An advertisement for \u201cFox And Friends\u201d outside the show's studio in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n \n -- The president reportedly has fewer events on his schedule than he did during the opening year of his presidency so that he can have extra \u201cexecutive time\u201d in the residence, which is a euphemism for watching television. That\u2019s only intensified the cable news feedback loop. Trump\u2019s tweets routinely echo messages, sometimes word for word, that he heard on Fox minutes earlier. Remember Trump\u2019s tweet about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u201cbutton\u201d?\n   The president just threatened a nuclear strike while live-tweeting a Fox News segment. \n\nLeft, Fox, 7:37 pm\nRight, Trump, 7:49 pm pic.twitter.com/vJciYH6LIA\n\u2014 Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) January 3, 2018   \n The president\u2019s cable habit almost led him to torpedo a compromise his own administration had negotiated to reauthorize Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act in January. \u201cTrump issued an early morning tweet in response to Judge Andrew Napolitano\u2019s criticism on a \u2018Fox and Friends\u2019 segment,\u201d Tufts University professor Daniel Drezner notes. \u201cOnly direct intervention from the chief of staff, national security adviser, director of national intelligence, CIA director, and House Speaker Paul Ryan convinced Trump to post a follow-up tweet clarifying his position.\u201d\n Last Friday, Trump pardoned a former Navy sailor whose conviction for unauthorized retention of national defense information had made him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on Fox. Commentators have often argued that the year he served in prison for taking pictures aboard a submarine showed Hillary Clinton was treated too leniently for how she mishandled classified material.\n Kristian Saucier, 31, who is now a garbage collector in Vermont, had appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d earlier in the week to press his case. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s two different sets of laws in this country, for the political elite and for, you know, those lower-level, individuals, Americans, like myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my case draws a very clear example of that.\u201d\n   Former Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier: I mishandled classified info, pled guilty to that mistake and continue to be punished, meanwhile Hillary Clinton gets to run for president pic.twitter.com/YKx8dgeKQ3\n\u2014 FOX  friends (@foxandfriends) March 4, 2018   \n \u201cA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on its involvement, if any, in the process,\u201d Matt Zapotosky reports.\n The only other pardon Trump has issued since taking office was for Joe Arpaio, who also frequently appears on Fox shows. The former Arizona sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge\u2019s order to stop racially profiling Latinos.\n -- Trump plainly enjoys the company of people he sees on TV. Trump invited Sebastian Gorka, a lightning rod who got fired from the White House last year but now spends a lot of time defending the president on Fox, over for dinner last week. Jesse Watters, a co-host of Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Five,\u201d joined them. \u201cAccording to a White House official and two other sources familiar with the meeting, Trump invited Gorka and Watters because \u2018he couldn\u2019t get enough of them on TV,\u2019 as one source put it, and wanted to confab with them about what he\u2019d seen on Fox News, politics, gossip, and his administration,\u201d The Daily Beast reported.\n Watters tweeted a picture of the menu afterward:\n  -- The embattled president also appears to be putting a greater premium on loyalty as he makes personnel decisions. He clearly feels burned by some of his early hiring decisions. For example, Trump interviewed Jeanine Pirro, the host of Fox\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine,\u201d to be deputy attorney general. Instead, he went along with Rod Rosenstein, a respected DOJ insider who he had no prior relationship with. That\u2019s a decision he\u2019s repeatedly said that he regrets.\n -- Trump\u2019s embrace of talking heads has become a punch line in popular culture. \u201cTo help find [Gary Cohn\u2019s] replacement, the president turned to his most trusted confidante: the TV in his bedroom,\u201d Comedy Central host Trevor Noah said on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d last night. \u201cBasically, if Trump sees you on TV, there\u2019s a really good chance that he\u2019ll hire you. By the time his term is done, his attorney general is going to be \u2018Judge Judy\u2019 and his housing secretary will be \u2018Bob the Builder.\u2019\u201d\n   WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n  -- The death toll rose to six in the bridge collapse near Miami. The new pedestrian bridge hailed for its novel construction collapsed onto moving traffic, crushing at least eight vehicles and leaving rescue workers racing to free victims. Francisco Alvarado, Susan Svrluga, Faiz Siddiqui and Aaron C. Davis report: \u201cThe bridge was designed to connect the city of Sweetwater with the sprawling campus of Florida International University, and to make it safer for students to cross a frenetic roadway. \u2018It was going to be a significant project,\u2019 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Thursday night. \u2018To see it on the ground and underneath it those who died and who were injured is a tragedy.\u2019 He said the cause of the collapse will be fully investigated. \u2018The victims and their families deserve to know what went wrong.\u2019\u201d\n   Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump walk out of a church service with their children.

(Cindy Boren, Jacob Bogage, Des Bieler and Matt Bonesteel)   THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n -- Robert Mueller has issued his first known subpoena to the Trump Organization, ordering the company to turn over all documents related to Russia and other areas of its investigation. The New York Times\u2019s Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cThe breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents \u2026 There are few other publicly known examples of Mr. Mueller using subpoenas. \u2026 [But it] is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will drag on for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena comes as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump\u2019s political activities.\u201d\n -- The Trump administration imposed new financial sanctions against Russian\u00a0hackers and spy agencies\u00a0in response to a spate of cyberattacks.\u00a0Ellen Nakashima reports: \u201cSanctions also were imposed on individuals known as \u2018trolls\u2019 and the Russian organizations \u2014 including the [Internet Research Agency]\u2014 that supported their efforts to undermine the election. Additionally, the administration alerted the public that Russia is targeting the U.S. energy grid with computer malware that could sabotage the systems. Taken together, the moves represent the administration\u2019s most significant actions to date against Russia for its aggression against the United States, though analysts say their impact is mostly symbolic.\u201d\n -- The new sanctions fall well short of what lawmakers authorized last year. Anne Gearan and Ellen Nakashima write: \u201cSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the sanctions announcement a \u2018long overdue response\u2019 but noted that the administration has failed to implement six other mandatory provisions of the law enacted last year, including penalties affecting Russian defense and other industries.\u201d\n -- Scary:\u00a0\u201cAmerican officials and private cybersecurity experts uncovered a series of Russian attacks aimed at the energy, water and aviation sectors and critical manufacturing, including nuclear plants, in the United States and Europe,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Nicole Perlroth and David Sanger report. \u201cIn [an urgent June report], the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. notified operators about the attacks but stopped short of identifying Russia as the culprit. By then, Russian spies had compromised the business networks of several American energy, water and nuclear plants, mapping out their corporate structures and computer networks. They included that of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear plant near Burlington, Kan. \u2026 Forensic analysis suggested that Russian spies were looking for inroads \u2014 although it was not clear whether the goal was to conduct espionage or sabotage, or to trigger an explosion of some kind.\u201d\n -- The United States, France and Germany joined Britain in denouncing Russia for the brazen assassination attempt of a former Russian spy and his daughter, saying\u00a0the poisoning was the \u201cfirst offensive use of a nerve agent\u201d in Europe since World War II. \u201cThe joint statement signaled another step in the mounting international pressure on Russia over apparent ties to the assault,\u201d Karla Adam and Matthew Bodner report, though it did not spell out any possible further reprisals by the U.K. or its allies.\u00a0Russia plans to retaliate in similar fashion, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov telling reporters \u201cof course, we will\u201d when asked whether the country would expel British diplomats.\n   Special counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller on Capitol Hill.

Democratic investigators for that committee\u2019s Senate counterpart also are interested in what she may know about relationships between the NRA or its allies and wealthy Russians\u00a0\u2026Mitchell told McClatchy in an email that any suggestion she has concerns about the NRA's Russia connections is a 'complete fabrication.'\u201d\n -- House Republicans fear they fumbled the rollout of their Russia report.\u00a0Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney reports: \u201cThe blaring headline the GOP wanted from this week\u2019s rollout was clear: After a year of searching, Republicans on [House intel] found no evidence that [Trump] or his associates aided Moscow\u2019s scheme to interfere in the 2016 election[.] \u2026\u00a0Instead, much of the focus has been on lawmakers\u2019 startling conclusion that the nation's intelligence agencies botched their analysis when they determined Russia wanted Trump to defeat Hillary Clinton.The finding once again pitted the committee's Republicans against the leaders of the intelligence community and led to a frenzy of news coverage that put members on the defensive.\u201d\n  INSTITUTIONALIZED CHAOS:\n -- Based on 19 interviews with presidential advisers and administration officials, Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker\u00a0and Carol D. Leonnig paint a must read portrait of the turmoil: \u201cThe mood inside the White House in recent days has verged on mania, as Trump increasingly keeps his own counsel and senior aides struggle to determine the gradations between rumor and truth. At times, they say, they are anxious and nervous, wondering what each new headline may mean for them personally. But in other moments, they appear almost as characters in an absurdist farce \u2014 openly joking about whose career might end with the next presidential tweet. \u2026 The president is enjoying the process of assessing his team and making changes, tightening his inner circle to those he considers survivors and who respect his unconventional style, one senior White House official said.\u201d\n Here are five of the juiciest nuggets from the piece:\n Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s ouster has been widely speculated about for weeks:\u00a0\u201cBut two top officials said Trump on Thursday morning expressed disbelief to Vice President Pence, senior advisers and Kelly himself that Kelly\u2019s name was surfacing on media watch lists because his job is secure. Trump and Kelly then laughed about it \u2026 But others in the West Wing say Kelly\u2019s departure could be imminent, and Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been mentioned as a possible new chief of staff.\u201d\n Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt \u201chas made no secret inside the West Wing of his ambition to become attorney general should Trump decide to fire Jeff Sessions\": \u201cWhite House officials have grown agitated that Pruitt and his allies are privately pushing for the EPA chief to replace Sessions, a job Pruitt has told people he wants. On Wednesday night, Kelly called Pruitt and told him the president was happy with his performance at EPA and that he did not need to worry about the Justice Department, according to two people familiar with the conversation \u2026\n \u201cWith Hope Hicks resigning her post as communications director, the internal jockeying to replace her has been especially intense between Mercedes Schlapp, who oversees the White House\u2019s long-term communications planning, and Tony Sayegh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s top communications adviser.\n \u201cAnother episode haunting [VA secretary] Shulkin was a trip to the Invictus Games in Canada last September with first lady Melania Trump\u2019s entourage. Shulkin fought with East Wing aides over his request that his wife accompany him on the trip because he was eager for her to meet Britain\u2019s Prince Harry, who founded the games, according to multiple officials familiar with the dispute. The first lady\u2019s office explained there was not room on the plane for Shulkin\u2019s wife, and officials said the secretary was unpleasant during the trip \u2026\n \u201cTrump has sometimes expressed confusion about what agencies and secretaries are in charge of what duties, a senior administration official said. For example, this official said, he has complained to Pruitt about regulatory processes for construction projects, although the EPA is not in charge of the regulations.\u201d\n   John McEntee walks onto the South Lawn of the White House.(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n \n ALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN:\n -- Trump\u2019s personal aide John McEntee lost his White House job\u00a0after a security clearance investigation revealed he was a frequent gambler who bet tens of thousands of dollars at a time. Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThere was no indication his gambling was illegal, but there was concern that the 27-year-old could be vulnerable to outside influence \u2026 McEntee, who had been one of the first staffers to join the Trump campaign \u2026 was escorted off the White House grounds Monday after being notified that he was being let go. McEntee was \u2018very upset\u2019 \u2026 and complained he had done nothing improper. Two White House advisers said they learned about McEntee\u2019s gambling habit after his dismissal. His hasty exit ... upset a number of staffers in the building, who described him as a loyal aide who deserved a more ceremonious departure.\u201d\n -- Newly released documents showed Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s military flights have cost taxpayers nearly $1 million. From Politico\u2019s Victoria Guida: \u201cThat includes a one-week trip to the Middle East in late October, which cost $183,646 for flights on military aircraft. That trip came on top of $811,797.81 in previously reported expenditures for government-funded military aircraft.\u201d\n -- Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe went to the Justice Department\u00a0to make a final plea that he not be fired before his retirement benefits\u00a0kick in. The bureau\u2019s disciplinary officer recommended that McCable be fired, but\u00a0it's\u00a0up to Jeff Sessions. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cMcCabe has become a lightning rod in the partisan squabbling over the Russia investigation and the political probes involving [the Clintons]. ... If the veteran FBI agent is not terminated, that might upset conservatives and Trump, who feel he has been given undeserved leniency. If he is, supporters in the FBI might feel he has been treated too harshly because of pressure from the president.\u201d\u00a0Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacked McCabe from the podium\u00a0during yesterday's briefing: \u201cWe do think that it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor.\u201d\n -- A senior adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development resigned amid allegations that he committed fraud and exaggerated his biography. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine reports: \u201cIn November 2013, a judge ordered [Naved] Jafry and a fuel company he chaired to repay more than $800,000 to the family of Alfred Oglesby, a former NFL player and investor in [Jafry\u2019s] fuel firm, who died in 2009. Oglesby\u2019s widow accused Jafry of fraud. Jafry has not paid the money. Debt collectors said they had been trying to locate him for years. \u2026 During an interview, Jafry described himself as a veteran of the US army and said he was deployed to Kosovo. When confronted with his service record, though, he said he in fact served as a reservist in the army national guard, and remained in California while giving logistics support to colleagues in Kosovo.\u201d\n -- Trump\u2019s top trade adviser Peter Navarro received backing from an American steel company to produce a documentary on the dangers of China\u2019s trade policy. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos and Rebecca Ballhaus report: \u201cNucor made payments to fund the film through a San Diego nonprofit then led by a friend of Mr. Navarro. The arrangement was examined as part of a broader 2012 FBI investigation of the nonprofit\u2019s finances, according to three former employees of the nonprofit. No charges were filed.\u201d\n -- Top House Democrats said they have proof\u00a0State Department employees were ousted because\u00a0they were viewed as \u201cdisloyal\u201d to Trump. From Karoun Demirjian and Carol Morello: \u201cThe ranking Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Government Reform committees sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, writing that they received documents [from a whistleblower] \u2018indicating that high-level officials at the White House and State Department worked with a network of conservative activists to conduct a \u201ccleaning\u201d of employees they believed were not sufficiently \u201csupportive\u201d of President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u2019\u201d\n -- Emails reveal administration officials and conservative agitators, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, specifically tried to oust Sahar Nowrouzzadeh\u00a0from State over her role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. Politico\u2019s Nahal Toosi reports: \u201cA conservative website had published an article depicting Nowrouzzadeh as a Barack Obama loyalist who had \u2018burrowed into the government\u2019 under Trump and even had ties to the hated Iranian regime itself. \u2026 The emails show that State Department and White House officials repeatedly shared such misleading information about Nowrouzzadeh, deriding her as an Obama cheerleader and strong advocate for the nuclear deal with Iran ...\u00a0Later, after Nowrouzzadeh was reassigned to another job, some [State]\u00a0officials tried to mislead a POLITICO reporter about whether she\u2019d completed her full tenure [on the Policy Planning Staff].\u201d\n -- The White House has refused to comply with all three Republican-led House committees seeking information on\u00a0top Trump top aides \u2014 including Cabinet leaders and Jared Kushner.

From Karoun Demirjian: \u201c[Feinstein] wrote in a letter Thursday that senators need \u2018the complete picture\u2019 of Haspel\u2019s involvement to \u2018fully and fairly\u2019 review her fitness for the job. \u2026 \u2018The American people deserve to know the actual role the person nominated to the director of the CIA played in what I consider to be one of the darkest chapters in American history.'\u201d\n  THE REST OF TRUMP'S AGENDA:\n -- The Trump administration is finalizing a plan\u00a0urging\u00a0stronger law-enforcement measures for drug dealers \u2014 including the death penalty. The plan has alarmed health advocates and some GOP lawmakers, who warned that capital punishment will only worsen efforts to reduce the drug crisis. Politico\u2019s Dan Diamond reports: \u201cThe ambitious plan \u2026 could be announced as soon as Monday when [Trump] visits New Hampshire, a state hard hit by the epidemic \u2026 According to language circulating this week, the Trump administration will call for the death penalty as an option in \u2018certain cases where opioid, including Fentanyl-related, drug dealing and trafficking are directly responsible for death.\u2019 However, the plan could cost billions of dollars more than Trump budgeted \u2014 and likely far more than any funding package that Congress would approve \u2014 raising questions about how much of it can actually be put into practice.\u201d\n -- The White House defended Trump\u2019s false claim the United States has a trade deficit with Canada.\u00a0Josh Dawsey and Damian Paletta report: \u201c\u2018The president was accurate because there is a trade deficit and that was the point he was making,\u2019 said [Sarah Huckabee Sanders], who later referred to a figure that includes only goods and not services. \u2018He didn\u2019t have to look at the specific figures.\u2019 \u2026 Canadian government spokesmen repeated U.S. government statistics pointing out that Canada has a trade surplus with their American neighbor. \u2018Canada and the United States have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship,\u2019 said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, pointing to official U.S. statistics.\u201d\n -- The International Wildlife Conservation Council, a new Interior Department advisory board entrusted to help rewrite regulations on importing hunting trophies, includes several trophy hunters. The AP\u2019s Michael Biesecker, Jake Pearson and Jeff Horwitz report: \u201cOne appointee co-owns a private New York hunting preserve with Trump\u2019s adult sons. \u2026 Appointees [also] include celebrity hunting guides, representatives from rifle and bow manufacturers, and wealthy sportspeople who boast of bagging the coveted \u2018Big Five\u2019 \u2014 elephant, rhino, lion, leopard and Cape buffalo.

McCabe was serving as acting FBI director at the time. (Alex Brandon/AP) \n   MORE THAN the details of the case, President Trump\u2019s tweet early Saturday celebrating the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe is what stands out: a marquee of bullying and unseemly behavior by a president. Mr. Trump acts like a nasty, small-minded despot, not the leader of a democracy more than two centuries old in which rule of law is a sturdy pillar. If there is doubt that the timing of Mr. McCabe\u2019s dismissal was driven by political vengeance, Mr. Trump does everything he can to prove the worst with his own sordid words. \n This is the language of a banana republic. In nations without a strong democratic foundation, tyrants cling to power by belittling perceived enemies and insulting and coopting other institutions, such as a free press, law enforcement and the military, coercing them into subservience. Just look around the world at practices today in Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Turkey, to name a few. The banana republic playbook has no place in the United States, not in a town hall, not in a statehouse, least of all in the Oval Office. \n Mr. McCabe is a 21-year-veteran of the FBI and served as deputy director under James B. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired earlier. A Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report, not yet public, reportedly  found that he authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about an investigation involving Hillary Clinton and then misled investigators. He disputes the allegations, noting that he had authority to share the information and corrected what he told investigators. He previously stepped down from the deputy director\u2019s job and was preparing to retire from the FBI on Sunday, which would have assured him of a full federal pension. The rushed timing of the firing on Friday night by Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 whose own job security is perpetually threatened  by Mr. Trump \u2014 robs Mr. McCabe of that full pension.\n As Mr. Trump knows, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been reported to be looking into possible obstruction of justice in the firing of Mr. Comey. Mr. McCabe could be a vital witness in such a prosecution. Now the president has attempted to discredit, and lauded the punishment of, a potential witness against him, an affront to the integrity and independence of law enforcement. \n Mr. McCabe\u2019s actions as deputy FBI director are hard to evaluate without release of the inspector general\u2019s report, due out this spring. There will be time to judge him then. What is clear today is that the president jumped on Mr. McCabe with unseemly ferocity, tweeting: \u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI \u2014 A great day for Democracy.\u201d \n In fact, the hardworking men and women of the FBI, the Justice Department, the intelligence agencies and elsewhere in government come to work every day to uphold the values of a democratic system based on rule of law \u2014 a system that is distinguished by the simple principle that everyone is judged fairly, not by grudge or whim, and that no one is above the law, not even the president.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Matt Zapotosky", "body": "President Trump has renewed his attacks on special counsel Robert S.

Mueller III, who heads the team, is a longtime registered Republican. He was appointed by another Republican, Rod Rosenstein, who Trump himself nominated as deputy attorney general. But publicly available voter registration information shows that 13 of the 17 members of Mueller's team have previously registered as Democrats, while four had no affiliation or their affiliation could not be found.\n Nine of the 17 made political donations to Democrats, their contributions totaling more than $57,000.

McCabe had been involved in the Russia probe, and Trump and his lawyer seized on his ouster to attack the special counsel.\n \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" Trump wrote Saturday night. \"It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\"\n A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment for this story. The special counsel team is composed of veteran white collar lawyers and prosecutors who are among the most respected in the legal world. They have a broad range of experience in fraud, public corruption, cyber and terrorism cases. Legal analysts have said previously they could see no significant legal or ethical concerns with the team members' political giving, and noted Justice Department policies prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of politics.\n [ McCabe is said to have written memos detailing his interactions with Trump ]\n Some lawyers, though, said the team's makeup creates an optical problem for Mueller, as conservatives might not trust what the team ultimately finds, especially with respect to the president. Mueller's critics, too, already had ammunition to criticize the special counsel investigators as biased, after messages were released showing two top FBI officials involved in the case\u00a0\u2014 agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page\u00a0\u2014 exchanged texts disparaging Trump.\n The two no longer work for the special counsel. Mueller removed Strzok after the Justice Department's inspector general found the texts, and Page already had left for what officials said were unrelated reasons. Federal records show neither Page nor Strzok made any political donations.\n Lawyers at the Justice Department\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from which Mueller drew the bulk of his team\u00a0\u2014 are generally thought to be left leaning, while the FBI is generally thought of as a more conservative institution.

And several administration officials said Trump was particularly determined to follow through on this specific set of tariffs, as criticism of U.S.-China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign.\n Trump plans to impose the tariffs at a time when he has much of the world on edge over his pivot to protectionism. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put \u201cAmerica First\u201d on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as he muscled a tax cut bill through Congress.\n That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House. \n One of President Trump\u2019s top advisers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a \u201ctrade war.\u201d \n Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have alleged that China should make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn\u2019t work.\n Still, Trump\u2019s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolate him, particularly on economic issues.

He fumes in private that just about every time he looks up at a television screen, the cable news headlines are trumpeting yet another scandal. He voices frustration that son-in-law Jared Kushner has few on-air defenders. He revives old grudges. And he confides to friends that he is uncertain who he can trust.\n Trump\u2019s closest West Wing confidant, Hope Hicks \u2014 the communications director who often acted as a de facto Oval Office therapist \u2014 announced her resignation last week, leaving behind a team the president views more as paid staff than surrogate family. So concerned are those around Trump that some of the president\u2019s oldest friends have been urging one another to be in touch \u2014 the sort of familiar contacts that often lift his spirits.\n In an unorthodox presidency in which emotion, impulse and ego often drive events, Trump\u2019s ominous moods manifested themselves last week in his zigzagging positions on gun control; his shock trade war that jolted markets and was opposed by Republican leaders and many in his own administration; and his roiling feud of playground insults with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n   President Trump attends a meeting with lawmakers about trade policy in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Feb. 13, 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n Some of Trump\u2019s advisers say the president is not all doom and gloom, however. He has been pleased with the news coverage of his role in the gun debate and lighthearted moments have leavened his days, such as a recent huddle with staff to prepare his comedic routine for the Gridiron, a Saturday night dinner with Washington officials and journalists.\n Still, Trump\u2019s friends are increasingly concerned about his well-being, worried that the president\u2019s obsession with cable commentary and perceived slights is taking a toll on the 71-year-old. \u201cPure madness,\u201d lamented one exasperated ally.\n Retired four-star Army general Barry McCaffrey said the American people \u2014 and Congress especially \u2014 should be alarmed.\n \u201cI think the president is starting to wobble in his emotional stability and this is not going to end well,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cTrump\u2019s judgment is fundamentally flawed, and the more pressure put on him and the more isolated he becomes, I think, his ability to do harm is going to increase.\u201d\n This portrait of Trump at a moment of crisis just over a year after taking office is based on interviews with 22 White House officials, friends and advisers to the president and other administration allies, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss Trump\u2019s state of mind.\n The tumult comes as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and the president\u2019s possible obstruction of justice has intensified. Meanwhile, Kushner, a White House senior adviser, was stripped last week of his access to the nation\u2019s top secrets amid increasing public scrutiny of his foreign contacts and of his mixing of business and government work.\n Trump has been asking people close to him whether they believe Kushner or his company have done anything wrong, according to a senior administration official. Two advisers said the president repeatedly tells aides that the Russia investigation will not ensnare him \u2014 even as it ensnares others around him \u2014 and that he believes the American people are finally starting to conclude that the Democrats, as opposed to his campaign, colluded with the Russians. \n   Nick Ayers, Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff, left, and Gary Cohn, the National Economic Council director, listen as President Trump addresses governors in the State Dining Room of hte White House on Feb. 26, 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n  [\u2018Jared has faded\u2019: Inside the 28 days of tumult that left Kushner badly diminished] \n Still, the developments have delivered one negative headline after another, leading Trump to lose his cool \u2014 especially in the evenings and early mornings, when he often is most isolated, according to advisers.\n For instance, aides said, Trump seethed with anger last Wednesday night over cable-news coverage of a photo, obtained by Axios, showing Sessions at dinner with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia investigation, and another top Justice Department prosecutor. The outing was described in news reports as amounting to an act of solidarity after Trump had attacked Sessions in a tweet that morning.\n The next morning, Trump was still raging about the photo, venting to friends and allies about a dinner he viewed as an intentional show of disloyalty.\n Trump has long been furious with Sessions for recusing himself from oversight of the Russia probe, and privately mocks him as \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d an elderly and bumbling cartoon character. But this past week the president was irate that his attorney general had asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general \u2014 as opposed to criminal prosecutors \u2014 to investigate alleged misdeeds by the FBI in obtaining surveillance warrants.\n On Friday morning, Trump targeted his ire elsewhere. About an hour after Fox News Channel aired a segment about comedian Alec Baldwin saying he had tired of impersonating Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Trump lit into Baldwin on Twitter, initially misspelling his first name. \u201cIt was agony for those who were forced to watch,\u201d the president wrote at 5:42 a.m.\n \u201cTrump\u2019s fundamentally distorted personality \u2014 which at its core is chaotic, volatile and transgressive \u2014 when combined with the powers of the presidency had to end poorly,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a veteran of the three previous Republican administrations and a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cWhat we\u2019re now seeing is the radiating effects of that and it\u2019s enveloped him, his White House, his family and his friends.\u201d\n Trump jetted Friday to his favorite refuge, his private Mar-a-Lago Club in South Florida, where he dined on the gilded patio with old friends \u2014 former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and wife Judith and Blackstone Group chairman Stephen A. Schwartzman, among others. Trump tried to convince his companions that trade tariffs were more popular than they think, according to someone with knowledge of their conversation.\n Shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday, he rolled up to the Trump International Golf Course for a sunny, 70-degree morning on the greens. Rather than firing off a flurry of angry messages as on other recent weekend mornings, the president tweeted only, \u201cHappy National Anthem Day!\u201d But then shortly after noon, once he returned to Mar-a-Lago from the golf course, Trump tweeted that the mainstream media has \u201cgone CRAZY!\u201d\n Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a Trump friend, said, \u201cI\u2019m bewildered when I see these reports that he\u2019s in turmoil. Every time I speak to him he seems more relaxed and in control than ever. He seems pretty optimistic about how things are shaping up.\u201d\n Trump is testing the patience of his own staff, some of whom feel he is not listening to their advice. White House counsel Donald McGahn and national economic council director Gary Cohn have been especially frustrated, according to other advisers.\n The situation seems to be grating as well on White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who had been on the ropes over his handling of domestic abuse allegations against former staff secretary Rob Porter but who now appears on firmer footing. Talking last week about his move from being homeland security secretary to the West Wing, Kelly quipped, \u201cGod punished me.\u201d\n Last Friday, Kelly tried to explain anew the timeline of Porter\u2019s dismissal with a group of reporters \u2014 an unprompted move that annoyed and confused some White House staffers, who believed they were finally moving past the controversy that had consumed much of February. \n \u201cMorale is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said a Republican strategist in frequent contact with White House staff. \u201cNobody knows what to expect.\u201d\n  [Trump aide Hope Hicks to resign amid personal tumult and Russia probe] \n Since Trump entered presidential politics three years ago, Hicks has been his stabilizing constant, tending his moods and whims in addition to managing his image. Within the president\u2019s orbit, many wonder if Trump has fully absorbed the impact of Hicks\u2019 upcoming departure. \n Trump told one friend that Hicks was a great young woman, who, after three intense years, was ready to do her own thing. He told this friend that he recognized the White House was full of \u201ctough hombres,\u201d according to someone briefed on the conversation. \n But other confidants said the president feels abandoned and alone \u2014 not mad at Hicks, but frustrated by the circumstance. Coupled with last fall\u2019s departure of longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller, Trump will have few pure loyalists remaining. \n \u201cLosing people is too much of a story for the president,\u201d said oil investor Dan K. Eberhart, a Trump supporter and a Republican National Committee fundraiser. \u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s imploding .\u2009.\u2009. Trump had momentum with tax reform, the \u2018State of the Union\u2019 speech. He should try to keep that going.\u201d\n On Capitol Hill, lawmakers were left in varying states of consternation by Trump\u2019s whipsaw on guns. He suggested publicly last Wednesday that he favored tougher background checks and would forgo due process in taking away guns from the mentally ill, but then sent opposite signals after huddling with National Rifle Association lobbyists the next night.\n Trump\u2019s aides said his vacillation was a function of the controlled chaos the president likes to sow. Trump recently has come to favor opening his meetings to the media \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like his own TV show,\u201d said one adviser \u2014 where he often chews over outlandish ideas, plays to the assembled press and talks up bipartisan consensus, even if it never leads to actual policy.\n Trump doesn\u2019t see guns through the traditional prism of left versus right, but rather as a Manhattan business developer, said one senior administration official, adding that he has told staff that he doesn\u2019t understand why people need assault rifles. \n  [\u2018Every day is a new adventure\u2019: Trump upends Washington and Wall Street with shifts on trade, guns] \n The president\u2019s decision last Thursday to announce steep new tariffs on aluminum and steel \u2014 and gleefully tout a possible trade war \u2014 caught almost his entire team, including some of his top trade advisers, by surprise. \n Earlier in the week, Cohn was telling people he was going to continue stalling Trump on tariffs. He described the tariffs as \u201cobviously stupid,\u201d in the recollection of one person who spoke to him.\n \u201cGary said to him, you can\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cThe more you tell him that, the more he is going to do what he wants to do.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s allies say that in his past ventures he has managed to thrive in chaotic environments, and he has replicated that atmosphere in the White House. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) recalled visiting Trump in the Oval Office for a bill-signing photo opportunity a few weeks into his presidency that was scheduled to last just a few minutes.\n \u201cWe were in there over an hour, and every White House character was in there at one point or another .\u2009.\u2009. It was like Grand Central Station,\u201d King said. \u201cHe has a way of getting things done. He had the worst campaign ever.

In August, lawmakers passed legislation limiting the president\u2019s ability to lift sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its military intervention in Ukraine.\u00a0\n Since coming to power, the Trump administration has taken forceful action against Moscow, closing its consulate in San Francisco and approving lethal aid to Ukraine in its battle with pro-Russian separatists, a move the Obama administration opposed.\u00a0\n Trump, however, has refrained from criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, including in a phone call last week after Russia\u2019s disputed presidential elections.\n  In advance of the call, the president\u2019s staff included a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d and recommending that he raise the poisoning of the former Russian spy.

Bannon attacks the \u201cdeep state.\u201d It is not simply a legal ploy when Republicans running interference for President Trump call the FBI \u201ccorrupt\u201d or when Trump\u2019s lawyer John Dowd calls to shut down the Russia investigation. When a witness to conversations and interactions with Trump who has turned over information to the investigation\u00a0is fired, the danger goes beyond the investigation directly at hand. In one form or another, these are attacks on a vital pillar of democratic government \u2014 the apolitical administration of justice.\n As to Dowd\u2019s comments, which he later claimed represented his own views, reaction across the political spectrum was harsh, while many outside observers raised questions about the motive behind former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe\u2019s firing.\n Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a terse statement:\u00a0\u201cMr. Dowd\u2019s comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of the president and his legal team is not to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn.\u00a0The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel\u2019s investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s actions have broader implications for our democracy. Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group seeking to check attacks on democracy and illegitimate executive branch power grabs, put out a\u00a0white paper\u00a0this month that now seems prescient. \u201cIf those in power can wield the enforcement\u00a0authority of the state to punish their critics or opponents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or to turn a blind eye to\u00a0law-breaking by their friends\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we have lost the rule of law. Thomas Jefferson\u00a0observed, and the Justice Department quotes on its website, \u2018The most sacred of the\u00a0duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.\u2019\u00a0Each\u00a0time the White House intervenes with the Justice Department\u2019s handling of a\u00a0specific-party matter, it risks violating that sacred duty.\u201d\u00a0When the president seeks to reach down into the Justice Department to tilt the outcome of actions or to punish individual lawyers for pursuing justice, a grave injury is done to our democracy.\n Yascha Mounk, author of \u201cThe People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger And How to Save It,\u201d\u00a0tells me, \u201cFor citizens to have trust in their law enforcement agencies, justice doesn\u2019t only need to be done; it also needs to be seen to be done. Given that Mr. McCabe was fired after continual attacks from the President of the United States, we already know that this important principle has been violated in this case.\u201d He adds, \u201cEven if it eventually turns out that McCabe really did misbehave \u2014 and there is no publicly available evidence to substantiate that theory so far \u2014 the manner of his firing undermines the independence of the FBI and the trust Americans can put in their institutions.\u201d He continues, \u201cThe alternative is even worse: If the charges against McCabe eventually turn out to be spurious, then the partisan takeover of the FBI is very far along. And that should terrify any American citizen who values his liberty or his democracy.\u201d\n That politicization of the Justice Department and the implicit threat of retaliation for crossing the president should be of grave concern.\n Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is right to call for immediate hearings. In a statement released on Saturday he said, \u201cDuring my four decades in the Senate, I have never before seen our nation\u2019s career, apolitical law enforcement officials so personally and publicly maligned by politicians \u2014 indeed, by our President. And I have never been so concerned that the walls intended to protect the independence of our dedicated law enforcement professionals, including Special Counsel Mueller, are at risk of crumbling.\u201d He recounted, \u201c\u201cA month ago I asked Chairman Grassley to hold a hearing on the escalating politicized attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. We can all point to mistakes made by Justice Department officials over the course of high-profile investigations during the 2016 elections. Such mistakes rightly fall within the purview of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s routine oversight functions. . . .\u00a0 I believe the Judiciary Committee will fail to fulfill its core oversight responsibility if it does nothing in this moment.\u201d\n Between Dowd\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s after McCabe\u2019s firing, we see the intensification of Trump\u2019s deliberate interference with the Justice Department to suit the president\u2019s personal interests.\u00a0\u201cWhatever Andrew McCabe did or did not do, his firing two days before retiring would obviously never have happened if the President hadn\u2019t personally demanded it,\u201d Protect Democracy Executive Director Ian Bassin surmises. He tells me that this incident shows that \u201cTrump has moved from autocratic rhetoric to autocratic action, as personally ordering the purging of civil servants who are insufficiently loyal is what autocrats do.\u201d He warns the Justice Department inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility not to do Trump\u2019s bidding. Bassin asserts, \u201cTrump\u2019s certain intervention was also so manifestly corrupt that it likely violated constitutional principles that limit a President\u2019s authority to \u2018do whatever he wants with the Justice Department.'\u201d\n In sum, recent events should underscore two dangers that remain so long as Trump is president. First, he may use his executive powers to extract revenge, settle scores and instill fear in political opponents \u2014 just as the Nixon White House did with the Internal Revenue Service.\u00a0Second, he will continue to undermine the morale of prosecutors and investigators, causing them to leave, second-guess their actions or shape their work so as to avoid the president\u2019s wrath. And worst of all, Trump will undermine the public\u2019s faith in entities that are supposed to be apolitical fact-finders and enforcers of the law, leading Americans to question the honesty and fairness of our government and criminal-justice system.

Bob Corker of Tennessee was pressed by the Washington Examiner on why Republicans are hesitant to protect Mueller, and this is what happened:\n  Republicans in Congress are hesitant to antagonize President Trump ahead of ahead of difficult midterm elections, wary of sparking a backlash from a committed grassroots base more loyal to the White House.\n Amid sky-high Democratic enthusiasm and a developing \u201cblue wave,\u201d Republicans can\u2019t afford a war with Trump that depresses GOP turnout. Republicans\u00a0might be worried\u00a0about Trump\u2019s attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller, but they are reluctant to push back, much less support legislation to curtail the president\u2019s ability to fire Mueller and sideline the federal probe \u2026\n \u201cThe president is, as you know \u2014 you\u2019ve seen his numbers among the Republican base \u2014 it\u2019s very strong. It\u2019s more than strong, it\u2019s tribal in nature,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who decided to retire when his second term concludes at year\u2019s end, after periodically sparring with Trump.\n \u201cPeople who tell me, who are out on trail, say, look, people don\u2019t ask about issues anymore. They don\u2019t care about issues. They want to know if you\u2019re with Trump or not,\u201d Corker added.\n  This is a candid admission from a leading GOP lawmaker of what\u2019s really driving the Republican straddle on Mueller. As I\u2019ve noted, Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller put Republicans in a tough spot. The educated swing voters who are driving the Dem anti-Trump resurgence support the Mueller probe and may vote to oust Republicans who won\u2019t check Trump\u2019s excesses. But Trump\u2019s attacks probably rally GOP base voters, large percentages of whom see the Mueller probe as a witch hunt, making it harder for GOP lawmakers to protect that investigation.\n Corker just conceded that this is the driving motive. He suggested GOP voters equate being \u201cwith Trump\u201d in a \u201ctribal\u201d sense with not acting to protect Mueller. Republicans are mindful of this as they craft their position towards Mueller, which includes rhetorical support for the probe but no new substantive limits on Trump\u2019s power to do what they say they don\u2019t want him to do.\n After all, some Republicans have already sponsored bills that would protect Mueller from Trump, by creating a process\u00a0under which any removal of the special counsel would be subjected to judicial review and reversed if it were not for good cause. But these bills are stalled, and Republicans have no intention of changing that.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell yesterday voiced strong support for the Mueller probe. But he again said there\u2019s no reason to act to protect it. And Republican leaders privately rebuffed yet another push by Dems on this front.\n I\u2019m told by Democratic aides familiar with the negotiations over the omnibus spending package that Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi asked GOP leaders to insert a provision that would have protected Mueller from action by Trump, aides familiar with the talks say. But Republican leaders rebuffed the request. (Politico also reported this.) I could not ascertain whether GOP leaders gave a reason for doing so. A GOP aide countered this was never part of the talks.\n At bottom, the GOP position is basically\u00a0to\u00a0beg Trump not to bring the issue to a head, without taking any action to prevent it \u2014 and without signaling what Republicans will do in response if he does. Making this worse, University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck points out\u00a0that if Congress does not act in advance, reinstating Mueller might actually prove legally harder than it would be to protect the investigation now. As Brian Beutler puts it: \u201cRepublicans pleading with Trump not to fire Mueller are more properly understood to be asking him not to put them in the position of having to capitulate.\u201d\n Corker has basically conceded that Republicans believe it would alienate the GOP base to signal that removing Mueller would meet with specific consequences. But if this is the case, and Trump does try to shut down or hamstring the probe, that would only further rally Republican voters behind him. Why would it be any easier to inflict consequences at that point? If, as Corker says, what matters most in this calculus is what GOP voters think of lawmakers\u2019 tribal loyalty to Trump, it would only get harder. And really, why would Trump take any other lesson from what he\u2019s seeing right now?\n * REPUBLICANS SPEND BIG AT TRUMP PROPERTIES: The Post reports that the Republican National Committee spent $271,000 at Trump\u2019s private businesses in February. And this is part of a broad pattern:\n  Since his election, Trump\u2019s private properties\u00a0have attracted steady business from the RNC, party committees, congressional campaigns and outside groups, which spend\u00a0anywhere from about $300 to over $160,000 per event, an analysis by The Washington Post shows. Dozens of Republican lawmakers and candidates have spent campaign or PAC money at the president\u2019s properties since his election, The Post found.\n  It\u2019s worth noting that in so doing, Republicans are rewarding Trump for his refusal to divest in his businesses as president.\n * TRUMP MAY NOT GET HIS WALL: Politico reports that in the negotiations over the big omnibus spending package, talks on protecting the \u201cdreamers\u201d have fallen apart. But:\n  Congressional Democrats spent\u00a0Monday and Tuesday\u00a0pushing to freeze hiring of immigration enforcement officials in return for providing Trump more than $1 billion in funding on his border wall. Democrats and Republicans are likely to agree on about $1.6 billion in border funding that would help finance some fencing and security and avoid directly funding the large concrete wall that Trump wants, according to a Democratic aide.\n  If Trump had agreed to permanent protections for the dreamers, he would have gotten full funding for his wall in exchange. Now he likely won\u2019t ever get it.\n * TRUMP DEFIES TALKING POINTS ON PUTIN: Trump yesterday congratulated Vladimir Putin on his election victory, and The Post reports that he defied his aides in doing so:\n  Trump did not follow \u2026 a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE,\u201d according to officials familiar with the call. Trump also chose not to heed talking points from aides instructing him to condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain with a powerful nerve agent, a case that both the British and U.S. governments have blamed on Moscow.\n  Experts have said Putin\u2019s reelection was rigged, which has led other world leaders to hesitate before congratulating him. Not Trump. Trump loves a winner!\n * PUTIN LEAK RATTLES WHITE HOUSE: Axios reports that the leak about Trump ignoring talking points on Putin has deeply rattled White House advisers:\n    The speed and sensitivity of the leak prompted immediate finger-pointing within the administration, as aides reeled from a leak that could only have come from a small group of people, each of whom is trusted with sensitive national secrets.\u00a0Possible motives\u00a0include concern about how Trump is handling Putin, frustration by the officials\u00a0about Trump ignoring their advice, or internal power games.\n  Perhaps people around Trump want it publicly known that there is plenty of internal disagreement with his handling of Russia.\n \n \n * DEMS CONTEST LOTS OF STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES: Steven Rogers, a politics professor who specializes in state legislative races, calculates that Democrats are running candidates in 85 percent of contests in 16 states that make such info available:\n  More Democrats are running than in any election since 1982. \u2026 Democrats are running in record numbers at least partly in the hope of riding an anti-Trump wave, as Conor Lamb did last week in Pennsylvania.\n  This is potentially a huge deal. If Dems can take back a good amount of territory on the state level, it\u2019ll impact everything from health care to redistricting for the next decade.\n * U.S. TRIES TO LIMIT JUNK FOOD LABELS: The New York Times reports that in NAFTA talks, U.S. negotiators are trying to limit the ability of the three countries to warn consumers about the health threats posed by junk food and high levels of sugar, salt, and fat:\n  Obesity has at least doubled in 73 countries\u00a0since 1980.\u00a0 Officials in Mexico and Canada \u2026 are discussing options like the use of colors, shapes and other easy-to-understand symbols that warn consumers of health risks. \u2026 But the Office of the United States Trade Representative \u2026 s pushing to limit the ability of any Nafta member to require consumer warnings on the front of sugary drinks and fatty packaged foods.\n  As the Times notes, this is because of pressure from \u201cbig American food and soft-drink companies.\u201d It should also\u00a0do wonders for struggling Trump voters in the industrial Midwest.\n * AND TRUMP WARNS OF HIS OWN IMPEACHMENT: Trump said this at a fundraiser last night:\n  \u201cThe Democrats think they\u2019re invincible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean I watch this Maxine Waters. You ever see Maxine Waters? A low-IQ individual. Low IQ. \u2018We will impeach him. We will impeach him.\u2019 But he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter. We will impeach him.\u2019 \u2026 This is what we\u2019re going to have to fight against.\u201d\n  Whether or not it results in impeachment, which will depend on what Robert Mueller finds, it is true that the only hope for any accountability for Trump lies with a Democratic House.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Editorial Board", "body": "President Trump. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \n   IT WAS one thing for Donald Trump, the businessman, to require employees, investors, ex-wives and adult-film stars to sign nondisclosure agreements. As distasteful as those agreements may have been, he was exercising the legal rights of a private citizen. It is an entirely different \u2014 and completely unacceptable \u2014 matter for Donald Trump, the president, to think he can similarly gag White House staff. \n Federal employees, including those in the West Wing, work for the American people, not some corporate executive, and their loyalty is to the Constitution, not an individual. Attempts to bully them into giving up their First Amendment right to speak are yet another troubling example of Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s failure to understand the duties and sensibilities of his public office.\n Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for signed confidentiality agreements, The Post\u2019s Ruth Marcus reported in revealing their existence, was prompted by his fury over embarrassing leaks early in his administration. The New York Times subsequently reported that White House Counsel Donald McGahn had cautioned that threatening penalties for those revealing secrets was illegal and unenforceable, but \u2014 mainly to placate the president \u2014 eventually drew up a broad document barring officials from revealing what they heard and saw at work.\n The specific details of the agreements are unclear. The White House has refused to release a copy of the document or answer our questions. Among them: How many officials signed nondisclosure agreements? Over what period of time? Do they give Mr.\u00a0Trump a personal right of action after the end of his presidency? Are there exceptions for congressional testimony? \n No one denies the need to keep secret sensitive government information that could undermine the interests and security of the country. But there is already a system in place that classifies information at various levels and provides for appropriate clearance levels and access, as well as resulting penalties for those found in violation. It is routine to require federal employees and contractors who work with classified information to sign nondisclosure agreements. \n The fact that this administration was, until recently, all too willing to let people without appropriate security clearance be privy to top-secret materials makes the push for these newly disclosed and unprecedented nondisclosure agreements all the more suspect. The main motivator appears to be the president\u2019s ego and not the national interest. \n Any appeal to Mr. Trump to disavow use of these confidentiality agreements based on historic norms, constitutional principles or the need for accountability in government would probably fall on deaf ears. After all, the country is still waiting for him to fulfill his promise to release his tax returns. So perhaps the government accountability committees in Congress could stir themselves and demand to see a copy of the agreement.

Lighthizer to propose within 15 days tariff increases designed to compensate the United States for lost profits and jobs. After a comment period, the list, targeting Chinese products that benefited from U.S. technology, will be made public.\n But even as he confronted China over technology, Trump weakened a new tariff meant to protect U.S. production of industrial metals, potentially exempting the European Union, Brazil and other countries accounting for two-thirds of steel imports and more than half of foreign-made aluminum.\n By challenging China, Trump rejected the approach of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, gambling that China will bend before he does. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this is going to turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, director of the project on Chinese business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt could be resolved in a few months, or it could spiral out of control into a broader strategic rivalry.\u201d\n Early reviews were not good. On Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 700 points, or almost 3 percent, as investors blanched at the prospect of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about this administration\u2019s shoot-first approach,\u201d said Josh Bolten, president of the Business Roundtable. \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. The victims of the actions that the administration is proposing to take are principally Americans.\u201d\n Trump is betting that disrupting the traditional U.S. approach to China will yield a better commercial bargain for American businesses and workers than the status quo that he blames for hollowing out American industry.\n Among U.S. politicians and business leaders, there is broad agreement that China has violated U.S. intellectual property rights through restrictive licensing arrangements in China and outright cybertheft in the United States.\n But Thursday\u2019s actions threatens to unravel global supply chains, increase costs for consumers and open the door to Chinese retaliation against U.S. farmers and businesses. \n \u201cThe biggest and most powerful American companies are stuck in the middle,\u201d said James McGregor, APCO Worldwide\u2019s chairman for greater China. \u201cThey\u2019re schizophrenic now. They don\u2019t want today\u2019s business to be eliminated. But they know China\u2019s plan for tomorrow is to eliminate them in the Chinese market and then take them on globally.\u201d\n At $60 billion in affected products, Trump\u2019s China actions carry a bigger punch than the tariffs on $46 billion in steel and aluminum imports that he announced March 8.\n The impact of those earlier levies may shrink further: Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that products from the European Union, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil will not be affected when the tariffs go into effect on Friday while negotiations over potential exemptions continue.\n Trump already had exempted Canada and Mexico from the import levies for the duration of talks aimed at renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n Still, the likely China tariffs pose little immediate threat to the growing economy because they will touch just 3 percent of total goods imports, according to Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist for Capital Economics.\n The big worry is how China responds and whether the countries stumble into a tit-for-tat slugfest. In Washington, the Chinese Embassy distributed a statement from Ambassador Cui Tiankai rejecting Trump\u2019s claims of intellectual property violations and warning that his approach would hurt \u201cAmerican middle-class people,\u201d U.S. companies and the stock market.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t want a trade war. But we are not afraid of it,\u201d Cui said. \u201cIf somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will certainly fight back and retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.\u201d\n The United States last adopted this sort of uncompromising approach in a 1995 dispute over intellectual property rights. China ultimately acceded to U.S. demands, but today its economy is almost 17 times as big, making it less vulnerable to American pressure.\n A Sino-U.S. trade war would affect economies that account for roughly 40 percent of global output, which explains the mounting apprehension on Wall Street.\n \u201cTrump\u2019s economics team blew it,\u201d economist Chris Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank wrote in a research note. \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. Tariffs mean a trade war and the news has the world\u2019s investors running for the exits.\u201d\n The president blamed China for the loss of 60,000 factories and 6\u00a0million jobs, a number that most economists say blends the impact on U.S. employment of both Chinese competition and automation.\n Trump said that unfair Chinese trade practices are responsible for the yawning U.S. trade deficit with China, which has reached a record $375 billion on his watch.\n \u201cAny way you look at it, it\u2019s the largest of any country in the history of our world,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s out of control.\u201d\n The White House expects the new taxes, which could reach up to 1,300 specific imports, will have a \u201cminimal impact\u201d upon consumers. But even business groups that support the goal of requiring changes in Chinese industrial policy voiced opposition to the tariffs.\n \u201cThere is no way to impose $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports without it having a negative impact on American consumers. Make no mistake, these tariffs may be aimed at China, but the bill will be charged to American consumers who will pay more at the checkout for the items they shop for every day,\u201d said Hun Quach, vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n Trump and his aides provided varying estimates of the value of the Chinese goods at issue. The president referred in his Roosevelt Room remarks to \u201cabout $60 billion,\u201d while a senior White House aide who briefed reporters two hours before the president put the figure at \u201cabout $50 billion.\u201d\n The official cannot be identified under the ground rules for such White House briefings.\n Trump also ordered Lighthizer to complain to the World Trade Organization about China\u2019s discriminatory licensing practices for foreign companies, an effort that U.S. officials hope will draw support from American allies in Europe and Japan.\n The president described the actions against China as part of a broader reappraisal of U.S. global relationships, featuring a willingness to use tariff threats to force concessions from trading partners.\n \u201cWe will end up negotiating these things rather than fighting over them,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, in an apparent reference to fears of a trade war.\n The president also alluded to political calculations, saying that voter concerns over economic losses from bad trade deals was \u201cmaybe one of the main reasons\u201d he won the White House.\n \u201cThe era of economic surrender is over,\u201d Vice President Pence added.\n Trump\u2019s actions won plaudits from Democrats such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). But they drew fire from the conservative National Taxpayers Union\u2019s Bryan Riley, who called the proposed China tariffs \u201cself-destructive and reckless.\u201d\n Under the measures targeting Beijing announced Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will draw up new investment restrictions to address concerns about Chinese investors, including state-sponsored investment funds, acquiring U.S. companies to gain access to their technology.\n \u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trading practices,\u201d said Everett Eissenstat, deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs.\n Since the president took office 14 months ago, his remarks on China have swung between effusive praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping and tough talk about its trade practices. In recent months, Trump has adopted an increasingly bellicose tone, with the White House billing Thursday\u2019s actions as \u201ctargeting China\u2019s economic aggression\u201d and the president\u2019s trade agenda released in February labeling the country a \u201chostile\u201d economic power.\n \u201cChina is engaged in practices which harm this country,\u201d said Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy.\n Trump\u2019s trade moves potentially mark a sharp break with decades of growing U.S. economic engagement with China, which began in the late 1970s as the country emerged from Maoist autarky.\n Years of commercial delegations and diplomatic dialogue saw trade between the two countries mushroom to $635\u00a0billion from $116\u00a0billion in 2000. Yet at the same time, U.S. companies complained about strict restraints on their operations in the Chinese market. Government regulations typically limited them to a minority stake alongside a local partner.\n The administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama sought to persuade the Chinese to embrace more fully a market-oriented policy. Through 2013, when a high-level Communist Party conclave proclaimed a \u201cdecisive role\u201d for the market and officials promised to pare back the state\u2019s role in the economy, U.S. officials believed China was headed in the right direction.\n \u201cThat process has failed,\u201d Navarro said.\n Trump administration officials say that China\u2019s economic policies are distorting global markets for key products such as steel and threaten to have the same effect on more advanced industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n \u201cChina benefits far more from the U.S.-China relationship than the U.S. does,\u201d Navarro said.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Shane Harris", "body": "Officials in at least four countries have privately discussed ways they can manipulate Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, by taking advantage of his\u00a0complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter.\u00a0\n Among those nations discussing ways to influence Kushner to their advantage were the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico, the current and former officials said.\u00a0\n It is unclear if any of those countries acted on the discussions, but Kushner\u2019s contacts with certain foreign government officials have raised concerns inside the White House and are a reason he has been unable to obtain a permanent security clearance, the officials said. \n Kushner\u2019s interim security clearance was downgraded last week from the top-secret to the secret level, which should restrict the regular access he has had to highly-classified information, according to administration officials.\n H.R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, learned that Kushner had contacts with foreign officials that he did not coordinate through the National Security Council or officially report. The issue of foreign officials talking about their meetings with Kushner and their perception of his vulnerabilities was a subject raised in McMaster\u2019s daily intelligence briefings, according to the current and former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n Within the White House, Kushner\u2019s lack of government experience and his business debt were seen from the beginning of his tenure as potential points of leverage that foreign governments could use to influence him, the current and former officials said.\n They could also have legal implications. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has asked people about the protocols Kushner used when he set up conversations with foreign leaders, according to a former U.S. official.\n  [New White House security clearance policy could put \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019 on Kushner] \n Officials in the White House were concerned that Kushner was\u00a0\u201cnaive and being tricked\u201d in conversations with foreign officials, some of whom said they wanted to deal only with Kushner directly and not more experienced personnel, said one former White House official.\u00a0\n Kushner has an unusually complex set of business arrangements and foreign entanglements for a senior White House aide, experts have said. But his behavior while in office has only drawn more scrutiny and raised concerns that he would be unable to obtain a final security clearance, which he needs to perform the many jobs Trump has entrusted to him, from negotiating foreign trade deals to overseeing a Middle East peace process.\u00a0\n \n \u201cWe will not respond substantively to unnamed sources peddling second-hand hearsay with rank speculation that continue to leak inaccurate information,\u201d said Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Kushner\u2019s lawyer. \n White House officials said McMaster was taken aback by some of Kushner\u2019s foreign contacts. \n \u201cWhen he learned about it, it surprised him,\u201d one official said. \u201cHe thought that was weird...It was an unusual thing. I don\u2019t know that any White House has done it this way before.\u201d\n The official said that McMaster was \u201cnot concerned but wanted an explanation. It seemed unusual to him.\u201d\n In the months since, McMaster and Kushner have worked to coordinate so that the National Security Council is aware of Kushner\u2019s contacts with foreign officials and so Kushner has access to the council\u2019s country experts to prepare for meetings.\n \u201cGeneral McMaster has the highest regard for Mr. Kushner and the two work well together,\u201d said NSC spokesman Michael Anton. Everything they do is integrated...it\u2019s seamless.\u201d\n  [Mueller and Trump: Born to wealth, raised to lead. Then, sharply different choices.] \n Foreign governments routinely discuss ways they can influence senior officials in all administrations.\u00a0\n \u201cEvery country will seek to find their point of leverage,\u201d said one person familiar with intelligence intercepts of foreign officials discussing Kushner.\u00a0\n But Kushner came to his position with an unusually complex set of business holdings and a family company facing significant debt issues.\n A Mexican diplomatic source said that Kushner\u00a0\u201chas remained strictly professional\u201d in his dealings with the country,\u00a0\u201cwith both sides looking after their interests but trying to find common ground.\u201d\u00a0\n Officials from the UAE identified Kushner as early as the spring of 2017 as particularly manipulable because of his family\u2019s search for investors in their real estate company, current and former officials said.\n Officials at the embassies of China, Israel and the UAE did not respond to requests for comment.\n Kushner\u2019s lack of a final security clearance has drawn scrutiny in recent weeks. He had an interim clearance that gives him access to information at the top-secret level, as well as more highly classified information, such as the president\u2019s daily intelligence briefing. But the application for his final clearance dragged on for more than a year.\u00a0The downgrading of his interim clearance from top secret to secret was first reported by Politico.\n On Feb. 9, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that significant issues would further delay Kushner\u2019s security clearance process, according to four people familiar with their discussions.\u00a0\n Kushner has repeatedly amended a form detailing his contacts with foreign persons. Not fully disclosing foreign contacts ordinarily would result in a clearance being denied, experts said.\u00a0\n On Friday, Trump said White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly would make a final decision on whether Kushner would continue to have a security clearance.\n During 2016, Kushner was simultaneously running his family business, Kushner Cos., and helping to oversee Trump\u2019s campaign. One of his top business concerns was what to do with his family\u2019s investment in 666 Fifth Ave. in New York, which the company bought under his direction for $1.8 billion in 2007, the highest price paid at the time for a U.S. office tower. The purchase became troubled as the Great Recession hit, and Kushner refinanced it, leaving the company with a $1.2 billion debt that comes due in January 2019.\n The Manhattan property has been a particularly nettlesome problem inside the government because Kushner\u2019s company has sought foreign money on the project.\u00a0\n Kushner and his company had proposed a redevelopment plan that would double the building\u2019s size, requiring major new investment. Before Trump took office, Kushner and other company officials explored several options for the financing. They met with an executive of a Chinese-run insurance company, Anbang, which had bought the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. They also discussed a possible investment by the former finance minister of Qatar, who oversaw an investment fund. But after Kushner served as Trump\u2019s senior adviser for a few months in the White House, questions arose about potential conflicts of interest, the financing talks ended, and neither Anbang nor the Qatari fund signed on.\n  Thomas Barrack, a close Trump friend who asked the Qataris to consider investing in the Fifth Avenue property, has told The Washington Post that the refinancing efforts were \u201ccrushed\u201d because Kushner\u2019s move to the White House \u201cjust about completely chilled the market, and [potential investors] just said, \u2018No way \u2014 can\u2019t be associated with any appearances of conflict of interest,\u2019 even though there was none.\u201d\n \u00a0Questions have also been raised about whether Kushner discussed financing with a Russian banker. Kushner met in December 2016 with Sergey Gorkov, the top executive of Vnesheconombank.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n \n One short, newly-revealed email from a Manhattan banker just made it much more likely that the $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election violated federal law.\n NBC News on Friday reported that Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime ally and attorney, had used a Trump Organization email address as he worked to secure the payment to Daniels. Daniels alleges that the money was paid to keep her from telling the media about a sexual relationship she had with Trump; Cohen and Trump continue to deny that relationship.\n In particular, NBC received a copy of an email from a banker at First Republic Bank\u00a0that\u00a0was sent to Cohen. Cohen then forwarded the email to his private Gmail account and, from there, to Daniels\u2019s attorney.\n  Notice the email address. The banker emailed Cohen at mcohen@trumporg.com. Trumporg.com redirects to Trump.com. The domain is registered to the Trump Organization. It is, in other words, an email address that belongs to the Trump Organization. An asset of the company.\n And that means that federal election law was almost certainly violated.\n Last month, we spoke with Lawrence Noble, senior director and general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. He walked us through the danger zones for the Daniels payment in terms of what election law prohibits. At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear where the money had come from or how it got to Daniels. We lacked a number of details about how Daniels and Trump\u2019s team, Cohen in particular, had interacted.\n We\u2019ve learned a lot since then. In addition to the email above, we\u2019ve also seen the lawsuit filed by Daniels alleging that the agreement to remain silent was never in effect because Trump failed to sign it. Included in that lawsuit is this element of the \u201cfactual background\u201d to the matter at-hand.\n  Daniels\u2019s lawsuit asserts that Trump learned that she was talking to media outlets shortly after a number of women had come forward to rebut Trump\u2019s denial during the Oct. 10, 2016 presidential debate that he\u2019d never actually groped women as he\u2019d implied in the famous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Hearing that she might tell her story, too, Trump \u201csought to silence\u201d her, \u201cthus helping to ensure he won the Presidential Election.\u201d\n Those two things together \u2014 that a Trump Organization email address was used to facilitate the payment and that the payment was linked to the campaign \u2014 would constitute a legal violation. The email from the bank to Cohen doesn\u2019t prove that company funds were used to pay Daniels, which Noble told us last month would itself be illegal. But just using that email address is its own problem.\n Common Cause\u2018s Paul Ryan (himself a former lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center) noted on Twitter that the use of Trump Organization resources likely violates 11 CFR 114.2(f). That reads, with our added emphasis:\n  \u201cCorporations and labor organizations (including officers, directors or other representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election \u2026\u201d\n  \u201cThe use of the Trump Organization email is evidence that Cohen\u2019s services were, at least in part, being paid for by the Trump Organization,\u201d Noble said in an email. \u201cThat would be an illegal corporate contribution to the campaign even if the company did not pay the $130,000.\u201d\n Paying someone to be quiet so that they don\u2019t damage a political effort is an in-kind contribution to that campaign, covering a cost meant to aid efforts to win the election. When we spoke in February, Noble predicted that the almost-certain defense will be that the Daniels payment didn\u2019t qualify as a campaign contribution. That Cohen (who does seem to have fronted the $130,000 himself) made a payment to a woman shortly before the election for reasons that had nothing to do with the election itself.\n Noble was understandably skeptical of this argument, given what was known then. But he also pointed out that even if what happened with Daniels was the sort of thing that was very common for Cohen as part of his duties, the Daniels scenario could still be a contribution if Cohen understood that it would aid Trump\u2019s electoral effort.\n The Daniels lawsuit makes clear that her team, at least, thought that this was Cohen\u2019s (and Trump\u2019s) goal. The payment was made in part \u201cto ensure he won the Presidential Election,\u201d the lawsuit reads. What\u2019s more, the original agreement itself includes stipulations that Daniels (identified as \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d or \u201cPP\u201d) should take certain actions to secure her silence by Nov. 1, 2016 \u2014 a week before Election Day.\n  (\u201cDD\u201d was \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d \u2014 Trump.)\n So we have an agreement executed right before the election with a mandate that Daniels take certain actions protecting Trump against the story coming out before the election that resulted in a $130,000 payment that Cohen facilitated using resources provided by the Trump Organization.\n The final call is the FEC\u2019s. But in the view of Ryan and Noble, that\u2019s a violation of federal election law.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Matt Zapotosky", "body": "The FBI office that handles employee discipline has recommended firing the bureau\u2019s former deputy director over allegations that he authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter and misled investigators when asked about it \u2014 though Justice Department officials are still reviewing the matter and have not come to a final decision, a person familiar with the case said. \n The recommendation from the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility is likely to add fuel to the political fire surrounding former deputy director Andrew McCabe, who abruptly stepped down from his post earlier this year but technically remained an FBI employee.\n McCabe was hoping to retire in just days, when he becomes eligible for his full benefits. If he is fired, he could lose his retirement benefits. President Trump has long made McCabe a particular target of his ire, and the recommendation to fire the former No. 2 FBI official could give him new ammunition. \n Through a representative, McCabe declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cThe Department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated. That process includes recommendations from career employees and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.\u201d\n An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. \n Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has for some time been working on a report that blasts McCabe for allowing two high-ranking bureau officials to sit down with the Wall Street Journal as the news outlet prepared a story in 2016 on an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s family foundation, then misleading the inspector general\u2019s team about his actions. A person familiar with the matter said Horowitz\u2019s findings are what sparked the Office of Professional Responsibility\u2019s recommendation, which was first reported by the New York Times. Horowitz\u2019s report has not yet been released.\n  [Report said to fault FBI\u2019s former No. 2 for approving improper media disclosure, misleading inspector general] \n McCabe, 49, had long been expected to retire on March 18 though he abruptly left his post earlier this year after his boss, FBI Director Christopher Wray, was told of what the inspector general had found. \n The situation now seems fraught for all involved. If the Justice Department does not move on the recommendation, conservatives might view officials there as unfairly protecting McCabe. President Trump \u2014 who already has a strained relationship with Justice Department leaders \u2014 might be particularly displeased. \n But if the FBI fires McCabe with just days to go before his retirement, it could be viewed as bending to the will of a vindictive president. Trump has previously suggested McCabe was biased in favor of Clinton, pointing out that McCabe\u2019s wife, who ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Virginia legislature, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from the political action committee of Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a noted Clinton ally. The president remarked in December that McCabe was \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d \n The inspector general has since last January been investigating the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the politically charged probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, which is separate from the foundation probe. McCabe represents but a piece of that work. \n Horowitz is also examining broad allegations of misconduct involving former FBI Director James B. Comey, including the public statement he made recommending that the Clinton email case be closed without charges and his decision 11 days before the election to reveal to Congress that the FBI had resumed its work. McCabe briefly took over as the FBI\u2019s acting director after Trump fired Comey in May. \n The story for which McCabe authorized FBI officials to discuss came just as the bureau announced it was resuming its look at Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, though it focused more on a different case involving her family\u2019s foundation. \n The story presented McCabe as a complicated figure \u2014 one who lower level officials felt was stymieing their work, even though it detailed McCabe pushing back against Justice Department officials so the case could move forward.\n The inspector general was interested in McCabe\u2019s role in authorizing officials to talk about the matter, people familiar with the case said, because the story detailed ongoing criminal investigative work, which law enforcement officials are not normally allowed to discuss. \n The Wall Street Journal story was written by Devlin Barrett, who is now a reporter at The Washington Post. Recently released text messages show that Barrett had talked with the FBI\u2019s top spokesman, Michael Kortan, and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who worked for McCabe, two days before it was published. \n Background briefings with reporters are common in Washington, particularly when reporters have information that officials feel compelled to respond to or add context.

In mid-February, he surfaced at the only public forum between Lipinski and his liberal challenger, Marie Newman, sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, introducing himself to members of the news media\u00a0and asking if they wanted to interview him. On election night, several outlets ran news alerts about Jones\u2019s primary win \u2014 which was never in doubt.\n Republicans are now faced with putting up an alternative candidate that they\u00a0doubt\u00a0could win the election in November. In 2016, Lipinski faced no challenger at all; in 2014, a bad year for his party overall, he won reelection by 29 points in a district that was drawn specifically to keep him in Congress. But more than 64,000 votes were cast for his opponent, in a year when Gov. Bruce Rauner (R-Ill.) won by just 142,284 votes.\n Illinois election law gives\u00a0candidates outside the Democratic and Republican parties several options for getting on the ballot. Third-party candidates can file to run as late as June, and write-in candidates can declare as late as September.

In 2012, an unknown conspiracy theorist named Mark E. Clayton won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Tennessee; the party recruited a write-in candidate, who was halted after courts decided that Clayton had\u00a0fulfilled the requirements to be the Democratic nominee.\n Two years earlier, Kesha Rogers, a member of the fringe political movement led by Lyndon LaRouche, won the Democratic nomination in a House race the party had written off.

He\u2019s tired of advisers who are\u00a0steering him away from his true agenda and persona, goes this narrative; instead, he\u2019s finally getting back to the basics that make Trump who he really is.\n But this framing is built on a distortion that underplays just how dangerous Trump\u2019s evolution really threatens to become. What\u2019s really happening is that Trump is increasingly surrounding himself with advisers who are better than the \u201cadults in the room\u201d at\u00a0manipulating his erratic and shifting impulses and whims, by giving a shape to them that he can accept and act upon.\n Axios reports this morning that sources close to Trump \u201cfeels\u201d that Bolton \u201cwill finally deliver the foreign policy the president wants\u201d on Iran and North Korea. What makes this account almost certainly\u00a0dead on is the word \u201cfeels.\u201d As Michael Warren of the Weekly Standard points out, Bolton has skillfully used his conservative media perches to send messages to Trump that nudge him towards \u201cmore hawkish stances,\u201d by \u201ccasting them as fulfillments of Trump\u2019s own pledges and true beliefs.\u201d\n Bolton wants to bomb Iran. There is no particular reason to believe that Trump either favors or opposes that stance. Trump knows that the Iran nuclear deal is bad because Barack Obama negotiated it; Trump knows Trump is strong and Obama is weak; and Trump knows his supporters cheered when he vowed to rip the agreement to shreds. But Trump has not meaningfully articulated why we should pull out of it, because he can\u2019t.\n And so, when Trump was debating whether to certify the Iran deal last summer, and was unhappy with advisers urging him to do so on substantive grounds, then-adviser Stephen K. Bannon handed him a piece by Bolton urging him to decertify. Bolton\u2019s piece cast that\u00a0that as the only course consistent with Trump\u2019s \u201cview that the Iran deal was a diplomatic debacle,\u201d because Obama had given Iran \u201cunimaginably favorable terms.\u201d Trump has no idea whether this is true or not \u2014 it isn\u2019t \u2014 but it persuaded Trump to come close to decertifying, though ultimately the adults prevailed that time.\n The point is that Trump doesn\u2019t grasp the details, but Bolton skillfully gave shape to his impulses. Now Bolton will be in an even better position to persuade Trump to kill the Iran deal, and if and when that happens, to push Trump more in the direction of his own bellicose designs, which Bolton will almost certainly cast as in keeping with Trump\u2019s vow to be tougher than Obama.\n Or take North Korea. Everyone knows that when Trump agreed to meet with Kim Jong-Un, he did so on an impulse, with no thought through rationale or sense of the risks and complexities involved. Bolton wants to go to war with North Korea and has dismissed talks. But he cleverly greeted Trump\u2019s announcement by describing it as \u201cshock and awe\u201d and an opportunity for Trump to give North Korea an ultimatum if it does not immediately begin \u201ctotal denuclearization.\u201d This, too, gave a shape to Trump\u2019s impulse that he will very likely find flattering, but also one that might move Trump towards Bolton\u2019s position.\n If Trump now \u201cfeels\u201d that Bolton will give him the policies he wants on Iran and North Korea, it\u2019s because Bolton is skilled at making Trump feel that way. And that\u2019s ominous, because it means Bolton may be able to push Trump towards believing that Bolton\u2019s goals are a realization of his own foreign policy vision, such as it is.\n Trump\u2019s vision is formless\n And that foreign policy vision is formless. During the campaign, Trump opposed the Iraq War, sending the message that he won\u2019t get drawn into the misguidedly idealistic or stupidly conceived military adventurism so typical of our clueless, corrupt elites.\u00a0But Trump has never been either antiwar or an isolationist. His posture was rather that he will magically smash our enemies and aggressively represent our interests abroad effortlessly, without any serious cost, because he\u2019s tougher, stronger, and smarter than those elites. How hard will it be for Bolton to shape those impulses into something more in line with his own vision?\n On trade, the process leading up to Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs was a joke with no regard for specifics. But it did showcase the rising star of trade adviser Alex Navarro,\u00a0who unabashedly stated that he had provided the \u201canalytics\u201d to \u201cconfirm his intuition,\u201d which is \u201calways right.\u201d Trump just pushed out legal adviser John Dowd, who advised\u00a0careful cooperation with Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, and has added Joe diGenova, who has fed Trump\u2019s fantasies of a deep state plot against him, signaling the much more aggressive confrontation with Mueller that Trump clearly craves, without having the foggiest strategic rationale. In both cases, these people are successfully giving shape to Trump\u2019s impulses.\n As Michelle Goldberg recently observed, one after another, the people who are supposed to be \u201cchecking Donald Trump\u2019s worst instincts and most erratic whims\u201d have departed. But this doesn\u2019t mean Trump is getting back to being who he always wanted to be. It means he is increasingly listening to people who are good at exploiting and shaping those instincts and whims.\n * KELLY WANTED McMASTER OUT, BUT NOT BOLTON IN: The New York Times reports some of the backstory on why Trump is replacing McMaster with Bolton:\n  McMaster \u2026 had a difficult relationship with the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, people close to the White House said. Mr. Kelly, they said, prevailed in easing out General McMaster but failed to prevent Mr. Trump from hiring Mr. Bolton, whom they said Mr. Kelly fears will behave like a cabinet official rather than a staff member.\n  Also, as the Times notes, McMaster committed the sin of acknowledging that Russia interfered in our election, which drew Trump\u2019s Twitter wrath.\n * BOLTON FAVORS REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN: The Post\u2019s write-up reminds us that Bolton has gone a lot further\u00a0than merely calling for withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal:\n  In January, Bolton told Fox News that Trump should dump the nuclear deal, reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran, and work toward an overthrow of the government there. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do, and we should do it,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cOur goal should be regime change in Iran.\u201d He similarly called for bombing Iran in a New York Times editorial in 2015.\n  Why yes, Bolton did indeed call for bombing Iran in 2015.\n * A FRIGHTENING CHOICE: Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp aptly sums up Bolton\u2019s career and the significance of his appointment:\n  Bolton has said the United States should declare war on both\u00a0North Korea\u00a0and\u00a0Iran. He was credibly accused of\u00a0manipulating US intelligence\u00a0on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war and of\u00a0abusive treatment\u00a0of his subordinates. He once \u201cjoked\u201d about\u00a0knocking 10 stories\u00a0off the UN building in New York. \u2026\u00a0American foreign policy may be soon be shaped by someone who seems to truly believe that war is the answer to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n  As Christopher Preble of the Cato Institute puts it: \u201cBolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible.\u201d\n * BOLTON DEEPLY ALARMS DEMS: This quote from Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut aptly sums up the reaction of many Democrats to the Bolton appointment:\n  \u201cThe person who will be first in first out of the Oval Office on national security matters passionately believes the U.S. should launch pre-emptive war against both Iran and North Korea with no authorization from Congress. My God.\u201d\n  McMaster had urged caution against scrapping the Iran deal, though he\u2019d also urged a hard line against North Korea. Now we\u2019ve got someone even more hawkish.\n * SPENDING BILL PASSES AS REPUBLICANS SCRAP PRINCIPLES: The Post reports that the Senate passed the massive $1.3 trillion omnibus, which jacks up spending on defense and non-defense spending alike:\n  It abandons GOP claims of fiscal discipline in a stark reversal of the promises many Republicans ran on in capturing control of the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014 as they railed against what they described as a profligate President Barack Obama. And in another about-face, GOP leaders tossed aside their own rules and past complaints about Democrats to rush the legislation through the House ahead of the Friday midnight government shutdown deadline.\n  Anyone who is surprised by this hasn\u2019t been paying attention to how Republicans have operated for the last decade or more.\n * TRUMP THREATENS VETO: Hello, Mr. President:\n   I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J.

Yet Trump is systematically alienating those countries \u2026 Trump\u2019s trade policy is quickly turning into an object lesson in the wages of ignorance.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n \n It would have been fascinating to run into Donald Trump at one of his properties five years ago and complain about the service. Would he have accepted the criticism and pledged to do better? Or would he instead have suggested that the problem was with the team he was working with, that he really tried to get them to fix the problem and that he doesn\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t?\n As president, there\u2019s been a dearth of ownership of problems on Trump\u2019s part. Perhaps a thousand articles have been written about how Trump fails to live up to the \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d mantra that Harry Truman made famous, including by yours truly. In part, that\u2019s a function of Trump\u2019s consistently demonstrating his unwillingness to accept responsibility for what happens in Washington, an abdication that stands out in sharper relief given that his party controls both the House and the Senate. His frequent protestations that the filibuster is keeping the Senate from enacting his vision is hampered by the fact that the difference-making opposition in that chamber often stems from Republicans.\n Trump raised the filibuster again on Friday during what he\u2019d billed as a \u201cnews conference\u201d but mostly ended up being a statement to the media. That statement echoed his complaints earlier in the day that the spending bill passed by Congress didn\u2019t include what he wanted to see. He stopped short of following through on his tweeted veto threat, though, which wasn\u2019t terribly surprising given that the White House had on Thursday touted that Trump himself had locked up the critical parts of the funding bill.\n  \u201cThere are a lot of things that I\u2019m unhappy about in this bill,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that we shouldn\u2019t have had in this bill. But we were, in a sense, forced \u2014 if we want to build our military, we were forced to have. There are some things that we should have in the bill. But I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I\u2019m not going to do it again.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider, in many cases, them to be bad or them to be a waste of money,\u201d he said later. \u201cBut that\u2019s the way, unfortunately, right now the system works.\u201d\n It\u2019s trite by now, but it\u2019s still important to note that this was specifically the logjam that Trump promised to break while he was campaigning. He was the master of dealmaking! He presented to the voters that he possessed some sort of skeleton key to unlock bipartisan and international agreement on any and every possible point of contention. He breezily dismissed partisan bickering on Capitol Hill as the sort of thing he could brush aside in an instant were he given access to the White House. He was given that access; the skeleton key apparently remained back in Trump Tower.\n What\u2019s weird about Trump\u2019s positioning on this bill (and on past legislative stumbles, like health-care reform) is that Trump doesn\u2019t only abdicate his claim to being a master dealmaker, he also positions himself as somehow powerless in the face of the entrenched interests in Washington.\n   Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration.

The dealmaker who\u2019d drain the swamp now wrings his hands at how the swamp keeps him from making deals.\n There are two theories for what\u2019s happening here.\n One is that Trump is strategically positioning himself in opposition to congressional leadership because it lets him maintain one of his favorite selling points from 2016: He\u2019s an outsider. It\u2019s awfully tricky for a president of the United States to position himself as oppositional to the government he runs, but one way to do that is to hint at how the establishment is keeping you from getting anything done. Trump is the guy trying to crack D.C. open, and D.C. keeps fighting back. That, this theory goes, is why Trump willingly tells America that he can\u2019t do the thing that he said he\u2019d do when he got to the White House. He knows where the boundaries are, and he steps outside of them to maintain his image as the guy who is necessary to shake things up.\n That may be one step more complicated than it needs to be. The other theory for why Trump positions himself as weak is that he\u2019d rather blame other people for unpopular things than worry about how that reflected on his capabilities. This is the hotel question that we led with. The manager of a hotel would, ideally, accept responsibility for problems at the hotel and assure that they\u2019d be fixed. A manager who blames the cleaning staff and says there was nothing he could do? Not super confidence inspiring.\n That analogy is flawed, obviously, since Trump can\u2019t fire Congress (to his chagrin). But it demonstrates the difference between two approaches to leadership.\n Let\u2019s go back to Friday\u2019s bill. Why did Trump apparently have a change of heart overnight? According to The Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey, because people called him and complained about it.\n   Lot of Trump friends and allies are dialing him in the last 24 hours telling him he's going to look bad if he signs the omnibus spending bill and that he will be played for something of a fool by Schumer, per two people with knowledge of the calls.\n\u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) March 23, 2018  \n \n The reporting on Trump has consistently indicated that his views on a subject are often heavily influenced by whoever spoke with him last. When those views are critical of something he\u2019s contemplating, his position might then align with those views. If he\u2019s stuck having to embrace something about which he\u2019s heard complaints, the middle path is to go along with it while complaining about it. Trump tweeted that he was considering a veto, the strongest position a president can take in opposition to a bill. And maybe he was \u2014 but even if he wasn\u2019t he can now point to that tweet as evidence of just how unhappy he was about having to sign it. He can point to his public statement and say that it\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 fault.\n Trump came to office having spent decades as the autocratic leader of the Trump Organization. The presidency doesn\u2019t work that way. The presidency is heavily dependent on negotiation and compromise \u2014 even when the president\u2019s party controls Congress. What the White House did on Thursday is position Trump as the leader who brought both sides together for a solution. What Trump did on Friday is position himself as a lamentably powerless observer who was forced into a position he opposed.\n Either because he wants to be seen as hostile to D.C. \u2014 or because he wants to avoid blame for something people don\u2019t like.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "James Mcauley", "body": "Former top White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon spoke to supporters of France\u2019s far-right National Front March 10 in Lille, France. (Reuters) \n \n  Former White House senior staffer Stephen K.

And history is on our side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tide of history is with us, and it will compel us to victory after victory after victory.\u201d\n His speech contained a familiar litany of attacks against global elites, Hillary Clinton and journalists. Some of it translated; some of it did not. When Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, mentioned that he once sold a company to the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale, the room erupted in jeers, not cheers. \u201cI thought you might like that,\u201d he said, in response.\n   Former senior adviser to President Trump, Stephen K. Bannon, left, and National Front president Marine Le Pen, at a news conference Saturday in Lille, France. (Thibault Vandermersch/European Pressphoto Agency) \n  [Bannon\u2019s post-Trump, post-Breitbart life is not what you\u2019d expect] \n On some level, the speech presented another development in the transatlantic relationship between far-right movements in the United States and Europe, particularly in France. Last month, Marion-Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen \u2014 the niece of the National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen \u2014 spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.\n Her speech echoed many of the statements of Donald Trump, the man Bannon helped get elected to the U.S. presidency. \u201cI am not offended when I hear President Donald Trump say \u2018America first,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI want Britain first for the British people, and I want France first for the French people.\u201d\n  [Trump\u2019s GOP is morphing into France\u2019s far right] \n But in general, the meeting between Bannon and the party of Marine Le Pen came a particularly fraught moment for them both, with one and the other trying to remain relevant in an unforgiving political environment.\n During the 2016 presidential campaign, Bannon was a close ally and confidante of Trump, and he joined the West Wing staff as Trump\u2019s chief strategist. But he was forced out of the White House last August. \n Likewise, Le Pen was a prominent contender for the French presidency in May 2017, but she lost to Emmanuel Macron in a landslide vote. Her party \u2014 widely seen as the alternative to Macron during the election \u2014 then fared poorly in France\u2019s legislative elections: in a parliament of 577 seats, the National Front now holds only eight. That figure presents a striking contrast with the 34 percent of the popular vote that Le Pen won in the presidential election, and her party cannot be labeled the opposition.\n  [France\u2019s National Front lost big. Now it\u2019s in chaos.] \n To that end, rebranding the National Front\u2019s image is the primary purpose of the \u201cparty congress\u201d in Lille this weekend. Le Pen and her allies are also expected to announce a new name for the party that they hope will appeal to more voters in the future.\n Le Pen has long sought to \u201cde-demonize\u201d her party by distancing it from its origins.\n The National Front was co-founded in 1972 by her father, the convicted Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, who continues to refer to Nazi gas chambers as a \u201cdetail\u201d in the history of World War II. Last week, he published the first volume of his memoirs, \u201cSon of the Nation,\u201d which feature an empathic defense of Philippe P\u00e9tain, the leader of France\u2019s Vichy government, a body that willingly collaborated with Nazi Germany during the war.\n Although several of Marine Le Pen\u2019s aides were also accused of Holocaust denial during the recent election campaign, she claims to be estranged from her father. The party conference in Lille will also feature a vote as to whether the elder Le Pen can keep his title as the party\u2019s honorary president. His daughter officially expelled him in 2015, for repeating the gas chamber remark.\n Bannon had some advice for those who might be embarrassed by such a history. \u201cLet them call you racists. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists,\u201d he said. \u201cWear it as a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker.\u201d\n In French media, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 noting that Bannon was widely perceived as the \u201cmost radical\u201d of Trump\u2019s advisers \u2014 cast doubt on the value of his daughter\u2019s American guest.\n \u201cI think this is not exactly the definition of \u2018de-demonization,\u2019\u201d he said.\n   \n  \n  Read more \n  No publisher would touch Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s memoir.

Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) on \u201cMeet The Press\u201c), it seemed as though\u00a0he was contemplating the Heretofore Unthinkable Course of trying to shut down the Mueller investigation. His lawyer\u00a0John Dowd even put forth a request that the investigation stop.\n But there is no cause for alarm. Should the president attempt such a course, the Republicans who hold power in Congress have made it clear that they will \u2026 be disappointed.\n One or two even have definite plans to\u00a0compose a strongly worded letter to the president and think very, very hard about sending it. Another handful\u00a0will go so far as to whisper to some reeds growing just on the edge of the great swamp that they think this idea is \u201cvery bad, and a travesty of our values.\u201d\n With one voice, Republicans in Congress have made it clear that\u00a0if the president\u00a0takes this extreme step, they will not be afraid to defy him by appearing on a cable news channel and saying something noncommittal. As they are doing right now. For instance, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf he tried to do that [fire Mueller], that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d Beware, President Trump! If you continue down your present course, there is every reason to believe that Graham\u00a0may even go so far as to write a memoir where he calls this \u201ca dark, dark moment for this country, when people should have spoken up.\u201d\n Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is likewise standing firm.\u00a0If the president crosses this hardest, firmest\u00a0red line, Rubio will be, like, super bummed, and probably also go on TV and say words to that effect, and maybe even\u00a0deliver a speech that includes stinging phrases like \u201cI weep for our democracy\u201d \u2014 which would be\u00a0delivered directly into a camera.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said nothing publicly, but those around him have been given to understand that if the president crosses this red line, McConnell will crumple up whatever paper he happens to be\u00a0holding at the time and throw it to the ground and say, \u201cDarn!\u201d loudly.\n Some Republicans have even spoken up already. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said\u00a0this weekend, through a spokesperson, that he continues to see firing Mueller\u00a0as a red line, and that he is pretty sure that if the president crosses it, someone will stop him. (Someone brave, probably. Someone who was in a position to do something about this.) Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said he\u00a0has confidence that we will get to hear the outcome of the Mueller investigation, because when have we ever seen this president violate norms in a surprising, disappointing way? Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he is confident in the courage of his fellow Republicans, who have never let him down before, and that they will do the right thing regardless of the electoral consequences. (He\u00a0is not running for reelection.) But just in case that does not work out, he is in New Hampshire right now shaking hands and kissing babies.\n The red line is certainly not slowly\u00a0receding into the distance like a mirage; it is definitely real, and it\u00a0will kick in this time. People should not be worried: If the future of our democracy depends on the courage of the current crop of Republican lawmakers, we can rest assured that when the time comes, they will\u00a0put country over party and eventually say something stern,\u00a0as they open for Trump at a rally.\n It is reassuring to hear the Republicans in the legislative branch, one of the checks and balances holding our democracy precariously in place, speaking\u00a0in chorus that there are some\u00a0breaches\u00a0they will not enjoy\u00a0accepting with\u00a0only a murmur of protest.\u00a0It will be grueling and disheartening for them to sit there silently and watch this unfold without taking the slightest action to stop it.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n \n Between 2009 and 2011, I briefed almost every political appointee to enter government at the start of their tenure on what it means to be a government employee, and the responsibilities that came with the office. I had one overriding message: Whatever you came into government to do \u2014 whether to work on health care or foreign policy or climate change \u2014 before you could do any of that, you have to commit to serve the public. The reasoning was simple. Public office is a public trust, and unless the public trusts you to be working on their behalf, government as an enterprise will fail.\n While I was the one giving these talks, either to hundreds of federal agency appointees in the lobby of the Ronald Reagan Building or to each new White House staffer in small gatherings, the message didn\u2019t originate with me. The idea came from our Founding Fathers, and the decision to prioritize it in the past administration came from the president.\n That\u2019s why it\u00a0has been disturbing to have witnessed for the past year a complete upending of this concept by the current holder of that office. This week\u2019s revelation by Ruth Marcus that President Trump had White House staff sign a nondisclosure agreement compelling their silence long after their government service is over, ostensibly to be enforceable by Trump personally, is the latest example. It\u2019s not just a matter of law (though government does restrict disclosure of some confidential or classified information, these NDAs go far beyond those rules); it\u2019s about principle, and what these NDAs signify about the president\u2019s view of government work. At root, it has become clear that Trump doesn\u2019t view public office as a public trust, but rather as a personal fiefdom, to be controlled by whomever is declared the winner of an election.\n [ Opinion: Trump had senior staff sign nondisclosure agreements. They\u2019re supposed to last beyond his presidency. ]\n With the plethora of scandals coming out of this White House, it can be hard to process them all. It\u2019s important not to treat the latest revelations about the NDA or any other scandal as just one more item on a list, forgotten after the next staffing fiasco or outrageous tweet. Taken together, Trump\u2019s actions add up to something more: a president who isn\u2019t committed to the fundamental principle that government exists to serve the public.\n First, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s expectation that every federal employee works for him personally. That explains his disbelief that Attorney General Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation rather than \u201ctotally protect\u201d Trump. It explains why he asked in various ways for personal loyalty\u00a0from James B. Comey, Rod J. Rosenstein and Andrew McCabe, and has removed two of them (so far) when he felt their loyalty was insufficient. And it\u2019s what\u00a0is so misguided about an NDA that, aside from imposing an outrageous lifetime blanket omerta on public servants, purports to be enforceable (it\u2019s not) by Trump personally as a private citizen after leaving office.\n   Second, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s view that he alone can wield the powers of government however he chooses. Or, as he declared recently, that he has \u201can absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department\u201d (he doesn\u2019t). Consider also his statement on aluminum and steel tariffs: \u201cI\u2019m sticking with 10 and 25 [percent] initially. I\u2019ll have a right to go up or down depending on the country, and I\u2019ll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.\u201d You would\u00a0never know from that statement that there is a Congress or an executive branch or any process designed to take public input.\n Third, there\u2019s his campaign to undermine any form of public accountability: The\u00a0media\u00a0are\u00a0fake; the voters are engaging in fraud; the special counsel is conflicted; the judges are biased; the potential witnesses against him are liars.\n And last, there\u2019s the way Trump uses his public office to enrich himself and his kin, whether by refusing to divest his businesses and allowing them to serve as a conduit for alleged bribes, or using his platform as head of state to hawk his golf properties\u00a0in official speeches.\n [ Trump Organization\u2019s real estate partner in India accused of $147 million fraud ]\n When you take all of this together, you don\u2019t just have an attack on the notion that public office is a public trust, you have an attack on the idea of liberal democracy itself \u2014 that the public elects officeholders to carry out the public\u2019s business, who are constrained by a set of checks and balances to ensure they don\u2019t subvert that mission.\n As the democracy expert Yascha Mounk put it recently, it\u2019s for these reasons that \u201cthe Founding Fathers insisted that the primary duty of American citizens should be to a set of ideas and institutions, not to a particular person,\u201d and that \u201cIt is this fundamental tradition that Trump \u2014 acting more like an Old World monarch who is used to demanding fealty from his subjects \u2014 [has] attack[ed].\u201d\n I was asked on occasion when I served in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office if staff should be required to sign NDAs.

Trump\u2019s tax bill will make it easier for the company to pay off debt under that deal\u00a0because of regulatory changes that will allow it to return cash from overseas.\n The fortunes of the Carrier plant have not been so bright.\n Since Trump\u2019s jawboning, the plant\u00a0experienced\u00a0a round of layoffs\u00a0in\u00a0July, when 337 workers left the plant. Another 300 positions were terminated in January.\n \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem that the government is going to use its\u00a0contracts to exert any leverage on the jobs front,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not as much of an action item as it was a year ago, and it wasn\u2019t then either. It was just optics.\u201d\n Robert James, president of the local United Steelworkers union that represents the Carrier employees, said he hasn\u2019t heard of more anticipated layoffs. But workers are skeptical\u00a0about the\u00a0future. Four days after Trump visited Indianapolis to celebrate the Carrier deal, United Technologies\u00a0chief executive Hayes said in a television interview that he planned to invest in automation, reducing the need for human labor.\n Some Carrier workers expressed resignation that\u00a0they would\u00a0see little benefit from the big defense deals.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the government doing business with big corporations like always,\u201d said T.J.

Cohen fired back in his own filings last week, claiming he\u00a0was entitled to $20 million in damages because she had violated it 20 times.\n Adding to the tension, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is scheduled to air an interview\u00a0between Cooper and Daniels on March 25.\u00a0The White House has denied that\u00a0there was ever an affair between Trump and the porn star.\n In Tuesday\u2019s CNN segment, Schwartz told Cooper that Trump was a third-party beneficiary\u00a0to the agreement, and that Cohen had acted on his own accord. There was a spot for Trump\u2019s signature, but Trump didn\u2019t sign it. He didn\u2019t have to, Schwartz said.\n Cooper asked if it was normal\u00a0for an attorney to pay out of his own pocket on his client\u2019s behalf.\n \u201cNo, but there\u2019s nothing illegal about it. And given the context of this relationship there\u2019s certainly nothing\u00a0unethical about it,\u201d Schwartz said.\n \u201cIf all of that is believable,\u201d Avenatti spit back, \u201cthen why did Mr. Cohen draft an agreement with a signature line for Donald Trump?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s painting a fictional picture of the whole scenario,\u201d Schwartz said. He\u00a0then accused Avenatti of deliberately advising Daniels to\u00a0\u201cblatantly violate\u201d the contract.\n \u201cShe\u2019s going to be liable for $20 million,\u201d he said, pointing a finger at Avenatti, \u201cand Michael Cohen is going to collect every single penny of that money, make no mistake.\u201d\n They sparred for several minutes over the provisions of the agreement, some of which\u00a0require\u00a0Trump to stay away from her and her family and release her from claims he has against her, according to Avenatti. Schwartz\u00a0called Avenatti\u2019s view of the agreement \u201cabsurd\u201d and again\u00a0saying Daniels would be on the hook for a lot of money.\n \u201cWhy not just let her talk?\u201d\u00a0Avenatti\u00a0interjected, wagging his finger at Schwartz. \u201cWhy is it so important to your friend and the president of the United States to keep this woman under wraps, to keep her under the thumb, to shut her up?\u201d\n By way of analogy, Avenatti compared dispute over the agreement to buying a house for $130,000, then being told that only one of the bedrooms was available.\n \u201cIf it\u2019s gonna take him that long to explain it to the judge he\u2019s in big trouble,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go down in flames on this case.\u201d\n \u201cI hope you have a good malpractice policy,\u201d he added later, \u201cbecause when she\u00a0owes $20 million she should go after you to collect the money.\u201d\n In the weeks since the Wall Street Journal first reported that Cohen had arranged the $130,000 payment, questions have swirled about whether it was\u00a0intended to protect Trump\u00a0at a time when his\u00a0election was looking like a\u00a0real possibility. As The Washington Post has reported, there are at least two complaints\u00a0to the Federal Election Commission alleging the money was meant to influence the election and therefore amounted to an illegal in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign. The Post also reported last week that Cohen sought to\u00a0prevent Daniels from airing her story about her alleged affair with the president as early as 2011.\n Cohen has acknowledged he personally paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and said he was not reimbursed by the Trump campaign. He told Vanity Fair in an interview this week that the agreement wasn\u2019t an election issue\u00a0and denied claims by Avenatti that Daniels had been manipulated or intimidated into signing it. \u201cUnlike Mr. Avenatti, we are not handling this matter through the court of public opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are handling it through a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n Cooper asked Schwartz why it took years to strike the agreement: \u201cWhy anyone should anyone honestly believe this had nothing to do with the election?\u201d\n \u201cBecause this is when she came out and threatened to disclose this information,\u201d Schwartz responded.\n Avenatti scoffed. \u201cIt had everything to do with the election,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear as day.\u201d\n Schwartz fired back: If it\u2019s already an invalid contract, why file a lawsuit over it?\n \u201cBecause we want a judicial determination that this agreement is trash,\u201d Avenatti said, \u201cwhich it is.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Karoun Demirjian", "body": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.

Leonnig", "body": "For much of the past year, President Trump has declined to participate in a practice followed by  the past seven of his predecessors: He rarely if ever reads the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a document that lays out the most pressing information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from hot spots around the world. Trump has opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office rather than getting the full written document delivered to review separately each day, according to three people familiar with his briefings.\u00a0 Reading the traditionally dense intelligence book is not Trump\u2019s preferred \u201cstyle of learning,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The arrangement underscores Trump\u2019s impatience with exhaustive classified documents that go to the commander in chief \u2014 material that he has said he prefers condensed as much as possible. But by not reading the daily\u00a0briefing, the president could hamper his ability to respond to crises in the most effective manner, intelligence experts warned. Soon after Trump took office, analysts sought to tailor their intelligence sessions for a president with a famously short attention span, who is known for taking in much of his information from the conservative Fox News Channel. The oral briefings were augmented with photos, videos and graphics. After several months, Trump made clear he was not interested in reviewing\u00a0a personal copy of the written intelligence report known as the PDB, a highly classified summary prepared before dawn to provide the president with the best update on the world\u2019s events, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\u00a0\u00a0 Administration officials defended Trump\u2019s reliance on oral sessions and said he gets full intelligence briefings, noting that presidents have historically sought to receive the information in different ways. Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Trump \u201cis an avid consumer of intelligence, appreciates the hard work of his briefers and of the entire intelligence community and looks forward every day to the give and take of his intelligence briefings.\u201d Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement that \u201cany notion that President Trump is not fully engaged in the PDB or does not read the briefing materials is pure fiction and is clearly not based on firsthand knowledge of the process.\u201d He added that Trump\u2019s routine sessions with senior intelligence advisers \u201cdemonstrate his interest in and appreciation for the value of the intelligence provided. In fact, President Trump engages for significantly longer periods than I understand many previous presidents have done.\u201d   The PDB, which has been described as a newspaper with the smallest circulation in the world, is drawn from material provided by U.S. spies, satellites and surveillance technology, as well as news sources and foreign intelligence agencies.  [Trump\u2019s favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust? ]  Several intelligence experts said that the president\u2019s aversion to diving deeper into written\u00a0intelligence details \u2014 the \u201chomework\u201d that past presidents have done to familiarize themselves with foreign policy and national security \u2014 makes both him and the country more vulnerable. Leon Panetta,\u00a0a former CIA director and defense  said Trump\u00a0could miss important context and nuance if he is relying solely on an oral briefing. The arrangement also increases pressure on the president\u2019s national security team, which cannot entirely replace a well-informed commander in chief, he said. \u201cSomething will be missed,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cIf for some reason his instincts on what should be done are not backed up by the intelligence because he hasn\u2019t taken the time to read that intel, it increases the risk that he will make a mistake.\u201d \u201cYou can have the smartest people around you \u2014 in the end it still comes down to his decision,\u201d he added. The top-secret intelligence report, which dates in its current form to\u00a0the Johnson administration, is made up of individual \u201carticles\u201d written by career analysts, mostly from the CIA. The PDB is so tightly controlled that intelligence officials maintain a log to record when the briefers provide a copy of the document to a principal and when they retrieve it, several officials said. Mark Lowenthal, a\u00a0career intelligence officer who served as a CIA assistant director from 2002 to 2005, said Trump does not have to read the PDB if he is getting an extensive oral briefing. He warned, however, that a short briefing on a few select items would leave the president ill-equipped for major decisions over the long term. \u201cThen he\u2019s really not getting a full intelligence briefing,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cYou need to get immersed in a story over its entire course. You can\u2019t just jump into an issue and come up to speed on the actors and the implications. The odds are pretty good that something will arise later on for which he has no intelligence basis for helping him work through it.\u201d\u00a0 The document, while traditionally lengthy and dense, contains\u00a0key insights\u00a0that can create a cumulative body of knowledge \u2014 and foreshadow looming threats, intelligence professionals said.\u00a0 President George W. Bush faced a political firestorm over how closely his administration was paying attention to the PDB after it was discovered that a month before the 9/11 attacks, his briefing book had included a warning that Osama bin Laden was \u201cdetermined\u201d to attack U.S. targets using airplanes. In the current administration, versions of the president\u2019s written intelligence briefing are provided to at least a dozen top officials, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to people familiar with the dissemination. Aides say Trump receives his\u00a0in-person intelligence briefing nearly every day, although his publicly released schedules indicate that the sessions have been taking place about every two to three days on average in recent months, typically around 11 a.m. One senior White House official described the\u00a0Oval Office briefing as a distilled version of the sessions that senior administration officials receive earlier in the day. CIA Director\u00a0Mike Pompeo usually attends the session, as does Coats. During Trump\u2019s briefing,\u00a0a\u00a0veteran intelligence official\u00a0typically\u00a0describes intelligence highlights contained in a shortened, written version of the PDB.\u00a0Trump has rarely, if ever, requested that the document be left behind for him to read, according to people familiar with the meetings.\u00a0 Pompeo has said the president is briefed on current developments, as well as upcoming events \u2014 such as visits by foreign leaders \u2014 and longer-term strategic issues. \u201cThe president asks hard questions,\u201d he said in public remarks last month. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply engaged. We'll have a rambunctious back-and-forth, all aimed at making sure we\u2019re delivering him the truth as best we understand it.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s admirers say he has a unique ability to cut through conventional foreign policy wisdom and ask questions that others have long taken for granted. \u201cWhy are we even in Somalia?\u201d or \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just pull out of Afghanistan?\u201d he will ask, according to officials.\u00a0 The president asks \u201cedge\u201d questions, said one senior administration official, meaning that he pushes his staff to question long-held assumptions about U.S. interests in the world. Another person familiar with the briefing process said that, at times, Trump has been dismissive of his briefers. He has shaken his head, frowned and complained that the briefers were\u00a0\u201ctalking down to him,\u201d this person said. Trump has at times demonstrated a deep distrust of the intelligence community. He has accused Obama-era intelligence chiefs of rooting against his election and exaggerating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to delegitimize his presidency. The Washington Post\u00a0reported last year that intelligence officials in some cases have included Russia-related intelligence only in the\u00a0president\u2019s daily\u00a0written assessment, steering clear of it in the oral briefing in order not to upset Trump. The last U.S. president who is believed not to have regularly reviewed the PDB was\u00a0Richard Nixon. The historical record contains no references to him having read the document,\u00a0although\u00a0Nixon and\u00a0his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, received a copy each day, according to David Priess, a former CIA briefer and author of \u201cThe President\u2019s Book of Secrets.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt is not unprecedented for someone to get only an oral briefing of the PDB,\u201d Priess said.\u00a0\u201cBut it is the exception rather than the rule. And a rare exception.\u201d\u00a0 The intelligence community prides itself on tailoring the briefing document and the oral briefing\u00a0to each president\u2019s style. Obama preferred to received the PDB on a secure iPad to review before asking questions of his briefers.\u00a0\u00a0 President\u00a0George W. Bush typically read the\u00a0PDB first thing in the morning, with his briefer present to review the highlights and answer questions, according to former officials who briefed him. Neither Obama nor Bush reviewed the briefing book every day, and at times they skipped a session, especially when traveling President Ronald Reagan read the PDB every day but chose not to have a briefing from a CIA officer, said John Poindexter, who served as Reagan\u2019s national security adviser. Reagan often discussed the briefing document in morning Oval Office meetings with his top advisers, Poindexter said.\u00a0 Trump indicated early on that\u00a0he had little interest in immersing himself in detailed intelligence documents.\u00a0 \u201cI like bullets or I like as little as possible. I don\u2019t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page,\u201d he told Axios shortly before taking office. During the transition, the CIA offered to give Trump the same daily intelligence briefing that Obama received, a tradition for presidents-elect. But Trump declined a daily update, opting for less frequent briefings. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d Trump said in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview in December 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years \u2014 but eight years. I don\u2019t need that.\u201d At the time, Obama warned it was never wise to skip insights from intelligence professionals.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting their perspective \u2014 their detailed perspective \u2014 then you are flying blind,\u201d he said in an interview on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d During the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, the format of his intelligence briefings changed. In the early days, he received the traditional briefing sometime between 9 and 10:30 a.m.,\u00a0according to his publicly released schedules.\u00a0Within a few months, his intelligence advisers began augmenting the sessions with maps, charts, pictures and videos, as well as \u201ckiller graphics,\u201d as Pompeo put it at the time.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s our task, right? To deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we\u2019re trying to communicate,\u201d Pompeo\u00a0told The Post in May.  [How President Trump consumes \u2014 or does not consume \u2014 top-secret intelligence]   The early briefing sessions had a more freewheeling quality,\u00a0according to current and former administration officials. Five or more White House aides might join Trump for the briefing,\u00a0in addition to his briefer and intelligence officials. The meetings\u00a0were often dominated by whatever topic most interested the president that day.\u00a0Trump would discuss the news of the day or a tweet he sent about North Korea or the border wall \u2014 or anything else on his mind, two people familiar with the briefings said.\u00a0 On such days, there would only be a few minutes left \u2014 and the briefers would have barely broached the topics they came to discuss, one senior U.S. official said. \u201cHe often goes off on tangents during the briefing and you\u2019d have to rein him back in,\u201d one official said. After he joined the administration in July, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly slashed the number of people who could attend the intelligence briefings in an effort to exert more discipline over how the president consumes information, current and former officials said.\u00a0  Josh Dawsey and Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Sari Horwitz", "body": "(Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)     The Justice Department announced the indictment Friday of a notorious Russian troll farm \u2014 naming more than a dozen individual suspects who allegedly worked there \u2014 as part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into criminal interference with the 2016 election.

Eight years after nearly every Senate Democrat backed a sweeping set of new rules for financial firms large and small, the party is now split, with moderates, several of them facing tough midterm election contests, working with the opposing party.\n The core of the new bill exempts about two dozen financial companies with assets between $50\u2009billion and $250\u2009billion from the highest levels of scrutiny by the Federal Reserve, the nation\u2019s central bank. Supporters argue that the legislation would bring much-needed relief to midsize and regional banks that were treated like their much larger counterparts under the 2010 legislation known as Dodd-Frank. Opponents say it would weaken the oversight needed to stave off the type of dangerous lending and investing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees.\n The Senate is slated to take an initial procedural vote this week to move the measure forward, and if it eventually becomes law, it would be the most substantial weakening of Dodd-Frank since it was passed.\n \u201cOn the 10th anniversary of an enormous financial crash, Congress should not be passing laws to roll back regulations on Wall Street banks,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in an interview. \u201cThe bill permits about 25 of the 40 largest banks in America to escape heightened scrutiny and to be regulated as if they were tiny little community banks that could have no impact on the economy.\u201d\n Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a Banking Committee member and one of the new bill\u2019s leading Democratic supporters, said banks in his largely rural state have been going out of business in part because of the regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank.\n \u201cThe Main Street banks, community banks and credit unions didn\u2019t create the crisis in 2008, and they were getting heavily regulated,\u201d Tester said, contending that \u201cthere\u2019s not one thing in this bill that gives Wall Street a break.\u201d\n Critics dispute those claims, echoing a Democratic Party schism over financial regulations that pits liberals such as Warren and top Banking Committee Democrat Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) against moderate-leaning Democrats including Tester and Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.).\n Many of the moderates face political pressure to establish a centrist voting record, particularly after voting against the GOP tax cuts in December. Tester, Heitkamp and Donnelly are all up for reelection in November in states President Trump won by large margins. All three helped negotiate the banking legislation with its GOP sponsor, Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).\n Yet the coalition of Democrats supporting the bill also includes lawmakers such as Tim Kaine (Va.), Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in the 2016 election, and Mark R. Warner (Va.), who was among the lead authors of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act but also voiced concerns about over-regulating smaller banks. \n The GOP-led bill appears to have a clear path to becoming law. The level of Democratic support all but guarantees that the bill will have the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate, which will move toward debate on the legislation with a procedural vote set for Tuesday. And the Trump administration has been broadly supportive.\n The House has already passed legislation that would repeal larger chunks of Dodd-Frank, so proponents\u2019 biggest remaining challenge may be to reconcile the House and Senate versions.

Schumer (D-N.Y.), who represents Wall Street and is often motivated by the desire to protect his vulnerable red-state incumbents, opposes the bill, but he has taken a largely hands-off approach to the debate thus far.\n That a Wall Street regulatory rollback is possible is a testament to the financial sector\u2019s improved standing on Capitol Hill \u2014 as well as to the lobbying muscle of local banks and credit unions present in every state.\n Financial firms upped their campaign contributions to key Senate Democrats over the last year, with  Heitkamp, Donnelly and Tester becoming the top three Senate recipients of donations from commercial banks so far in the 2018 campaign cycle , according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The senators disputed any connection between the donations and their support for the Dodd-Frank rewrite legislation.\n Lobbying efforts ramped up as the Senate debate approached. The Credit Union National Association descended on Washington in late February to meet with lawmakers. More than 5,000 credit union advocates, including employees and chief executives from every state, arrived on Capitol Hill wearing \u201cvote yes\u201d pins and stickers. They held 600 meetings with lawmakers.\n The in-person push started with a White House meeting with Trump and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, during which credit union advocates pitched the bill as a way to rectify Dodd-Frank\u2019s overreach. \u201cWe understand the concerns that banks perpetuated the crash, but those were not credit unions,\u201d said Jim Nussle, president of the Credit Union National Association, who attended the meeting.\n Small and regional banks have complained that Dodd-Frank has put them under an unfair supervisory squeeze, punishing them for the sins of Wall Street. Many lawmakers from both parties have proved sympathetic to these claims, helping fuel bipartisan backing for Crapo\u2019s bill. \n While the bill\u2019s effects on the financial sector would only become fully clear after passage, the legislation aims to strike a middle ground between those seeking to gut Dodd-Frank and those who want the law left intact \u2014 or, at most, to be modified by tweaks and technical corrections.\n The new measure centers on an exemption for some two dozen financial companies from stricter supervision by the Federal Reserve. It would lift the asset limit for this scrutiny from $50\u2009billion to $250\u2009billion, easing \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 scrutiny on banks such as SunTrust and BBT. Fewer than 10 U.S. banks have more than $250\u2009billion in assets, although the Fed would reserve the right to apply tougher scrutiny to a smaller bank if it felt this was justified.\n Critics charge that advocates of deregulation are guilty of overly short memories and a false sense of security. There has not been a banking crisis since the Dodd-Frank law \u2014 named for its sponsors, former senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and former congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) \u2014 passed a Democratic-controlled Congress in 2010 on nearly party-line votes and was signed by Obama.\n The law was a response to the 2008 financial crisis that felled hundreds of banks and large financial companies, nearly toppling some of the largest U.S. financial institutions, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. The Bush administration was forced to seek a $700\u2009billion rescue package that stabilized the economy by keeping some of the largest firms afloat.\n The crisis was fueled by risky investments at all levels of the financial system. Local banks and mortgage brokers offered subprime home loans to people who had little chance of keeping up with their payments, and then sold those loans to firms up the chain. They were in turn bundled by larger firms and used for a string of exotic financial instruments sold around the world. When homeowners defaulted on their loans en masse, the bonds they\u2019d been bundled into \u2014 as well as other assets based on those bonds \u2014 collapsed in value, threatening to take the global financial system down with them.\n The Dodd-Frank law, which tightened supervision of the largest financial companies, made it harder for banks to use exotic financial instruments that could destabilize the financial system, tightened mortgage lending rules and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to prevent companies from ripping off borrowers. The law also created a system to wind down a large failing financial company in a way that limits taxpayer exposure in the future.\n The system for winding down failing banks has never been tested, and banks have been subjected to rigorous stress tests to determine whether they can withstand another shock. A number of large banks have been caught engaging in risky practices.\n Supporters say the bill includes a number of new consumer protections, including a one-year fraud alert in consumers\u2019 files and a provision aimed at protecting veterans\u2019 credit. Opponents point to the weakening of stress-test requirements and the elimination of some homeowner protections, including the blocking of homeowners from going to court to prevent wrongful foreclosures.\n \u201cThe public is not asking for bank deregulation,\u201d argued Brown, who sought compromise with Crapo on the issue last year before concluding that the bill was going in a direction he couldn\u2019t support. \u201cThis is not a community bank bill. They say it is. It\u2019s like the tax cuts weren\u2019t a middle-class tax bill; they want to say it is. This is a bill that helps some of the largest banks.\u201d\n Frank, whose signature law stands to be partially dismantled by the Crapo bill, opposes the new legislation. But he has been in touch with senators on both sides and agrees that it leaves the major protections of Dodd-Frank in place.\n He and others have argued over the years that Dodd-Frank did need adjusting, but \u2014 much as with Obama\u2019s signature law, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 most efforts for small-scale corrections stalled after being swept up into bids for full-on repeal.\n In an interview, Frank disputed the suggestion that the Crapo bill might lead to another financial crisis, arguing that the rules on mortgages and derivatives remain essentially unchanged. And Frank said he\u2019d rather see Heitkamp, Tester and Donnelly vote for the legislation and get reelected in November than vote against it and lose.\n \u201cIf they were defeated, in the next Congress you\u2019d get a much worse bill,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThe community banks drive this. They\u2019re in everyone\u2019s district.\u201d\n Democrats have been lured into supporting bank-friendly laws in the past only to regret it years later.\n The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act passed in 1999 with the support of 138 House Democrats, and it was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. That law allowed commercial banks and investment banks to merge, a phenomenon that many analysts later argued paved the way for the 2008 financial crisis by creating wobbly behemoths such as Citigroup.\n In 2000, Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, a law that led to the rapid expansion of certain complex financial instruments that were at the heart of the financial crisis eight years later.\n  \nRenae Merle and Jeff Stein contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Rubin", "body": "Then-acting FBI director Andrew McCabe listens during a news conference on July 13, 2017, at the Justice Department in Washington. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n \n It is no trifle when Stephen K. Bannon attacks the \u201cdeep state.\u201d It is not simply a legal ploy when Republicans running interference for President Trump call the FBI \u201ccorrupt\u201d or when Trump\u2019s lawyer John Dowd calls to shut down the Russia investigation. When a witness to conversations and interactions with Trump who has turned over information to the investigation\u00a0is fired, the danger goes beyond the investigation directly at hand. In one form or another, these are attacks on a vital pillar of democratic government \u2014 the apolitical administration of justice.\n As to Dowd\u2019s comments, which he later claimed represented his own views, reaction across the political spectrum was harsh, while many outside observers raised questions about the motive behind former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe\u2019s firing.\n Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a terse statement:\u00a0\u201cMr. Dowd\u2019s comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of the president and his legal team is not to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn.\u00a0The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel\u2019s investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s actions have broader implications for our democracy. Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group seeking to check attacks on democracy and illegitimate executive branch power grabs, put out a\u00a0white paper\u00a0this month that now seems prescient. \u201cIf those in power can wield the enforcement\u00a0authority of the state to punish their critics or opponents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or to turn a blind eye to\u00a0law-breaking by their friends\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we have lost the rule of law. Thomas Jefferson\u00a0observed, and the Justice Department quotes on its website, \u2018The most sacred of the\u00a0duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.\u2019\u00a0Each\u00a0time the White House intervenes with the Justice Department\u2019s handling of a\u00a0specific-party matter, it risks violating that sacred duty.\u201d\u00a0When the president seeks to reach down into the Justice Department to tilt the outcome of actions or to punish individual lawyers for pursuing justice, a grave injury is done to our democracy.\n Yascha Mounk, author of \u201cThe People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger And How to Save It,\u201d\u00a0tells me, \u201cFor citizens to have trust in their law enforcement agencies, justice doesn\u2019t only need to be done; it also needs to be seen to be done. Given that Mr. McCabe was fired after continual attacks from the President of the United States, we already know that this important principle has been violated in this case.\u201d He adds, \u201cEven if it eventually turns out that McCabe really did misbehave \u2014 and there is no publicly available evidence to substantiate that theory so far \u2014 the manner of his firing undermines the independence of the FBI and the trust Americans can put in their institutions.\u201d He continues, \u201cThe alternative is even worse: If the charges against McCabe eventually turn out to be spurious, then the partisan takeover of the FBI is very far along. And that should terrify any American citizen who values his liberty or his democracy.\u201d\n That politicization of the Justice Department and the implicit threat of retaliation for crossing the president should be of grave concern.\n Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is right to call for immediate hearings. In a statement released on Saturday he said, \u201cDuring my four decades in the Senate, I have never before seen our nation\u2019s career, apolitical law enforcement officials so personally and publicly maligned by politicians \u2014 indeed, by our President. And I have never been so concerned that the walls intended to protect the independence of our dedicated law enforcement professionals, including Special Counsel Mueller, are at risk of crumbling.\u201d He recounted, \u201c\u201cA month ago I asked Chairman Grassley to hold a hearing on the escalating politicized attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. We can all point to mistakes made by Justice Department officials over the course of high-profile investigations during the 2016 elections. Such mistakes rightly fall within the purview of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s routine oversight functions. . . .\u00a0 I believe the Judiciary Committee will fail to fulfill its core oversight responsibility if it does nothing in this moment.\u201d\n Between Dowd\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s after McCabe\u2019s firing, we see the intensification of Trump\u2019s deliberate interference with the Justice Department to suit the president\u2019s personal interests.\u00a0\u201cWhatever Andrew McCabe did or did not do, his firing two days before retiring would obviously never have happened if the President hadn\u2019t personally demanded it,\u201d Protect Democracy Executive Director Ian Bassin surmises. He tells me that this incident shows that \u201cTrump has moved from autocratic rhetoric to autocratic action, as personally ordering the purging of civil servants who are insufficiently loyal is what autocrats do.\u201d He warns the Justice Department inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility not to do Trump\u2019s bidding. Bassin asserts, \u201cTrump\u2019s certain intervention was also so manifestly corrupt that it likely violated constitutional principles that limit a President\u2019s authority to \u2018do whatever he wants with the Justice Department.'\u201d\n In sum, recent events should underscore the dangers that remain so long as Trump is president. First, he may use his executive powers to extract revenge, settle scores and instill fear in political opponents \u2014 just as the Nixon White House did with the Internal Revenue Service.\u00a0Second, he will continue to undermine the morale of prosecutors and investigators, causing them to leave, second-guess their actions or shape their work so as to avoid the president\u2019s wrath. And worst of all, Trump will undermine the public\u2019s faith in entities that are supposed to be apolitical fact-finders and enforcers of the law, leading Americans to question the honesty and fairness of our government and criminal-justice system. That, in a nutshell, is how authoritarians infiltrate and abuse the administration of justice \u2014 unless the voters rise up to stop them.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Carol D. Leonnig", "body": "For much of the past year, President Trump has declined to participate in a practice followed by  the past seven of his predecessors: He rarely if ever reads the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a document that lays out the most pressing information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from hot spots around the world. Trump has opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office rather than getting the full written document delivered to review separately each day, according to three people familiar with his briefings.\u00a0 Reading the traditionally dense intelligence book is not Trump\u2019s preferred \u201cstyle of learning,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The arrangement underscores Trump\u2019s impatience with exhaustive classified documents that go to the commander in chief \u2014 material that he has said he prefers condensed as much as possible. But by not reading the daily\u00a0briefing, the president could hamper his ability to respond to crises in the most effective manner, intelligence experts warned. Soon after Trump took office, analysts sought to tailor their intelligence sessions for a president with a famously short attention span, who is known for taking in much of his information from the conservative Fox News Channel. The oral briefings were augmented with photos, videos and graphics. After several months, Trump made clear he was not interested in reviewing\u00a0a personal copy of the written intelligence report known as the PDB, a highly classified summary prepared before dawn to provide the president with the best update on the world\u2019s events, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\u00a0\u00a0 Administration officials defended Trump\u2019s reliance on oral sessions and said he gets full intelligence briefings, noting that presidents have historically sought to receive the information in different ways. Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Trump \u201cis an avid consumer of intelligence, appreciates the hard work of his briefers and of the entire intelligence community and looks forward every day to the give and take of his intelligence briefings.\u201d Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement that \u201cany notion that President Trump is not fully engaged in the PDB or does not read the briefing materials is pure fiction and is clearly not based on firsthand knowledge of the process.\u201d He added that Trump\u2019s routine sessions with senior intelligence advisers \u201cdemonstrate his interest in and appreciation for the value of the intelligence provided. In fact, President Trump engages for significantly longer periods than I understand many previous presidents have done.\u201d   The PDB, which has been described as a newspaper with the smallest circulation in the world, is drawn from material provided by U.S. spies, satellites and surveillance technology, as well as news sources and foreign intelligence agencies.  [Trump\u2019s favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust? ]  Several intelligence experts said that the president\u2019s aversion to diving deeper into written\u00a0intelligence details \u2014 the \u201chomework\u201d that past presidents have done to familiarize themselves with foreign policy and national security \u2014 makes both him and the country more vulnerable. Leon Panetta,\u00a0a former CIA director and defense  said Trump\u00a0could miss important context and nuance if he is relying solely on an oral briefing. The arrangement also increases pressure on the president\u2019s national security team, which cannot entirely replace a well-informed commander in chief, he said. \u201cSomething will be missed,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cIf for some reason his instincts on what should be done are not backed up by the intelligence because he hasn\u2019t taken the time to read that intel, it increases the risk that he will make a mistake.\u201d \u201cYou can have the smartest people around you \u2014 in the end it still comes down to his decision,\u201d he added. The top-secret intelligence report, which dates in its current form to\u00a0the Johnson administration, is made up of individual \u201carticles\u201d written by career analysts, mostly from the CIA. The PDB is so tightly controlled that intelligence officials maintain a log to record when the briefers provide a copy of the document to a principal and when they retrieve it, several officials said. Mark Lowenthal, a\u00a0career intelligence officer who served as a CIA assistant director from 2002 to 2005, said Trump does not have to read the PDB if he is getting an extensive oral briefing. He warned, however, that a short briefing on a few select items would leave the president ill-equipped for major decisions over the long term. \u201cThen he\u2019s really not getting a full intelligence briefing,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cYou need to get immersed in a story over its entire course. You can\u2019t just jump into an issue and come up to speed on the actors and the implications. The odds are pretty good that something will arise later on for which he has no intelligence basis for helping him work through it.\u201d\u00a0 The document, while traditionally lengthy and dense, contains\u00a0key insights\u00a0that can create a cumulative body of knowledge \u2014 and foreshadow looming threats, intelligence professionals said.\u00a0 President George W. Bush faced a political firestorm over how closely his administration was paying attention to the PDB after it was discovered that a month before the 9/11 attacks, his briefing book had included a warning that Osama bin Laden was \u201cdetermined\u201d to attack U.S. targets using airplanes. In the current administration, versions of the president\u2019s written intelligence briefing are provided to at least a dozen top officials, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to people familiar with the dissemination. Aides say Trump receives his\u00a0in-person intelligence briefing nearly every day, although his publicly released schedules indicate that the sessions have been taking place about every two to three days on average in recent months, typically around 11 a.m. One senior White House official described the\u00a0Oval Office briefing as a distilled version of the sessions that senior administration officials receive earlier in the day. CIA Director\u00a0Mike Pompeo usually attends the session, as does Coats. During Trump\u2019s briefing,\u00a0a\u00a0veteran intelligence official\u00a0typically\u00a0describes intelligence highlights contained in a shortened, written version of the PDB.\u00a0Trump has rarely, if ever, requested that the document be left behind for him to read, according to people familiar with the meetings.\u00a0 Pompeo has said the president is briefed on current developments, as well as upcoming events \u2014 such as visits by foreign leaders \u2014 and longer-term strategic issues. \u201cThe president asks hard questions,\u201d he said in public remarks last month. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply engaged. We'll have a rambunctious back-and-forth, all aimed at making sure we\u2019re delivering him the truth as best we understand it.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s admirers say he has a unique ability to cut through conventional foreign policy wisdom and ask questions that others have long taken for granted. \u201cWhy are we even in Somalia?\u201d or \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just pull out of Afghanistan?\u201d he will ask, according to officials.\u00a0 The president asks \u201cedge\u201d questions, said one senior administration official, meaning that he pushes his staff to question long-held assumptions about U.S. interests in the world. Another person familiar with the briefing process said that, at times, Trump has been dismissive of his briefers. He has shaken his head, frowned and complained that the briefers were\u00a0\u201ctalking down to him,\u201d this person said. Trump has at times demonstrated a deep distrust of the intelligence community. He has accused Obama-era intelligence chiefs of rooting against his election and exaggerating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to delegitimize his presidency. The Washington Post\u00a0reported last year that intelligence officials in some cases have included Russia-related intelligence only in the\u00a0president\u2019s daily\u00a0written assessment, steering clear of it in the oral briefing in order not to upset Trump. The last U.S. president who is believed not to have regularly reviewed the PDB was\u00a0Richard Nixon. The historical record contains no references to him having read the document,\u00a0although\u00a0Nixon and\u00a0his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, received a copy each day, according to David Priess, a former CIA briefer and author of \u201cThe President\u2019s Book of Secrets.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt is not unprecedented for someone to get only an oral briefing of the PDB,\u201d Priess said.\u00a0\u201cBut it is the exception rather than the rule. And a rare exception.\u201d\u00a0 The intelligence community prides itself on tailoring the briefing document and the oral briefing\u00a0to each president\u2019s style. Obama preferred to received the PDB on a secure iPad to review before asking questions of his briefers.\u00a0\u00a0 President\u00a0George W. Bush typically read the\u00a0PDB first thing in the morning, with his briefer present to review the highlights and answer questions, according to former officials who briefed him. Neither Obama nor Bush reviewed the briefing book every day, and at times they skipped a session, especially when traveling President Ronald Reagan read the PDB every day but chose not to have a briefing from a CIA officer, said John Poindexter, who served as Reagan\u2019s national security adviser. Reagan often discussed the briefing document in morning Oval Office meetings with his top advisers, Poindexter said.\u00a0 Trump indicated early on that\u00a0he had little interest in immersing himself in detailed intelligence documents.\u00a0 \u201cI like bullets or I like as little as possible. I don\u2019t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page,\u201d he told Axios shortly before taking office. During the transition, the CIA offered to give Trump the same daily intelligence briefing that Obama received, a tradition for presidents-elect. But Trump declined a daily update, opting for less frequent briefings. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d Trump said in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview in December 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years \u2014 but eight years. I don\u2019t need that.\u201d At the time, Obama warned it was never wise to skip insights from intelligence professionals.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting their perspective \u2014 their detailed perspective \u2014 then you are flying blind,\u201d he said in an interview on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d During the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, the format of his intelligence briefings changed. In the early days, he received the traditional briefing sometime between 9 and 10:30 a.m.,\u00a0according to his publicly released schedules.\u00a0Within a few months, his intelligence advisers began augmenting the sessions with maps, charts, pictures and videos, as well as \u201ckiller graphics,\u201d as Pompeo put it at the time.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s our task, right? To deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we\u2019re trying to communicate,\u201d Pompeo\u00a0told The Post in May.  [How President Trump consumes \u2014 or does not consume \u2014 top-secret intelligence]   The early briefing sessions had a more freewheeling quality,\u00a0according to current and former administration officials. Five or more White House aides might join Trump for the briefing,\u00a0in addition to his briefer and intelligence officials. The meetings\u00a0were often dominated by whatever topic most interested the president that day.\u00a0Trump would discuss the news of the day or a tweet he sent about North Korea or the border wall \u2014 or anything else on his mind, two people familiar with the briefings said.\u00a0 On such days, there would only be a few minutes left \u2014 and the briefers would have barely broached the topics they came to discuss, one senior U.S. official said. \u201cHe often goes off on tangents during the briefing and you\u2019d have to rein him back in,\u201d one official said. After he joined the administration in July, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly slashed the number of people who could attend the intelligence briefings in an effort to exert more discipline over how the president consumes information, current and former officials said.\u00a0  Josh Dawsey and Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Beth Reinhard", "body": "Adult-film star Stormy Daniels reportedly was paid to remain silent about a sexual relationship with Donald Trump before he was president.

Trump said he contradicted Trudeau \u2014 \u201cWrong, Justin, you do\u201d \u2014 even though \u201cI didn\u2019t even know. \u2026 I had no idea.\u201d When Trudeau insisted, \u201cWe have no trade deficit,\u201d Trump replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He then called in an aide who supposedly told him that the U.S. has no trade deficit with Canada \u2014 but only if you don\u2019t count energy and timber. \u201c\u2009\u2018And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year,\u2019\u2009\u201d Trump quoted the aide as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n It\u2019s incredible, all right, as in literally not credible. Trump\u2019s own U.S. trade representative reports that the United States has a $12.5 billion trade surplus with Canada, and that includes energy and timber. But Trump didn\u2019t back down: He insisted that his \u201calternative facts\u201d were superior to actual facts.\n On Thursday, the president tweeted: \u201cWe do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive).\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was sent out to do a full Spicer by dutifully saying, without a scintilla of substantiation, that \u201cthere are plenty of things, once you take into the full account of all of the trade between the two countries, that show that there is actually a deficit.\u201d\n Like Trump\u2019s claims that Gen. John J. Pershing slaughtered Muslims, or that his inauguration drew record crowds, or that he would have won the popular vote if millions of illegal immigrants had not voted, this is another example of a would-be dictator\u2019s desire not just to sneak lies by us but to shove them down our throats. Trump is signaling that he doesn\u2019t care what the truth is. From now on the truth will be whatever he says, and he expects every loyal follower to faithfully parrot the official party line. Or else.\n Another disturbing indicator of the same authoritarian pathology came this week after Trump\u2019s graceless ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The White House initially claimed that Tillerson had been notified the previous Friday that he was being let go, but on Tuesday Steve Goldstein, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, contradicted that spin by telling reporters that Tillerson was \u201cunaware of the reason\u201d for his firing and had just found out about it. Goldstein was immediately canned and, in a significant bit of symbolism, replaced with a former host of \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d Trump\u2019s favorite TV show. Trump is sending a signal that not only does he insist on his right to lie but that he regards telling the truth as a firing offense. Government officials, take note.\n The same vindictiveness was apparent in Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s decision Friday night to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe after 21 years of service, just more than 24 hours before he was due to receive his pension. The excuse apparently was McCabe\u2019s supposedly unauthorized communications with the media about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, followed by alleged attempts to mislead investigators. But Trump\u2019s gloating tweet makes it obvious this was punishment for telling the truth about the Maximum Leader\u2019s attempts to obstruct justice and end an investigation into his links to the Kremlin. Those are inconvenient truths.\n As his presidency advances, Trump is becoming increasingly intolerant of disagreement and defiance, especially from aides who know what they are talking about. Economic adviser Gary Cohn tried to tell him that tariffs and trade wars are bad economics; Trump didn\u2019t listen and Cohn resigned. Tillerson tried to tell him that scrapping the Iran nuclear deal is a bad strategy, and now he\u2019s gone. National security adviser H.R. McMaster is said to be the next candidate for the heave-ho, because he reportedly rubs Trump the wrong way. Of course he does. McMaster is well known in the Army for his blunt willingness to disagree with superiors when he thinks they\u2019re wrong. Trump\u2019s ego is too fragile to handle the truth.\n The frightening thing is that Trump\u2019s insistence on redefining reality is working, at least with his base. The video news site NowThis has posted a hilarious and horrifying clip showing Fox News talking heads hyperventilating over President Barack Obama\u2019s promise to meet with the leaders of hostile states such as North Korea (Mike Huckabee: \u201cPresident Obama likes talking to dictators!\u201d), before going on to fulsomely praise President Trump for doing just that.\n Trump is sucking a substantial portion of America into his Orwellian universe.

At a time he lashes out at everyone from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to our trading partners to the FBI, he nevertheless bends over backward to avoid confronting the Russian tyrant. Instead of standing up for the United States, Trump rolls over for Russia.\n This behavior \u201csends a message to the American people that President Trump doesn\u2019t care about Russian interference in our election, that President Trump doesn\u2019t care about fair elections, and that what President Trump does care about is pleasing Putin,\u201d says former FBI special agent Clinton Watts. \u201cAlso congratulating Putin\u2019s electoral win, and then not challenging Putin on the nerve agent attack in the UK is the equivalent of telling Putin he can do whatever he wants.\u201d\n Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was irate. \u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country\u2019s future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d Likewise, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told a press gaggle Tuesday night, \u201cEvery time you talk with Putin and you give him a pass, that emboldens him. So our friends in Britain are probably disappointed the president didn\u2019t push back.\u201d\n As has often been the case, GOP leadership was far more muted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could only say that such a call would not have been \u201chigh on my list.\u201d Even worse, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) insisted that the call was \u201cfine.\u201d\u00a0It would be nice if \u2014 at least just once \u2014 GOP leaders and the committee chairman would challenge the president directly. \u201cMr. President, that\u2019s not how the leader of the Free World behaves. You communicate weakness or gullibility when you act this way. Why can\u2019t you ever manage to stand up to Putin?\u201d\n Human rights advocates were horrified. \u201cPutin should be condemned, not congratulated, for leading an authoritarian regime that cynically manipulates its own elections and actively works to undermine elections in the United States and other democracies,\u201d said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. \u201cThe United States should recognize Putin as the leader of a repressive government that seeks to export its model of denying fundamental freedoms, and its intolerance of opposition.\u201d\n Likewise, David Kramer, former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, wryly observed, \u201cIf he had to call at all, Trump should have called Putin on Saturday, the day before the so-called election, to congratulate him since the outcome was already known, with Putin having ensured \u2018victory\u2019 with the murder in 2015 of one leading Russian opposition figure (Boris Nemtsov) and the disqualification of another ([Alexei] Navalny) on an absurd conviction.\u201d He cautioned, \u201cNo Western leader should have congratulated Putin because Russia didn\u2019t hold an election in any true sense of that word. Russians deserve better. And to say nothing about the recent poisoning in the UK, interference in our and other elections, or Russian actions in Syria and Ukraine is to embolden Putin to continue such outrageous conduct.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s servility when it comes to Putin defies a benign explanation and takes us to the\u00a0heart of the Russia scandal: What does Putin \u201chave\u201d on Trump, and why is Trump so reluctant to defend American interests when it comes to only this world leader?\u00a0Mueller can ask Stephen K. Bannon and Michael Flynn about Trump\u2019s mysterious passivity, but he might want to question outgoing secretary of state Rex Tillerson, too.

Comey, Dershowitz argue the novel theory that Trump couldn\u2019t\u00a0obstruct justice by ousting his FBI director, even if his goal was to shut down the Russia investigation, because hiring (and firing) officers of the government is a constitutional power. \u201cRespectfully, I could not think Alan is more wrong,\u201d Toobin said in a June panel discussion with Dershowitz.\n Toobin isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s questioned Dershowitz\u2019s stances on\u00a0the probe and its many ramifications.\u00a0Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal and supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, has said that many of his old political allies have shunned him as he has\u00a0made his case in various television appearances and commentaries over the past year, as The Washington Post\u2019s Fred Barbash\u00a0reported.\n An array of legal scholars have criticized\u00a0Dershowitz\u2019s arguments about obstruction of justice, including Daniel J.

John Bolton, whom President Trump has said will take over the position next month, is unsuited for that role. His record is that of a rigid, bombastic ideologue with a history of bullying colleagues and twisting intelligence. His advocacy of extreme policies, including preventive war against North Korea and Iran, could lead Mr. Trump and the country to catastrophe.\n It\u2019s not clear if Mr. Trump chose Mr. Bolton because he agrees with his views or simply because he likes watching his commentaries on the Fox News network. (The president is said to have set aside previous plans to recruit the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations because he did not like the look of his bushy mustache.) Whether he intends it or not, Mr. Trump is likely reintroducing conflict and chaos into his national security team, which under fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson approached competence.\n Mr. McMaster, who joins the growing list of honorable public servants whose reputations have been besmirched by Mr. Trump, managed to purge the National Security Council staff of unqualified personnel imported by his predecessor, Michael Flynn, and to attract some foreign policy professionals. Now they will have to weigh Mr. Bolton\u2019s well-known history, which includes attempting to pressure State Department intelligence professionals into accepting the false conclusion that Cuba had biological weapons, and harassing an Agency for International Development whistleblower. USAID contractor Melody Townsel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2005 that Mr. Bolton chased her through a Moscow hotel in 1994 \u201cthrowing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman.\u201d \n Republican senators who studied this record refused to confirm Mr. Bolton as U.N. ambassador, and it is likely that he would have been rejected by the present Senate if nominated to a position requiring confirmation. Mr. Trump gets to choose his own national security adviser, but in selecting Mr. Bolton he is inviting not just staff turmoil but a radical turn in his foreign policy.\n Mr. McMaster, along with Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, persuaded Mr. Trump to put off some reckless moves, such as canceling the nuclear deal with Iran and withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Now the president\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser will be encouraging his inclination to breach the nuclear accord \u2014 something that would alienate U.S. allies and invite a conflict with Iran.\n Mr. Bolton\u2019s public advocacy of war with North Korea could sink Mr. Trump\u2019s already risky plan to meet with regime leader Kim Jong Un. If Mr. Trump were to heed Mr. Bolton\u2019s argument that a preemptive strike is preferable to managing the nuclear threat, East Asia and perhaps even the U.S. homeland could be exposed to unthinkable bloodshed. \n We\u2019d suggest that GOP leaders in Congress weigh in against Mr. Bolton, but they have shown again and again that they are unwilling to challenge the White House.

(Evan Vucci/AP)  Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian meddling, said in a statement: \u201cThe indictment reaffirms what our intelligence community concluded, what our committee\u2019s investigation has borne out, and what President Trump denies: that Russia interfered in our election in an effort to assist his presidential campaign and harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d Mueller\u2019s indictment came three days after the nation\u2019s top intelligence chiefs warned in Senate testimony that Russia is targeting the 2018 midterm elections in its continuing effort to disrupt the U.S. political system. But the intelligence community\u2019s warnings have gone largely unheeded in the White House. During the first 13 months of his presidency, Trump has rejected the evidence that Russia waged an assault on a pillar of American democracy \u2014 something many in his administration regard as objective reality \u2014 and has sought to discredit the case that Russia poses a threat to the United States. White House officials have said this is partly because the president wants to forge a productive partnership with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin to tackle problems in North Korea, Iran and other hot spots. Trump has never convened a Cabinet-level meeting on Russian interference and has resisted or attempted to undo efforts to hold Moscow to account, such as additional penalties imposed last August by Congress. On the National Security Council, there has been an unspoken understanding that the president would see raising the Russia matter as a personal affront. Trump\u2019s skepticism of the intelligence about Russian interference and his administration\u2019s handling of the security threat was documented by The Washington Post last December, including efforts to explore the return of two Russian compounds in the United States that had been seized by President Barack Obama.  [Exclusive: Doubting the intelligence, Trump pursues Putin and leaves a Russian threat unchecked]  Trump\u2019s doubts about Russia\u2019s role in the election drew considerable attention in September 2016, at his first presidential debate with Clinton. Moderator Lester Holt of NBC News asked Trump about the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cWho\u2019s behind it? And how do we fight it?\u201d Holt asked Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s saying \u2018Russia, Russia, Russia,\u2019\u201d Trump said, referencing Clinton. \u201cBut I don\u2019t \u2014 maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia. But it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?\u201d Thus began the 400-pound couch potato theory. It was not until January 2017 that Trump\u2019s advisers convinced him to acknowledge for the first time that he believed Russians were behind the cyber attacks. The leaders of the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies had traveled to New York on Jan. 6 to brief the president-elect on their findings. And in the days that followed, chief of staff Reince Priebus, son-in-law Jared Kushner and other advisers prodded Trump to accept the findings. They argued that he could affirm the validity of the intelligence without diminishing his electoral win.  Trump scoffed at the intelligence findings, arguing that they could not be trusted, but finally relented. On Jan. 11, in the lobby of Trump Tower, the president-elect held a news conference and said it once and for all: \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d Afterward, Trump told aides that he regretted the comments and he has since hedged his words when asked about Russian interference. Last November, during a trip to Asia, Trump met with Putin and apparently discussed the issue. Trump told reporters that he believed Putin\u2019s denials. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t meddle,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cEvery time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks roiled Washington and the president later tried to backtrack on what he had said. \u201cAs to whether I believe it or not,\u201d Trump told reporters the next day, adding, \u201cI\u2019m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership.\u201d Later that month, however, Trump was back to his old talking points. He tweeted last Nov. 26, \u201cSince the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Philip Rucker", "body": "Tentative plans for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to make his first visit to the White House to meet with President Trump were scuttled this week after a testy call between the two leaders ended in an impasse over Trump\u2019s promised border wall, according to U.S. and Mexican officials.\n Pe\u00f1a Nieto was eyeing an official trip to Washington this month or in early March, but called off the plan after Trump would not agree to publicly affirm Mexico\u2019s position that it would not fund construction of a border wall that the Mexican people widely consider offensive, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential conversation.\n Speaking by phone on Feb. 20, Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trump devoted a considerable portion of their roughly 50 minute conversation to the wall, and neither man would compromise his position.\n One Mexican official said Trump \u201clost his temper.\u201d But U.S. officials described him instead as being frustrated and exasperated, saying Trump believed it was unreasonable for Pe\u00f1a Nieto to expect him to back off his crowd-pleasing campaign promise of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall.\n Both accounts confirm it was Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s desire to avoid public embarrassment \u2014 and Trump\u2019s unwillingness to provide that assurance \u2014 that proved to be the dealbreaker.\n   \n  In a televised address Jan. 25, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said that Mexico will not pay for President Trump's border wall. (Reuters) \n \n A physically slight man, Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been loathe to put himself in an environment in which the more imposing Trump could play the bully. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s style is exceedingly formal and he is averse to verbal combat, making his carefully-scripted public events the opposite of Trump\u2019s often freewheeling appearances.\n With Mexico heading into a July presidential election, any action by Pe\u00f1a Nieto that could be seen as kowtowing to Trump or buckling under American pressure risks damaging the prospects for his Institutional Revolutionary Party.\n The two presidents\u2019 public posturing over the wall \u2014 Trump demands that Mexico pay for it; Pe\u00f1a Nieto insists that it will not \u2014 has harmed their personal relationship and jeopardized the alliance between their neighboring countries.\n \u201cThe problem is that President Trump has painted himself, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the bilateral relationship into a corner,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. \u201cEven from the get-go, the idea of Mexico paying for the wall was never going to fly. His relationship with Mexico isn\u2019t strategically driven. It\u2019s not even business; it\u2019s personal, driven by motivations and triggers, and that\u2019s a huge problem. It could end up with the U.S. asking itself, who lost Mexico?\u201d\n Still, negotiations between their respective administrations continue apace on the North American Free Trade Agreement and other issues. And both governments have striven to portray their ties as strong and the exchanges between their leaders as smooth.\n \u201cWe enjoy a great relationship with Mexico and the two administrations have been working for a year to deepen our cooperation across a range of issues including security, immigration, trade and economics,\u201d Michael Anton, the top spokesman for Trump\u2019s National Security Council, said in a statement.\n Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray called the U.S.-Mexico relationship \u201ccloser\u201d under Trump than in previous administrations.\n \u201cI think in many ways the relationship today is more fluid,\u201d Videgaray said earlier this month in Mexico City alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s closer than it was with previous administrations, which might be surprising to some people, but that\u2019s a fact of life.\u201d\n Traditionally, U.S. presidents have prioritized visits with their Mexican counterparts soon after taking office, considering the close ties between the neighboring countries.\n But in January 2017, just days into Trump\u2019s presidency, Pe\u00f1a Nieto called off a planned trip to meet Trump in Washington amid an escalating war of words between the two leaders over Trump\u2019s border wall proposal.\n In a Jan. 28, 2017, phone call, a transcript of which was published last year by The Washington Post, Trump suggested to Pe\u00f1a Nieto that they both try to gloss over their respective wall positions by saying \u201cwe will work it out\u201d whenever asked whether Mexico would pay for the wall.\n \u201cThe fact is, we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall,\u201d Trump told Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cI have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period. .\u2009.\u2009. If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that.\u201d\n Since that call, Trump has not visited Mexico City and Pe\u00f1a Nieto has not been to Washington, although the two presidents have spoken by phone and met in person last July at the Group of 20 summit in Germany. The two also met in summer 2016, when Trump traveled to Mexico City as a candidate.\n Earlier this month, a delegation of Mexican officials led by Videgaray met at the White House with senior adviser Jared Kushner \u2014 the president\u2019s son-in-law who is charged with managing the U.S.-Mexico relationship \u2014 national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other Trump administration officials to work out the parameters for a Pe\u00f1a Nieto visit, officials said.\n  [Jared Kushner proves to be a shadow diplomat on U.S.-Mexico talks] \n The Mexican officials left the Feb. 14 meeting believing they had an agreement with the U.S. side that Trump would not embarrass Pe\u00f1a Nieto by bringing up his desire for Mexico to fund the wall \u2014 a proposition Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government considers humiliating.\n One Mexican official described his country\u2019s position as, \u201cYou cannot talk about the bloody wall.\u201d This official said Videgaray left Washington believing Trump would not broach the wall during Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s visit.\n Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto made plans to speak by phone Feb. 20 and, assuming the call went well, their staffs would finalize an itinerary for the Mexican president\u2019s White House visit.\n But the call did not go smoothly, according to officials from both governments. Trump said that he would not be bound by any such agreement and could not commit himself to not talking about the wall.\n \u201cThat was a dealbreaker for us,\u201d the Mexican official said, adding that Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his administration were concerned in particular about a reporter asking a question about funding for the wall at a news conference and Trump answering it.\n Instead of announcing a date for a meeting in Washington, the statements issued by both governments summarizing the call were vague and said only that they had discussed their bilateral agenda on trade, security and migration issue. The statements also said the two presidents exchanged condolences for the high school gun massacre in Parkland, Fla., and for the military helicopter accident in Jamiltepec, Oaxaca.\n Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose department is responsible for border issues, has canceled an upcoming visit to Mexico. A Department of Homeland Security official denied Saturday that Nielsen\u2019s trip was scratched because of Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s disagreement, saying the decision to \u201cpostpone\u201d her Mexico trip was made a week before the two presidents spoke.\n U.S. officials said Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto agreed to have their staffs continue talking and try to reach agreement about the border wall and other issues, according to U.S. officials. A few hours after the two presidents spoke, officials said, Kushner called Pe\u00f1a Nieto to help smooth things over.\n U.S. officials said they anticipate Pe\u00f1a Nieto may try again to visit Washington, perhaps in the spring, and the Mexican official suggested the two presidents may get together in April at the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru.\n  [Mexicans see models of Trump\u2019s \u2018impenetrable\u2019 wall, and they\u2019re not impressed] \n \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d was a signature slogan of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 and has continued to be one through his presidency, even though Congress has not yet fully funded its construction. At his rallies, Trump would cry out, \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for the wall?\u201d And his crowds would shout back, \u201cMexico!\u201d\n Speaking Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump told his fans, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re getting the wall,\u201d adding that whenever he hears someone suggest that he does not really want to build a wall, \u201cthe wall gets 10 feet higher.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s statements are considered offensive and outright racist by many Mexicans, who accuse the American president of using their country as a \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d to motivate his most fervent supporters.\n In private, Mexican officials bristle at Trump\u2019s claims their government is passively allowing drugs and Central American migrants to pass through en route to the United States.\n The number of Central Americans detained and turned back by Mexican authorities has at times exceeded the number caught by U.S. border agents, but enforcement by the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government appears to have waned in recent years.\n Still, there is an understanding in Mexico that Trump is playing to his national interests, according to Larry Rubin, who for years has been a leader among U.S. Republicans in Mexico.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a better understanding of where President Trump is coming from and what his objective is and what his style is,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cLike in any negotiations, there is always posturing or issues that countries don\u2019t agree with.

He\u2019s bragged about the size of his \u201cnuclear button,\u201d repeatedly threatened military action and used playground taunts to demean America\u2019s adversaries. \n But in the first 15 months of his presidency, Trump has been cautious when it comes to actually using military power and putting U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\n The last two weeks could mark a major turning point in his presidency. In selecting John Bolton as his new national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as his secretary of state, Trump has elevated two of the most consistently hawkish Republicans in Washington.\n Now, the question is how these two Trump advisers will change a president with few, if any, fixed views on foreign policy.\n Bolton, a Fox News commentator and prolific writer, brings a coherent and unusually controversial foreign policy philosophy to the White House. He has been a fervent advocate for using American military power to prevent rogue regimes, such as Iran and North Korea, from acquiring and proliferating nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\n \u201cHe is unabashed about this,\u201d said Mark Groombridge, a former top adviser to Bolton at the State Department and United Nations. \u201cHe has no problems with the doctrine of preemption and feels the greatest threat that the United States faces is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n  [The return of John Bolton sparks concern around the world] \n Pompeo has described Iran as \u201ca thuggish police state\u201d and a \u201cdespotic theocracy.\u201d Both men have described the landmark Iran nuclear deal as \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n Trump was initially drawn to Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who he dismissed Thursday as national security adviser, for his reputation as a warrior in Iraq and Afghanistan. But McMaster\u2019s methodical and academic style grated on the president, who often complained that he couldn\u2019t stand being around him.\n Bolton and Pompeo are much more of a stylistic match. \u201cTrump likes the pugnacious, tough-guy style, and they reinforce it,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a former Bush administration official and Trump critic.\n They are also far more savvy bureaucratic operators than McMaster, who had never served in Washington and often tried to wear Trump down rather than woo him.\n The challenge for Bolton and Pompeo will be convincing Trump to support their aggressive plans.\n McMaster pressed the Pentagon for military options to strike targets in Iran. But his entreaties were routinely rebuffed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said U.S. officials.\n \u201cMattis has been daggers drawn with H.R. on everything,\u201d said a person close to both men.\n In most of these disputes Trump either backed Mattis or did not weigh in with his feuding advisers.\n  [Trump\u2019s favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust?] \n In Afghanistan, McMaster took a similarly tough line, pressing Trump to agree, against his own instincts, to double the size of U.S. forces to 15,000 troops and back a strategy that relies heavily on America\u2019s ability to improve Afghanistan\u2019s inefficient and corrupt government. But Trump never seemed to buy into the new strategy and resented McMaster for pushing it on him, U.S. officials said. Pentagon officials have said that they feel under intense pressure to show progress on the battlefield this year before Trump pulls the plug.\n Neither Bolton nor Pompeo share McMaster\u2019s belief that U.S. power can or should be used to reshape the world or spread democracy. \u201cBolton is almost entirely focused on U.S. national security,\u201d said David Bosco, an international relations professor at Indiana University who has interviewed Bolton for his work. \u201cHe has very little patience for the idea that the U.S. should be spending blood and treasure to improve other countries.\u201d\n In that way, both Bolton and Pompeo are much more of an ideological match with Trump. Their biggest impact in the immediate term could be on Trump\u2019s planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, scheduled to take place by the end of May.\n In approaching North Korea, Bolton has suggested that Trump should demand that the Kim Jong Un denuclearize and allow international arms inspectors unfettered access to the country \u2014 an outcome most Korea experts say is highly unlikely.\n Absent a total North Korean capitulation, Bolton is likely to press Trump to reject lesser concessions such as a freeze of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, said those who have worked with him.\n \u201cJohn hates the word \u2018freeze,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Groombridge said. \u201cHates it.\u201d\n Bolton and Pompeo also share Trump\u2019s intense frustration with the nuclear agreement that the United States and five other world powers reached with Tehran during the Obama administration. They will play key roles in advising Trump next month on whether to amend it or drop it entirely.\n Bolton and Pompeo will likely make their biggest impact on the daily operations of the Trump administration. For much of the last six months, if not longer, McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were widely viewed as weak and wounded players inside the administration. \n As CIA director, Pompeo has spent more time at the White House than previous directors, cultivating a relationship with Trump. He\u2019s likely to try to forge deeper ties at the State Department than Tillerson, who often ignored the diplomatic corps. \n \u201cPompeo has shown that he\u2019s committed to working with the team that\u2019s given to him,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, a senior vice president at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cAt State, he\u2019ll hear very different things than what the president wants him to hear.\u201d\n At the White House, Bolton is likely to reinforce Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d view of the world. Both the president and his new top adviser share a long-standing animus to any treaties, international laws or alliances that limit America\u2019s freedom to act on the world stage.\n Bolton has also shown that he knows how to influence Trump. Even when he was frozen out of a White House job at the start of the administration, Bolton managed to gain access to the president. \n For a brief period after White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly took over, Bolton was even completely blocked from the Oval Office. But the ban didn\u2019t last for long. Bolton won back his contact by drafting a plan to help Trump get out of the Iran deal at the same time that the president\u2019s advisers were encouraging him to stay in it.\n As national security adviser, Bolton\u2019s former colleagues said he would make access to Trump his top priority. His model: Henry Kissinger.\n \u201cJohn always said that he admired Kissinger,\u201d Groombridge recalled. \u201cHis model is very much an imperial-style National Security Council.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Samantha Schmidt", "body": "Claudia Tenney,\u00a0then a state assemblywoman,\u00a0speaks at the Capitol, in Albany, N.Y., in June\u00a02015.

In a radio interview last week, she suggested\u00a0the domestic abuse allegations against former White House staff secretary Rob Porter were not \u201ccrimes of character.\u201d And in\u00a0an earlier interview on CNN, she said Democrats who refrained from clapping during the State of the Union address were \u201cun-American.\u201d\n \u201cOnce again Congresswoman Tenney has demonstrated how completely unfit she is to serve in Congress,\u201d Lukaske said.\n In a statement later Wednesday, Tenney defended her remarks,\u00a0pointing fingers at the left for politicizing mass shootings.\n \u201cI am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy,\u201d Tenney said in\u00a0email\u00a0statement to The Washington Post.\n \u201cWhile we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime,\u201d she added. \u201cI will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.\u201d\n When running for Congress, Tenney was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, which gave her an \u201cA\u201d rating. She has described herself as a \u201clife\u00a0member of the NRA, gun owner and shooting sports enthusiast\u201d who is committed to defending the Second Amendment. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016, and was previously a member of the state Assembly.\n In her radio interview with\u00a0Dicker, Tenney also suggested that mass shootings did not take place decades ago, when fewer gun restrictions existed.

(Alex Brandon/AP)\n \n The Post reports:\n  Attorney General Jeff Sessions late Friday night fired former FBI deputy director Andrew Mc\u00adCabe, a little more than 24 hours before McCabe was set to retire\u00a0\u2014 a move that McCabe alleged was an attempt to slander him and undermine the ongoing special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign.\n Sessions announced the decision in a statement just before 10\u00a0p.m., noting that both the Justice Department inspector general and the FBI office that handles discipline had found \u201cthat Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor \u2014 including under oath \u2014 on multiple occasions.\u201d . . . . The move will likely cost Mc\u00adCabe a significant portion of his retirement benefits, though it is possible he could bring a legal challenge.\n  In a blistering written rebuttal,\u00a0McCabe said he authorized two FBI officials to talk to a reporter \u201cto set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\u201d He asserted, \u201cIt was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week.\u201d He continued:\n  I\u00a0am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey\u2019s accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG\u2019s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday\u2019s comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.\n This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration\u2019s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel\u2019s work.\n  President Trump, never able to conceal his vindictiveness and incapable of understanding what evidence might be used against him, gleefully tweeted, \u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI \u2013 A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\u201d\n No wonder Trump\u2019s lawyers seem unable to imagine allowing him to sit for an interview with special prosecutor Robert S. Mueller III. He is likely to blurt out something akin to, \u201cYay, that\u2019ll show McCabe and others what happens when they decide to help Comey!\u201d That\u2019s the essence of the tweet Trump could not resist sending.\n Former White House ethics counsel Norman Eisen, now with the Brookings Institution, tells me, \u201cTrump and his enablers are engaged in a systematic effort to undermine the Russia investigation \u2014 including Robert Mueller\u2019s review of whether Trump obstructed it by demanding James Comey pledge loyalty and let Michael Flynn go, and by firing Comey when he would not accede.\u201d He continued, \u201cMcCabe spurned Trump and is a key corroborating witness for Comey\u2014ergo a target of Trump\u2019s ire.\u201d He added, \u201cWhatever McCabe may or may not have done (and we will need to await more details to judge him, and Sessions too for that matter), Trump\u2019s behavior is an appalling violation of norms. It may also be a violation of law\u2014we will find out, should McCabe challenge this behavior in litigation.\u201d\n Unfortunately for McCabe, his ability to challenge his firing is limited. \u201cThere is honestly few legal recourses for him to pursue absent discriminatory actions,\u201d says attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in defending national security employees. \u201cIn my 25 years of federal legal practice, I have found FBI\u2019s due process to be sorely lacking.\u201d\n From a political standpoint, McCabe\u2019s firing is likely to come across as vindictive, small-minded and cruel \u2014 the essence of the Trump administration. For those within the FBI and the Justice Department, it may turn up the long-simmering resentment against the president to a full boil. A president willing to force McCabe\u2019s firing is willing to fire any one of them; if they needed further encouragement, this latest affront is likely to cause them to redouble their efforts to root out the extent of Russian interference in our election and any cooperation with the Trump campaign.\n Sessions\u2019s willingness to go along with this retaliatory move will not be received well within his department. He too has much to lose by enabling Trump\u2019s vendetta against DOJ, given that Sessions was involved in the firing of Comey and the drafting of a pretextual reason for his firing. Sessions no doubt felt it was necessary to fire McCabe to keep his job, but he\u2019d best be looking over his shoulder in his own department. There are long-time civil servants who may have material relevant to Sessions\u2019s actions.\n As a legal matter, this is another ham-handed and downright dumb move in a long line of actions designed to derail, undermine and discredit the Russia investigation.\n Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney tells me, \u201cEven if McCabe\u2019s firing is appropriate based on facts in the unreleased IG\u2019s report, because of the President\u2019s long running campaign against McCabe and Attorney General Sessions\u2019 perceived vulnerability if he didn\u2019t fall in step, it has the taint of political reprisal.\u201d She adds that, \u201cif an obstruction case against Trump ever went to trial, there would be a large screen where the President\u2019s tweets would be prominently displayed for the jury as evidence of his efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation, while a parade of witnesses testified about conversations they had with him preceding each Tweet.\u201d\n In sum, once more, a Trump-inspired stunt is likely to backfire. The politics are irrelevant to Mueller, who now views each of Trump\u2019s antics through a single lens: Does this reveal corrupt intent to disable an investigation into Trump\u2019s conduct?

For notwithstanding his ineptitude, lack of presidential temperament, chaotic White House and deep unpopularity, Trump is continuing to strengthen his grip on power.\n The McCabe case illustrates the fundamental asymmetry between Trump and his critics. For anti-Trump commentators and activists who embrace the rule of law as the central tenant of their resistance to the president, McCabe is problematic. According to reports of the findings of well-regarded Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, McCabe wrongfully leaked details of the investigation of Hillary Clinton, then was not fully candid with investigators about it. If true, this is not the sort of conduct that \u201crule of law\u201d advocates are comfortable defending. \n Which brings us to Trump\u2019s two advantages over his opponents. First, until the details of McCabe\u2019s case are public, many Trump critics have been restrained in their reaction to McCabe\u2019s firing. They want to reserve judgment until the facts are in; they want to assess McCabe\u2019s actual culpability before taking up his case. \n But Trump is not similarly constrained in smearing McCabe and regaling in his ouster. Trump called McCabe\u2019s firing \u2014 executed by an attorney general under pressure to appease his boss \u2014 \u201ca great day\u201d and a reflection of the \u201clies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI.\u201d This was at least his sixth tweet about McCabe in recent months, leaving no doubt about Trump\u2019s grudge against the career FBI agent whom Trump has maligned with a long list of false accusations. \n McCabe has professed his innocence, and the Justice Department inspector general has neither confirmed nor denied public reports of his findings. Weeks or months from now we may find, as McCabe claims, that he did nothing wrong. But by then the swirl of Trumpism will have moved on. By the time the fact-based opposition has what it needs to defend McCabe, the next of Trump\u2019s victims will be \u201cin the barrel,\u201d to use Roger Stone\u2019s famous phrase. \n And what if McCabe did do something wrong in authorizing FBI officials to talk to a reporter, or while answering questions from investigators looking into the matter? Here is Trump\u2019s second advantage: the fact that almost every person who stands up to Trump will, themselves, be imperfect, be vulnerable to investigation, have made mistakes \u2014 that is to say, human.\n As Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt point out in their book, \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d modern authoritarian leaders do not consolidate power by coming after wholly innocent people: They exploit the fact that almost every person with a long public career \u2014 those who could be a check on the leader\u2019s power \u2014 has done something wrong, or something that can be cast as wrong, if scrutinized in a certain way. Former FBI director James B. Comey \u2014 fired for refusing to bend to Trump\u2019s will \u2014 made substantial and hugely consequential mistakes in handling the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton. Rex Tillerson \u2014 fired just hours after being the first senior U.S. official to join Britain in sharply criticizing Russia \u2014 probably was the worst secretary of state in modern history. The list goes on. \n They, and others, may well have deserved to face some consequence, perhaps even to have their government service ended. But, in the era of Trump, that is not the right question. \n In these instances, we need to ask not whether an individual did something wrong; the question is whether there is any reason to believe that is why Trump took action. In McCabe\u2019s case, the answer is obvious.\n From Trump\u2019s own words, it is clear that he had McCabe fired not for anything he did wrong, but for what he did right: His refusal to pledge political loyalty to Trump, his determination that the investigation of Trump and his campaign continue without compromise, and his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee corroborating Comey\u2019s damning account of Trump\u2019s obstruction. \n McCabe\u2019s firing serves Trump\u2019s purposes, whether or not McCabe did anything wrong. And every FBI agent investigating matters that Trump finds uncomfortable, every intelligence officer reporting on Russian efforts to corrupt our democracy, every career civil servant doing his or her duty in the face of political pressure has been sent a chilling message: Cross the president at your peril. He will single you out, he will harass you publicly, he will find a way to end your career. He may even deny you a pension you have spent decades earning through selfless public service.\n This, then, is the challenge that confronts Trump\u2019s opponents dedicated to protecting the rule of law from his political power. Standing up to Trump may indeed involve standing unequivocally with imperfect people, people who may have done something wrong \u2014 to stop the president from perpetrating an even bigger wrong, with an even greater cost to our system. \n I stand with Andrew McCabe.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "John Wagner", "body": "President Trump on Wednesday defended his congratulatory call to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin on his reelection, saying that getting along with one of the United States\u2019 biggest geopolitical rivals is a \u201cgood thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n In a series of tweets, Trump criticized his predecessors for failing to establish a better relationship with Russia, asserting that the last president from his party, George W.

So it just seems to me that maybe it doesn\u2019t matter who it is that\u2019s in the majority. This is kind of the same argument all the time,\u201d said Rep.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who also first won in 2010, served as this group\u2019s biggest ally in the process argument. He mocked how big the bill was by tweeting that it was still printing in his office, more than two hours after he first hit print. \n The legislation \u2014 combining 12 separate funding bills that were supposed to have been approved six months ago \u2014 won on a sweeping bipartisan vote. A healthy majority of Republicans, as well as Democrats, supported the plan. \n Those conservative principles only went so far when they were measured against the unleashed spigots of federal funds, which had been tightly held since the 2011 Budget Control Act had placed strict spending caps. \n A bipartisan compromise last month gave a nearly $120 billion boost over the original 2018 spending limit, a massive 10 percent hike. \n House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) mounted a vigorous defense of the legislation, focusing on it representing the largest spike in military funding since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. \n He explained that the House had done its part in September, approving all 12 of the funding bills, while the Senate dithered. So members should have been able to read those earlier bills to have a sense of what would be in the final draft. \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t as if it was a one-week process. This has been a months-long process,\u201d Ryan told reporters at weekly Thursday briefing. He noted that Friday\u2019s funding deadline made it necessary to move quickly and also pointed to the need to allow several dozen lawmakers to leave early Friday morning to attend the funeral of Louise Slaughter (D) in Rochester, N.Y.\n   This year is shaping up to be a clash of Republican idealists vs. realists  \n   Pelosi, now minority leader, has long made a similar defense of the process of passing the health law, which transpired over nine months in 2009 and 2010, with multiple versions of the law publicly approved by different committees by the House and Senate.\n Ryan originally hoped to release the bill last week and hold a vote early this week, allowing the Senate several days to consider it. Instead, the talks dragged on and on, pushing up closer against the Friday deadline. \n And all the explanations fell flat to some Republicans. \n In last month\u2019s vote on the budget framework, 167 Republicans supported leadership, about two-thirds of the caucus. On Thursday, just 145 Republicans backed Ryan, a sharp drop that many attributed to the rushed process. Kelly was one of those who went from yes to no.\n \u201cI keep hearing about the process being broken,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThen why don\u2019t we fix it?\u201d \n In 2010, when John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) was minority leader, GOP leaders made process a central plank of the \u201cPledge to America\u201d, a campaign-style platform that gave voters a loose blueprint for how they would govern. Boehner believed that bad processes led to bad policy, a theme that Ryan echoed in his 2015 victory speech after he won the vote to succeed Boehner.\n So Republicans create the \u201cthree-day rule\u201d, mandating that a bill should not be voted on until the third day after its unveiling. Over the past seven years both Boehner and Ryan have violated that rule, because of imminent deadlines and potential doom of delay.\n But Republicans had never broke the rule on something of this magnitude \u2014 legislation funding every corner of the federal government. Even before they held a final vote, GOP leaders gaveled shut a procedural vote, 211 to 207, while some Democrats were waiting in the back not having voted. \n The whole scene brought criticism from some predictable rank-and-file Republicans who have always chafed under Boehner and Ryan. \n \u201cI never thought I would see the day when my party had a worse process than Obamacare did, but this was a worse process,\u201d Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas) said after the spending bill vote. \n But the class of 2010, whose campaigns were fueled with promises of legislative transparency, seemed most perplexed by the haphazard process.\n \u201cFor me, a 2,200-page bill is very tough to understand and read,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cAnd I was in the business world for 30 years, I wouldn\u2019t sign a 100-page bill.

Those two stories were three pages apart in Saturday\u2019s print edition of The Post.  On the front page, my colleagues Carol D. Leonnig, Shane Harris and Greg Jaffe reported that Donald Trump is the first president since Richard M. Nixon not to regularly review the document known as the President\u2019s Daily Brief, the distillation of information picked up around the world by U.S. intelligence agencies.  And there on Page A4 was the other one, under the bylines of Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett.  Jared Kushner\u2019s inability to get a permanent security clearance, for reasons that are not entirely clear, has become a source of vexation at the White House. But in the meantime, he has a temporary status that allows him to \u201csee materials, including the President\u2019s Daily Brief, that are among the most sensitive in government,\u201d they wrote. There are two sets of issues to be concerned about here. The more serious one, of course, is whether the president is getting the information he needs to keep the country safe \u2014 or alternatively, whether his handlers may be dumbing things down to avoid overtaxing his attention span or challenging his preconceptions. In the case of Kushner, there is a potential security risk but also the more immediate question of how appropriate is it for him to have access to the material under any circumstances. That takes us back to the fact that the 37-year-old real estate scion has no credential to merit holding his current White House job, outside of whom he married. It is hard to miss the irony of it all: Wasn\u2019t the main driver of the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails the fact that it suggested she was careless in handling the nation\u2019s secrets? The President\u2019s Daily Brief, or PDB, was the document that on Aug. 6, 2001, contained a heading warning: \u201cBin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\u201d It even suggested that he might hijack airlines to do it.  When such an attack happened a month later, that memo became Exhibit A in the case for those who argued that the George W. Bush administration was asleep to the danger. Of course, every president has his own style of processing information. But even Ronald Reagan, whose inattentiveness so often exasperated his closest advisers, made a point of reading the PDB every day.  White House officials say that Trump\u2019s decision to receive a shortened briefing orally reflects his \u201cstyle of learning,\u201d as well as his impatience with dense material. His intelligence advisers augment their presentation with charts, pictures, videos and what CIA Director Mike Pompeo calls \u201ckiller graphics.\u201d But it seems fair to wonder how closely the easily distractable chief executive is following the oral presentations. The time on his official schedule set aside for the briefings has sometimes coincided closely with his tweets, including ones about random things he seems to have heard on \u201cFox  Friends.\u201d  A separate issue is whether his oral briefings are full reflections of what the PDBs actually say. Last year, for instance, The Post reported that intelligence officials include Russia-related material only in the written version and avoid referring to it in their oral presentations, in apparent fear that it will set off another presidential eruption about witch hunts by sore-loser Democrats. While it is typical for a close circle of presidential aides to also have access to the PDB, it is far less so for someone like Kushner, a newcomer to government who has only a temporary status on his clearance \u2014 and who, it should be noted, is also a focus in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation. Kushner\u2019s lawyer Abbe Lowell insisted in a statement that Kushner\u2019s clearance is taking longer than usual \u201cbecause of the extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions.\u201d But the process has not been helped by the fact that Kushner has had to repeatedly update his security questionnaire, known as an SF-86, because he neglected to include all contacts he has had with foreigners. Concern about the casualness with which the Trump White House deals with sensitive material also has been amplified in the past week, with the resignation of White House staff secretary Rob Porter over allegations that he had abused two ex-wives. It turns out that Porter, whose job it was to control the flow of documents to the president, also had only an interim security clearance \u2014 and that the FBI had warned top White House officials that there was evidence that he committed a violent crime. Given Trump\u2019s background \u2014 the flamboyant bankrupticies of his businesses, the many lawsuits that he has filed and that have been lodged against him, the credible allegations that he has mistreated women \u2014 it is hard to imagine that he would be a slam dunk for a security clearance.

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo      JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be indicted in two corruption cases, police recommended Tuesday, ramping up pressure on the leader who has served more than a decade in office.  After months of investigations, Israeli police handed over their recommendations to Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit on Tuesday evening.  Netanyahu maintained his innocence in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday night. The first case, referred to as Case 1000, details gifts of cigars and jewelry worth hundreds of thousands of shekels that the prime minister and his wife, Sara, are suspected of receiving from billionaire benefactors such as Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchen and James Packer, an Australian millionaire who was briefly married to Mariah Carey. The other case, 2000, involves deals made between Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, publisher of popular Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth. According to information leaked to the Israeli press, the deal apparently would have allowed the prime minister to receive more favorable coverage from the newspaper if he agreed to weaken the status of rival daily newspaper Israel Hayom, owned by U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.  [Netanyahu suggests police could implicate him in corruption probe]  The police announcement will increase pressure on Netanyahu to resign, though he has given no indication that he plans to do so, adopting a combative tone as the investigations have circled closer to him.  He has repeatedly attacked the police, accusing them of being politically motivated and attempting to stage a coup.  That tension has ramped up over the past week amid leaks that police were preparing to recommend an indictment.  Netanyahu released a Facebook video telling his supporters not to worry and stating his often-repeated mantra: \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d It will be up to the attorney general to decide whether to indict him, he said, pointing out that many police recommendations for indictments go nowhere.  He later released a long Facebook message. \u201cThe real question is the integrity of the investigation, and the only way to get to the bottom of it is through an objective, unbiased and quick investigation,\u201d he said.  Netanyahu\u2019s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced to resign in 2009 after being plagued by corruption allegations during his term. He was indicted shortly after his resignation and was convicted in 2014.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) credit for finally saying that firing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III would be impeachable conduct by President Trump. \u201cWell, I think what the president will have done is stopped an investigation in whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign,\u201d he told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cI can\u2019t see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\u201d He also was candid enough to admit, in essence, that his fellow Republicans are hypocrites who put party above country. If it were a Democratic president, Graham conceded, Republicans would \u201call have a different view.\u201d\n Several things follow from this outpouring of candor.\n First, if Republicans under the same circumstances would take the view that a Democratic president\u2019s actions are impeachable, they have no business being in office. They are, if Graham is right, entirely incapable of upholding their oaths. At the very least, Graham has suggested that they very likely are not willing to put country above party.\n We have been saying much the same thing, namely that Republicans are signaling by their silence in the face of threats to Mueller that they have no stomach to really confront Trump. If they wanted to clear up any confusion, they could pass legislation \u2014 or simply a resolution \u2014 saying firing Mueller would be grounds for impeachment. They haven\u2019t, and their silence is telling.\n That realization \u2014 that they won\u2019t apply the same standard to Trump that they\u2019d apply to a Democratic president \u2014 tells us they must be voted out. If there is a substantial risk that they will not take action even when they know conduct has been committed that justifies impeachment, there is no reason to entrust the awesome responsibility of office, let alone the majority in both houses, to Republicans.\n Graham invites further scrutiny. In his mind, we now know, \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d in interfering with a prosecutor\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s own conduct is grounds for impeachment. But what if corrupt intent is revealed in a slew of other ways \u2014 drafting a false account of the Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, firing then-FBI Director James B. Comey, asking Comey to lay off Michael Flynn, threatening Comey (with some sort of claim that he improperly leaked information), cooking up a phony explanation for firing Comey, telling his White House counsel to fire Mueller, orchestrating the firing of a witness in the Russia investigation (Andrew McCabe), spewing baseless conspiracy theories to discredit the FBI so that the investigation will not have credibility with the president, and on and on? All of these actions demonstrate a pattern of action driven by corrupt intent. The test cannot be whether his corrupt intent succeeded in decapitating the chief prosecutor; it is whether Trump had the requisite criminal mind-set and took actions in furtherance of his corrupt intent.\u00a0In sum, if Trump took all the actions (and more) listed above with the intent of freeing himself from an investigation into his own wrongdoing then, under Graham\u2019s theory, impeachment is warranted.\n Two caveats are in order.\n Republicans may have higher standards than Graham (and I) believe. They should be given the opportunity to go on the record now (and before the midterms) and tell us that firing Mueller is grounds for impeachment. They can give their reasons \u2014 and explain why only firing Mueller (not firing Comey, for example) would trigger impeachment. In other words, knowing what we know now, has Trump\u2019s conduct to disrupt and impair the investigation evidenced corrupt intent?\n Second, unlike Democrats who could well say, \u201cWe think he\u2019s committed unimpeachable acts, but it would tear the country apart to impeach,\u201d Republicans could remove \u2014 indeed have the obligation to remove \u2014 the political taint by making justified impeachment bipartisan. It\u2019s their refusal to put partisanship aside (as Graham seems to anticipate) that would foist constitutional responsibility onto Democrats. Republicans will have rendered an appropriate congressional response to presidential conduct (impeachment and removal) dangerous to the survival of our democracy.\n In short, Graham deserves praise for owning up to the conclusion that interfering with an investigation to protect the president\u2019s own hide is impeachable. Now, we have to find out whether he thinks Trump has already met that standard by the pattern of conduct leading up to the present barrage of threats against Mueller. And if the voters have reason to believe Republicans will refuse to uphold their oaths \u2014 leaving in office an unfit president, or daring Democrats to set off a divisive political battle \u2014 they really need to get those lawmakers out of there.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Skripal\u2019s case was not discussed.

Two people familiar with the notecards acknowledged that they included instructions not to congratulate Putin. But a senior White House official emphasized that national security adviser H.R. McMaster did not mention the issue during a telephone briefing with the president, who was in the White House residence ahead of and during his conversation with Putin. \n  It was not clear whether Trump read the notes, administration officials said. Trump, who initiated the call, opened it with the congratulations for Putin, one person familiar with the conversation said. \n The president\u2019s tone drew a rebuke from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election.\u201d\n But Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appeared less concerned, noting Trump has also offered congratulations to other leaders of more totalitarian states. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read much into it,\u201d Corker said. \n Putin\u2019s latest consolidation of power came in what foreign policy analysts said was a rigged election in which he got 76 percent of the vote against several minor candidates. Some world leaders have hesitated to congratulate Putin, since his reelection occurred in an environment of state control of much of the news media and with his most prominent opponent barred from the ballot.\n   \n  While Russian President Vladimir Putin was reelected in a landslide victory on March 18, videos emerged of alleged ballot-stuffing at polling stations across Russia. (The Washington Post) \n \n Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s phone call, national security aides provided Trump with several handwritten notecards filled with talking points to guide his conversation, as is customary for calls with foreign leaders, according to the officials with knowledge of the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n The notecards are similar to the one Trump was photographed clutching during a White House meeting with students and parents after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., officials said.\n  [The Fix: This photo of Trump\u2019s notes captures his empathy deficit better than anything] \n Trump\u2019s failure to raise Moscow\u2019s alleged poisoning of the former Russian spy in Britain risked angering officials in London, who are trying to rally Britain\u2019s closest allies to condemn the attack. Russia has denied involvement in the March 4 poisoning, but the attack has badly damaged British-Russian relations and British Prime Minister Theresa May last week announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation.\n Putin denied that Russia had any role and called the claim \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n Asked about McCain\u2019s criticism, Sanders noted that the leaders of France and Germany also called Putin this week and pointed to former president Barack Obama, who congratulated Putin on an election victory in 2012.\n  \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear in the actions that we\u2019ve taken that we\u2019re going to be tough on Russia, particularly when it comes to areas that we feel where they\u2019ve stepped out of place,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve placed tough sanctions on Russia and a number of other things where we have shown exactly what our position is.\u201d\n She emphasized, however, that Trump is determined to establish a working relationship with Putin to tackle global challenges, including confronting North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. \n  Asked whether the Trump administration believes Russia conducted a \u201cfree and fair\u201d election, Sanders said the administration is focused on U.S. elections.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t get to dictate how other countries operate,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that\u2019s not something that we can dictate to them how they operate.\u201d\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also distanced himself Tuesday from Trump\u2019s congratulatory remarks. \n \u201cThe president can call whomever he chooses,\u201d McConnell said at his weekly news conference Tuesday. \u201cWhen I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results. I\u2019m always reminded of the election they used to have in almost every communist country where whoever the dictator was at the moment always got huge percentage of the vote.\u201d\n  Trump has largely refrained from criticizing Putin amid the ongoing investigation into the 2016 election meddling by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who in February indicted 13 Russian nationals on conspiracy charges. His tone has at times been at odds with his administration, which has taken stronger actions to counter Russian aggression, including Trump\u2019s authorization of new sanctions against Russia and additional support Ukrainian troops in their fight against Russian-backed forces in Crimea.\n  [Video: Trump discusses call with Putin] \n  \u201cIt\u2019s blatantly obvious that he has just an inexplicable level of support for President Putin,\u201d said Julie Smith, a European security expert who served as deputy national security adviser for former vice president Joe Biden. \u201cYou keep thinking it will change as he sees his own administration take action \u2014 that this never-ending well of support for Putin will some how subside. It\u2019s disheartening at a time when our trans-Atlantic partners really need a boost. Europe is looking to us for leadership on Russia in particular and they\u2019re not getting it.\u201d\n  Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, said Trump\u2019s actions were \u201ca sign he wants a pro-Russia foreign policy,\u201d which conflicts with the harder line from his administration.\n \u201cEveryone is trying to figure out what does this mean,\u201d Wright said. \u201cRussia hawks say, pay attention to us, but not to the president or to the tweets. But the reality is, his reaction is policy. The fact that there hasn\u2019t been a stronger sanctions response to the poisoning so far is policy.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s applause of Putin\u2019s victory was in line with other congratulatory calls he has made, including to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for winning a much-disputed referendum that increased his already autocratic powers and to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping for his \u201cextraordinary elevation\u201d after Xi last month engineered the Communist Party\u2019s elimination of presidential term limits.\n \u201cI think it\u2019s great.

Will", "body": "Newly named national security adviser John Bolton. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) \n   \n  Because John Bolton is five things President Trump is not \u2014 intelligent, educated, principled, articulate and experienced \u2014 and because of Bolton\u2019s West Wing proximity to a president responsive to the most recent thought he has heard emanating from cable television or an employee, Bolton will soon be the second-most dangerous American. On April 9, he will be the first national security adviser who, upon taking up residence down the hall from the Oval Office, will be suggesting that the United States should seriously consider embarking on war crimes. \n The first two charges against the major Nazi war criminals in the 1945-1946 Nuremberg trials concerned waging aggressive war. Emboldened by the success, as he still sees it, of America\u2019s Iraq adventure that began 15 years ago this month, Bolton, for whom a trade war with many friends and foes is insufficiently stimulating, favors real wars against North Korea and Iran. Both have odious regimes, but neither can credibly be said to be threatening an imminent attack against the United States. Nevertheless, Bolton thinks bombing both might make the world safer. What could go wrong?\n Much is made of the fact that Bolton is implacably hostile to strongman Vladimir Putin, whom the U.S. president, a weak person\u2019s idea of a strong person, admires. And of the fact that the president has repeatedly execrated the invasion of Iraq that Bolton advocated. So, today among the uneducable, furrowed brows express puzzlement: How can the president square his convictions with Bolton\u2019s? Let\u2019s say this one more time: Trump. Has. No. Convictions. \n Even this scatterbrain\u2019s Swiss cheese-style tariffs are too sloppy to reflect forethought. He has sentiments, and visceral reactions to which he is attentive. But to speak of, say, a sincere sofa is to commit what philosophers call a \u201ccategory mistake\u201d \u2014 sofas are incapable of sincerity \u2014 and to speak of this president\u2019s convictions (or plans, or policies) about this or that is a category mistake. \n It is frequently said that the decision to invade Iraq was the worst U.S. foreign policy decision since Vietnam. Actually, it was worse than Vietnam, and the worst in American history, for two reasons. One is that so far we probably have paid no more that 20\u00a0percent of the eventual costs of that decision that enhanced Iran\u2019s ascendancy. The other reason is that America gradually waded waist deep into Vietnam without a crossing-the-Rubicon moment \u2014 a single clear, dispositive decision. In contrast, the protracted preparation for invading Iraq was deliberative and methodical. It is not true that, as the current president and the virulent left insist, President George W. Bush and his senior advisers \u201clied\u201d about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. They simply got things wrong, which conservatives, especially, understand was an event not without precedent in the annals of government. \n For the first time since World War II, when the mobilization of U.S. industrial might propelled this nation to the top rank among world powers, the American president is no longer the world\u2019s most powerful person. The president of China is, partly because of the U.S. president\u2019s abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without an alternative trade policy. Power is the ability to achieve intended effects. Randomly smashing crockery does not count. The current president resembles Winston Churchill\u2019s description of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles \u2014 \u201cthe only bull I know who carries his china closet with him.\u201d \n Like the Obama administration, whose Iran policy he robustly ridicules, Bolton seems to believe that the United States has the power to determine who can and cannot acquire nuclear weapons. Pakistan, which had a per capita income of $470 when it acquired nuclear weapons 20 years ago (China\u2019s per capita income was $85.50 when it acquired them in 1964), demonstrated that almost any nation determined to become a nuclear power can do so. \n Bolton\u2019s belief in the U.S. power to make the world behave and eat its broccoli reflects what has been called \u201cnarcissistic policy disorder\u201d \u2014 the belief that whatever happens in the world happens because of something the United States did or did not do. This is a recipe for diplomatic delusions and military overreaching.\n Speaking of delusions, one died last week \u2014 the belief that this president could be safely cocooned within layers of adult supervision. Bolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R. McMaster, wrote a brilliant book (\u201cDereliction of Duty\u201d) on the failure of officials, particularly military leaders, who knew better but did not resist the stumble into the Vietnam disaster.

The Chronicle quoted unnamed ICE officials confirming Schwab\u2019s resignation but declining to discuss specifics, citing confidentiality for personnel matters. A Justice Department spokesperson could not immediately be reached.\n According to ICE, of the 232 people picked up in the raid, 115, or roughly half, had felonies or misdemeanors on their records.\n When Schwab insisted on setting the record straight and correcting the idea that hundreds of dangerous criminals got away, he said ICE officials told him to direct reporters to statements ICE or Homan had already made.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the job of a public affairs officer to offer transparency for the agency you work for,\u201d he told the Chronicle. \u201cI felt like we weren\u2019t doing that.

Trump officials had discussed Memorial Day on May 28, and July 4, but the Pentagon prefers Veterans Day on Nov. 11 \u2014 in part because it would coincide with 100th anniversary of the victorious end of World War I and therefore be less associated with the president and politics. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone is hoping,\u201d said the military official.

Bush\u2019s 1991 parade down Constitution Avenue celebrating victory in the Persian Gulf War \u2014 presidents have avoided displays of military hardware that are more associated in the American mind with the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Square celebrations or, more recently, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s efforts to show off his Taepodong missiles. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lack of love and respect for our armed forces in the United States,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cWhat are they going to do, stand there while Donald Trump waves at them? It smacks of something you see in a totalitarian country \u2014 unless there\u2019s a genuine, earnest reason to be doing it.\u201d The White House official rejected the suggestion that some associate a military parade with strongmen, saying it would be a \u201ccelebration of the men and women who give us freedom.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of a totalitarian government,\u201d the official said.

(Doug Mills/AP)  Weaponry on the streets of Washington is not unheard of. President Truman and President Kennedy had military equipment during their inaugural parades, in 1949 and 1963 respectively, during key junctures in the Cold War, said Michael Beschloss, another presidential historian. \u201cSet against the backdrop of American history, it does seem to hark back to the harsh days of the Cold War,\u201d Beschloss said. \u201cThose parades were a counterpoint to the parades in front of Lenin\u2019s tomb at Red Square .\u2009.\u2009. One reason the Soviets had those parades was to distract the world from the fact that the Soviet military was actually much weaker than the Soviets were claiming.\u201d But generally, the United States has shied away from parading its military assets, calculating that doing so was not necessary for the world\u2019s preeminent superpower. There is no law or regulations preventing Trump from putting on a military parade, but there are plenty of potential complications that military leaders are likely to raise with the president. One worry is practical: that 70-ton tanks built for the battlefield would chew up Pennsylvania Avenue blacktop.  The military might also want to weigh in on the kind of equipment on parade. One concern is that big displays of missile launchers might evoke Pyongyang-style nationalism more than American patriotism.  [Military leaders consolidate power in Trump administration]  A parade would likely be interpreted as another stroke of nuclear gamesmanship. Tensions between North Korea and the United States have risen over the past year as Trump and Kim have taunted each other with playground nicknames and threats.  After Kim warned last month that he had a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk, Trump replied: \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger  more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d The White House official said a parade would have nothing to do with Trump\u2019s feuds with Kim, but would be designed as a broad show of strength to send a warning to all of America\u2019s adversaries.

(ED JONES/AFP/Getty Images)  Then there are the domestic pitfalls. At a time when Mattis and his top generals have been complaining about the state of military readiness and lobbying Congress for more money, pulling equipment off line for a costly parade could send the wrong signal. There are personal risks for Trump as well. Though he attended a military high school, Trump did not serve in the armed forces, avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War by claiming bone spurs. Critics have previously criticized Trump as disingenuous for basking in the military\u2019s glory. Honoring the troops without politicizing their service has long been a dilemma for presidents. President Obama\u2019s frequent focus on wounded troops fighting to resume their lives struck the wrong chord with some conservatives.  One of George W. Bush\u2019s biggest blunders as president came in 2003 when commander in chief landed on an aircraft carrier bearing a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner to claim victory in the Iraq War. Former aides say Bush would have loved a big parade but they recognized a problem: the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan never ended. Such subtleties \u2014 the U.S. is currently dropping bombs in seven countries \u2014 don\u2019t seem to have factored into Trump\u2019s calculations.  With the midterm elections approaching and Trump\u2019s approval ratings at historic lows, the lure of honoring the troops is powerful.  \u201cWho flipped the coin for the Super Bowl on Sunday?\u201d asked Peter Feaver, a former Bush White House official and professor at Duke University. \u201cIt was Medal of Honor winners. Why? The military brings us together.\u201d But Feaver also issued a warning for Trump, who is known for his excesses. \u201cA military parade,\u201d he said, \u201cis the kind of thing that can easily be overdone.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Ashley Parker", "body": "President Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser and is actively discussing potential replacements, according to five people with knowledge of the plans, preparing to deliver yet another jolt to the senior ranks of his administration.\n Trump is now comfortable with ousting McMaster, with whom he never personally gelled, but is willing to take time executing the move because he wants to ensure both that the three-star Army general is not humiliated and that there is a strong successor lined up, these people said.\n The turbulence is part of a broader potential shake-up under consideration by Trump that is likely to include senior officials at the White House, where staffers are gripped by fear and un\u00adcertainty as they await the next move from an impulsive president who enjoys stoking conflict.\n For all of the evident disorder, Trump feels emboldened, advisers said \u2014 buoyed by what he views as triumphant decisions last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and to agree to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The president is enjoying the process of assessing his team and making changes, tightening his inner circle to those he considers survivors and who respect his unconventional style, one senior White House official said.\n Just days ago, Trump used Twitter to fire Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state whom he disliked, and moved to install his close ally, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, in the job. On Wednesday, he named conservative TV analyst Larry Kudlow to replace his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who quit over trade disagreements.\n   National Security Adviser H.R.

At times, they say, they are anxious and nervous, wondering what each new headline may mean for them personally.\n But in other moments, they appear almost as characters in an absurdist farce \u2014 openly joking about whose career might end with the next presidential tweet. Some White House officials have begun betting about which staffer will be ousted next, though few, if any, have much reliable information about what is actually going on.\n Many aides were particularly unsettled by the firing of the president\u2019s longtime personal aide, John McEntee, who was marched out of the White House on Tuesday after his security clearance was abruptly revoked.\n \u201cEverybody fears the perp walk,\u201d one senior White House official said. \u201cIf it could happen to Johnny, the president\u2019s body guy, it could happen to anybody.\u201d\u00a0\n   President Trump watches as Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin speaks during a White House event in August. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n Trump recently told White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly that he wants McMaster out and asked for help weighing replacement options, according to two people familiar with their conversations.\u00a0The president has complained that McMaster is too rigid and that his briefings go on too long and seem irrelevant.\n Several candidates have emerged as possible McMaster replacements, including John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Keith Kellogg, the chief of staff of the National Security Council.\n Kellogg travels with Trump on many domestic trips, in part because the president likes his company and thinks he is fun. Bolton has met with Trump several times and often agrees with the president\u2019s instincts. Trump also thinks Bolton, who regularly praises the president on Fox News Channel, is good on television. \n Some in the White House have been reluctant to oust McMaster from his national security perch until he has a promotion to four-star rank or other comfortable landing spot. They are eager to show that someone can serve in the Trump administration without suffering severe damage to their reputation.\n  [Trump Cabinet members accused of living large at taxpayer expense] \n McMaster is not the only senior official on thin ice with the president. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has attracted Trump\u2019s ire for his spending decisions as well as for general disorder in the senior leadership of his agency. \n Others considered at risk for being fired or reprimanded include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who has generated bad headlines for ordering a $31,000 dining room set for his office; Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has been under fire for his first-class travel at taxpayer expense; and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose agency spent $139,000 to renovate his office doors.\n Meanwhile, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos drew attention this week when she stumbled through a pair of high-profile television interviews. Kelly watched DeVos\u2019s sit-down with Lesley Stahl of CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with frustration and complained about the secretary\u2019s apparent lack of preparation, officials said. Other Trump advisers mocked DeVos\u2019s shaky appearance with Savannah Guthrie on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.\n Kelly\u2019s own ouster has been widely speculated for weeks. But two top officials said Trump on Thursday morning expressed disbelief to Vice President Pence, senior advisers and Kelly himself that Kelly\u2019s name was surfacing on media watch lists because his job is secure. Trump and Kelly then laughed about it, the officials said.\n The widespread uncertainty has created power vacuums that could play to the advantage of some administration aides.\n Pompeo, who carefully cultivated a personal relationship with the president, had positioned himself as the heir apparent to Tillerson, whom Trump had long disliked.\n Similarly, Pruitt has made no secret inside the West Wing of his ambition to become attorney general should Trump decide to fire Jeff Sessions, who he frequently derides for his decision to recuse himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n White House officials have grown agitated that Pruitt and his allies are privately pushing for the EPA chief to replace Sessions, a job Pruitt has told people he wants. On Wednesday night, Kelly called Pruitt and told him the president was happy with his performance at EPA and that he did not need to worry about the Justice Department, according to two people familiar with the conversation.\n With Hope Hicks resigning her post as communications director, the internal jockeying to replace her has been especially intense between Mercedes Schlapp, who oversees the White House\u2019s long-term communications planning, and Tony Sayegh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s top communications adviser.\n Trump enjoys watching his subordinates compete for his approval. Many of the rumors are fueled by Trump himself because he complains to aides and friends about other staffers, or muses about who might make good replacements.\n \u201cI like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view,\u201d Trump said last week, rapping his fists toward one another to simulate a clash. \u201cI like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it\u2019s the best way to go.\u201d\u00a0\n Shulkin, meanwhile, is facing mounting trouble after The Washington Post first reported that he and his wife took a sightseeing-filled trip to Europe on taxpayer funds, including watching tennis at Wimbledon. Shulkin is now facing an insurrection at his own agency, with tensions so high that an armed guard stands outside his office.\n Another episode haunting Shulkin was a trip to the Invictus Games in Canada last September with first lady Melania Trump\u2019s entourage. Shulkin fought with East Wing aides over his request that his wife accompany him on the trip because he was eager for her to meet Prince Harry of Wales, who founded the games, according to multiple officials familiar with the dispute.\n The first lady\u2019s office explained there was not room on the plane for Shulkin\u2019s wife, and officials said the secretary was unpleasant during the trip.\n  [\u2018It was a different mind-set\u2019: How Trump soured on Tillerson as his top diplomat] \n Shulkin said in an email sent by a spokeswoman: \u201cThese allegations are simply untrue. I was honored to attend the Invictus Games with the First Lady and understood fully when I was told that there wasn\u2019t any more room for guests to attend.\u201d\n A leading contender to replace Shulkin is Pete Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran and Fox News personality who is a conservative voice on veterans policy, officials said.\n White House officials said there are several reasons Trump has not axed Cabinet members with whom he has grown disenchanted: the absence of consensus picks to replace them; concern that their nominated successors may not get confirmed in the divided Senate; and reluctance to pick allied senators or House members for fear of losing Republican seats in special elections, as happened last year in Alabama. \n Also, Trump has sometimes expressed confusion about what agencies and secretaries are in charge of what duties, a senior administration official said. For example, this official said, he has complained to Pruitt about regulatory processes for construction projects, although the EPA is not in charge of the regulations.\n Amid the disarray, White House staff are training Cabinet secretaries and their staffs on ethics rules and discussing new processes to prevent mistakes. William J. McGinley, who runs the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs, and Stefan C. Passantino, a deputy White House counsel, have met individually and in groups with Carson, Pruitt, Shulkin, Zinke and other Cabinet secretaries to impress upon them the importance of changing behavior.\n Simply following the letter of the law is not enough, administration officials said. Trump and Kelly demand that their Cabinet secretaries be mindful of political optics and the bad headlines that come with misbehavior.\n \u201cEven if the legal guys sign off on it,\u201d one official said, \u201cyou still step back and say, \u2018Does this make sense optically?\u2019\u200a\u201d\n   \nGreg Jaffe contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Ruth Marcus", "body": "Back in April 2016, when the notion of Donald Trump in the White House still seemed fanciful, The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Bob Woodward sat down with Trump, and Costa, at one point, raised the subject of the nondisclosure agreements for employees of which the candidate was so fond.\n Costa: \u201cOne thing I always wondered, are you going to make employees of the federal government sign nondisclosure agreements?\u201d \n Trump: \u201cI think they should. .\u2009.\u2009. And I don\u2019t know, there could be some kind of a law that you can\u2019t do this. But when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don\u2019t like that. I mean, I\u2019ll be honest. And people would say, oh, that\u2019s terrible, you\u2019re taking away his right to free speech. Well, he\u2019s going in.\u201d \n Reader, it happened. In the early months of the administration, at the behest of now-President Trump, who was furious over leaks from within the White House, senior White House staff members were asked to, and did, sign nondisclosure agreements vowing not to reveal confidential information and exposing them to damages for any violation. Some balked at first but, pressed by then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, ultimately complied, concluding that the agreements would likely not be enforceable in any event.\n The nondisclosure agreements, said a person who signed the document, \u201cwere meant to be very similar to the ones that some of us signed during the campaign and during the transition. I remember the president saying, \u2018Has everybody signed a confidentiality agreement like they did during the campaign or we had at Trump Tower?\u2019\u2009\u201d\n At that time, in February or March of 2017, the source said, \u201cThere was lots of leaking, things that just weren\u2019t true, and a lot of things that were true and should have remained confidential. The president\u2019s point was that they [staff] would think twice about that if they were on the hook for some serious damages.\u201d\n Moreover, said the source, this confidentiality pledge would extend not only after an aide\u2019s White House service but also beyond the Trump presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be constrained by the four years or eight years he\u2019s president \u2014 or the four months or eight months somebody works there. It is meant to survive that.\u201d\n This is extraordinary. Every president inveighs against leakers and bemoans the kiss-and-tell books; no president, to my knowledge, has attempted to impose such a pledge. And while White House staffers have various confidentiality obligations \u2014 maintaining the secrecy of classified information or attorney-client privilege, for instance \u2014 the notion of imposing a side agreement, supposedly enforceable even after the president leaves office, is not only oppressive but constitutionally repugnant. \n Unlike employees of private enterprises such as the Trump Organization or Trump campaign, White House aides have First Amendment rights when it comes to their employer, the federal government. If you have a leaker on your staff, the cure is firing, not suing.\n \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d said attorney Debra Katz, who has represented numerous government whistleblowers and negotiated nondisclosure agreements. \u201cThe idea of having some kind of economic penalty is an outrageous effort to limit and chill speech. Once again, this president believes employees owe him a personal duty of loyalty, when their duty of loyalty is to the institution.\u201d\n I haven\u2019t been able to lay hands on the final agreement, but I do have a copy of a draft, and it is a doozy. It would expose violators to penalties of $10 million, payable to the federal government, for each and any unauthorized revelation of \u201cconfidential\u201d information, defined as \u201call nonpublic information I learn of or gain access to in the course of my official duties in the service of the United States Government on White House staff,\u201d including \u201ccommunications .\u2009.\u2009. with members of the press\u201d and \u201cwith employees of federal, state, and local governments.\u201d The $10 million figure, I suspect, was watered down in the final version, because the people to whom I have spoken do not remember that jaw-dropping sum.\n It would prohibit revelation of this confidential information in any form \u2014 including, get this, \u201cthe publication of works of fiction that contain any mention of the operations of the White House, federal agencies, foreign governments, or other entities interacting with the United States Government that is based on confidential information.\u201d\n As outlined in the document, this restriction would cover Trump aides not only during their White House service but also \u201cat all times thereafter.\u201d\n The document: \u201cI understand that the United States Government or, upon completion of the term(s) of Mr. Donald J. Trump, an authorized representative of Mr. Trump, may seek any remedy available to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement.\u201d\n This is so ridiculously excessive, so laughably unconstitutional, that I doubted, when it first came my way, that anything like it was ever implemented \u2014 only to do some reporting and learn otherwise.\n Ordinarily I would insert a response from the White House, but this is no ordinary White House: It dealt with my numerous requests for comment, to the press office and the counsel\u2019s office, with complete silence.\n The draft made its way to me after I wrote a column observing that Trump\u2019s silence-buying and silence-compelling days were done. Now we know that he imported these bullying tactics into the White House. Which raises the obvious question: Why is he so consistently frantic to ensure that no one knows what goes on behind closed doors?\n  Read more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Craig Timberg", "body": "LONDON \u2014 Conservative strategist Stephen K. Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s early efforts to collect troves of Facebook data as part of an ambitious program to build detailed profiles of millions of American voters, a former employee of the data-science firm said Tuesday.\n The 2014 effort was part of a high-tech form of voter persuasion touted by the company, which under Bannon identified and tested the power of anti-establishment messages that later would emerge as central themes in President Trump\u2019s campaign speeches, according to Chris Wylie, who left the company at the end of that year.\n Among the messages tested were \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and \u201cdeep state,\u201d he said.\n Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, is now facing questions about alleged unethical practices, including charges that the firm improperly handled the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. On Tuesday, the company\u2019s board announced that it was suspending its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after British television released secret recordings that appeared to show him talking about entrapping political opponents.\n More than three years before he served as Trump\u2019s chief political strategist, Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the financial backing of the wealthy Mercer family as part of a broader effort to create a populist power base. Earlier this year, the Mercers cut ties with Bannon after he was quoted making incendiary comments about Trump and his family.\n In an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post at his lawyer\u2019s London office, Wylie said that Bannon \u2014 while he was a top executive at Cambridge Analytica and head of Breitbart News \u2014 was deeply involved in the company\u2019s strategy and approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014.\n \u201cWe had to get Bannon to approve everything at this point. Bannon was Alexander Nix\u2019s boss,\u201d said Wylie, who was Cambridge Analytica\u2019s research director. \u201cAlexander Nix didn\u2019t have the authority to spend that much money without approval.\u201d\n Bannon, who served on the company\u2019s board, did not respond to a request for comment. He served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica from June 2014 to August 2016, when he became chief executive of Trump\u2019s campaign, according to his publicly filed financial disclosure. In 2017, he joined Trump in the White House as his chief strategist.\n Bannon received more than $125,000 in consulting fees from Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and owned \u201cmembership units\u201d in the company worth between $1 million and $5 million, according to his financial disclosure.\n  \n Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment about Bannon\u2019s role.\u00a0\n  [Cambridge Analytica whistleblower to testify to House Democrats on Facebook data operation] \n It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the data, which allegedly was collected through an app that was portrayed as a tool for psychological research but was then transferred to the company.\n Facebook has said that information was improperly shared and that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica officials said that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.\n Wylie said that both Bannon and Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert Mercer, financed the company, participated in conference calls in 2014 in which plans to collect Facebook data were discussed, although Wylie acknowledged that it was not clear they knew the details of how the collection took place.\n Bannon \u201capproved the data-collection scheme we were proposing,\u201d Wylie said.\n The Mercers did not respond to a request for comment.\n The data and analyses that Cambridge Analytica generated in this time provided discoveries that would later form the emotionally charged core of Trump\u2019s presidential platform, said Wylie, whose disclosures in news reports over the past several days have rocked both his onetime employer and Facebook.\n \u201cTrump wasn\u2019t in our consciousness at that moment; this was well before he became a thing,\u201d Wylie said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a client or anything.\u201d\n The year before Trump announced his presidential bid, the data firm already had found a high level of alienation among young, white Americans with a conservative bent.\n In focus groups arranged to test messages for the 2014 midterms, these voters responded to calls for building a new wall to block the entry of illegal immigrants, to reforms intended the \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington\u2019s entrenched political community and to thinly veiled forms of racism toward African Americans called \u201crace realism,\u201d he recounted.\n The firm also tested views of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n \u201cThe only foreign thing we tested was Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out, there\u2019s a lot of Americans who really like this idea of a really strong authoritarian leader and people were quite defensive in focus groups of Putin\u2019s invasion of Crimea.\u201d\n The controversy over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data collection erupted in recent days amid news reports that an app created by a Cambridge University psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, accessed extensive personal data of 50 million Facebook users. The app, called thisisyourdigitallife, was downloaded by 270,000 users. Facebook\u2019s policy, which has since changed, allowed Kogan to also collect data \u2014including names, home towns, religious affiliations and likes \u2014 on all of the Facebook\u00a0\u201cfriends\u201d of those users. Kogan shared that data with Cambridge Analytica for its growing database on American voters.\n Facebook on Friday banned the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie for improperly sharing that data.\n The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook to determine whether the social media platform violated a 2011 consent decree governing its privacy policies when it allowed the data collection. And Wylie plans to testify to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as part of their investigation of Russian interference in the election, including possible ties to the Trump campaign.\n Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News aired a video Tuesday in which Nix was shown boasting about his work for Trump. He seemed to highlight his firm\u2019s secrecy, at one point stressing the need to set up a special email account that self-destructs all messages so that \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence, there\u2019s no paper trail, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u00a0\n The company said in a statement that Nix\u2019s comments \u201cdo not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\u201d\u00a0\n Nix could not be reached for comment.\n Cambridge Analytica was set up as a U.S. affiliate of British-based SCL Group, which had a wide range of governmental clients globally, in addition to its political work.\n Wylie said that Bannon and Nix first met in 2013, the same year that Wylie \u2014 a young data whiz with some political experience in Britain and Canada \u2014 was working for SCL Group. Bannon and Wylie met soon after and hit it off in conversations about culture, elections and how to spread ideas using technology.\n  [The Mercers and Stephen Bannon: How a populist power base was funded and built] \n Bannon, Wylie, Nix, Rebekah Mercer and Robert Mercer met in Rebekah Mercer\u2019s Manhattan apartment in the fall of 2013, striking a deal in which Robert Mercer would fund the creation of Cambridge Analytica with $10 million, with the hope of shaping the congressional elections a year later, according to Wylie. Robert Mercer, in particular, seemed transfixed by the group\u2019s plans to harness and analyze data, he recalled.\n The Mercers were keen to create a U.S.-based business to avoid bad optics and violating U.S. campaign finance rules, Wylie said. \u201cThey wanted to create an American brand,\u201d he said.\n The young company struggled to quickly deliver on its promises, Wiley said. Widely available information from commercial data brokers provided people\u2019s names, addresses, shopping habits and more, but failed to distinguish on more fine-grained matters of personality that might affect political views.\n Cambridge Analytica initially worked for 2016 Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who was backed by the Mercers. The Trump campaign had rejected early overtures to hire Cambridge Analytica, and Trump himself said in May 2016 that he \u201calways felt\u201d that the use of voter data was \u201coverrated.\u201d\u00a0\n After Cruz faded, the Mercers switched their allegiance to Trump and pitched their services to Trump\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale. The company\u2019s hiring was approved by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was informally helping to manage the campaign with a focus on digital strategy.\u00a0\n Kushner said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Forbes magazine that the campaign \u201cfound that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. .\u2009.\u2009.We brought in Cambridge Analytica.\u201d Kushner said he \u201cbuilt\u201d a data hub for the campaign \u201cwhich nobody knew about, until towards the end.\u201d\u00a0\n Kushner\u2019s spokesman and lawyer both declined to comment Tuesday.\u00a0\n Two weeks before Election Day, Nix\u00a0told a Post reporter\u00a0at the company\u2019s New York City office that his company could \u201cdetermine the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.\u201d\u00a0\n The claim was widely questioned, and the Trump campaign later said that it didn\u2019t rely on psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica. Instead, the campaign said that it used a variety of other digital information to identify probable supporters.\u00a0\n Parscale said in a Post interview in October 2016 that he had not \u201copened the hood\u201d on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s methodology, and said he got much of his data from the Republican National Committee. Parscale declined to comment Tuesday. He has previously said that the Trump campaign did not use any psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica.\u00a0\n Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL Group, has an ongoing contract with the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center. The company was paid almost $500,000 to interview people overseas to understand the mind-set of Islamist militants as part of an effort to counter their online propaganda and block recruits.\n Heather Nauert, the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Tuesday that the contract was signed in November 2016, under the Obama administration, and has not expired yet. In public records, the contract is dated in February 2017, and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear.

Today, I feel that Fox is assaulting our constitutional order and rule of law, while fostering corrosive and unjustified paranoia among viewers. Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association. Now I am ashamed.\u201d\n He added: \u201cWhen prime-time hosts \u2014 who have never served our country in any capacity \u2014 dismiss facts and empirical reality to launch profoundly dishonest attacks on the FBI, the Justice Department, the courts, the intelligence community (in which I served) and, not least, a model public servant and genuine war hero such as Robert Mueller \u2014 all the while scaremongering with lurid warnings of \u2018deep-state\u2019 machinations \u2014 I cannot be part of the same organization, even at a remove. To me, Fox News is now wittingly harming our system of government for profit.\u201d\n In an interview, Peters, 65, who lives in Warrenton, Va., said he never intended his email to become public and that he wasn\u2019t trying to \u201cgrandstand\u201d about his differences with the network, which he joined as a contributor in 2008. But he offered no apologies.\n Instead, he said he wrote the email because Fox\u2019s hosts \u2014 whom he did not single out by name \u2014 are \u201churting the country.\u201d\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It may sound corny to say I took an oath as an officer, but it\u2019s true. I just feel for their selfish reasons, they\u2019re doing damage to the country.\u201d\n In a statement in reply to Peters, Fox said, \u201cRalph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he\u2019s choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention. We are extremely proud of our top-rated prime-time hosts and all of our opinion programing.\u201d\n To which Peters replied: \u201cIf I\u2019m seeking attention why the [expletive] did I just quit Fox and the chance to speak to millions every day?\u201d\n Peters appeared frequently on both Fox News and its sister channel, Fox Business Network, over the past decade to discuss military topics and foreign affairs, including U.S.-Russia relations. He estimates that he averaged more than 200 appearances a year during the past five years.\n During that time, he said, Fox\u2019s producers never instructed him what to say. But in the past year, as questions arose about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, he said Fox wouldn\u2019t let him engage on the topic, in which he holds considerable expertise as a former intelligence officer.\n In recent months, Peters said he \u201cedged\u201d toward criticizing Trump on the air, but \u201cas a matter of courtesy,\u201d he didn\u2019t let loose. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the king\u2019s shilling, you do the king\u2019s service,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t embarrass the host on the air. I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n By contrast, Peters was frequently blunt in his comments about the Obama administration\u2019s relations with Russia. In 2014, he said that President Obama got \u201cdate raped\u201d in his efforts to negotiate with Putin. On Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program in late 2015, Peters called Obama\u2019s Syria strategy \u201cinept, ineffective and cowardly,\u201d and described Obama as a \u201cterrified little man in a great big job he can\u2019t do.\u201d\n He apparently went too far a few weeks later on Fox Business Network when he called Obama \u201ca total pussy \u201d for his administration\u2019s counterterrorism policies, earning a two-week suspension. Peters apologized for his language but not the criticism, saying \u201cmy choice of words was incorrect, but my sentiment, I think, is shared by many.\u201d\n Peters retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 1998 after serving for 22 years.

Trump sought to block the legal action, but New York Supreme Court Judge Jennifer G.

Her lawsuit followed on the heels of a suit filed by Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who said she was paid to keep quiet about her own alleged affair with Trump long before he took office.\n The Zervos ruling, along with the cases filed by McDougal and Daniels, added to the mounting legal headaches facing Trump regarding his history with women.

(Reuters) \n \n Trump has repeatedly said that all of the women who accused him of touching them inappropriately were lying \u2014 a sentiment his White House reiterated as questions resurfaced about these allegations. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n Though Trump insisted during the campaign he had proof these women were all lying and vowed to sue them, no lawsuits materialized. Instead, the only court action to stem from these allegations has been Zervos\u2019s claim that he defamed her and his other accusers by branding them liars.\n Trump\u2019s attorneys argued that the president cannot be sued in state court and also said the comments he made were political opinion and, as a result, \u201csquarely protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n  \n Marc Kasowitz, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the ruling Tuesday.\n Mariann Meier Wang, co-counsel for Zervos with women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, wrote in an email: \u201cThe rule of law and sound reason have prevailed today. We are grateful for the opportunity to prove that the Defendant falsely branded Ms. Zervos a phony for telling the truth about his unwanted sexual groping.\u201d\n In an email, Allred wrote: \u201cI am very happy.\u201d\n At least a dozen women aired complaints about past sexual misconduct by Trump before the election, although Zervos is the only one to bring court action.

It is settled that the President of the United States has no immunity and is \u2018subject to the laws\u2019 for purely private acts.\u201d\n Schecter referred to a court case involving Clinton and Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who accused Clinton of sexual harassing her while he was serving as the state\u2019s governor. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Jones\u2019s lawsuit against Clinton could proceed, arguing that sitting presidents could be sued for private actions that predated their time in office; Trump\u2019s attorneys have argued that case applied to federal litigation and did not apply in state courts.\n In her ruling, Schecter also dismissed a request that the case be stayed for the duration of Trump\u2019s time in office, saying that such \u201ca lengthy and categorical stay is not justified\u201d just because a president can be called away to attend to a crisis. If that happens, Schecter wrote, Trump\u2019s federal responsibilities would be given priority.\n Schecter wrote that Trump\u2019s comments calling Zervos a liar \u201ccannot be characterized simply as opinion, heated rhetoric or hyperbole.\u201d\n Maria Glover, a law professor at Georgetown University, said that the decision will almost certainly go to appeal.\n \u201cThe issue of whether a president can have rights and liabilities adjudicated in state court is likely to reach the highest court in New York, in Albany,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom there, it could \u2014 and perhaps likely will \u2014 be appealed to the Supreme Court. This lengthy set of appeals means that we won\u2019t be getting Trump\u2019s deposition quite so fast.\u201d\n Even as they considered an appeal, lawyers representing Trump also had to monitor another lawsuit \u2014 this one filed in early March in Los Angeles Superior Court by Daniels, who has said Trump sought to silence her shortly before the 2016 election. The $130,000 hush agreement was intended to prevent her from speaking out about an alleged affair that began, Daniels said, at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006.\n    Daniels shared her story with InTouch magazine in 2011, but the interview was not published until the Wall Street Journal reported on the affair and payout earlier this year. She took a polygraph examination as part of that interview process, the magazine\u2019s editorial director said.\n A court document provided to The Post on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Daniels, describes the polygraph examination, which concluded that Daniels was being \u201ctruthful\u201d about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n Zervos first made public her claims against Trump at an October 2016 news conference as one of a parade of women who accused him of misconduct after the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording capturing the future president boasting in graphic language about groping women. At a presidential debate, Trump denied ever doing the things he described in the recording, which some of his accusers said prompted them to come forward.\n Zervos has accused Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts while she was pursuing a job at his company, charges he said were untrue.\n In January 2017, Zervos filed a suit in New York State Supreme Court against Trump, arguing that Trump defamed her by denying her account and calling his accusers \u201cliars.\u201d Attorneys for Trump pushed back on multiple fronts, arguing that the suit was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and was built around \u201callegations of events that never occurred.\u201d\n  \nBeth Reinhard contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "John Wagner", "body": "President Trump talks during a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in the Oval Office at the White House on Tuesday.

Mueller III, Trump officials have sought to paint the 30-year old energy consultant as a low level volunteer whose outreach to Russia was not authorized by the campaign \u2014 and in some cases, was actively discouraged.\n But emails described to The Washington Post, which are among thousands of documents turned over to investigators examining Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign, show that Papadopoulos had more extensive contact with key Trump campaign and presidential transition officials than has been publicly acknowledged. \n Among those who communicated with Papadopoulos were senior campaign figures such as chief executive Stephen K. Bannon and adviser Michael Flynn, who corresponded with him about his efforts to broker ties between Trump and top foreign officials, the emails show.\n As late as December 2016, as President-elect Trump was preparing to take office, Papadopoulos tried to serve as a conduit for the defense minister of Greece, transmitting what he said was a proposal for a strategic alliance from the Russian-allied Greek official that was reviewed by both Bannon and Flynn, then in line to be national security adviser.\n  [\u2018Anyone .\u2009.\u2009. with a pulse\u2019: How a Russia-friendly adviser found his way into the Trump campaign] \n The previously undisclosed emails paint a portrait of a young researcher who demonstrated an early and intense interest in joining Trump\u2019s presidential bid, beginning in July 2015, just weeks after the celebrity mogul announced his candidacy \u2014 eight months before his name first publicly surfaced. \n Thomas Breen, an attorney for Papadopoulos, declined to comment. A White House spokesman declined to comment.\n In a tweet after Papadopoulos pleaded guilty, President Trump wrote that \u201cfew people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.\u201d Another Trump campaign staffer dismissed Papadopoulos as a mere \u201ccoffee boy\u201d during the campaign.\n Papadopoulos is the only Trump associate known to have told prosecutors that he had advance warning the Russians held emails that could be damaging to Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. A London-based professor told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, according to his plea agreement.\n It is not known if Papadopoulos relayed that information to other campaign officials. \n The young aide was not a central player in Trump\u2019s inner circle. At times, he appeared as a supplicant to his superiors on the campaign, who occasionally ignored his notes or appeared to rebuff him, the emails show. Shortly after joining the campaign, Papadopoulos was rebuked by campaign officials for giving an unauthorized interview to a British newspaper, The Post previously reported.\n But the documents also indicate that amid Papadopoulos\u2019s advocacy of closer ties to Russia, he retained access to top officials \u2014 even after Trump\u2019s victory. \n  [For \u2018low level volunteer,\u2019 Papadopoulos sought high profile as Trump adviser] \n A former intern and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute, Papadopoulos was living in London when the 2016 presidential race kicked off. Less than a decade out of college, he had never worked for a campaign before.\n In July 2015, Papadopoulos contacted then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski about his interest in joining Trump\u2019s campaign, according to an email he sent the following month to deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner, now executive director of Trump\u2019s reelection effort.\n \u201cThe reason for my message is because I have been in touch with Mr. Corey Lewandowski since early last month about obtaining an advisory role to Mr. Trump on matters of energy security and U.S. policy in the Eastern Mediteranean,\u201d he wrote to Glassner. \n He corresponded for months with both Lewandowski and Glassner, according to the emails. The two campaign officials responded politely, but initially told him no job was available.\n Glassner and Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment.\n In December 2015, Papadopoulos went to work for the campaign of neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who was then challenging Trump for the GOP nomination.\n After several months, Papadopoulos reached out again to the Trump campaign to inform them he would be leaving the flagging Carson campaign. \n \u201cI wanted to let you know that I stopped working as Ben Carson\u2019s principle foreign policy adviser. I\u2019d be interested in getting on board with the Trump team. Is the team looking to expand?\u201d Papadopoulos wrote to Glassner early in March 2016. \n At the time, Trump was surging in the polls, and the real estate developer was under increasing pressure to name foreign policy advisers to his team.\n Glassner quickly connected Papadopouloswith campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis.\n Clovis and Papadopoulos spoke by phone four days later, a conversation in which Clovis said improving relations with Russia was a top campaign foreign policy goal, according to what Papadopoulos later told prosecutors. Clovis, who did not respond to a request for comment, has previously denied that account.\n Later that month, Trump himself named Papadopoulos among a list of five people advising his campaign on foreign policy during a meeting with The Washington Post editorial board. \u201cExcellent guy,\u201d the candidate said.\n At the end of March, Papadopoulos attended a meeting of Trump\u2019s newly named national security advisory group at Trump\u2019s not-yet-opened hotel in Washington. After introducing himself, the young adviser announced that he could organize a meeting between Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and Trump, according to court documents. \n The following month, he intensified his outreach to new Russian contacts he had met through the London professor, Joseph Mifsud. They included a woman who had been introduced to him as a Putin relative and Ivan Timofeev, a director of a Moscow think tank. Papadopoulos highlighted these contacts in numerous emails to campaign officials disclosed by prosecutors and described previously to the Post.\n  In May, Papadopoulos forwarded to campaign officials a note he received from Timofeev informing him that Russian foreign ministry officials were open to a Trump visit. That idea was batted down by campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who emailed his associate Rick Gates: \u201cWe need to communicate that DT is not doing these trips.\u201d \n Still, Papadopoulos persisted and was encouraged by Clovis in August to pursue meetings on his own \u201cif feasible,\u201d according to court documents. A lawyer for Clovis has said he was merely being polite and did not authorize Papadopoulos to represent the campaign abroad.\n  That spring, Papadopoulos spoke to a group of researchers in Israel, where he announced that Trump believed Putin was a \u201cresponsible actor and potential partner,\u201d according to The Jerusalem Post.\n Several months later, Papadopoulos alerted the campaign that he had an opportunity to speak to the Russian news outlet Interfax.\n \u201cReceived a request from Interfax Russian News Agency with Ksenia Baygarova on U.S.-Russia ties under a President Trump. What do you think?\u201d he wrote to Lanza on September 9, 2016. \u201cIf the campaign wants me to do it, can answer similar to the answers I gave in April while in Israel.\u201d\n Lanza gave the go-ahead, citing the conflict in Syria as a reason to work the Russians. Papadopoulos then offered to send the campaign a copy of the interview after it was published.\n \u201cYou\u2019re the best. Thank you!\u201d Lanza responded.\n Lanza declined to comment.\n In the interview, published Sept. 30, 2016, Papadopoulos told the Russian media outlet that Trump had been \u201copen about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in U.S.-Russia ties,\u201d specifically citing the need for cooperation in Syria.\n According to prosecutors, Papadopoulos also sent the Interfax story to Mifsud after its publication.\n Baygarova, the Interfax reporter who interviewed Papadopoulos, said in an email to The Post that she reached out to Papadopoulos after being assigned to interview a representative of both presidential campaigns. She said she sent messages to each person on a list of Trump foreign policy advisers.

There was a good chemistry there,\u201d Trump told Fox Business\u2019 Lou Dobbs the next day.\n William Burck, an attorney for Bannon, declined to comment.\n Papadopoulos continued to position himself as a go-between for Trump\u2019s top staff and key foreign officials after Trump\u2019s victory.\n In December 2016, Papadopoulos alerted Bannon that he had recently been in contact with Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, a pro-Russian Greek nationalist who has met with Putin. \n \u201cThey want to sign a government-to-government agreement with the USA for all rights to all energy fields offshore, strategic foothold in the Mediterranean and Balkans,\u201d Papadopoulos wrote in an email.\n Bannon forwarded the message to Flynn and Flynn\u2019s deputy, KT McFarland.\n \u201cWill work this one,\u201d Flynn responded.\n It is not clear if Flynn pursued the Greek offer. In late December, Flynn wrote in an email to Papadopoulos that he believed the young adviser\u2019s suggestions presented \u201cgreat opportunities.\u201d\n \u201cWe will examine these and determine if this is something we should take on early. Stay in touch and, at some point, we should get together.\u201d\n He signed the email, \u201cMike.\u201d\n Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, declined to comment. An attorney for McFarland did not respond to a request for comment.\n In an interview, Kammenos said he did not seek Papadopoulos\u2019s help in reaching Trump\u2019s aides. He said that before the election, Papadopoulos sent him an energy proposal that he thought had merit.\n But by Trump\u2019s election, he said he had concluded Papadopoulos was not a major figure in Trump\u2019s world and established his own contact with the presidential transition.\n Kammenos added: \u201cI think Mr. Papadopoulos is a very young person with dreams.\u201d\n tom.hamburger@washpost.com\n  \nEllen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Philip Rucker", "body": "President Trump fired off angry tweets Sunday morning railing against the Justice Department special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation and attacking the integrity of former FBI director James B.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n \n One hundred years ago this week, the founder of modern American conservatism was born into poverty in Plymouth, Michigan. Russell Kirk\u2019s \u201cThe Conservative Mind,\u201d published in 1953, laid the foundations of a modern conservative movement that dominated the second half of the American Century. But 65 years later, Kirk\u2019s classic work reads instead as a damning indictment against the very movement he helped launch.\n The central thesis of Kirk\u2019s philosophy was that \u201cthe conservative abhors all forms of ideology\u201c and subscribes to principles \u201carrived at by convention and compromise\u201d instead of \u201cfanatic ideological dogmata.\u201c Six decades of Republican overreach and corrosive causes have instead led to the rise of Donald Trump and a foreign policy run by John Bolton, an economy guided by Larry Kudlow and a legal team led by conspiracy theorist Joseph DiGenova.\n Bolton\u2019s elevation to the position of national security adviser is a fitting coda for a movement whose adherents spent decades throwing themselves on an endless array of ideological barricades while vilifying opponents whose responses to Soviet Russia or Islamic fundamentalism were deemed insufficiently harsh. Bolton\u2019s selection will not disappoint these same GOP militants whom Kirk battled until his death in 1994. Trump\u2019s third national security advisor in 14 months has called for the preemptive bombing of both North Korea and Iran, while defending his role in the worst U.S. foreign policy disaster since Vietnam. Of America\u2019s military misadventure in Iraq, Bolton pleads innocence on all counts while shamelessly calling Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 decision to bring American troops home \u201cthe worst decision\u201d made in that debacle.\n In the forward to the seventh edition of \u201cThe Conservative Mind,\u201d Kirk predicted with precision the rise of political players like Bolton and Trump and foresaw a time when America would \u201cfall into the hands of merciless ideologues or squalid oligarchs.\u201d He also repeated Swedish philosopher Tage Lindbom\u2019s warning of the bleak harvest coming from a \u201csecularized generation for which material existence is everything and spiritual life is nothing.\u201d\n This was the predictable outcome of my Republican Party aligning its interests with the most cynical political operators of our time. The Atwaters, Manaforts, Gingriches and Roves leveraged a weaponized media culture that reduced politics to a secularized religion and consolidated political power and material wealth in the hands of its richest donors.\n Yes, the Soviet Union is in the dustbin of history, Osama bin Laden is dead and ISIS is \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 on its heels. But the inner chaos that Kirk warned of so many years ago runs rampant in a country dominated by the bloated presence of a man who embraces dictators, vilifies the free press, corrupts religious leaders, absolves white supremacists, degrades women and continues a life\u2019s work defined by little more than the amoral pursuit of material wealth.\n Remarkably, order could be pulled from this culturally calamitous crisis if\u00a0just two GOP senators had the moral courage to deprive Donald Trump of a ruling majority until he agreed to bring to heel his most destructive instincts.

We are on the cusp of change of a magnitude not seen since the 1960s, at least, and not just on guns but on immigration, race, health care, diplomacy, the role of government and America\u2019s place in the world.\n This is a paradox of the Trump era, which every day brings more calamity: a trade war, dramatic debt expansion during an economic boom, tax cuts that expand the gap between rich and poor, the arrival of a dangerous ideologue as national security adviser, a president aligning himself with a hostile foreign power trying to disrupt U.S. democracy with an assist from America\u2019s own Facebook empire, a sprawling criminal inquiry of top presidential advisers, a leader turning Americans against each other by race, gender and religion and attacking the pillars of democratic governance.\n And yet it could not be clearer that the power structure that created this mess is on its way out. Millennials will sometime next year become the largest living generation, and Generation Z is poised to be even larger. Together, they will resoundingly repudiate the status quo. Just 27\u2007percent of millennials approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, according to the Pew Research Center, which says the generational gap in political views is wider than at any point since Pew began examining it in the early 1990s.\n This is related to rapidly changing racial demographics (millennials are more than 40 percent nonwhite, Gen Z even more so), but, even controlling for racial diversity, Pew reported in a study this month that young Americans are markedly more liberal than older cohorts.\n Seventy-nine percent of millennials say immigrants strengthen America (vs. 47 percent of the oldest, Silent generation). Seventy-seven percent of millennials say good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace (vs. 43 percent of the Silent). There are similar gaps in views of free trade, universal health care, welfare and racial discrimination, and liberal millennials outnumber conservative millennials 57 percent to 12 percent; among the oldest generation it\u2019s almost the reverse: 28 percent liberal to 40 percent conservative.\n The kids might even save us from Facebook, a creation of millennials that is now being turned into an anti-democratic weapon. The research firm eMarketer found that the number of 12-\u2007to 17-year-old American users of Facebook declined 9.9 percent in 2017, part of a drop of 2.8 million U.S. users of Facebook under age 25. The firm expects Facebook to shed another 2.1 million this year, as young people switch to other platforms.\n On gun control, there is broad and growing support across generations. But the issue of mass shootings is the \u201cdefining fear\u201d for the youngest Americans, according to an attempt by USA Today and Ipsos to poll 13- to 24-year-olds. The survey, released this  week, found that gun violence eclipses all other worries, including terrorism, racism, college affordability and climate change. Nearly one-fifth don\u2019t feel safe at school.\n This will change. The zeitgeist is already changing, as seen in recent actions by Delta Air Lines, Hertz, MetLife, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Walmart, Citigroup and others.

Among them: evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts, evidence of work displayed at artistic exhibitions and evidence of original contributions to a field.\n  \u201cWhat did she submit?\u201d asked David Leopold, an immigration lawyer and a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThere are a lot of questions about how she procured entry into the United States.\u201d \n The process of deciding who meets the \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d standard is subjective, said Sarah Pierce, an immigration expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

Aides said it was hypocritical for Democrats, after months of complaining about the $1.5 trillion deficit impact of the tax bill, to take two-thirds of that cost and devote it to infrastructure.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) scoffed at the proposal in floor remarks Wednesday.\n \u201cRepeal all these bonuses, pay raises, new jobs, and new investments? Talk about a nonstarter,\u201d he said.\n Before Trump\u2019s election, Schumer and many other Democrats had previously endorsed infrastructure plans that would have raised funds by forcing American companies to move their overseas profits back to the United States and taxing them at a discounted rate. But Republicans used that maneuver, known as repatriation, to help offset the cost of their tax cuts.\n That has left little choice, Schumer said, to finance a big infrastructure plan. Democratic leaders, like their Republican counterparts, have rejected one obvious alternative: raising the federal gasoline tax for the first time since 1993.\n \u201cWe\u2019d rather have the very wealthy and corporations pay for it than average folks who drive,\u201d he said.\n  Read more at PowerPost", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Sari Horwitz", "body": "Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has gathered evidence that a secret meeting in Seychelles just before the inauguration of Donald Trump was an effort to establish a back channel between the incoming administration and the Kremlin \u2014 apparently contradicting statements made to lawmakers by one of its participants, according to people familiar with the matter.\n In January 2017, Erik Prince, the founder of the private security company Blackwater, met with a Russian official close to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and later described the meeting to congressional investigators as a chance encounter that was not a planned discussion of U.S.-Russia relations.\n A witness cooperating with Mueller has told investigators the meeting was set up in advance so that a representative of the Trump transition could meet with an emissary from Moscow to discuss future relations between the countries, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n George Nader, a Lebanese American businessman who helped organize and attended the Seychelles meeting, has testified on the matter before a grand jury gathering evidence about discussions between the Trump transition team and emissaries of the Kremlin, as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election.\n Nader began cooperating with Mueller after he arrived at Dulles International Airport in mid-January and was stopped, served with a subpoena and questioned by the FBI, these people said. He has met numerous times with investigators.\n  [Businessman cooperating with Mueller probe] \n Last year, Prince told lawmakers \u2014 and the news media \u2014 that his Seychelles meeting with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of a Russian government-controlled wealth fund, was an unplanned, unimportant encounter that came about by chance because he happened to be at a luxury hotel in the Indian Ocean island nation with officials from the United Arab Emirates.\n In his statements, Prince has specifically denied reporting by The Washington Post that said the Seychelles meeting, which took place about a week before Trump\u2019s inauguration, was described by U.S., European and Arab officials as part of an effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and the incoming administration.\n Prince told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that he did not plan to meet Dmitriev in Seychelles but that once he was there discussing possible business deals with UAE officials, they unexpectedly suggested that he visit the hotel bar and meet Dmitriev.\n \u201cAt the end, one of the entourage says, \u2018Hey, by the way, there\u2019s this Russian guy that we\u2019ve dealt with in the past. He\u2019s here also to see someone from the Emirati delegation. And you should meet him, he\u2019d be an interesting guy for you to know, since you\u2019re doing a lot in the oil and gas and mineral space,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Prince told lawmakers.\n The two men, he said, spoke for no more than 30\u00a0minutes, or about the time it took him to drink a beer.\n \u201cWe chatted on topics ranging from oil and commodity prices to how much his country wished for resumption of normal trade relations with the USA,\u201d Prince told lawmakers. \u201cI remember telling him that if Franklin Roosevelt could work with Joseph Stalin to defeat Nazi fascism, then certainly Donald Trump could work with Vladi\u00admir Putin to defeat Islamic fascism.\u201d\n Prince said he went to Seychelles as a private businessman, not as an official or unofficial emissary of the Trump transition team. During the congressional interview, which became testy at times as Democratic lawmakers pressed him to be more specific in his answers, Prince repeatedly complained that he had reason to believe U.S. intelligence agencies were leaking information about his activities.\n Asked to comment on assertions that new evidence appears to contradict Prince\u2019s description of the Seychelles meeting, a spokesman for Prince referred to his previous statements to the committee and declined further comment.\n A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.\n  [Blackwater founder held secret meeting in Seychelles] \n Prince has known Nader for years and once hired him to try to generate business from the Iraqi government in the years after the U.S.-led invasion of that country. That effort was not successful, according to Prince\u2019s statements in a subsequent deposition.\n Nader, according to current and former officials, was known to Trump transition and administration officials as someone with political connections in the Middle East who could help navigate the tricky diplomacy of the region.\n Nader had also attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between senior Trump advisers and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n While Mueller is probing the circumstances of the Seychelles meeting, he is also more broadly examining apparent efforts by the Trump transition team to create a back channel for secret talks between the new administration and the Kremlin. Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, whether any Americans assisted in such efforts, and any other matters that arise in the course of his probe.\n Investigators now suspect that the Seychelles meeting may have been one of the first efforts to establish such a line of communications between the two governments, these people said. Nader\u2019s account is considered key evidence \u2014 but not the only evidence \u2014 about what transpired in Seychelles, according to people familiar with the matter.\n Nader has long served as an adviser to the UAE leadership, and in that role he met more than once with Trump officials, including Stephen K. Bannon and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to people familiar with the matter. After the Seychelles meeting, Nader visited the White House several times, and met at least once there with Bannon and Kushner, these people said.\n Nader could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer declined to comment.\n Nader \u2014 and the Seychelles meeting \u2014 are also of interest to Mueller\u2019s team as it examines whether any foreign money or assistance fueled the Trump campaign, and how Trump officials during the transition and early days of the administration communicated with foreign officials, particularly Russians.\n Nader\u2019s cooperation with the special counsel was first reported by the New York Times. \n The UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. Such a concession by Moscow would have been likely to require the easing of U.S. sanctions on Russia, which were imposed for Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine in 2014, those officials said.\n Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition. However, according to people familiar with the Seychelles meeting, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his discussion with the Russian official.\n  Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the meeting in the Seychelles took place in January 2017, not 2016. \n  \nCarol D.

Schiff (D-Calif.), who told reporters last month that based on what he had seen, there was \u201cample evidence\u201d of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n Democrats and Republicans on the committee have interviewed the same 73 witnesses and viewed the same 300,000-plus documents, according to the tally Conaway gave reporters on Monday.

She was 88 and the oldest sitting member of Congress.\n Rep. Slaughter had been hospitalized and treated for a concussion after falling at her home in the District, The Washington Post reported Wednesday .\n The daughter of a blacksmith in a Kentucky coal mine, Rep. Slaughter traced her lineage to Daniel Boone and attacked her political opponents with a marksman\u2019s accuracy and, not infrequently, a disarming grin. \u201cShe\u2019s sort of a combination of Southern charm and back-room politics, a Southern belle with a cigar in her mouth,\u201d Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women\u2019s Campaign Fund, told The Post in 1992.\n A microbiologist with a master\u2019s in public health, she moved to western New York with her husband in the 1950s and entered politics two decades later, after fighting to preserve a stand of beech-maple forest near their home in the Rochester suburbs. She served in the Monroe County Legislature and New York State Assembly before being elected to Congress in 1986, and soon established herself as a defender of blue-collar constituents who worked for Xerox or Kodak. \n Breaking with Democratic Party leaders, she argued that international trade agreements did little more than drain the United States of manufacturing jobs. When President Bill Clinton asked her to support the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), according to the Almanac of American Politics, she replied, \u201cWhy are you carrying George Bush\u2019s trash?\u201d\n   U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter (Matthew Staver/BLOOMBERG) \n Initially one of just 29 women in the House of Representatives, Rep. Slaughter was a flinty advocate of women\u2019s access to health care and abortion. She was a co-author of the landmark Violence Against Women Act, a landmark 1994 law aimed at staunching domestic abuse and aiding its victims, and in 1991 was part of a group of seven Democratic congresswomen who marched to the Senate to demand a delay in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. \n In a legislative assault she later likened to the World War II battle of Iwo Jima, she and her fellow legislators prevailed on their Senate colleagues to hear testimony from Anita Hill, a former Thomas aide who had accused him of sexual harassment. \n \u201cThere\u2019s no monolithic way that women respond to this,\u201d she said at the time, referring to the harassment allegations. \u201cBut we are the people who write the laws of the land. Good lord, she should have some recourse here.\u201d\n Rep. Slaughter was the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, which determines when and how bills reach the House floor, and was elevated to chairman after Pelosi became the first female House speaker in 2007. For four years, she marshalled legislation that included an ethics bill to tighten lobbying rules and a bill prohibiting discrimination on the basis of genetic information. \n The latter, co-authored by Rep. Slaughter, was designed to prevent insurance providers from rejecting coverage for healthy people predisposed to cancer and other diseases.\n Among her greatest achievements was helping shepherd the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, during which she said she received a death threat and her district office window was smashed with a rock. She remained nonchalant, however, even while inspiring Republican rage over a short-lived proposal known as \u201cthe Slaughter Strategy,\u201d in which she considered passing the Senate version of Obamacare without an up-or-down vote \u2014 a tactic, she noted, that her Republican colleagues had sometimes used themselves.\n \u201cWe are about to unleash a cultural war in this country!\u201d Rep.

Slaughter described herself as the only microbiologist on Capitol Hill, and in recent years fought to establish stringent restrictions on the use of antibiotics in healthy cattle \u2014 a leading factor, she argued, in the rise of drug-resistant bacteria. She often pointed toward a Food and Drug Administration report which found that in 2009, out of all the antibiotics sold for use by people and livestock, 80 percent went to cattle.\n \u201cThese statistics tell the tale of an industry that is rampantly misusing antibiotics in an attempt to cover up filthy, unsanitary living conditions among animals,\u201d she told the New York Times in 2011. \u201cAs they feed antibiotics to animals to keep them healthy, they are making our families sicker by spreading these deadly strains of bacteria.\u201d\n Rep. Slaughter was unable to pass restrictive antibiotics legislation. But her proposal, introduced in each congressional session since 2007, helped draw national attention to the issue. In 2015, President Barack Obama announced a $1.2 billion, five-year plan to identify emerging \u201csuperbugs\u201d and increase funding for new antibiotics and vaccines.\n Dorothy Louise McIntosh was born in Harlan County, in southeastern Kentucky, on Aug. 14, 1929.

Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told a press gaggle Tuesday night, \u201cEvery time you talk with Putin and you give him a pass, that emboldens him.

Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. \u201cThe United States should recognize Putin as the leader of a repressive government that seeks to export its model of denying fundamental freedoms, and its intolerance of opposition.\u201d\n Likewise, David Kramer, former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, wryly observed, \u201cIf he had to call at all, Trump should have called Putin on Saturday, the day before the so-called election, to congratulate him since the outcome was already known, with Putin having ensured \u2018victory\u2019 with the murder in 2015 of one leading Russian opposition figure (Boris Nemtsov) and the disqualification of another ([Alexei] Navalny) on an absurd conviction.\u201d He cautioned, \u201cNo Western leader should have congratulated Putin because Russia didn\u2019t hold an election in any true sense of that word.

Research on gun violence is notoriously underfunded, but the data we do have shows that lawmakers can act to save lives from gun violence.\n\nThousands of people will descend on the Mall this week to protest gun violence in the United States. This movement should be informed by science, with specific policy proposals that could make a real impact.\n\nThe Las Vegas massacre. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. The Virginia Tech slaughter. The massacre at the Texas First Baptist Church.\n\nThese are the five highest-casualty mass shootings in modern American history. And what did they all have in common? Semiautomatic weapons that allowed the shooter to fire into crowds without reloading.\n\nBased on the evidence we have, banning these weapons probably won\u2019t do too much to curb overall gun deaths. We know this because in 1994, Congress passed legislation to outlaw the sale of certain types of semiautomatic guns and large-capacity magazines, and the effect was unimpressive. Gun homicide rates declined during the ban, but they also fell after the ban expired in 2004. One federally funded study of the ban found that the effect on violence was insignificant, partly because it was full of loopholes.\n\nBut banning so-called assault weapons was never meant to reduce overall gun deaths. It was meant to reduce gun deaths from mass shootings \u2014 even if these represent a small portion of gun violence.\n\nAnd in fact, mass shooting casualties dipped during the ban, although a review of studies by the Rand Corporation found the effect of the ban on mass shootings to be inconclusive. We need to know more.\n\nBut research shows that semiautomatic weapons and weapons with high-capacity magazines are more dangerous than other weapons in shooting events. One older study of handgun attacks in New Jersey shows that gunfire incidents involving semiautomatic weapons wounded 15 percent more people than shootings with other weapons. Another more recent study from Minneapolis found that shootings with more than 10 shots fired accounted for between 20 and 28 percent of gun victims in the city.\n\nSo how do we keep such dangerous weapons from being used in crime? A ban on assault weapons might help, as data from a few cities during the 1994 ban suggest:\n\nBut experts say focusing on reducing large-capacity magazines might be more effective. Simply put, gunmen are less deadly when they have to reload.\n\nSuch a ban might take time to have an effect, as a Post investigation shows. But it would be worth it. Alarmingly, local crime data suggest that crimes committed with high-powered weapons have been on the rise since the 1994 ban ended.\n\nAgain, mass shootings account for a small piece of the puzzle, so any ban on these weapons and magazines would result in marginal improvements, at best. But even if this step reduced shootings by 1 percent \u2014 far less than what the Minneapolis study suggests \u2014 that would mean 650 fewer people shot a year. Isn\u2019t that worth it?\n\nKeep guns away from kids\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve heard proposals to raise age limits for semiautomatic weapons. Taken alone, this would do very little. Since 2009, men under 21 committed two mass shootings with semiautomatic rifles. And one of those shootings involved a gun purchased illegally.\n\nBut expanding existing age limits to all guns might be more effective, since young people are far more likely to commit homicide than older ones. One survey of inmates found that setting a minimum age requirement of 21 could have prohibited gun possession in 17 percent of cases in which people legally owned a gun and used it to commit a crime.\n\nOf course, keeping guns out of the hands of young shooters would be difficult, because it\u2019s so easy for people to obtain guns illegally. But age limits in general have proven to be effective in limiting bad behavior, so it\u2019s worth trying.\n\nThere\u2019s another reform that could be even more effective at keeping guns from kids: requiring gun owners to securely store firearms in a locked container or with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock.\n\nNearly 2 million minors in the United States live in homes where firearms are loaded and easy to access. And alarmingly, one study found that of the teens who had guns in their home who had attempted suicide in the past year, 40 percent had easy access to the firearm. Another study from the federal government shows that 68 percent of school shootings are perpetrated by shooters who obtain a gun from their homes or the homes of relatives.\n\nIn Massachusetts, which has the strictest safe-storage laws in the country, guns are used in just 9 percent of youth suicides, compared with 42 percent nationally. The suicide death rate among youth in the state is 38 percent below the national average.\n\nThe Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence also reports that states requiring locks on handguns in at least some circumstances have 40 percent fewer suicides per capita and 68 percent fewer firearm suicides per capita than states without such laws.\n\nMeanwhile, another safety innovation is being developed: smart guns. These are guns that use fingerprint recognition and other means so that only their owners can fire them. The technology is still relatively new, but it\u2019s promising. One small study found that over seven years, 37 percent of gun deaths could have been prevented by smart guns. Lawmakers could encourage their use by incorporating them into laws regulating safe storage.\n\nHere\u2019s a general rule: The more guns there are, the more gun deaths there will be.\n\nIt holds across countries (note how much the United States stands out):\n\nAnd across states. One 2013 study from Boston University found that for every percentage point increase in gun ownership at the state level, there was a 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.\n\nSo how do we reduce the steady flow of guns? Three ideas:\n\nIn the 1990s, Australia spent $500 million to buy back almost 600,000 guns. Harvard University researchers found that the gun homicide rate dropped 42 percent in the seven years following the law and the gun suicide rate fell 58 percent.\n\nAn Australian study found that for every 3,500 guns withdrawn per 100,000 people, the government was able to achieve a 74 percent drop in gun suicides.\n\nIn fact, since the ban, the country has not experienced another mass shooting. That doesn\u2019t proves causation. But the likelihood it\u2019s due to chance? Roughly 1 in 200,000, according to a recent paper.\n\nOf course, the United States is different from Australia. The Australian buyback was mandatory, which would probably run into constitutional problems here. Plus, we have way more guns per capita, so the United States would have to spend exponentially more to make a significant difference.\n\nStill, given Australia\u2019s trends, it\u2019s worth at least experimentation. Perhaps the government can use buyback programs to target specific kinds of weapons, such as semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity magazines.\n\n2. Limit the number of guns people can buy at one time\n\nFederal gun enforcers have long warned that state laws allowing bulk purchases of guns enable crime. Older studies from what is now called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that as many as 1 in 5 handguns recovered in a crime were originally purchased as part of a sale in which multiple guns were purchased.\n\nTo combat this behavior, some states have instituted \u201cone handgun a month\u201d policies, such as Virginia in 1993. At the time, Virginia was the top supplier of guns seized in the Northeast. Three years later, the state dropped to eighth. Research also shows that the Virginia law was effective in reducing criminal firearms sent to nearby states. It also led to a 35 percent reduction in guns recovered anywhere in the United States that were traced back to Virginia.\n\nSuch a policy isn\u2019t going to solve gun trafficking. The Virginia law didn\u2019t prevent \u201cstraw purchases\u201d in which traffickers pay people to buy guns legally so they can be sold elsewhere. In fact, Virginia remained the eighth-top supplier of illegal guns even after it repealed its one-handgun-a-month law in 2012.\n\nBut experts say one-gun-a-month laws make it more costly for criminals to traffic guns. And given the success in the past, such policies are worth promoting.\n\nResearch has shown that in some cities, guns used to commit crimes often come from a small set of gun dealers. In Milwaukee, for example, a single dealer was linked to a majority of the guns used in the city\u2019s crime.\n\nSo how do we stop the flow of those guns? Hold dealers accountable.\n\nIn 1999, the federal government published a report identifying gun shops connected with crime guns, including that Milwaukee dealer. In response to negative publicity, that dealer changed its sales practices. Afterward, the city saw a 76 percent reduction in the flow of new guns from that shop to criminals and a 44 percent reduction in new crime guns overall. But in 2003, Congress passed a law prohibiting the government from publishing such data, after which the rate of new gun sales from that dealer to criminals shot up 200 percent.\n\nStudies show that regulation of licensed dealers \u2014 such as record-keeping requirements or inspection mandates \u2014 can also reduce interstate trafficking. So can litigation against gun dealers that allow their guns to enter criminal markets. One sting operation conducted by New York City reduced the probability of guns from the dealers they targeted ending up in the hands of criminals by 84 percent.\n\nFederal law requires background checks to obtain a gun, but those checks are extremely porous.\n\nUnder federal law, only licensed gun dealers have to perform these background checks. Private individuals and many online retailers don\u2019t. That leaves a lot of gun owners \u2014 about 42 percent, according to one survey published in 2017 \u2014 who didn\u2019t undergo a background check for a gun purchase. So what happens when states go beyond federal laws and require all handgun sales to undergo a background check? Fewer gun deaths.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, those states had 35 percent fewer gun deaths per capita than those without the requirement. Those states also have 53 percent fewer firearm suicides and 31 percent fewer overall suicides per capita.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t prove causation. In fact, a few states with expanded background checks have relatively high gun-death rates.\n\nBut we do know most gun offenders obtain their weapons through unlicensed sellers. One survey of state prison inmates convicted of offenses committed with guns in 13 states found that only 13 percent obtained their guns from a seller that had to conduct a background check. Among those who were supposed to be prohibited from possessing a firearm, nearly all of them got their hands on one through suppliers that didn\u2019t have to conduct a background check. Closing that loophole might help, although it\u2019s questionable to what degree, since black markets already feed the flow of crime.\n\nWhat else can we do to strengthen background checks? Three possibilities:\n\nMost gun background checks are instant. But some \u2014 around 9 percent \u2014 take more time, and federal law says if it takes more than three business days, the sale can proceed. As a result, thousands of people who were not supposed have access to guns ended up getting them, as the Government Accountability Office reported.\n\nAmong the people who benefited from this loophole? Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. Ending this practice would save lives.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2014, an average of 760 Americans were killed with guns annually by their spouses, ex-spouses or dating partners, according to an Associated Press analysis.\n\nFederal law prevents anyone with domestic violence misdemeanors from having a gun, but that law is defined narrowly and doesn\u2019t include all domestic violence perpetrators \u2014 for example, boyfriends. More specifically, the law doesn\u2019t keep guns from abusers who are not married, do not live with their partner or do not share a child with them.\n\nSome states have expanded on federal law \u2014 and it works. One study found that domestic-violence-related homicide rates decline 7 percent after a state passes such laws.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that waiting periods reduce violent crime. But we\u2019re pretty sure they prevent suicides.\n\nResearch shows that people who buy handguns are at higher risk of suicide within a week of the purchase, and that waiting periods can keep them from using guns to commit suicide. In fact, one study found that when South Dakota repealed its 48-hour waiting period in 2012, suicides jumped 7.6 percent in the following year.\n\nMental illness is associated with a relatively small portion (around 5 percent) of gun homicides. Federal law already prohibits anyone committed to a mental-health facility or deemed dangerous or lacking all mental capacities through a legal proceeding from having a gun.\n\nBut mental-health records are notoriously spotty. There\u2019s limited evidence that improved reporting at the state level might reduce violent crimes. Connecticut started reporting mental-health data to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2007, and one study found that violent crimes committed by people with mental illness there significantly decreased.\n\nWe can also make it easier for family members to help loved ones with mental illness, by letting them seek court orders to disarm relatives who might do harm to themselves. In Connecticut, which has allowed this since 1999, one study estimates that the law averted 72 suicide attempts through 2013 from being fatal.\n\nConsider two data points: first in Connecticut, then in Missouri.\n\nIn Connecticut, state lawmakers required people to get a license and safety training for a gun, just as we do for cars. In the decade after, it saw a drop in both gun homicides and suicides \u2014 at faster rates than other states without similar laws. And at the same time, Connecticut saw no significant drop in homicides not related to guns.\n\nIn Missouri, the state legislature repealed its licensing requirements in 2007.\n\nA study found that the law change was associated with an additional 55 to 63 homicides in each of the five years following the repeal \u2014 even as homicides committed without guns dropped.\n\nIn both cases, it\u2019s hard to prove a connection. But these experiences do strongly suggest something we learned in our decades-long efforts to reduce vehicle-related deaths: Regulation saves lives.\n\nIt can also deter crime. Research from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns has found that guns sold in states with licensing laws \u2014 which are sometimes paired with mandatory registration of guns with local police \u2014 end up being exported for criminal activity at one-third the rate of states without the laws.\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s much harder to feed guns into illegal markets if police can trace them to their legal gun owners.

The idea of arming some teachers has been controversial and has drawn sharp opposition from the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers lobby, among other groups.\n Many of the student survivors have urged Washington to toughen restrictions on gun purchases, but such measures are fiercely opposed by the National Rifle Association, and the Trump plan does not include any substantial changes to gun laws.\n Rather, the president is establishing a Federal Commission on School Safety, to be chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, that will explore possible solutions, such as the age requirement for purchases, officials said.\n DeVos characterized the administration\u2019s efforts as \u201ca pragmatic plan to dramatically increase school safety.\u201d\n   President Trump watches as Julia Cordover, Parkland student body president, speaks during a listening session on gun violence at the White House on Feb. 21, (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) \n \u201cWe are committed to working quickly because there\u2019s no time to waste,\u201d DeVos said on a Sunday evening conference call with reporters. Invoking past mass school shootings, she continued, \u201cNo student, no family, no teacher and no school should have to live the horror of Parkland or Sandy Hook or Columbine again.\u201d\n The administration\u2019s proposals come after 17 people were shot and killed last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., a massacre that spurred officials in Washington to reevaluate gun laws.\n Trump has said he was personally moved by the shooting \u2014 and by the persistent and impassioned calls for action from some of the teenage survivors as well as parents of the victims \u2014 and elevated the issue of school safety in his administration. He has called for raising the minimum age for purchasing an AR-15 or similar-style rifles from 18 to 21 years old.\n \u201cNow, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I\u2019m saying it anyway,\u201d Trump said in a Feb. 28 meeting with lawmakers. \u201cYou can buy a handgun \u2014 you can\u2019t buy one; you have to wait until you\u2019re 21.\u00a0But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18.\u00a0I think it\u2019s something you have to think about.\u201d\n But the White House plan released Sunday does not address the minimum age for gun purchases. Pressed by reporters about the apparent backtracking, a senior administration said the age issue was \u201ca state-based discussion right now\u201d and would be explored by DeVos\u2019s commission.\n  [\u2018I love this place.\u2019 Trump campaigns for Pa. candidate but keeps spotlight on himself] \n At a political rally Saturday night in Pennsylvania, Trump mocked the idea of commissions to solve the nation\u2019s drug epidemic.\n \u201cDo you think the drug dealers who kill thousands of people during their lifetime, do you think they care who\u2019s on a blue-ribbon committee?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness.\u201d\n Administration officials demurred Sunday night when asked why Trump found commissions an inadequate response to the drug epidemic but an appropriate way to respond to gun massacres. \n \u201cThere are not going to be one-size-fits-all approaches and solutions, and I think that that is a very cogent argument for having a commission,\u201d said a senior administration official, who would only answer questions from reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n The centerpiece of the administration\u2019s plan is Trump\u2019s vow to \u201charden our schools against attack.\u201d Since almost immediately after the Parkland shooting, the president has advocated arming some teachers as a solution to stopping future massacres.\n \u201cA gun-free zone to a maniac \u2014 because they\u2019re all cowards \u2014 a gun-free zone is, let\u2019s go in and let\u2019s attack, because bullets aren\u2019t coming back at us,\u201d Trump said during a Feb. 22 listening session at the White House with teachers, students and parents.\n The administration will start working with states to provide \u201crigorous firearms training\u201d to teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to be armed, said Andrew Bremberg, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. The White House has not proposed offering states new funding for this training.\n Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the NEA, the teachers\u2019 lobby, said last month that \u201cbringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms.\u201d\n The NRA supports the idea of allowing armed teachers in schools.\n Bremberg said the administration is backing two pieces of legislation: A bipartisan bill by Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that is designed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System; and the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize state-based grants to implement violence prevention training for teachers and students.\n The administration also is urging all states to pass risk protection orders, as Florida recently did, allowing law enforcement officers to remove firearms from individuals who are considered a threat to themselves or others and to prevent them from purchasing new guns, Bremberg said.\n Lastly, the administration wants to better integrate mental health, primary care and family services programs, and the president has ordered a full audit and review of the FBI tip line, he said. The FBI has said it ignored a warning that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz might attack a school just weeks before he allegedly carried out the rampage in Parkland.\n \u201cThe president is determined to get to the root of the various societal issues that lead to violence in our country,\u201d Bremberg said. \u201cNo stone will be unturned.\u201d\n At the Department of Justice, meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Saturday took an incremental step toward banning bump stocks, devices that can make semiautomatic weapons fire like fully automatic firearms.\n Sessions submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a proposed regulation on bump stocks. The proposal still requires that office\u2019s approval, and once that is complete, it must be published and public comments considered before it becomes reality. \n While some gun control advocates welcomed the move, others argued that it would still be better for Congress to pass legislation banning the devices. Federal officials had in years past concluded they could not legally regulate bump stocks, and the new move to do so is likely to be met with lawsuits from manufacturers of the devices.\n For its part, the NRA does not oppose regulating bump stocks under existing law, but does object to new legislation.\n In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott (R) defied the NRA last Friday by signing into law a new set of gun regulations that imposes a three-day waiting period for most purchases of long guns, raises the minimum age for buying those weapons to 21 and bans the possession of bump stocks.\n \u201cI am going to do what I think are common-sense solutions,\u201d Scott said after the signing. \u201cI think this is the beginning. There is now going to be a real conversation about how we make our schools safe.\u201d\n  [Florida Gov. Rick Scott breaks with NRA to sign new gun regulations] \n But the new Florida restrictions have drawn opposition from some Republicans nationally. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he does not support raising the age to purchase long guns, such as AR-15 rifles that have been used in many of the recent mass shootings.\n \u201cWe send our sons and daughters over to Afghanistan, in Iraq,\u201d at age 18, Johnson said. \u201cThey defend our freedoms. I think if they do that, they ought to be able to buy a hunting rifle.\u201d\n Trump has vacillated in his public pronouncements about guns. He and Republican leaders in Congress have been afraid to cross the National Rifle Association ahead of the November midterm elections because the gun lobby has long been a powerful force mobilizing conservative activists in elections.\n At his Feb. 28 meeting with lawmakers, Trump sounded open to new restrictions on gun purchase. \u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d he said, winning the approval of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and other Democrats who have long sought to toughen gun laws and ban semiautomatic assault rifles.\n But NRA leaders then met privately with Trump and the president had an apparent change of tune and backed off more restrictive proposals. Last week, Trump met personally in the Oval Office with Kyle Kashuv, a Stoneman Douglas student who has become one of his school\u2019s few pro-gun rights activists with his frequent appearances on Fox News Channel.\n Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Eli Rosenberg", "body": "Rep.

But I also agree with what Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his majority opinion in 2008\u2019s landmark Heller case: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d It is \u201cnot a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d\n It is clear we have a problem with the gun laws in this country.

Following each of these senseless, tragic events there\u2019s a great deal of idle, fruitless talk in the halls of Congress, and then the conversation quickly comes to an end. \n It\u2019s our great hope and belief that this time will be different. It has to be different.\n Maybe it\u2019s because the survivors of the Parkland, Fla., massacre \u2014 and the thousands of students who made their feelings known for 17 minutes last week \u2014 are standing up and shouting \u201cenough is enough\u201d and \u201cnever again.\u201d They are demanding that our elected officials come together to find solutions.

We have met with a number of lawmakers and have talked with many of our peers in the retail industry. We have spoken with strong-willed advocacy groups and visited with families in Parkland.\n It is becoming increasingly apparent through our conversations that there continues to be deep skepticism that anything of substance will be done.\n Some members of Congress are committed to change, but not enough are willing to set aside partisanship to find a solution.

(Joshua Roberts/Reuters).\n \n Politicians, economics and\u00a0executives agree China isn't playing fair on trade. But there's a lot of disagreement about whether President Trump's hefty tariffs are the right weapon for fighting back. American farmers and Walmart shoppers are\u00a0likely to feel pain in this fight, and a lot of them voted for Trump.\n There are two ways Americans are highly likely to get hurt in a U.S.-China trade spat. First, prices on a lot of items will almost certainly rise and second, China is going to hit back with tariffs on American products.\n In many U.S. stores, \u201cMade in China\u201d labels and stamps are on tons of T-shirts, shoes, plastic Easter eggs and water bottles, among other goods. Tariffs are basically taxes that mean Americans will pay more when they shop. That's especially true for low-income families\u00a0who spend a higher share of their paycheck on goods, and often buy the cheapest products, families that Trump often thinks of as his base.\n \u201cLots of stuff we import from China is for the Walmart shopper,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIf you start to increase the price of clothing, sheets, etc., lower-income households would feel it more.\u201d\n Top retailers from Walmart to Apple have sent letters to Trump urging him not to do this because it would worsen inequality and\u00a0 \u201cpunish American working families with higher prices.\u201d The Tax Foundation pointed out that Trump's tariffs on China would cancel out about 20 percent of the benefits of the recent GOP tax cuts.\n [ Trump goes after China, announcing $50 billion of new tariffs ]\n The other knock is expected to come when China fights back. Senior Chinese officials have made it clear they'll take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to retaliate for Trump's tariffs. All indications from Beijing are that China's counter-tariffs will\u00a0target goods and jobs in parts of America that voted for Trump. At the top of China's list are agricultural products likes soybeans and hogs.\n Soybeans and grains are the second largest U.S. export to China. Trump carried eight of the top 10 soy-producing states, and the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin are both in the top 15 soybean producers, according to USDA data. Airplanes, the top U.S. export to China, could also end up on the Chinese hit list.\n  \u201cThere is virtually certain to be Chinese retaliation aimed largely on U.S. agriculture,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. \u201cMost of Trump's policies hurt his base, and this could be a real problem in places like the Midwest.\u201d\n In a best-case scenario, Trump does his tariffs, China responds with its tariffs and then the two sides decide to cool down and talk. The whole ordeal is short-lived. But the reason the stock market fell sharply \u2014 with the Dow down about 500 points at one point on Thursday \u2014 is that this trade spat could turn into an all-out trade war. That would last longer and make the pain far more widespread on consumers and specific U.S. industries and workers.\n The U.S. may \u201cjust be warming up here and we would hit them again,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has advised the administration on China trade policy. \u201cI think it will end up being Round 1.\u201d\n Trump fanned those concerns Thursday when he signed the tariff announcement and told the crowd of onlookers, \u201cThis is the first of many.\u201d\n Consider the numbers: Trump is starting with tariffs on\u00a0 at least $50 billion of Chinese goods or about 10 percent of the roughly $500 billion worth of Chinese goods and services that come to the U.S. (White House officials have put the figure at $50 billion although Trump himself has mentioned $60 billion).\u00a0\u00a0The bigger tariff figure gets, the more it will be felt by people on both sides of the Pacific.\n Trump and his top advisers dismiss such concerns. They argue that even if consumers have to pay a bit more, it's worth it because it would save U.S. jobs and industries.\n \u201cIt's important to put this action in context. As a practical matter, China benefits far more from the U.S.-China trade relationship than the U.S. does,\u201d said Peter Navarro, a senior Trump adviser who has been driving trade policy. \u201cThe trade deficit results in 2 million more jobs in China and 2 million less here.\u201d\n What has stopped trade spats in the past is foreign countries hitting back at politically sensitive industries located in parts of America that the president and his party want to keep happy. In 2002,\u00a0 President George W. Bush's steel tariffs ended early after the European Union readied tariffs on Florida oranges and North and South Carolina textiles. Bush didn't want to anger voters in Florida, a state he narrowly won in his first election by\u00a0only a few hundred votes.\n The Chinese are eyeing soybeans and pork products, and with good reason. Heading into the midterms 2018 elections, Trump might have a hard time convincing voters in the top 10 soybean-exporting states that tariffs are a good idea.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n The controversies surrounding members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet have caused upheaval within the administration, prompting White House officials to scramble in an effort to avert any further political fallout and to summon agency leaders for face-to-face ethics meetings. \n Revelations about repeated use of chartered airplanes forced the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in September. More recently, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has continued to wrestle with the fallout of news that taxpayers covered the expenses for his wife during a 10-day trip to Europe last year \u2014 and more recently that his chief of staff doctored an email and made false statements to justify the payments. \n Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has faced public criticism and the scrutiny of government investigators for his own frequent first-class travels and for other expenditures he made using public funding. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that new records showed a soundproof phone booth installed in Pruitt\u2019s office cost $43,000 \u2014 $18,000 more than previously disclosed. \n At the Interior Department, Secretary Ryan Zinke has faced inquiries about his travel practices, and last fall an official in the agency\u2019s inspector general office wrote that he had failed to properly document his trips since taking office. \n And at HUD, public records released this week detail how Carson\u2019s wife was closely involved in the redecorating of his office at the agency, including the purchase of a $31,561 dining set. \n Barry Bennett, who served as Carson\u2019s presidential campaign manager and then informally advised Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, wrote in an email that in many instances Cabinet members are unaware of the actual costs stemming from their actions. He said Carson often complained about staying in fancy hotels on the campaign trail because their rooms didn\u2019t readily offer an ironing board and iron \u2014 which he relied on to press his own clothes.\n Still, Bennett added, \u201cthese are unforced errors\u201d that the White House needs to halt. \n   Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke speaks during the daily briefing at the White House on April 3, 2017.

At their power, level anything is possible.\u201d\n Even as new revelations have surfaced, in part through numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, Trump\u2019s deputies have pushed back against accusations that they have misspent taxpayer funds.\n During a hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Zinke defended his use of charter planes for various trips, including to Montana, Alaska and the U.S. Virgin Islands. He labeled questions about this travels as \u201cinnuendos,\u201d arguing that his predecessor at the department took similar trips at taxpayer expense. \n \u201cI resent the fact of your insults. I resent the fact they\u2019re misleading,\u201d Zinke told Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who had asked him about a $12,375 flight Zinke chartered from Las Vegas to near his home in Montana. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, added later, \u201cI\u2019ve been shot at before, I\u2019m very comfortable with it. Do right, fear no man, do the best you can.\u201d\n Carson has used his personal Twitter account to defend his family\u2019s integrity, including after The Post reported that HUD lawyers warned him he risked running afoul of federal ethics rules by allowing his son and daughter-in-law to help organize a listening tour to Baltimore last summer.\n Referring to a complaint to HUD\u2019s special counsel about redecorating his office, Carson tweeted on Feb. 28, \u201cWe suspect, based on past attempts, that they will continue to probe and make further accusations even without evidence or substantiation. We will continue to ask for God\u2019s guidance to do what is right.\u201d\n Last month, at least four Cabinet members \u2014 Carson, Pruitt, Shulkin and Zinke \u2014 met separately with White House Cabinet Secretary William McGinley to discuss proper ethics practices, according to multiple administration officials familiar with the sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. \n The meetings, first reported by CNN, included handouts with ethics advice and a discussion about how not to violate federal laws when traveling to campaign for political candidates. The tips included, \u201cYou are the best guardian of your reputation. Your record-keeping practices must be designed with a purpose to prove innocence at the complaint phase or with the press,\u201d and \u201cEven if legal, does not mean you should do it \u2014 always consider optics.\u201d \n The sessions \u201cwere not confrontational, were not adversarial,\u201d said one White House official.\n \u201cWe are in the process of meeting with all of the Cabinet for discussions,\u201d the official added, \u201cjust so they can understand that the level of scrutiny is so high that they need to be aware of perception, in addition to ethical and lawful behavior.\u201d\n At times, White House officials have made it clear to outsiders that they are scrutizing Cabinet members closely. Two weeks ago, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with veterans service organizations to discuss the current turmoil at the VA. Several representatives told him that Shulkin was being undermined at the department by an insurrection of high-level White House appointees who disagree with many of his policies, according to three people in attendance. \n They expected to get sympathy from Kelly. But Kelly told the representatives that from his perspective, their observations made a good case that Shulkin should be fired, because the secretary had not been able to keep his troops in line.\n Singleton, a conservative political commentator who serves as communications director for Howard Stirk Holdings, said some of the conservatives he spends time with have \u201clowered\u201d expectations of Trump given the recent spate of scandals, \u201cbecause the president promised he would not do things the way they had been done in the past.\n \u201cThere is some disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those people remain particularly loyal to him,\u201d he said.\n  \nLisa Rein contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "John Kiriakou", "body": "I was inside the CIA\u2019s Langley, Va., headquarters on Sept. 11, 2001. Like all Americans, I was traumatized, and I volunteered to go overseas to help bring al-Qaeda\u2019s leaders to justice. I headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan from January to May 2002. My team captured dozens of al-Qaeda fighters, including senior training-camp commanders. One of the fighters whom I played an integral role in capturing was Abu Zubaida, mistakenly thought at the time to be the third-ranking person in the militant group. \n By that May, the CIA had decided to torture him. When I returned to CIA headquarters that month, a senior officer in the Counterterrorism Center asked me if I wanted to be \u201ctrained in the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d I had never heard the term, so I asked what it meant. After a brief explanation, I declined. I said that I had a moral and ethical problem with torture and that \u2014 the judgment of the Justice Department notwithstanding \u2014 I thought it was illegal.\n Unfortunately, there were plenty of people in the U.S. government who were all too willing to allow the practice to go on. One of them was Gina Haspel, whom President Trump nominated Tuesday as the CIA\u2019s next director.\n Putting Haspel in charge of the CIA would undo attempts by the agency \u2014 and the nation \u2014 to repudiate torture. The message this sends to the CIA workforce is simple: Engage in war crimes, in crimes against humanity, and you\u2019ll get promoted. Don\u2019t worry about the law. Don\u2019t worry about ethics. Don\u2019t worry about morality or the fact that\u00a0torture doesn\u2019t even work. Go ahead and do it anyway. We\u2019ll cover for you. And you can destroy the evidence, too.\n Described in the media as a \u201cseasoned intelligence veteran,\u201d Haspel has been at the CIA for 33 years, both at headquarters and in senior positions overseas. Now the deputy director, she has tried hard to stay out of the public eye. Mike Pompeo, the outgoing CIA director and secretary of state designee, has lauded her \u201cuncanny ability to get things done and inspire those around her.\u201d \n I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true for some. But many of the rest of us who knew and worked with Haspel at the CIA called her \u201cBloody Gina.\u201d\n The CIA will not let me repeat her r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u00a0or the widely reported specifics of how her work fit into the agency\u2019s torture program, calling such details \u201ccurrently and properly classified.\u201d But I can say that Haspel was a protege of and chief of staff for Jose Rodriguez, the CIA\u2019s notorious former deputy director for operations and former director of the Counterterrorism Center.\u00a0And that Rodriguez\u00a0eventually\u00a0assigned Haspel to order the detruction of\u00a0videotaped evidence of the torture of Abu Zubaida. The Justice Department investigated, but no one was ever charged in connection with the incident. \n CIA officers and psychologists under contract to the agency began torturing Abu Zubaida on Aug. 1, 2002.\u00a0The techniques were supposed to be incremental, starting with an open-palmed slap to the belly or the face. But the operatives\u00a0where he was held decided to start with the toughest method. They waterboarded Abu Zubaida 83 times. They later subjected him to sleep deprivation; they kept him locked in a large dog cage for weeks at a time; they locked him in a coffin-size box and, knowing that he had an irrational fear of insects, put bugs in it with him.\u00a0\n Rodriguez would later tell reporters\u00a0that the torture worked and that Abu Zubaida provided actionable intelligence that disrupted attacks and saved American lives. We know, thanks to the\u00a0Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on CIA torture and the personal testimony of\u00a0FBI interrogator Ali Soufan , that this was false.\n  [Torture is not a public relations problem] \n I knew what was happening to Abu Zubaida because of my position in CIA operations at the time. I kept my mouth shut\u00a0about it,\u00a0even after I left the CIA in 2004. But by 2007, I had had enough.\u00a0\n President George W. Bush had steadfastly denied to the American people that there was a torture program. I knew that was a lie. I knew torture didn\u2019t work. And I knew it was illegal. So in December 2007, I granted an\u00a0interview to ABC News in which I said that the CIA was torturing its prisoners, that torture was official U.S. government policy and that the policy had been personally approved by the president. The FBI began investigating me immediately.\u00a0\n A year later, the Justice Department concluded that I had not committed a crime. But CIA leaders were still furious that I had aired the agency\u2019s dirty laundry. The CIA asked the new Obama Justice Department to reopen the case against me. It did, and three years later, I was\u00a0charged with five felonies , including three counts of espionage, resulting from that ABC News interview and\u00a0a subsequent interview with the New York Times . Of course, I hadn\u2019t committed espionage, and the charges were eventually dropped, but only after I agreed to plea to a lesser charge. I served 23 months in prison for my whistleblowing.\n It was worth every day. Largely because the CIA\u2019s conduct became public, Congress has specifically prohibited waterboarding and other techniques that the agency used at the secret sites. A ban on torture is now the law of the land. \n  [Psychologists are facing consequences for helping with torture. It\u2019s not enough.] \n But while I went to prison for disclosing the torture program, Haspel is about to get a promotion despite her connection to it.\u00a0Trump\u2019s move hurts morale among CIA officers who recognize that torture is wrong. It comforts people at the agency who still believe \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d is somehow acceptable. I spoke with a senior officer this past week who said, \u201cThe more things change, the more they stay the same.\u201d There\u2019s an attitude of defeatism among opponents of torture.\n And the\u00a0message\u00a0it sends to our friends and allies (and the\u00a0countries we criticize in the State Department\u2019s annual\u00a0human rights reports) is this:\u00a0We say we\u2019re a shining city on a hill, a beacon of respect for human rights, civil rights, civil liberties and the rule of law.\u00a0But actually,\u00a0that\u2019s nonsense. We say those things when it\u2019s expedient. We say them to make ourselves feel good. But when push comes to shove, we do what we want, international law be damned.\n  [Trump will have vast powers. He can thank Obama for them.] \n The meaning of Haspel\u2019s nomination won\u2019t be\u00a0lost on our enemies, either. The torture program and similar abuses at military-run prisons in Iraq were among the greatest recruitment tools that al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other bad actors ever had, according to legal experts, U.S. lawmakers and even to the militants themselves. It energized them and gave them something to rally against. It sowed an even deeper hatred of the United States among militant groups. It swelled their ranks. It was no coincidence that the Islamic State paraded its prisoners in front of cameras wearing orange jumpsuits (like those worn by Guantanamo Bay detainees) before beheading them. Haspel and the others at the CIA who engineered and oversaw the torture program are at least partially responsible for that, because they showed the world how the United States sometimes treats captives.\u00a0\n Do we\u00a0Americans\u00a0want to\u00a0remain a nation\u00a0that tortures people, like North Korea, China and Iran?\u00a0Are we proud of the era when we\u00a0snatched people from one country and\u00a0sent\u00a0them to another to be interrogated\u00a0in secret prisons? Do we want to be the country that cynically preaches human rights and then violates those same rights when we think nobody is looking?\u00a0\n Our country cannot afford that. We cannot look the other way. We cannot reward the torturers.

And, as those long-sought dreams come to life, America\u2019s role as a defender of democracy and freedom is fading fast.\n Here are the facts: Putin is a ruthless despot. His regime murders political rivals, dissidents, and journalists. Russia has no genuinely independent media, and state-controlled outlets endlessly parrot Putin\u2019s chosen messages. Russian elections are clearly rigged.\n Those domestic tactics reverberate globally. Putin is complicit in facilitating war crimes in Syria. He snatched Crimea from a sovereign Ukraine, stoking conflict with covertly deployed Russian troops. And in the West, the Kremlin attacked democracy in America and in Europe, using a sophisticated blend of hacking and information warfare to sow chaos and undermine confidence in democratic institutions.\n Now Putin\u2019s regime appears to have used a chemical nerve-agent in an assassination attempt within Britain, America\u2019s closest and most powerful ally.\n Apparently none of this had any impact on Trump, who has savagely insulted those who defend America \u2014 the FBI, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Gold Star families \u2014 while relentlessly praising a foreign dictator who attacked the United States.\n In response to Putin\u2019s rigged reelection, Trump uncritically congratulated Putin, despite advice from his national security team that should have been difficult to misinterpret (\u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE,\u201d the guidance read). Worse, when White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether the Russian election was free and fair, she dodged, simply saying it wasn\u2019t America\u2019s place to \u201cdictate\u201d what happens in other countries.\n The correct response should have been \u201cNo.\u201d It would have been even better if she had added something along these lines: \u201cWe won\u2019t dignify Putin\u2019s sham \u2018election\u2019 with comment as it has no legitimacy. In the meantime, we stand with our ally, the United Kingdom, in solidarity against Russian aggression and unequivocally condemn their deployment of chemical weapons. We know friend from foe. Britain is our friend. And until the Kremlin stops its unacceptable attacks against the United States and its allies, Russia will be our foe.\u201d\n Of course, such a statement would require principled, moral leadership \u2014 which is about as plentiful in the White House these days as oxygen is in outer space.\n So, instead we got \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a presidential tweet praising Putin: \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n I guess we should just make nice with a world power that seeks to harm the United States and its allies at every possible opportunity? The Tweeter in chief has spoken.\n Trump made similar statements during the 2016 campaign. And yet, as Putin\u2019s aggression becomes increasingly brazen, Trump\u2019s embrace of him is unshakably enthusiastic. That is the very definition of appeasement. And as history teaches us, appeasement emboldens tyrants.\n Trump\u2019s praise for Putin also sends a clear signal to the rest of the world. The president of the United States openly admires dictators and despots, from the Philippines to Turkey to Egypt and China. Worse, Trump doesn\u2019t just praise them \u2014 he mimics what they do: Attacking the press. Threatening to jail his political rivals. Surrounding himself\u00a0in the West Wing with family members and unqualified cronies.\n How is the State Department supposed to promote freedom of the press abroad when Trump refers to journalists at home as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d? How are our diplomats supposed to press for the release of political prisoners overseas when Trump incessantly talks about jailing his own opponents? And just imagine trying to lecture another country about the dangers of nepotism.\n Well, apparently Trump realized that glaring hypocrisy, so instead of fixing it, he just stripped the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d from the State Department mission statement altogether.\n The modern Republican Party used to be the Party of Reagan, which depicted America as a \u201cshining city upon a hill\u201d that stood for democracy and freedom. \u201cAnd she\u2019s still a beacon,\u201d President Ronald Reagan said in his farewell address, \u201cstill a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.\u201d\n The Republican Party is now the Party of Trump. The \u201cbeacon\u201d is being snuffed out as America hurtles into its own darkness.

Haspel\u2019s selection faced immediate opposition from some lawmakers and human rights groups because of her prominent role in one of the agency\u2019s darkest chapters.\n Haspel was in charge of one of the CIA\u2019s \u201cblack site\u201d prisons where detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harrowing interrogation measures widely condemned as torture. \n When those methods were exposed and their legality came under scrutiny, Haspel was among a group of CIA officials involved in the decision to destroy videotapes of interrogation sessions that left some detainees on the brink of physical collapse.\n Trump announced the move on Twitter on Tuesday, saying that Pompeo would move to the State Department and that Haspel would \u201cbecome the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!\u201d\n Jameel Jaffer, formerly deputy legal director of the ACLU, said Tuesday on his Twitter feed that Haspel is \u201cquite literally a war criminal.\u201d\n  Haspel spent much of her 33-year CIA career in undercover assignments overseas and at CIA headquarters, including serving as the agency\u2019s top representative in London and as the acting head of its clandestine service in 2013.\n Current and former U.S. intelligence officials who have worked with Haspel praised her as an effective leader who could be expected to stand up to the pressures that Trump has often placed on spy agencies \u2014 including his denunciations of the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n Officials described Haspel as a consummate \u201cinsider\u201d and said CIA employees would greet her appointment with some relief, because an intelligence veteran would be back in charge. \n \u201cThe building will love the fact that she\u2019s an insider,\u201d said Mark Lowenthal, a former senior CIA officer. \n Pompeo, a former member of Congress who spent his early career in business, had no profile in the intelligence community apart from his leading role on a congressional committee investigating the terrorist attacks on a U.S. government facility in Benghazi, Libya. Career CIA officers have seen Pompeo as one of the most overtly political directors in the agency\u2019s history and a staunch public defender of the president.\n Haspel, by contrast, has almost no public profile. But she is a visible presence inside CIA headquarters, running day-to-day operations while Pompeo handles the public-facing aspects of the job, making speeches and media appearances, and meeting with the president. \n \u201cThis is not someone who has sharp elbows, but she is a sharp competitor,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss Haspel.\n Rumors of Pompeo\u2019s departure have flared up several times in recent months, and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) had often been mentioned as a leading replacement. Current intelligence officials reacted with alarm to that prospect. \u201cDisastrous\u201d is how one described a possible nomination of Cotton, who is widely seen as too political and inexperienced for the job. \n Pompeo\u2019s appointment inspired some of those same concerns, but he has been a staunch defender of the agency, and that has bolstered his credibility among career intelligence officers. \n Pompeo also had a strong rapport with the president, a quality that always makes a director valuable to the rank-and-file. But it\u2019s not clear that Haspel has the same close relationship with Trump. \n \u201cShe does bring continuity after Pompeo,\u201d said the former senior intelligence official, noting that the two were in accord on strengthening the agency\u2019s counterterrorism operations. \u201cThe question is, how much juice does she have in the White House?\u201d \n Inside CIA, Haspel has advocated a more aggressive approach to overseas operations. She had also led the agency\u2019s work on Russia, which could put her at odds with a president who has accused intelligence officials of trying to undermine his election by stating that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help get Trump elected.\n Her extensive involvement in a covert program that used harrowing interrogation measures on al-Qaeda suspects resurfaced last year when she was named deputy director of the CIA after Trump had signaled as a presidential candidate that he would consider reestablishing agency prisons and resuming interrogation methods that President Obama had banned. Trump never followed through on that plan, which was opposed by senior members of his administration including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.\n Haspel ran one of the first CIA black sites, a compound in Thailand code-named \u201cCat\u2019s Eye,\u201d where al-Qaeda suspects Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, better known as Abu Zubaida, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri were subjected to waterboarding and other techniques in 2002.\n An exhaustive Senate report on the program described the frightening toll inflicted. At one point, the report said, Zubaida was left \u201ccompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.\u201d \n Internal CIA memos cited in a Senate report on the agency\u2019s interrogation program described agency officials who witnessed the treatment as distraught and concerned about its legality. \u201cSeveral on the team profoundly affected,\u201d one agency employee wrote, \u201c...some to the point of tears and choking up.\u201d\n Haspel later served as chief of staff to the head of the agency\u2019s Counterterrorism Center, Jose Rodriguez, when he ordered the destruction of dozens of videotapes made at the Thailand site.\n Rodriguez wrote in his memoir that Haspel \u201cdrafted a cable\u201d ordering the tapes\u2019 destruction in 2005 as the program came under mounting public scrutiny and that he then \u201ctook a deep breath of weary satisfaction and hit Send.\u201d\n The Justice Department spent several years investigating alleged abuses in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes, but no charges were ever filed.\n When she was named deputy CIA director last year, the agency took the unusual step of soliciting testimonials from seven former top intelligence and congressional officials. Their statements of support were included in the agency\u2019s release. Former CIA director Michael Hayden described Haspel as \u201ca trusted friend, lieutenant and guide to the sometimes opaque corridors of American espionage.\u201d\n Some believe she had been unfairly penalized for her role in counterterrorism operations that were launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and carried out with the legal approval of the Justice Department.\n  Haspel was passed over in 2013 for a permanent assignment as head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service, although agency officials said the decision was not driven by her connection to the prisons controversy.\n  \nJulie Tate contributed to this report.\n   Read more: \n  In the end, no one was more surprised that Tillerson was fired than Tillerson", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "William Booth", "body": "LONDON \u2014 After asserting on Monday that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Russia was behind a poison attack against a former double agent in a quiet English town, Prime Minister Theresa May gave the Russian government a deadline to explain itself and where the rare and powerful \u201cweapons-grade\u201d nerve agent came from.\n As expected, May\u2019s deadline passed on Wednesday and Russia did not respond \u2014 or did not respond with the details or explanations that Britain sought.\u00a0\n Instead, Russian officials and state media assailed the British for whipping up \u201canti-Russia hysteria.\u201d The Kremlin rejected the \u201cunfounded accusations\u201d and shrugged off British demands.\n May vowed that without a \u201ccredible response\u201d from Moscow, she would return to Parliament on Wednesday \u201cto set out the full range of measures we will take.\u201d Her office declined to give a time for May\u2019s announcement of reprisals.\n British politicians and commentators said May could employ a range of diplomatic and financial sanctions \u2014 from clamping down on Russian oligarchs\u2019 property-buying binge in London to tossing out embassy staff.\u00a0\n May could also ask the European Union, or even NATO, to join in a response to what she described as a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate\u201d attack, which not only endangered the lives of its two principal victims, the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, but also potentially exposed scores of others to the nerve agent, including a police officer who remains hospitalized.\n Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006 for selling state secrets to British intelligence for 10 years, but he was released in 2010 as part of a high-profile spy swap. He and his daughter remain in critical condition at a Salisbury hospital.\n A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said the British leader discussed the attack with President Trump, who said Washington was \u201cwith the U.K. all the way\u201d that Russia \u201cmust provide unambiguous answers as to how this nerve agent came to be used.\u201d\n In his last remarks, just hours after being fired by Trump via Twitter, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned, \u201cmuch work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.\u201d\n Tillerson warned, \u201cRussia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone\u2019s interest.\u201d\n May also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cThey agreed that the international community should coordinate closely as the investigation developed and in the wake of Russia\u2019s response,\u201d said her spokesman.\n Russia essentially blew off May\u2019s midnight deadline for an explanation of how deadly Novichok nerve gas appeared on the streets of the quiet medieval town of Salisbury, famous for its nearby ruins of Stonehenge.\n Various officials and commentators made it clear that Moscow would call her bluff.\n After Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the U.K. on Tuesday that Moscow had no intention of responding to May\u2019s ultimatum, the ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, dialed up the heat on an evening talk show on one of the leading state-run channels.\n \u201cNo one can come before their national parliament and say: I give Russia 24 hours,\u201d said Zakharova, \u201cWhat kind of conversation is that in principle?\u201d She then appeared to chastise London for not behaving like a nuclear power, and took a shot at Boris Johnson.\u00a0\n \u201cWhen a country\u2019s Foreign Ministry is led by people who have absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy, who have built their career around populism, they have no idea either about the organization for the prohibition of nuclear weapons or the relevant [chemical weapons convention].\u201d\n \u00a0\u201cTo them, it is normal to go out and start intimidating,\u201d Zakharova said. \u201cDon\u2019t.

He reiterated that Moscow\u2019s official position, that it was not involved and demands proof, has been delivered through diplomatic channels.\n Peskov said that Moscow does not accept London\u2019s accusations and hopes the West will come to their senses and engage Russia in a joint investigation into the poisoning of Skripal.\n Regarding possible British actions against Russia today, Peskov said that \u201cany unlawful actions against any Russian media outlets in the UK will, of course, lead to reciprocal measures backed the principle of reciprocity.\u201d So far, no one in Russia has specified which outlets a response would apply to, thought they have suggested that every British outlet could be targeted.\n \u00a0So far, Foreign Minister Lavrov is the most senior Russian official to comment on May\u2019s ultimatum.

The decision amounts to a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of those involved with the new policy.\n The new plan will be challenged in court, just as the full ban that Trump issued last summer was, in at least four separate cases that are still ongoing. Federal judges allowed transgender service members to continue serving under the old ban and permitted transgender recruits to join the military as well. \n The Justice Department filed a copy of Mattis\u2019s recommendations in at least one of those legal battles Friday.\n \u201cIn service to the ideological goals of the Trump-Pence base, the Pentagon has distorted the science on transgender health to prop up irrational and legally untenable discrimination that will erode military readiness,\u201d said Aaron Belkin, who has studied transgender issues for the Palm Center, a think tank that had worked with the Obama administration in repealing the previous ban. \u201cThere is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy. Our troops and our nation deserve better.\u201d \n In his memo to the president, Mattis specifically challenged the thinking of the Obama administration when it repealed the ban in 2016. Mattis said that he found a Rand Corp. study \u2014 commissioned by the Pentagon under Obama that became a backbone of the repeal process \u2014 to be flawed.\n \u201cIt referred to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cIn short, this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or RAND assumed.\u201d\n The new direction comes after months of the Pentagon\u2019s grappling with how to change its policy after Trump unexpectedly tweeted July 26 that he was banning all transgender people from serving in the military. The president, without any plan in place, cited the \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d that he believed transgender military service would cause, and said that he had consulted with \u201cmy Generals and military experts.\u201d \n A day later, Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, released a memo effectively stopping the military from making any changes until a new policy was adopted, and Mattis backed the move.\n In August, Trump issued a presidential memorandum providing more detail. He accused the Obama administration of allowing transgender military service without identifying a \u201csufficient basis\u201d that doing so would not \u201chinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources,\u201d and he directed Mattis to have the Pentagon adopt a new ban similar to the military\u2019s former policy by Friday. \n The Obama administration began allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military in June 2016, following a review that dragged out months longer than expected amid internal conflict in the Pentagon over how the change would be made. Until then, the Pentagon considered gender dysphoria a disqualifying mental illness. \n In removing the ban, then-Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter stopped the military from involuntarily separating anyone in the service, and gave the service branches a year to iron out how they would begin processing transgender recruits. A year later, Mattis delayed allowing transgender recruits for an additional six months as the deadline neared, saying the issue needed more study. \n Trump\u2019s tweets came a few weeks later.\n Federal judges required the military to allow transgender recruits beginning Jan. 1, and the Pentagon signaled in December that it would not stand in the way of the courts\u2019 rulings. Instead, it issued new policy guidance to recruits to explain how to enlist transgender men and women, and stated in a policy paper that the guidance \u201cshall remain in effect until expressly revoked.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Ashley Parker", "body": "Over just a few days last week, the essence of Trumpism was on global display: The president ignored his advisers by congratulating Vladi\u00admir Putin, took the first steps toward imposing tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods and signed a huge $1.3 trillion spending bill that will balloon the federal deficit.\n In each case, President Trump cast aside years of Republican orthodoxy \u2014 and most of the party followed right along. The raw, undefined brand of populism that Trump rode into office is now hardening into a clearer set of policies in his second year, remaking the Republican Party and the country on issues ranging from trade and immigration to spending and entitlement programs.\n Even amid persistent unpopularity and the chaotic din of his White House, Trump has used a mix of legislation and unilateral actions to successfully push ahead with key parts of his vision \u2014 tariffs that have rocked global markets; harsh crackdowns on illegal immigrants; a nationalistic foreign policy that spurns allies while embracing foes and costly policies with little concern for the growing national debt.\n The spending legislation\u00a0\u2014 which puts the deficit on track to pass $1 trillion in 2019 \u2014 faced little meaningful opposition from Republican lawmakers despite years of GOP complaints that federal expenditures were out of control. Trump called the bill \u201cridiculous,\u201d but focused on issues other than the amount of spending.\n It was another example of how Trump seems to have overtaken his party\u2019s previously understood values, from a willingness to flout free-trade principles and fiscal austerity to a seeming abdication of America\u2019s role as a global voice for democratic values.\u00a0\n   President Trump speaks after signing a $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress early Friday, averting a government shutdown. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \u201cWhile the president\u2019s vision of pro-American immigration, trade and national security policies may not have had widespread support in Washington, they are widely supported by the American people,\u201d said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. \u201cThis is President Trump\u2019s Republican Party.\u201d\n A tweet Friday, in which Trump threatened to veto the spending bill, also underscored another tenet of Trumpism \u2014 a state of continuous uncertainty about where he will land on key policies. In the tweet, Trump said he was frustrated with the legislation both because it\u00a0\u201ctotally abandoned\u201d young undocumented immigrants known as \u201cdreamers\u201d (long a Democratic priority) and because it failed to\u00a0\u201cfully\u201d fund his controversial border wall (now a Republican priority). \u00a0\n \u201cThere has certainly been a wholesale repudiation of many core principles that have guided the Republican Party\u2019s thinking over the years,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\u00a0\u201cTheir willingness to accept certain victories on their agenda in return for the acceptance of Trumpism more broadly \u2014 that seems to be the guiding principle of Republican Party leaders.\u201d\n Trump allies and advisers say that while he has in some ways reshaped the Republican Party, he rose to power by understanding where the party\u2019s base already was and channeling those existing worries and desires.\n \u201cI would argue that Trump is more a reflection of where the voters are today,\u201d said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think he persuaded them into these stances. That\u2019s where they were. He\u2019s merely being a mirror to them. .\u2009.\u2009. He heard what the voters were talking about, what they feared, the pain that they had, and he immediately championed it.\u201d\n White House officials also stressed that Trump\u2019s professed\u00a0\u201cAmerica First\u201d theme serves as a kind of connective ideology, whether in prioritizing American workers over foreign workers on immigration or calling for NATO members to spend more on a shared defense. They said that on many regulatory and economic issues, such as last year\u2019s tax cuts,\u00a0the president and Republican lawmakers remain naturally aligned.\n For many pro-Trump voters, one senior White House official said, the actual policies are less important than the principle \u2014 and the principal, Trump himself, promising to stand up and fight for them.\n   President Trump shows off posters as he talks with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia at the White House on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who\u00a0decided to retire this year after periodically sparring with Trump, described Trump\u2019s support in stark terms:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s more than strong, it\u2019s tribal in nature,\u201d Corker said.\n \u201cPeople who tell me, who are out on the trail, say, \u2018Look, people don\u2019t ask about issues anymore. They don\u2019t care about issues. They want to know if you\u2019re with Trump or not,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said.\n An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week illustrated the point, finding that 59 percent of registered Republican voters said they consider themselves more a supporter of Trump than the Republican Party.\u00a0\n The question is whether Republican lawmakers and party leadership are compromising long-held values \u2014 or simply racing to catch up to a president and a party that has shifted underneath them.\u00a0\n \u201cObviously, the president has a bully pulpit and he\u2019s got a towering Twitter account,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump\u2019s closest allies on the Hill. \u201cBoth of those allow him to communicate directly with some 49 million people each and every day. And it does affect policy, without a doubt.\u201d\n Even while flouting GOP tenets on issues such as trade, Trump has embraced conservative positions on many social issues \u2014 keeping him in good stead with one of his strongest constituencies, evangelical voters. On Friday, for instance, the White House announced a policy to ban most transgender troops from serving in the military. Trump also retreated to default conservative positions on gun control after suggesting broader restrictions in the wake of the shooting massacre in Parkland, Fla.\n The shift to Trumpism is perhaps most stark on trade. Trump\u2019s protectionist moves\u00a0\u2014 including a series of proposed tariffs, withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and threats to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement\u00a0\u2014 have quickly been embraced by a party that for years extolled the virtues of open markets.\n In a\u00a0Quinnipiac University poll earlier this month, 58 percent of Republican voters supported imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. During the 2016 election year,\u00a0Pew tracked a massive drop in the share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying that free trade agreements had been a \u201cgood thing\u201d for the United States, from 56 percent in early 2015 to 29 percent in October 2016.\n Stephen Moore, a former Trump campaign adviser and senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said some of the realignment is a natural outgrowth of the fact that Trump\u00a0\u2014 an unconventional leader not steeped in decades of GOP orthodoxy\u00a0\u2014 is now the leader of the party.\n \u201cThat\u2019s just political realism,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0\u201cA lot of my conservative friends say,\u00a0\u2018Well, I don\u2019t agree with him on trade or immigration or infrastructure spending or whatever it may be,\u2019 and my response is, it\u2019s a package deal here. You can\u2019t just pick out what you like and don\u2019t like.\u201d\u00a0\n Corker, who has seesawed in his support for the president, voted against the spending bill and excoriated it as \u201cgrotesque\u201d Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor.\u00a0\u201cThere are a lot of discussions about the fact that maybe the Republican Party has lost its soul,\u201d he said, adding that the specter of a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican president\u00a0\u201cgetting ready to pass a bill that adds $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years\u201d should serve as\u00a0\u201ca wake-up call to people as to whether that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n Trump has upended his party on other issues as well. On immigration, although many GOP voters already shared Trump\u2019s restrictionist impulses, his policies and hard-line rhetoric are at odds with long-standing attempts by Republican leaders to attract more Hispanic voters. After the 2012 presidential election, when Mitt Romney won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, a report by the Republican National Committee declared that the party \u201cmust embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n On entitlements, too, a number of rising Republican stars \u2014 such as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \u2014 have vowed to overhaul the existing system to save the government money. Yet Trump has made no serious moves to change Medicare or Social Security.\n Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) described the return to deficit spending as \u201cscary\u201d and said the solution was to tackle entitlements. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019ve got to get entitlements under control,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s driving the debt and deficit more than anything else.\u201d\n But the problem, Simpson said, is Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a president who said he won\u2019t touch it,\u201d he said. \u201cMakes it kind of difficult, you know.\u201d\n Similarly,\u00a0Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said Trump \u201cmost definitely has, in part, given cover to congressional Republicans to drive up spending.\u201d\u00a0\n \u00a0\u201cWe had the president during the campaign saying he wasn\u2019t going to touch the main drivers of our fiscal problems: Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare,\u201d Flake said. \u201cBut this, we can\u2019t blame this on our president. A lot of this is being driven by Congress, and a lot of this went on long before the president got here.\u201d\n Asked if there were any other notable areas\u00a0\u2014 aside from spending, immigration and trade\u00a0\u2014 where Trump had significantly remade the party, Flake chuckled.\n \u201cOn the kind of decency stuff, certainly,\u201d Flake said, before offering the flip side:\u00a0\u201cAnd creating a safe space for indecent discourse.\u201d\n  \nScott Clement, Paul Kane, Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Lindsey Bever", "body": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.

In a statement to\u00a0the liberal outlet ThinkProgress, the spokesman had called the\u00a0contract \u201croutine\u201d for large groups, adding that it \u201chas more than 2,000 such contracts in place.\u200b\u201d\n The NRA claims\u00a05 million members, takes in tens of millions of dollars each year through memberships, and devotes massive resources to fighting gun regulations in the name of constitutional protections that guarantee Americans\u00a0the right to bear arms.\n The group has faced public anger before \u2014 after the massacre of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, for example. But it\u00a0has always fought back against pushes for gun-law reform, and efforts to significantly restrict firearms\u00a0inevitably die out as public fury over the shootings ebbs.\n But outrage over the Parkland shooting \u2014 sustained in part by politically active teenagers who survived the massacre \u2014 has shown no signs of dying out.\u00a0Police say a former student killed 17 people with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle, one of at least 10\u00a0gun he owned.\u00a0\n As calls for gun\u00a0control spread, the\u00a0NRA has increasingly become a target of activists,\u00a0with social media hashtags\u00a0urging boycotts of\u00a0any\u00a0corporation\u00a0found to be linked with it.\n Delta\u00a0and United are\u00a0the latest to submit to the pressure.\n  First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private U.S. banks, may\u00a0have been the first to respond publicly to the boycott calls. The bank had previously advertised\u00a0the \u201cOfficial Credit Card of the NRA,\u201d according to the Omaha World-Herald\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0Visa card\u00a0with\u00a05 percent back on gas and sporting goods.\n \u201cCustomer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,\u201d the bank said in a statement published Thursday, eights days after the Parkland shooting. \u201cAs a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card.\u201d\n Enterprise followed suit a few hours later. \u201cAll three of our brands have ended the discount for NRA members,\u201d effective March 26,\u00a0the car rental company wrote\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0Thursday afternoon.\u00a0Hertz, Avis Budget Group and TrueCar\u00a0would soon join Enterprise and end their NRA discounts.\u00a0 So did movers\u00a0North American Van Lines and Allied Van Lines.\n On\u00a0Friday morning, Symantec announced that the boycott movement had spread to the software industry. NRA members will now have to pay the same price for its anti-virus software as everyone else.\n   Symantec has stopped its discount program with the National Rifle Association.\n\u2014 Symantec (@symantec) February 23, 2018  \n \n On the same day,\u00a0Chubb Limited\u00a0announced\u00a0that it will stop underwriting \u201cNRA Carry Guard,\u201d a policy marketed to NRA members who face legal or civil lawsuits after they shoot someone, which gun opponents sometimes\u00a0call \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d\u00a0A spokesman for Chubb told Reuters that the company had made the decision months ago, but its announcement of the fact on Friday only increased the perception of a boycott movement swelling against the NRA.\n It has now spread across multiple industries and affected some of the world\u2019s largest corporations. The global insurance company\u00a0Metlife said it has terminated discounts\u00a0for\u00a0NRA members. The hotel chains Best Western and Wyndham Hotels\u00a0announced they are no longer affiliated with the NRA.\n  Many of these companies, including Delta and United, have faced a backlash from NRA supporters. And the gun lobbyist, which is funded largely by its own members, is\u00a0unlikely to be moved by\u00a0snubs from\u00a0companies with which it had only loose and peripheral ties.\n Nor has the boycott movement been entirely successful. FedEx, for example, still\u00a0gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount\u00a0on shipping expenses.\n Gun-control organizations Moms Demand Action and Everytown sent a letter Friday asking five companies \u2014 Google, Amazon, Apple, ATT and Roku \u2014 to cease streaming NRATV, saying \u201cit\u2019s time for tech leaders to acknowledge their role in helping the NRA spread this dangerous content.\u201d\n But as more and more corporations break with the NRA, there are\u00a0signs that the movement is swaying lawmakers as well as corporations. For example, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and other Republicans have endorsed banning rifle sales to anyone under 21 \u2014\u00a0which the NRA opposes.\u00a0Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, on the other hand, was jeered at a recent town hall for accepting political contributions from the gun group.\n The NRA has not\u00a0commented on the boycott movement. But its leaders spoke\u00a0defiantly\u00a0at public appearances this week, blaming the public groundswell on media manipulation.\n \u201cMany in legacy media love mass shootings,\u201d NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Thursday at\u00a0a conservative political conference. \u201cCrying white mothers are ratings gold.\u201d\n \u201cThey want to make us all less free,\u201d NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said when he took the microphone after Loesch.\n The correct response to the Florida shooting, he said, was more armed security on school campus \u2014 not fewer guns in the United States.\n T.J.

Mueller III is now directly gunning for President Trump \u2014 and not just on one front. It appears that Mueller is investigating whether Trump himself committed misconduct or possible criminality on two fronts, and possibly more.\n NBC News is now reporting that Mueller has sent a subpoena to an unnamed witness\u00a0that appears to hint at just how wide a net Mueller has cast. NBC reports that the subpoena suggests Mueller is focused, among other things, on determining what Trump himself knew about Russian sabotage of the 2016 election as it was happening.\n The subpoena demands a range of documents that involve Trump himself, in addition to\u00a0nine\u00a0of his top campaign advisers and associates. The documents solicited include emails, texts, work papers, and telephone logs dating back to November of 2015, four months after Trump declared his presidential candidacy.\n This builds on NBC\u2019s previous report that Mueller\u2019s investigators are asking witnesses questions that indicate that Mueller is examining whether Trump knew that Democratic emails had been hacked before that became public, and whether he was somehow involved in their \u201cstrategic release.\u201d\u00a0As NBC\u2019s new report puts it:\n  The subpoena indicates that Mueller may be focused not just on what Trump campaign aides knew and when they knew it, but also on what Trump himself knew.\n  In a certain sense, it isn\u2019t that surprising to learn that Mueller is focused on what Trump knew about Russia\u2019s hacking of emails and interference in the election, and any potential conspiracy with them. Mueller is charged with investigating \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\u201d with Trump\u2019s campaign, as well as any other matters that arise from that line of inquiry. This was inevitably going to include what Trump himself knew and when.\n But the subpoena\u2019s search for documents dating all the way back to November of 2015, and its demand for documents relating to\u00a0so many of Trump\u2019s top associates \u201cindicates just how wide a net Mueller is casting,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig, a special counsel for Ken Starr\u2019s investigation into Bill Clinton, told me today.\n Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel under President Obama, added in an interview with me that the subpoena may serve as a reminder of Trump\u2019s centrality to the collusion tale.\n Indeed, as Bauer noted, the publicly known facts already point to Trump\u2019s centrality.\u00a0Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. eagerly held a meeting in June of 2016 with Russians in the full expectation that he\u2019d be getting dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. It has not been established whether Trump knew about that meeting. But recall that Trump himself helped draft the initial statement misleading the nation about the real purpose of that meeting.\n Also recall that former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon told author Michael Wolff that, in his view, the \u201cchance that Don Jr. did not walk\u201d the Russians \u201cup to his father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.\u201d (Bannon is one of the advisers the subpoena seeks documents about.)\n \u201cWe have the president apparently involved in drafting a fallacious statement on behalf of Don Jr. about what actually happened in the Trump Tower meeting,\u201d Bauer told me. \u201cWe have Bannon speculating \u2014 and I think this only stands to reason \u2014 that Don Jr. would never have arranged this meeting without his father knowing that it was coming. It\u00a0is known that the Trump campaign was communicating with the Russians about help for the campaign and that Trump was personally involved in an effort to conceal information about these contacts from the public.\u201d\n \u201cThe president in particular is right in the middle of questions about Russian interference,\u201d Bauer said.\n Also recall that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos\u2019 plea agreement with Mueller indicated that he had been informed in April of 2016 that the Russians collected \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. What\u2019s more, Dem Rep. Adam Schiff \u2014 the ranking Dem on the House Intelligence Committee probe \u2014 has now openly stated that information gathered by the committee shows that \u201cthe Russians previewed to Papadopoulous that they could help with disseminating these stolen emails.\u201d The question is whether Trump campaign higher-ups\u00a0were told of these things \u2014 and whether Trump knew of them.\n We don\u2019t know the answer to those questions, and again, it must be stressed that Mueller may find no evidence of coordination. But the already known facts are troubling enough on their own. And it\u2019s obvious that Mueller knows a lot more than we do.\n Trump has acted methodically to hamstring the Mueller probe\n Indeed, this feeds into the second way that Mueller is investigating Trump \u2014 for possible obstruction of justice. We learned last week that Mueller is closely scrutinizing Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of mind during his repeated efforts to push out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to determine whether the goal was to replace him with someone who would better protect him from the Mueller probe (Sessions had recused himself, enraging Trump). Mueller is trying to determine whether this conduct, along with Trump\u2019s firing of his FBI director, establishes a pattern that constitutes obstruction of justice. As I have argued, we know beyond any doubt that Trump has acted methodically, again and again and again, to constrain or derail the investigation, and only pulled back after those efforts were foiled.\n That particular conduct can potentially be explained by Mueller\u2019s scrutiny of what Trump and/or his associates knew and when about Russian efforts to sabotage the election on his behalf. This confluence doesn\u2019t prove anything, of course. But as Bauer put it to me:\u00a0\u201cTrump came into office frantic to deny any collusion with the Russians during the campaign, and from the beginning, he is apparently maneuvering to choke off an investigation by pressuring and then firing Comey, and attacking Sessions over the recusal. And so he added an obstruction inquiry to his problems.\u201d\n Beyond all this, we also know Mueller is scrutinizing whether\u00a0any White House policies might have been shaped by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s business discussions with foreigners during the transition. And who knows where that might lead.\n * NOTHING FROM CONGRESS ON ELECTION SECURITY: On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s former chief of staff\u00a0accused Republicans of refusing to forcefully condemn Russian sabotage of the 2016 election. The Post adds this:\n  Not one congressional panel looking into the Russia probe has released a bipartisan plan for how to strengthen election security, even though the 2018 primary season begins in certain states this month. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russian intervention, is expected to release recommendations later this month, though that will not mark the end of its probe.\n  And we have heard very little from the administration about its plans, ever since it was reported that Trump has not held a single cabinet meeting on the threat of more sabotage.\n * NOTHING FROM STATE DEPARTMENT ON ELECTION SECURITY: The New York Times reports that the State Department has spent none of the $120 million allotted to it for countering foreign sabotage of our elections:\n  As a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department\u2019s Global Engagement Center \u2014 which has been tasked with countering Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign \u2014 speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts. The delay is just one symptom of the largely passive response to the Russian interference by President Trump.\n  Is anyone else seeing a pattern here?\n * GOWDY: WE MAY GET ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL:\u00a0Some Republicans want a second special counsel to examine alleged Hillary Clinton wrongdoing in the fake Uranium One scandal, among other things. Rep. Trey Gowdy, the House GOP Oversight Committee chair,\u00a0told Fox News: \u201cI think we\u2019re trending perhaps towards another special counsel.\u201d\n We learned last fall that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is evaluating whether a second special counsel is merited, obviously in response to Trump\u2019s relentless demands that Sessions target Clinton. When are we going to hear back from Sessions on that?\n * GOP UNLEASHES AD BLITZ ON TAX PLAN: The Washington Examiner reports that American Action Network, the outside group allied with House GOP leaders, is unleashing a $1 million ad blitz touting the GOP tax cuts in 24 competitive House districts:\n  Republicans \u2026 want voters to make a direct connection between the tax bill and accelerated job and wage growth. \u2026 AAN and its sister organization, the super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund, are investing tens of millions of dollars to improve the image of the tax bill, viewing it as the key to any success Republicans might have in holding the party\u2019s 24-seat House majority.\n  But in the special election just outside Pittsburgh, Republicans have shifted away from tax cut messaging and towards attacks over illegal immigration, suggesting the tax message may be a bust.\n * STATES PRESS FORWARD WITH GUN-RIGHTS BILLS:\u00a0Talking Points Memo reports that numerous states have pressed forward with bills loosening regulations on firearms in the wake of the Parkland massacre. Note this:\n  Even as gun control legislation remains stalled in Congress, the NRA has campaigned for 15 measures in 11 states that would further loosen gun restrictions. Among other things, the bills would\u00a0strengthen existing stand-your-ground laws (Wyoming and Idaho), allow people to carry handguns without a permit (Oklahoma), and expand the list of places where people can carry guns (numerous states).\n  This is yet another reminder that if you want new gun regulations, you should channel some energy into Democratic efforts to win back ground on the state level.\n * DACA DEADLINE IS TODAY, AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN: Today is the day that the protections for the \u201cdreamers\u201d expire, and CNN reports that nothing is going to happen to protect them in Congress today or in the near future:\n  March 23 is the next government funding deadline, and some lawmakers have suggested they may try to use the must-pass package of funding bills as a point of leverage. But sources close to the process say it\u2019s more likely that efforts will be made to keep a bad deal out of the omnibus spending measure than to come up with a compromise to attach to it, as no solution has a clear path to passing either chamber.\n  The courts have put Trump\u2019s move on hold and have ordered the restarting of the program, so today\u2019s deadline means less. But make no mistake: The dreamers\u2019 future is still very much in limbo.\n * QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND, TRUMP-IS-A-DECISIVE LEADER EDITION: On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was pressed to say whether Trump\u2019s decision on tariffs is final. He replied:\n  \u201cWhatever his final decision is, is what will happen. \u2026 If he says something different, it\u2019ll be something different. I have no reason to think he\u2019s going to change. \u2026 He has made a decision at this point \u2026 If he for some reason should change his mind, then it\u2019ll change.\u201d\n  The most senior members of Trump\u2019s administration haven\u2019t got any earthly clue where the strong and decisive businessman president will end up.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Fred Barbash", "body": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.

A spokesman for Chubb told Reuters that the company informed the NRA of the decision three months ago; the policy has\u00a0faced criticism from gun-control groups who called it \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d\n The decisions came as the names of companies with NRA associations began circulating widely on the Internet and social media under the #BoycottNRA hashtag after the deadly Valentine\u2019s Day attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n A gunman wielding an AR-15 rifle killed 17 people and wounded at least 14 others, drawing anguished calls for a ban on assault weapons from students and families.\n The mass killing\u00a0focused renewed attention on the NRA, which is credited with blocking gun-control measures for years through millions of dollars in political campaign contributions and pressure from its large membership base.\n American businesses have become increasingly politically aware and have participated in boycotts over the past few years against states over LGBT rights. But the NRA is a well-funded membership operation devoted to a single cause\u00a0\u2014 guns\u00a0\u2014 and unlikely to be moved by the actions of companies with which it has such loose and peripheral ties.\n Like many other organizations, the NRA has benefit deals with companies designed to make membership more appealing. The\u00a0NRA \u201cmember benefits\u201d page\u00a0offers\u00a0savings on a credit card, hearing\u00a0aids, car rentals, travel, car purchases\u00a0and prescription drugs.\n FedEx, for example, gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount\u00a0on shipping expenses.\n FedEx has not said anything publicly about its NRA association in recent days; when reached around 4:30\u00a0ET on Friday afternoon, a company spokesperson said he had no information to provide.\n  Hashtags urging boycotts of specific companies involved in the deals have sprouted up across social media over the past several days.\u00a0People then started posting comments on the social media platforms of many of the companies urging them to take action.\n The Omaha bank appears to have been the first to respond publicly.\n   Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA.

On Friday evening, Alice Pereira, a spokeswoman for Avis Budget Group \u2014 the company mark for Avis, Budget and Zipcar\u00a0brands \u2014\u00a0confirmed that it will no longer provide the NRA member discount as of March 26.

Indiana got hit hard by threatened boycotts in 2015 when Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed legislation allowing businesses and individuals to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The Indiana legislature and Pence reversed the measure within two weeks.\n In 2016, North Carolina was the target of a business boycott after it enacted a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their assigned gender at birth. After the NCAA canceled tournaments in the state and PayPal decided not to build a new facility in the state, the legislation was partially repealed.\n The NRA claims\u00a05 million members and corporate allies in the gun industry that provide the organization with tens of millions of dollars per year.

Or was Hicks simply exhausted?\n Porter\u2019s job involved controlling the flow of paperwork, some of it classified and extremely sensitive, to the president. Because of those abuse allegations, however, he couldn\u2019t get a permanent top-secret security clearance. That was bad enough, but later we learned that dozens of White House officials, perhaps 100 or more, were working with only interim clearances, not permanent ones. Their access to secret information was cut off by Chief of Staff John F. Kelly \u2014 but only after all of this had become public.\n Among those now with limited access is Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose heavily indebted real estate empire and grudging disclosure of his many foreign contacts worried FBI investigators. Kushner is a senior adviser to the president whose many assignments include forging peace in the Middle East \u2014 but who now is not cleared for documents or meetings that discuss what\u2019s really happening in the Middle East or anywhere else. So why is he still there?\n Why was he there in the first place? Because of Trump\u2019s appalling nepotism.\n Trump also brought his daughter Ivanka into the White House as an adviser. What does she do? What qualifies her to do it? In a real administration, conservative or liberal, Kushner\u2019s office and Ivanka Trump\u2019s office would be occupied by experienced professionals who actually know something about diplomacy or administration or some government function.\n According to the New York Times, Kushner set up White House meetings for two business executives whose private equity firm and bank later made loans to the Kushner Companies real estate firm totaling more than $500 million. Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d was a cruel joke. He has expanded it into a vast protected wetland, to be enjoyed by friends and family.\n Never before have we had a president openly at war with his own attorney general. The Post reported Wednesday that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is investigating whether Trump\u2019s attempts to force Attorney General Jeff Sessions out of his job last summer were part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice. According to The Post, Trump\u2019s private name for Sessions is \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d a baby-boomer reference that younger readers will have to Google. \n Trump began his day Wednesday by tweeting that a decision Sessions recently made was \u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d Sessions responded by issuing a statement strongly rebutting Trump\u2019s criticism. And that evening, Sessions was photographed at a posh Washington restaurant dining with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein \u2014 who oversees the Mueller investigation \u2014 and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. If it wasn\u2019t a deliberate display of unity at the Justice Department, it sure looked like one.\n Also on Wednesday, Trump convened a televised negotiating session with members of Congress on the subject of gun violence. To the escalating horror of Republicans present, he heartily endorsed several Democratic gun control proposals \u2014 and then went much further, saying that in the case of individuals who are mentally unstable, authorities should \u201ctake the guns first, go through due process second.\u201d\n If President Barack Obama had ever said such a thing, we\u2019d be in the middle of Civil War II.\n Any other president who displayed such cavalier disregard for previous policy positions and total ignorance of basic facts would have provoked an uproar. Trump barely gets a shrug. Nobody expects him to be consistent. Nobody expects him to know anything about anything. He is defining the presidency down in a way that we must not tolerate.\n I spent years as a foreign correspondent in Latin America.

The real estate magnate, who owned the Miss Universe pageant, wrote the note at a time when he was looking to expand his brand to Russia.\n The letter, the first known attempt at direct outreach by Trump to Putin, has been turned over to investigators probing Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign. It is unclear whether Trump\u2019s missive was ever delivered to the Russian president \u2014 and if so, whether Putin responded.\n John Dowd, an attorney for President Trump, said he was not familiar with the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s all nonsense,\u201d he said. A White House spokesman and attorneys for the Trump Organization declined to comment.\n At the time, Trump made no secret that he hoped Putin would attend the Miss Universe pageant, which was being held in Russia for the first time.\n In a June\u00a018, 2013, tweet, Trump wrote: \u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow \u2014 if so, will he become my new best friend?\u201d\u00a0\n His letter to Putin was written that month, according to the people familiar with the document.\n The pageant was part of a years-long effort to bring the Trump name to Russia. Trump has repeatedly sought to build a tower in Russia since the late 1980s, without success.\n But in 2013, a new opportunity emerged through another business he owned: the Miss Universe pageant.\n Trump was approached by billionaire Moscow developer Aras Agalarov and his pop star son, Emin, who said they would pay to bring Miss Universe to the Russian capital.\n  [Inside Trump\u2019s financial ties to Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin] \n Trump was eager for Putin to attend the event, but the Russian president canceled a planned appearance at the last minute, Aras Agalarov told The Washington Post in a 2016 interview.\n \u201cThat was a very complicated situation then, because I promised Trump he would meet Putin,\u201d Agalarov said.\n Instead, Putin sent a \u201cfriendly\u201d letter and a gift of a Russian lacquered box, he said. \u201cSo he was leaving with very warm feelings,\u201d Agalarov said. \u201cHe was very happy.\u201d\n During the pageant, Trump suggested that Putin was following the event and Trump\u2019s role in it. \u201cI do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today,\u201d Trump told MSNBC while in Moscow.\n Investigators for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III have asked witnesses questions about the Miss Universe pageant and Trump\u2019s interest in having Putin attend the event, according to people familiar with the inquiry.\n Mueller\u2019s team also has examined Trump\u2019s relationship with the Agalarovs, which extended beyond the 2013 pageant.\n In June 2016, a music promoter representing Emin Agalarov emailed one of Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr., and asked if he would meet with a Russian lawyer who the promoter said could give him damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\u201d Trump Jr. responded. Days later, he met with the lawyer at Trump Tower in New York. A U.S.-based employee for the Agalarovs also attended, as did Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump Jr. has said that no information about Clinton was provided at the meeting.\n Over the years, Donald Trump has offered inconsistent stories about whether he met Putin before he became president.\n In October 2013, a month before the Miss Universe pageant, he told late-night host David Letterman that Putin was a\u00a0\u201ctough guy\u201d and that he had \u201cmet him once.\u201d\u00a0\n During a Republican primary debate in November 2015, Trump said that he knew Putin\u00a0\u201cvery well.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n But in July 2016, he told a CBS affiliate in Miami, \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do, I never met Putin, I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0\n By that time, Russia was widely suspected of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, which had been published by WikiLeaks.\u00a0\n \u201cI don\u2019t know who Putin is,\u201d Trump said at a news conference the same day. \u201cHe said one nice thing about me.

The 2011 map that has been used this decade has resulted in Republicans consistently winning 13 of the state\u2019s 18 congressional seats.\n Monday\u2019s action was the second time that the court declined to get involved in the partisan battle that has roiled Pennsylvania politics. The commonwealth\u2019s highest court earlier this year ruled that a map drawn by the Republicans leaders in 2011 \u201cclearly, plainly and palpably\u201d violated the Free and Equal Elections Clause of the Pennsylvania constitution.\n  [Supreme Court declines to get involved in Pennsylvania gerrymandering case] \n The U.S. Supreme Court deliberated nearly two weeks before turning down the request to stop the map from being used in this fall\u2019s elections.

There were no noted dissents. \n  Under a new map drawn by a nonpartisan expert and adopted by Democratic justices of Pennsylvania\u2019s elected supreme court, analysts say Republicans start with an edge in 10 of the 18 districts. Pennsylvania traditionally is a purple state, and currently has a legislature controlled by Republicans, a governor who is a Democrat and a U.S. senator from each party.\n Candidates face a Tuesday deadline to qualify to run for the redrawn seats.\n Political analysts say the changes in Pennsylvania might aid national Democrats in their attempt to flip the House from Republican control. Democrats need to take about two dozen seats to win the majority, and Pennsylvania could provide some of that total. Six incumbents, five of them Republicans, have said they will not be on the fall ballot.\n Pennsylvania\u2019s top Republicans have fought the imposition of a new plan since the state supreme court ruled. They have received encouragement from President Trump, who tweeted they should challenge the new map \u201call the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\u201d\n \u201cYour Original was correct!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes  waste money!\u201d\n Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. turned down the state\u2019s first request on Feb. 5, after the state supreme court ordered a new map.\n After the map was adopted, the legislative leaders were back, renewing their plea that the Pennsylvania justices were taking away the power that rightfully belongs to the state legislature to draw congressional lines.\n \u201cThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court conspicuously seized the redistricting process and prevented any meaningful ability for the legislature to enact a remedial map to ensure a court-drawn map,\u201d said state House Speaker Michael C. Turzai and Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph B. Scarnati III.\n But those who challenged the 2011 map as an improper partisan gerrymander said the state was making arguments the U.S. Supreme Court already has rejected.\n \u201cTheir latest stay application is just another ploy to preserve congressional districts that violate Pennsylvania\u2019s Constitution for one more election cycle,\u201d said a brief for the League of Women Voters, adding, \u201cIt would be unprecedented for this Court to interfere with the state court\u2019s determination about its own state\u2019s law.\u201d\n The challengers pointed out that qualifying has already begun under the new map, and \u201cat least 150 candidates in all 18 new districts have begun collecting voter signatures on nomination petitions\u201d for May 15 primaries.\n Pennsylvania election officials have said changing the process again would require postponing the primaries and could cost the commonwealth $20 million.\n The victory in Pennsylvania for opponents of partisan gerrymandering suggest a new mode of attack, by challenging redistricting in state courts under state constitutions.\n The U.S. Supreme Court has never thrown out a state\u2019s redistricting plan because it has found it so infected with partisan bias that it violates voters\u2019 constitutional rights.\n  But the court has on its current docket two cases--one from Wisconsin and one from Maryland--that raise the question.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Eli Rosenberg", "body": "Former Senate\u00a0candidate Roy Moore (R) in December 2017 after his loss to Doug Jones (D) in the special U.S. Senate race in Alabama.

But never has Kudlow been as spectacularly wrong as he was before the signal economic event of our time. If you heeded Kudlow\u2019s advice in the months before the 2008 crash, you would have been ruined.\n Even as trouble became clear, Kudlow, a CNBC pundit who is not trained in economics, wrote a Feb. 5, 2008, column in National Review saying he was \u201cstill betting on and buying Goldilocks [a just-right scenario] for the long run.\u201d He wrote, \u201cMaybe we are going to have a mild correction.

It\u2019s nothing to get up in arms about.\u201d\n Move along. Nothing to see here.\n When the economy didn\u2019t rebound and housing continued its collapse, Kudlow pronounced, in a CNBC column on July 24, 2008, that he saw in the data \u201can awful lot of very good new news, which appear to be pointing to a bottom in the housing problem; in fact, maybe the tiniest beginnings of a recovery.\u201d Stocks lost nearly half their value in the coming months.\n All of this is to say Kudlow should fit right in with his new colleagues in the Trump administration.\n This is the same president, after all, who tapped to be the chief scientist at the Agriculture Department a talk-radio host who is not a scientist, named a brain surgeon to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development and floated the idea of his personal pilot as head the Federal Aviation Administration.

He added that the president had phoned him a few hours earlier when the news broke of his selection to be director of the National Economic Council. \u201cThe president called and he said, \u2018It\u2019s out,\u2019\u201d Kudlow recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018You\u2019re on the air\u2026 I\u2019m looking at a picture of you\u2026 Very handsome!\u2019 So Trumpian.\u201d\n   Then-Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland watches Jeff Sessions get sworn in as attorney general in the Oval Office last year. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n \n -- But installing cable pundits in decision-making jobs has not worked out very well for Trump thus far. Foreign policy pros were aghast when Trump named K.T. McFarland as his deputy national security adviser during the transition. She had appeared frequently on Fox as an analyst and anchored her own program called \u201cDEFCON3.\" But the last time she\u2019d worked in government was more than three decades earlier, as a junior Pentagon spokeswoman and speechwriter.\n McFarland got marginalized after Michael Flynn went down. Then Trump nominated her to be ambassador to Singapore, but her nomination needed to be withdrawn when damning emails implicated her in the Russia scandal and imperiled her Senate confirmation.\n Trump initially named another Fox talking head, Monica Crowley, as the senior director of strategic communications for the NSC. He stood by her for more than a week as news stories revealed egregious examples of plagiarism over several years, from a 2012 book to her PhD dissertation and op-eds. Just before the inauguration, under pressure, the president-elect dumped her.\n Former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie, 34, was forced to resign two months ago as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service after CNN uncovered bigoted statements he had made about African Americans, immigrants and gays as the host of an Internet radio show. He got the patronage because he had been a go-to Trump defender on Fox, CNN and MSNBC during the 2016 campaign.\n America First Priorities, a Trump-sanctioned outside group, hired the 34-year-old on Thursday as its new advocacy director, with the expectation that he\u2019ll again appear on TV to promote the president. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m coming back into the fray does not mean that the president endorses those comments by any stretch,\u201d Higbie told the Hartford Courant yesterday. \u201cWe\u2019ve all said something we\u2019ve regretted. I just happened to say it on the radio. \u2026 But I\u2019m committed to this administration and its policies.\u201d\n   An advertisement for \u201cFox And Friends\u201d outside the show's studio in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n \n -- The president reportedly has fewer events on his schedule than he did during the opening year of his presidency so that he can have extra \u201cexecutive time\u201d in the residence, which is a euphemism for watching television. That\u2019s only intensified the cable news feedback loop. Trump\u2019s tweets routinely echo messages, sometimes word for word, that he heard on Fox minutes earlier. Remember Trump\u2019s tweet about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u201cbutton\u201d?\n   The president just threatened a nuclear strike while live-tweeting a Fox News segment. \n\nLeft, Fox, 7:37 pm\nRight, Trump, 7:49 pm pic.twitter.com/vJciYH6LIA\n\u2014 Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) January 3, 2018   \n The president\u2019s cable habit almost led him to torpedo a compromise his own administration had negotiated to reauthorize Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act in January. \u201cTrump issued an early morning tweet in response to Judge Andrew Napolitano\u2019s criticism on a \u2018Fox and Friends\u2019 segment,\u201d Tufts University professor Daniel Drezner notes. \u201cOnly direct intervention from the chief of staff, national security adviser, director of national intelligence, CIA director, and House Speaker Paul Ryan convinced Trump to post a follow-up tweet clarifying his position.\u201d\n Last Friday, Trump pardoned a former Navy sailor whose conviction for unauthorized retention of national defense information had made him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on Fox. Commentators have often argued that the year he served in prison for taking pictures aboard a submarine showed Hillary Clinton was treated too leniently for how she mishandled classified material.\n Kristian Saucier, 31, who is now a garbage collector in Vermont, had appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d earlier in the week to press his case. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s two different sets of laws in this country, for the political elite and for, you know, those lower-level, individuals, Americans, like myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my case draws a very clear example of that.\u201d\n   Former Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier: I mishandled classified info, pled guilty to that mistake and continue to be punished, meanwhile Hillary Clinton gets to run for president pic.twitter.com/YKx8dgeKQ3\n\u2014 FOX  friends (@foxandfriends) March 4, 2018   \n \u201cA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on its involvement, if any, in the process,\u201d Matt Zapotosky reports.\n The only other pardon Trump has issued since taking office was for Joe Arpaio, who also frequently appears on Fox shows. The former Arizona sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge\u2019s order to stop racially profiling Latinos.\n -- Trump plainly enjoys the company of people he sees on TV. Trump invited Sebastian Gorka, a lightning rod who got fired from the White House last year but now spends a lot of time defending the president on Fox, over for dinner last week. Jesse Watters, a co-host of Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Five,\u201d joined them. \u201cAccording to a White House official and two other sources familiar with the meeting, Trump invited Gorka and Watters because \u2018he couldn\u2019t get enough of them on TV,\u2019 as one source put it, and wanted to confab with them about what he\u2019d seen on Fox News, politics, gossip, and his administration,\u201d The Daily Beast reported.\n Watters tweeted a picture of the menu afterward:\n  -- The embattled president also appears to be putting a greater premium on loyalty as he makes personnel decisions. He clearly feels burned by some of his early hiring decisions. For example, Trump interviewed Jeanine Pirro, the host of Fox\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine,\u201d to be deputy attorney general. Instead, he went along with Rod Rosenstein, a respected DOJ insider who he had no prior relationship with. That\u2019s a decision he\u2019s repeatedly said that he regrets.\n -- Trump\u2019s embrace of talking heads has become a punch line in popular culture. \u201cTo help find [Gary Cohn\u2019s] replacement, the president turned to his most trusted confidante: the TV in his bedroom,\u201d Comedy Central host Trevor Noah said on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d last night. \u201cBasically, if Trump sees you on TV, there\u2019s a really good chance that he\u2019ll hire you. By the time his term is done, his attorney general is going to be \u2018Judge Judy\u2019 and his housing secretary will be \u2018Bob the Builder.\u2019\u201d\n   WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n  -- The death toll rose to six in the bridge collapse near Miami. The new pedestrian bridge hailed for its novel construction collapsed onto moving traffic, crushing at least eight vehicles and leaving rescue workers racing to free victims. Francisco Alvarado, Susan Svrluga, Faiz Siddiqui and Aaron C. Davis report: \u201cThe bridge was designed to connect the city of Sweetwater with the sprawling campus of Florida International University, and to make it safer for students to cross a frenetic roadway. \u2018It was going to be a significant project,\u2019 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Thursday night. \u2018To see it on the ground and underneath it those who died and who were injured is a tragedy.\u2019 He said the cause of the collapse will be fully investigated. \u2018The victims and their families deserve to know what went wrong.\u2019\u201d\n   Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump walk out of a church service with their children.

(Cindy Boren, Jacob Bogage, Des Bieler and Matt Bonesteel)   THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n -- Robert Mueller has issued his first known subpoena to the Trump Organization, ordering the company to turn over all documents related to Russia and other areas of its investigation. The New York Times\u2019s Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cThe breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents \u2026 There are few other publicly known examples of Mr. Mueller using subpoenas. \u2026 [But it] is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will drag on for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena comes as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump\u2019s political activities.\u201d\n -- The Trump administration imposed new financial sanctions against Russian\u00a0hackers and spy agencies\u00a0in response to a spate of cyberattacks.\u00a0Ellen Nakashima reports: \u201cSanctions also were imposed on individuals known as \u2018trolls\u2019 and the Russian organizations \u2014 including the [Internet Research Agency]\u2014 that supported their efforts to undermine the election. Additionally, the administration alerted the public that Russia is targeting the U.S. energy grid with computer malware that could sabotage the systems. Taken together, the moves represent the administration\u2019s most significant actions to date against Russia for its aggression against the United States, though analysts say their impact is mostly symbolic.\u201d\n -- The new sanctions fall well short of what lawmakers authorized last year. Anne Gearan and Ellen Nakashima write: \u201cSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the sanctions announcement a \u2018long overdue response\u2019 but noted that the administration has failed to implement six other mandatory provisions of the law enacted last year, including penalties affecting Russian defense and other industries.\u201d\n -- Scary:\u00a0\u201cAmerican officials and private cybersecurity experts uncovered a series of Russian attacks aimed at the energy, water and aviation sectors and critical manufacturing, including nuclear plants, in the United States and Europe,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Nicole Perlroth and David Sanger report. \u201cIn [an urgent June report], the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. notified operators about the attacks but stopped short of identifying Russia as the culprit. By then, Russian spies had compromised the business networks of several American energy, water and nuclear plants, mapping out their corporate structures and computer networks. They included that of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear plant near Burlington, Kan. \u2026 Forensic analysis suggested that Russian spies were looking for inroads \u2014 although it was not clear whether the goal was to conduct espionage or sabotage, or to trigger an explosion of some kind.\u201d\n -- The United States, France and Germany joined Britain in denouncing Russia for the brazen assassination attempt of a former Russian spy and his daughter, saying\u00a0the poisoning was the \u201cfirst offensive use of a nerve agent\u201d in Europe since World War II. \u201cThe joint statement signaled another step in the mounting international pressure on Russia over apparent ties to the assault,\u201d Karla Adam and Matthew Bodner report, though it did not spell out any possible further reprisals by the U.K. or its allies.\u00a0Russia plans to retaliate in similar fashion, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov telling reporters \u201cof course, we will\u201d when asked whether the country would expel British diplomats.\n   Special counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller on Capitol Hill.

Democratic investigators for that committee\u2019s Senate counterpart also are interested in what she may know about relationships between the NRA or its allies and wealthy Russians\u00a0\u2026Mitchell told McClatchy in an email that any suggestion she has concerns about the NRA's Russia connections is a 'complete fabrication.'\u201d\n -- House Republicans fear they fumbled the rollout of their Russia report.\u00a0Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney reports: \u201cThe blaring headline the GOP wanted from this week\u2019s rollout was clear: After a year of searching, Republicans on [House intel] found no evidence that [Trump] or his associates aided Moscow\u2019s scheme to interfere in the 2016 election[.] \u2026\u00a0Instead, much of the focus has been on lawmakers\u2019 startling conclusion that the nation's intelligence agencies botched their analysis when they determined Russia wanted Trump to defeat Hillary Clinton.The finding once again pitted the committee's Republicans against the leaders of the intelligence community and led to a frenzy of news coverage that put members on the defensive.\u201d\n  INSTITUTIONALIZED CHAOS:\n -- Based on 19 interviews with presidential advisers and administration officials, Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker\u00a0and Carol D. Leonnig paint a must read portrait of the turmoil: \u201cThe mood inside the White House in recent days has verged on mania, as Trump increasingly keeps his own counsel and senior aides struggle to determine the gradations between rumor and truth. At times, they say, they are anxious and nervous, wondering what each new headline may mean for them personally. But in other moments, they appear almost as characters in an absurdist farce \u2014 openly joking about whose career might end with the next presidential tweet. \u2026 The president is enjoying the process of assessing his team and making changes, tightening his inner circle to those he considers survivors and who respect his unconventional style, one senior White House official said.\u201d\n Here are five of the juiciest nuggets from the piece:\n Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s ouster has been widely speculated about for weeks:\u00a0\u201cBut two top officials said Trump on Thursday morning expressed disbelief to Vice President Pence, senior advisers and Kelly himself that Kelly\u2019s name was surfacing on media watch lists because his job is secure. Trump and Kelly then laughed about it \u2026 But others in the West Wing say Kelly\u2019s departure could be imminent, and Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been mentioned as a possible new chief of staff.\u201d\n Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt \u201chas made no secret inside the West Wing of his ambition to become attorney general should Trump decide to fire Jeff Sessions\": \u201cWhite House officials have grown agitated that Pruitt and his allies are privately pushing for the EPA chief to replace Sessions, a job Pruitt has told people he wants. On Wednesday night, Kelly called Pruitt and told him the president was happy with his performance at EPA and that he did not need to worry about the Justice Department, according to two people familiar with the conversation \u2026\n \u201cWith Hope Hicks resigning her post as communications director, the internal jockeying to replace her has been especially intense between Mercedes Schlapp, who oversees the White House\u2019s long-term communications planning, and Tony Sayegh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s top communications adviser.\n \u201cAnother episode haunting [VA secretary] Shulkin was a trip to the Invictus Games in Canada last September with first lady Melania Trump\u2019s entourage. Shulkin fought with East Wing aides over his request that his wife accompany him on the trip because he was eager for her to meet Britain\u2019s Prince Harry, who founded the games, according to multiple officials familiar with the dispute. The first lady\u2019s office explained there was not room on the plane for Shulkin\u2019s wife, and officials said the secretary was unpleasant during the trip \u2026\n \u201cTrump has sometimes expressed confusion about what agencies and secretaries are in charge of what duties, a senior administration official said. For example, this official said, he has complained to Pruitt about regulatory processes for construction projects, although the EPA is not in charge of the regulations.\u201d\n   John McEntee walks onto the South Lawn of the White House.(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n \n ALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN:\n -- Trump\u2019s personal aide John McEntee lost his White House job\u00a0after a security clearance investigation revealed he was a frequent gambler who bet tens of thousands of dollars at a time. Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThere was no indication his gambling was illegal, but there was concern that the 27-year-old could be vulnerable to outside influence \u2026 McEntee, who had been one of the first staffers to join the Trump campaign \u2026 was escorted off the White House grounds Monday after being notified that he was being let go. McEntee was \u2018very upset\u2019 \u2026 and complained he had done nothing improper. Two White House advisers said they learned about McEntee\u2019s gambling habit after his dismissal. His hasty exit ... upset a number of staffers in the building, who described him as a loyal aide who deserved a more ceremonious departure.\u201d\n -- Newly released documents showed Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s military flights have cost taxpayers nearly $1 million. From Politico\u2019s Victoria Guida: \u201cThat includes a one-week trip to the Middle East in late October, which cost $183,646 for flights on military aircraft. That trip came on top of $811,797.81 in previously reported expenditures for government-funded military aircraft.\u201d\n -- Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe went to the Justice Department\u00a0to make a final plea that he not be fired before his retirement benefits\u00a0kick in. The bureau\u2019s disciplinary officer recommended that McCable be fired, but\u00a0it's\u00a0up to Jeff Sessions. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cMcCabe has become a lightning rod in the partisan squabbling over the Russia investigation and the political probes involving [the Clintons]. ... If the veteran FBI agent is not terminated, that might upset conservatives and Trump, who feel he has been given undeserved leniency. If he is, supporters in the FBI might feel he has been treated too harshly because of pressure from the president.\u201d\u00a0Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacked McCabe from the podium\u00a0during yesterday's briefing: \u201cWe do think that it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor.\u201d\n -- A senior adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development resigned amid allegations that he committed fraud and exaggerated his biography. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine reports: \u201cIn November 2013, a judge ordered [Naved] Jafry and a fuel company he chaired to repay more than $800,000 to the family of Alfred Oglesby, a former NFL player and investor in [Jafry\u2019s] fuel firm, who died in 2009. Oglesby\u2019s widow accused Jafry of fraud. Jafry has not paid the money. Debt collectors said they had been trying to locate him for years. \u2026 During an interview, Jafry described himself as a veteran of the US army and said he was deployed to Kosovo. When confronted with his service record, though, he said he in fact served as a reservist in the army national guard, and remained in California while giving logistics support to colleagues in Kosovo.\u201d\n -- Trump\u2019s top trade adviser Peter Navarro received backing from an American steel company to produce a documentary on the dangers of China\u2019s trade policy. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos and Rebecca Ballhaus report: \u201cNucor made payments to fund the film through a San Diego nonprofit then led by a friend of Mr. Navarro. The arrangement was examined as part of a broader 2012 FBI investigation of the nonprofit\u2019s finances, according to three former employees of the nonprofit. No charges were filed.\u201d\n -- Top House Democrats said they have proof\u00a0State Department employees were ousted because\u00a0they were viewed as \u201cdisloyal\u201d to Trump. From Karoun Demirjian and Carol Morello: \u201cThe ranking Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Government Reform committees sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, writing that they received documents [from a whistleblower] \u2018indicating that high-level officials at the White House and State Department worked with a network of conservative activists to conduct a \u201ccleaning\u201d of employees they believed were not sufficiently \u201csupportive\u201d of President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u2019\u201d\n -- Emails reveal administration officials and conservative agitators, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, specifically tried to oust Sahar Nowrouzzadeh\u00a0from State over her role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. Politico\u2019s Nahal Toosi reports: \u201cA conservative website had published an article depicting Nowrouzzadeh as a Barack Obama loyalist who had \u2018burrowed into the government\u2019 under Trump and even had ties to the hated Iranian regime itself. \u2026 The emails show that State Department and White House officials repeatedly shared such misleading information about Nowrouzzadeh, deriding her as an Obama cheerleader and strong advocate for the nuclear deal with Iran ...\u00a0Later, after Nowrouzzadeh was reassigned to another job, some [State]\u00a0officials tried to mislead a POLITICO reporter about whether she\u2019d completed her full tenure [on the Policy Planning Staff].\u201d\n -- The White House has refused to comply with all three Republican-led House committees seeking information on\u00a0top Trump top aides \u2014 including Cabinet leaders and Jared Kushner.

From Karoun Demirjian: \u201c[Feinstein] wrote in a letter Thursday that senators need \u2018the complete picture\u2019 of Haspel\u2019s involvement to \u2018fully and fairly\u2019 review her fitness for the job. \u2026 \u2018The American people deserve to know the actual role the person nominated to the director of the CIA played in what I consider to be one of the darkest chapters in American history.'\u201d\n  THE REST OF TRUMP'S AGENDA:\n -- The Trump administration is finalizing a plan\u00a0urging\u00a0stronger law-enforcement measures for drug dealers \u2014 including the death penalty. The plan has alarmed health advocates and some GOP lawmakers, who warned that capital punishment will only worsen efforts to reduce the drug crisis. Politico\u2019s Dan Diamond reports: \u201cThe ambitious plan \u2026 could be announced as soon as Monday when [Trump] visits New Hampshire, a state hard hit by the epidemic \u2026 According to language circulating this week, the Trump administration will call for the death penalty as an option in \u2018certain cases where opioid, including Fentanyl-related, drug dealing and trafficking are directly responsible for death.\u2019 However, the plan could cost billions of dollars more than Trump budgeted \u2014 and likely far more than any funding package that Congress would approve \u2014 raising questions about how much of it can actually be put into practice.\u201d\n -- The White House defended Trump\u2019s false claim the United States has a trade deficit with Canada.\u00a0Josh Dawsey and Damian Paletta report: \u201c\u2018The president was accurate because there is a trade deficit and that was the point he was making,\u2019 said [Sarah Huckabee Sanders], who later referred to a figure that includes only goods and not services. \u2018He didn\u2019t have to look at the specific figures.\u2019 \u2026 Canadian government spokesmen repeated U.S. government statistics pointing out that Canada has a trade surplus with their American neighbor. \u2018Canada and the United States have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship,\u2019 said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, pointing to official U.S. statistics.\u201d\n -- The International Wildlife Conservation Council, a new Interior Department advisory board entrusted to help rewrite regulations on importing hunting trophies, includes several trophy hunters. The AP\u2019s Michael Biesecker, Jake Pearson and Jeff Horwitz report: \u201cOne appointee co-owns a private New York hunting preserve with Trump\u2019s adult sons. \u2026 Appointees [also] include celebrity hunting guides, representatives from rifle and bow manufacturers, and wealthy sportspeople who boast of bagging the coveted \u2018Big Five\u2019 \u2014 elephant, rhino, lion, leopard and Cape buffalo.

McCabe was serving as acting FBI director at the time. (Alex Brandon/AP) \n   MORE THAN the details of the case, President Trump\u2019s tweet early Saturday celebrating the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe is what stands out: a marquee of bullying and unseemly behavior by a president. Mr. Trump acts like a nasty, small-minded despot, not the leader of a democracy more than two centuries old in which rule of law is a sturdy pillar. If there is doubt that the timing of Mr. McCabe\u2019s dismissal was driven by political vengeance, Mr. Trump does everything he can to prove the worst with his own sordid words. \n This is the language of a banana republic. In nations without a strong democratic foundation, tyrants cling to power by belittling perceived enemies and insulting and coopting other institutions, such as a free press, law enforcement and the military, coercing them into subservience. Just look around the world at practices today in Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Turkey, to name a few. The banana republic playbook has no place in the United States, not in a town hall, not in a statehouse, least of all in the Oval Office. \n Mr. McCabe is a 21-year-veteran of the FBI and served as deputy director under James B. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired earlier. A Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report, not yet public, reportedly  found that he authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about an investigation involving Hillary Clinton and then misled investigators. He disputes the allegations, noting that he had authority to share the information and corrected what he told investigators. He previously stepped down from the deputy director\u2019s job and was preparing to retire from the FBI on Sunday, which would have assured him of a full federal pension. The rushed timing of the firing on Friday night by Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 whose own job security is perpetually threatened  by Mr. Trump \u2014 robs Mr. McCabe of that full pension.\n As Mr. Trump knows, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been reported to be looking into possible obstruction of justice in the firing of Mr. Comey. Mr. McCabe could be a vital witness in such a prosecution. Now the president has attempted to discredit, and lauded the punishment of, a potential witness against him, an affront to the integrity and independence of law enforcement. \n Mr. McCabe\u2019s actions as deputy FBI director are hard to evaluate without release of the inspector general\u2019s report, due out this spring. There will be time to judge him then. What is clear today is that the president jumped on Mr. McCabe with unseemly ferocity, tweeting: \u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI \u2014 A great day for Democracy.\u201d \n In fact, the hardworking men and women of the FBI, the Justice Department, the intelligence agencies and elsewhere in government come to work every day to uphold the values of a democratic system based on rule of law \u2014 a system that is distinguished by the simple principle that everyone is judged fairly, not by grudge or whim, and that no one is above the law, not even the president.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Matt Zapotosky", "body": "President Trump has renewed his attacks on special counsel Robert S.

Mueller III, who heads the team, is a longtime registered Republican. He was appointed by another Republican, Rod Rosenstein, who Trump himself nominated as deputy attorney general. But publicly available voter registration information shows that 13 of the 17 members of Mueller's team have previously registered as Democrats, while four had no affiliation or their affiliation could not be found.\n Nine of the 17 made political donations to Democrats, their contributions totaling more than $57,000.

McCabe had been involved in the Russia probe, and Trump and his lawyer seized on his ouster to attack the special counsel.\n \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" Trump wrote Saturday night. \"It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\"\n A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment for this story. The special counsel team is composed of veteran white collar lawyers and prosecutors who are among the most respected in the legal world. They have a broad range of experience in fraud, public corruption, cyber and terrorism cases. Legal analysts have said previously they could see no significant legal or ethical concerns with the team members' political giving, and noted Justice Department policies prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of politics.\n [ McCabe is said to have written memos detailing his interactions with Trump ]\n Some lawyers, though, said the team's makeup creates an optical problem for Mueller, as conservatives might not trust what the team ultimately finds, especially with respect to the president. Mueller's critics, too, already had ammunition to criticize the special counsel investigators as biased, after messages were released showing two top FBI officials involved in the case\u00a0\u2014 agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page\u00a0\u2014 exchanged texts disparaging Trump.\n The two no longer work for the special counsel. Mueller removed Strzok after the Justice Department's inspector general found the texts, and Page already had left for what officials said were unrelated reasons. Federal records show neither Page nor Strzok made any political donations.\n Lawyers at the Justice Department\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from which Mueller drew the bulk of his team\u00a0\u2014 are generally thought to be left leaning, while the FBI is generally thought of as a more conservative institution.

And several administration officials said Trump was particularly determined to follow through on this specific set of tariffs, as criticism of U.S.-China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign.\n Trump plans to impose the tariffs at a time when he has much of the world on edge over his pivot to protectionism. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put \u201cAmerica First\u201d on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as he muscled a tax cut bill through Congress.\n That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House. \n One of President Trump\u2019s top advisers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a \u201ctrade war.\u201d \n Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have alleged that China should make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn\u2019t work.\n Still, Trump\u2019s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolate him, particularly on economic issues.

He fumes in private that just about every time he looks up at a television screen, the cable news headlines are trumpeting yet another scandal. He voices frustration that son-in-law Jared Kushner has few on-air defenders. He revives old grudges. And he confides to friends that he is uncertain who he can trust.\n Trump\u2019s closest West Wing confidant, Hope Hicks \u2014 the communications director who often acted as a de facto Oval Office therapist \u2014 announced her resignation last week, leaving behind a team the president views more as paid staff than surrogate family. So concerned are those around Trump that some of the president\u2019s oldest friends have been urging one another to be in touch \u2014 the sort of familiar contacts that often lift his spirits.\n In an unorthodox presidency in which emotion, impulse and ego often drive events, Trump\u2019s ominous moods manifested themselves last week in his zigzagging positions on gun control; his shock trade war that jolted markets and was opposed by Republican leaders and many in his own administration; and his roiling feud of playground insults with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n   President Trump attends a meeting with lawmakers about trade policy in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Feb. 13, 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n Some of Trump\u2019s advisers say the president is not all doom and gloom, however. He has been pleased with the news coverage of his role in the gun debate and lighthearted moments have leavened his days, such as a recent huddle with staff to prepare his comedic routine for the Gridiron, a Saturday night dinner with Washington officials and journalists.\n Still, Trump\u2019s friends are increasingly concerned about his well-being, worried that the president\u2019s obsession with cable commentary and perceived slights is taking a toll on the 71-year-old. \u201cPure madness,\u201d lamented one exasperated ally.\n Retired four-star Army general Barry McCaffrey said the American people \u2014 and Congress especially \u2014 should be alarmed.\n \u201cI think the president is starting to wobble in his emotional stability and this is not going to end well,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cTrump\u2019s judgment is fundamentally flawed, and the more pressure put on him and the more isolated he becomes, I think, his ability to do harm is going to increase.\u201d\n This portrait of Trump at a moment of crisis just over a year after taking office is based on interviews with 22 White House officials, friends and advisers to the president and other administration allies, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss Trump\u2019s state of mind.\n The tumult comes as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and the president\u2019s possible obstruction of justice has intensified. Meanwhile, Kushner, a White House senior adviser, was stripped last week of his access to the nation\u2019s top secrets amid increasing public scrutiny of his foreign contacts and of his mixing of business and government work.\n Trump has been asking people close to him whether they believe Kushner or his company have done anything wrong, according to a senior administration official. Two advisers said the president repeatedly tells aides that the Russia investigation will not ensnare him \u2014 even as it ensnares others around him \u2014 and that he believes the American people are finally starting to conclude that the Democrats, as opposed to his campaign, colluded with the Russians. \n   Nick Ayers, Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff, left, and Gary Cohn, the National Economic Council director, listen as President Trump addresses governors in the State Dining Room of hte White House on Feb. 26, 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n  [\u2018Jared has faded\u2019: Inside the 28 days of tumult that left Kushner badly diminished] \n Still, the developments have delivered one negative headline after another, leading Trump to lose his cool \u2014 especially in the evenings and early mornings, when he often is most isolated, according to advisers.\n For instance, aides said, Trump seethed with anger last Wednesday night over cable-news coverage of a photo, obtained by Axios, showing Sessions at dinner with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia investigation, and another top Justice Department prosecutor. The outing was described in news reports as amounting to an act of solidarity after Trump had attacked Sessions in a tweet that morning.\n The next morning, Trump was still raging about the photo, venting to friends and allies about a dinner he viewed as an intentional show of disloyalty.\n Trump has long been furious with Sessions for recusing himself from oversight of the Russia probe, and privately mocks him as \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d an elderly and bumbling cartoon character. But this past week the president was irate that his attorney general had asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general \u2014 as opposed to criminal prosecutors \u2014 to investigate alleged misdeeds by the FBI in obtaining surveillance warrants.\n On Friday morning, Trump targeted his ire elsewhere. About an hour after Fox News Channel aired a segment about comedian Alec Baldwin saying he had tired of impersonating Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Trump lit into Baldwin on Twitter, initially misspelling his first name. \u201cIt was agony for those who were forced to watch,\u201d the president wrote at 5:42 a.m.\n \u201cTrump\u2019s fundamentally distorted personality \u2014 which at its core is chaotic, volatile and transgressive \u2014 when combined with the powers of the presidency had to end poorly,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a veteran of the three previous Republican administrations and a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cWhat we\u2019re now seeing is the radiating effects of that and it\u2019s enveloped him, his White House, his family and his friends.\u201d\n Trump jetted Friday to his favorite refuge, his private Mar-a-Lago Club in South Florida, where he dined on the gilded patio with old friends \u2014 former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and wife Judith and Blackstone Group chairman Stephen A. Schwartzman, among others. Trump tried to convince his companions that trade tariffs were more popular than they think, according to someone with knowledge of their conversation.\n Shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday, he rolled up to the Trump International Golf Course for a sunny, 70-degree morning on the greens. Rather than firing off a flurry of angry messages as on other recent weekend mornings, the president tweeted only, \u201cHappy National Anthem Day!\u201d But then shortly after noon, once he returned to Mar-a-Lago from the golf course, Trump tweeted that the mainstream media has \u201cgone CRAZY!\u201d\n Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a Trump friend, said, \u201cI\u2019m bewildered when I see these reports that he\u2019s in turmoil. Every time I speak to him he seems more relaxed and in control than ever. He seems pretty optimistic about how things are shaping up.\u201d\n Trump is testing the patience of his own staff, some of whom feel he is not listening to their advice. White House counsel Donald McGahn and national economic council director Gary Cohn have been especially frustrated, according to other advisers.\n The situation seems to be grating as well on White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who had been on the ropes over his handling of domestic abuse allegations against former staff secretary Rob Porter but who now appears on firmer footing. Talking last week about his move from being homeland security secretary to the West Wing, Kelly quipped, \u201cGod punished me.\u201d\n Last Friday, Kelly tried to explain anew the timeline of Porter\u2019s dismissal with a group of reporters \u2014 an unprompted move that annoyed and confused some White House staffers, who believed they were finally moving past the controversy that had consumed much of February. \n \u201cMorale is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said a Republican strategist in frequent contact with White House staff. \u201cNobody knows what to expect.\u201d\n  [Trump aide Hope Hicks to resign amid personal tumult and Russia probe] \n Since Trump entered presidential politics three years ago, Hicks has been his stabilizing constant, tending his moods and whims in addition to managing his image. Within the president\u2019s orbit, many wonder if Trump has fully absorbed the impact of Hicks\u2019 upcoming departure. \n Trump told one friend that Hicks was a great young woman, who, after three intense years, was ready to do her own thing. He told this friend that he recognized the White House was full of \u201ctough hombres,\u201d according to someone briefed on the conversation. \n But other confidants said the president feels abandoned and alone \u2014 not mad at Hicks, but frustrated by the circumstance. Coupled with last fall\u2019s departure of longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller, Trump will have few pure loyalists remaining. \n \u201cLosing people is too much of a story for the president,\u201d said oil investor Dan K. Eberhart, a Trump supporter and a Republican National Committee fundraiser. \u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s imploding .\u2009.\u2009. Trump had momentum with tax reform, the \u2018State of the Union\u2019 speech. He should try to keep that going.\u201d\n On Capitol Hill, lawmakers were left in varying states of consternation by Trump\u2019s whipsaw on guns. He suggested publicly last Wednesday that he favored tougher background checks and would forgo due process in taking away guns from the mentally ill, but then sent opposite signals after huddling with National Rifle Association lobbyists the next night.\n Trump\u2019s aides said his vacillation was a function of the controlled chaos the president likes to sow. Trump recently has come to favor opening his meetings to the media \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like his own TV show,\u201d said one adviser \u2014 where he often chews over outlandish ideas, plays to the assembled press and talks up bipartisan consensus, even if it never leads to actual policy.\n Trump doesn\u2019t see guns through the traditional prism of left versus right, but rather as a Manhattan business developer, said one senior administration official, adding that he has told staff that he doesn\u2019t understand why people need assault rifles. \n  [\u2018Every day is a new adventure\u2019: Trump upends Washington and Wall Street with shifts on trade, guns] \n The president\u2019s decision last Thursday to announce steep new tariffs on aluminum and steel \u2014 and gleefully tout a possible trade war \u2014 caught almost his entire team, including some of his top trade advisers, by surprise. \n Earlier in the week, Cohn was telling people he was going to continue stalling Trump on tariffs. He described the tariffs as \u201cobviously stupid,\u201d in the recollection of one person who spoke to him.\n \u201cGary said to him, you can\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cThe more you tell him that, the more he is going to do what he wants to do.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s allies say that in his past ventures he has managed to thrive in chaotic environments, and he has replicated that atmosphere in the White House. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) recalled visiting Trump in the Oval Office for a bill-signing photo opportunity a few weeks into his presidency that was scheduled to last just a few minutes.\n \u201cWe were in there over an hour, and every White House character was in there at one point or another .\u2009.\u2009. It was like Grand Central Station,\u201d King said. \u201cHe has a way of getting things done. He had the worst campaign ever.

In August, lawmakers passed legislation limiting the president\u2019s ability to lift sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its military intervention in Ukraine.\u00a0\n Since coming to power, the Trump administration has taken forceful action against Moscow, closing its consulate in San Francisco and approving lethal aid to Ukraine in its battle with pro-Russian separatists, a move the Obama administration opposed.\u00a0\n Trump, however, has refrained from criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, including in a phone call last week after Russia\u2019s disputed presidential elections.\n  In advance of the call, the president\u2019s staff included a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d and recommending that he raise the poisoning of the former Russian spy.

Bannon attacks the \u201cdeep state.\u201d It is not simply a legal ploy when Republicans running interference for President Trump call the FBI \u201ccorrupt\u201d or when Trump\u2019s lawyer John Dowd calls to shut down the Russia investigation. When a witness to conversations and interactions with Trump who has turned over information to the investigation\u00a0is fired, the danger goes beyond the investigation directly at hand. In one form or another, these are attacks on a vital pillar of democratic government \u2014 the apolitical administration of justice.\n As to Dowd\u2019s comments, which he later claimed represented his own views, reaction across the political spectrum was harsh, while many outside observers raised questions about the motive behind former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe\u2019s firing.\n Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a terse statement:\u00a0\u201cMr. Dowd\u2019s comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of the president and his legal team is not to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn.\u00a0The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel\u2019s investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s actions have broader implications for our democracy. Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group seeking to check attacks on democracy and illegitimate executive branch power grabs, put out a\u00a0white paper\u00a0this month that now seems prescient. \u201cIf those in power can wield the enforcement\u00a0authority of the state to punish their critics or opponents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or to turn a blind eye to\u00a0law-breaking by their friends\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we have lost the rule of law. Thomas Jefferson\u00a0observed, and the Justice Department quotes on its website, \u2018The most sacred of the\u00a0duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.\u2019\u00a0Each\u00a0time the White House intervenes with the Justice Department\u2019s handling of a\u00a0specific-party matter, it risks violating that sacred duty.\u201d\u00a0When the president seeks to reach down into the Justice Department to tilt the outcome of actions or to punish individual lawyers for pursuing justice, a grave injury is done to our democracy.\n Yascha Mounk, author of \u201cThe People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger And How to Save It,\u201d\u00a0tells me, \u201cFor citizens to have trust in their law enforcement agencies, justice doesn\u2019t only need to be done; it also needs to be seen to be done. Given that Mr. McCabe was fired after continual attacks from the President of the United States, we already know that this important principle has been violated in this case.\u201d He adds, \u201cEven if it eventually turns out that McCabe really did misbehave \u2014 and there is no publicly available evidence to substantiate that theory so far \u2014 the manner of his firing undermines the independence of the FBI and the trust Americans can put in their institutions.\u201d He continues, \u201cThe alternative is even worse: If the charges against McCabe eventually turn out to be spurious, then the partisan takeover of the FBI is very far along. And that should terrify any American citizen who values his liberty or his democracy.\u201d\n That politicization of the Justice Department and the implicit threat of retaliation for crossing the president should be of grave concern.\n Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is right to call for immediate hearings. In a statement released on Saturday he said, \u201cDuring my four decades in the Senate, I have never before seen our nation\u2019s career, apolitical law enforcement officials so personally and publicly maligned by politicians \u2014 indeed, by our President. And I have never been so concerned that the walls intended to protect the independence of our dedicated law enforcement professionals, including Special Counsel Mueller, are at risk of crumbling.\u201d He recounted, \u201c\u201cA month ago I asked Chairman Grassley to hold a hearing on the escalating politicized attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. We can all point to mistakes made by Justice Department officials over the course of high-profile investigations during the 2016 elections. Such mistakes rightly fall within the purview of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s routine oversight functions. . . .\u00a0 I believe the Judiciary Committee will fail to fulfill its core oversight responsibility if it does nothing in this moment.\u201d\n Between Dowd\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s after McCabe\u2019s firing, we see the intensification of Trump\u2019s deliberate interference with the Justice Department to suit the president\u2019s personal interests.\u00a0\u201cWhatever Andrew McCabe did or did not do, his firing two days before retiring would obviously never have happened if the President hadn\u2019t personally demanded it,\u201d Protect Democracy Executive Director Ian Bassin surmises. He tells me that this incident shows that \u201cTrump has moved from autocratic rhetoric to autocratic action, as personally ordering the purging of civil servants who are insufficiently loyal is what autocrats do.\u201d He warns the Justice Department inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility not to do Trump\u2019s bidding. Bassin asserts, \u201cTrump\u2019s certain intervention was also so manifestly corrupt that it likely violated constitutional principles that limit a President\u2019s authority to \u2018do whatever he wants with the Justice Department.'\u201d\n In sum, recent events should underscore two dangers that remain so long as Trump is president. First, he may use his executive powers to extract revenge, settle scores and instill fear in political opponents \u2014 just as the Nixon White House did with the Internal Revenue Service.\u00a0Second, he will continue to undermine the morale of prosecutors and investigators, causing them to leave, second-guess their actions or shape their work so as to avoid the president\u2019s wrath. And worst of all, Trump will undermine the public\u2019s faith in entities that are supposed to be apolitical fact-finders and enforcers of the law, leading Americans to question the honesty and fairness of our government and criminal-justice system.

Bob Corker of Tennessee was pressed by the Washington Examiner on why Republicans are hesitant to protect Mueller, and this is what happened:\n  Republicans in Congress are hesitant to antagonize President Trump ahead of ahead of difficult midterm elections, wary of sparking a backlash from a committed grassroots base more loyal to the White House.\n Amid sky-high Democratic enthusiasm and a developing \u201cblue wave,\u201d Republicans can\u2019t afford a war with Trump that depresses GOP turnout. Republicans\u00a0might be worried\u00a0about Trump\u2019s attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller, but they are reluctant to push back, much less support legislation to curtail the president\u2019s ability to fire Mueller and sideline the federal probe \u2026\n \u201cThe president is, as you know \u2014 you\u2019ve seen his numbers among the Republican base \u2014 it\u2019s very strong. It\u2019s more than strong, it\u2019s tribal in nature,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who decided to retire when his second term concludes at year\u2019s end, after periodically sparring with Trump.\n \u201cPeople who tell me, who are out on trail, say, look, people don\u2019t ask about issues anymore. They don\u2019t care about issues. They want to know if you\u2019re with Trump or not,\u201d Corker added.\n  This is a candid admission from a leading GOP lawmaker of what\u2019s really driving the Republican straddle on Mueller. As I\u2019ve noted, Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller put Republicans in a tough spot. The educated swing voters who are driving the Dem anti-Trump resurgence support the Mueller probe and may vote to oust Republicans who won\u2019t check Trump\u2019s excesses. But Trump\u2019s attacks probably rally GOP base voters, large percentages of whom see the Mueller probe as a witch hunt, making it harder for GOP lawmakers to protect that investigation.\n Corker just conceded that this is the driving motive. He suggested GOP voters equate being \u201cwith Trump\u201d in a \u201ctribal\u201d sense with not acting to protect Mueller. Republicans are mindful of this as they craft their position towards Mueller, which includes rhetorical support for the probe but no new substantive limits on Trump\u2019s power to do what they say they don\u2019t want him to do.\n After all, some Republicans have already sponsored bills that would protect Mueller from Trump, by creating a process\u00a0under which any removal of the special counsel would be subjected to judicial review and reversed if it were not for good cause. But these bills are stalled, and Republicans have no intention of changing that.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell yesterday voiced strong support for the Mueller probe. But he again said there\u2019s no reason to act to protect it. And Republican leaders privately rebuffed yet another push by Dems on this front.\n I\u2019m told by Democratic aides familiar with the negotiations over the omnibus spending package that Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi asked GOP leaders to insert a provision that would have protected Mueller from action by Trump, aides familiar with the talks say. But Republican leaders rebuffed the request. (Politico also reported this.) I could not ascertain whether GOP leaders gave a reason for doing so. A GOP aide countered this was never part of the talks.\n At bottom, the GOP position is basically\u00a0to\u00a0beg Trump not to bring the issue to a head, without taking any action to prevent it \u2014 and without signaling what Republicans will do in response if he does. Making this worse, University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck points out\u00a0that if Congress does not act in advance, reinstating Mueller might actually prove legally harder than it would be to protect the investigation now. As Brian Beutler puts it: \u201cRepublicans pleading with Trump not to fire Mueller are more properly understood to be asking him not to put them in the position of having to capitulate.\u201d\n Corker has basically conceded that Republicans believe it would alienate the GOP base to signal that removing Mueller would meet with specific consequences. But if this is the case, and Trump does try to shut down or hamstring the probe, that would only further rally Republican voters behind him. Why would it be any easier to inflict consequences at that point? If, as Corker says, what matters most in this calculus is what GOP voters think of lawmakers\u2019 tribal loyalty to Trump, it would only get harder. And really, why would Trump take any other lesson from what he\u2019s seeing right now?\n * REPUBLICANS SPEND BIG AT TRUMP PROPERTIES: The Post reports that the Republican National Committee spent $271,000 at Trump\u2019s private businesses in February. And this is part of a broad pattern:\n  Since his election, Trump\u2019s private properties\u00a0have attracted steady business from the RNC, party committees, congressional campaigns and outside groups, which spend\u00a0anywhere from about $300 to over $160,000 per event, an analysis by The Washington Post shows. Dozens of Republican lawmakers and candidates have spent campaign or PAC money at the president\u2019s properties since his election, The Post found.\n  It\u2019s worth noting that in so doing, Republicans are rewarding Trump for his refusal to divest in his businesses as president.\n * TRUMP MAY NOT GET HIS WALL: Politico reports that in the negotiations over the big omnibus spending package, talks on protecting the \u201cdreamers\u201d have fallen apart. But:\n  Congressional Democrats spent\u00a0Monday and Tuesday\u00a0pushing to freeze hiring of immigration enforcement officials in return for providing Trump more than $1 billion in funding on his border wall. Democrats and Republicans are likely to agree on about $1.6 billion in border funding that would help finance some fencing and security and avoid directly funding the large concrete wall that Trump wants, according to a Democratic aide.\n  If Trump had agreed to permanent protections for the dreamers, he would have gotten full funding for his wall in exchange. Now he likely won\u2019t ever get it.\n * TRUMP DEFIES TALKING POINTS ON PUTIN: Trump yesterday congratulated Vladimir Putin on his election victory, and The Post reports that he defied his aides in doing so:\n  Trump did not follow \u2026 a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE,\u201d according to officials familiar with the call. Trump also chose not to heed talking points from aides instructing him to condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain with a powerful nerve agent, a case that both the British and U.S. governments have blamed on Moscow.\n  Experts have said Putin\u2019s reelection was rigged, which has led other world leaders to hesitate before congratulating him. Not Trump. Trump loves a winner!\n * PUTIN LEAK RATTLES WHITE HOUSE: Axios reports that the leak about Trump ignoring talking points on Putin has deeply rattled White House advisers:\n    The speed and sensitivity of the leak prompted immediate finger-pointing within the administration, as aides reeled from a leak that could only have come from a small group of people, each of whom is trusted with sensitive national secrets.\u00a0Possible motives\u00a0include concern about how Trump is handling Putin, frustration by the officials\u00a0about Trump ignoring their advice, or internal power games.\n  Perhaps people around Trump want it publicly known that there is plenty of internal disagreement with his handling of Russia.\n \n \n * DEMS CONTEST LOTS OF STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES: Steven Rogers, a politics professor who specializes in state legislative races, calculates that Democrats are running candidates in 85 percent of contests in 16 states that make such info available:\n  More Democrats are running than in any election since 1982. \u2026 Democrats are running in record numbers at least partly in the hope of riding an anti-Trump wave, as Conor Lamb did last week in Pennsylvania.\n  This is potentially a huge deal. If Dems can take back a good amount of territory on the state level, it\u2019ll impact everything from health care to redistricting for the next decade.\n * U.S. TRIES TO LIMIT JUNK FOOD LABELS: The New York Times reports that in NAFTA talks, U.S. negotiators are trying to limit the ability of the three countries to warn consumers about the health threats posed by junk food and high levels of sugar, salt, and fat:\n  Obesity has at least doubled in 73 countries\u00a0since 1980.\u00a0 Officials in Mexico and Canada \u2026 are discussing options like the use of colors, shapes and other easy-to-understand symbols that warn consumers of health risks. \u2026 But the Office of the United States Trade Representative \u2026 s pushing to limit the ability of any Nafta member to require consumer warnings on the front of sugary drinks and fatty packaged foods.\n  As the Times notes, this is because of pressure from \u201cbig American food and soft-drink companies.\u201d It should also\u00a0do wonders for struggling Trump voters in the industrial Midwest.\n * AND TRUMP WARNS OF HIS OWN IMPEACHMENT: Trump said this at a fundraiser last night:\n  \u201cThe Democrats think they\u2019re invincible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean I watch this Maxine Waters. You ever see Maxine Waters? A low-IQ individual. Low IQ. \u2018We will impeach him. We will impeach him.\u2019 But he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter. We will impeach him.\u2019 \u2026 This is what we\u2019re going to have to fight against.\u201d\n  Whether or not it results in impeachment, which will depend on what Robert Mueller finds, it is true that the only hope for any accountability for Trump lies with a Democratic House.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Editorial Board", "body": "President Trump. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \n   IT WAS one thing for Donald Trump, the businessman, to require employees, investors, ex-wives and adult-film stars to sign nondisclosure agreements. As distasteful as those agreements may have been, he was exercising the legal rights of a private citizen. It is an entirely different \u2014 and completely unacceptable \u2014 matter for Donald Trump, the president, to think he can similarly gag White House staff. \n Federal employees, including those in the West Wing, work for the American people, not some corporate executive, and their loyalty is to the Constitution, not an individual. Attempts to bully them into giving up their First Amendment right to speak are yet another troubling example of Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s failure to understand the duties and sensibilities of his public office.\n Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for signed confidentiality agreements, The Post\u2019s Ruth Marcus reported in revealing their existence, was prompted by his fury over embarrassing leaks early in his administration. The New York Times subsequently reported that White House Counsel Donald McGahn had cautioned that threatening penalties for those revealing secrets was illegal and unenforceable, but \u2014 mainly to placate the president \u2014 eventually drew up a broad document barring officials from revealing what they heard and saw at work.\n The specific details of the agreements are unclear. The White House has refused to release a copy of the document or answer our questions. Among them: How many officials signed nondisclosure agreements? Over what period of time? Do they give Mr.\u00a0Trump a personal right of action after the end of his presidency? Are there exceptions for congressional testimony? \n No one denies the need to keep secret sensitive government information that could undermine the interests and security of the country. But there is already a system in place that classifies information at various levels and provides for appropriate clearance levels and access, as well as resulting penalties for those found in violation. It is routine to require federal employees and contractors who work with classified information to sign nondisclosure agreements. \n The fact that this administration was, until recently, all too willing to let people without appropriate security clearance be privy to top-secret materials makes the push for these newly disclosed and unprecedented nondisclosure agreements all the more suspect. The main motivator appears to be the president\u2019s ego and not the national interest. \n Any appeal to Mr. Trump to disavow use of these confidentiality agreements based on historic norms, constitutional principles or the need for accountability in government would probably fall on deaf ears. After all, the country is still waiting for him to fulfill his promise to release his tax returns. So perhaps the government accountability committees in Congress could stir themselves and demand to see a copy of the agreement.

Lighthizer to propose within 15 days tariff increases designed to compensate the United States for lost profits and jobs. After a comment period, the list, targeting Chinese products that benefited from U.S. technology, will be made public.\n But even as he confronted China over technology, Trump weakened a new tariff meant to protect U.S. production of industrial metals, potentially exempting the European Union, Brazil and other countries accounting for two-thirds of steel imports and more than half of foreign-made aluminum.\n By challenging China, Trump rejected the approach of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, gambling that China will bend before he does. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this is going to turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, director of the project on Chinese business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt could be resolved in a few months, or it could spiral out of control into a broader strategic rivalry.\u201d\n Early reviews were not good. On Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 700 points, or almost 3 percent, as investors blanched at the prospect of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about this administration\u2019s shoot-first approach,\u201d said Josh Bolten, president of the Business Roundtable. \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. The victims of the actions that the administration is proposing to take are principally Americans.\u201d\n Trump is betting that disrupting the traditional U.S. approach to China will yield a better commercial bargain for American businesses and workers than the status quo that he blames for hollowing out American industry.\n Among U.S. politicians and business leaders, there is broad agreement that China has violated U.S. intellectual property rights through restrictive licensing arrangements in China and outright cybertheft in the United States.\n But Thursday\u2019s actions threatens to unravel global supply chains, increase costs for consumers and open the door to Chinese retaliation against U.S. farmers and businesses. \n \u201cThe biggest and most powerful American companies are stuck in the middle,\u201d said James McGregor, APCO Worldwide\u2019s chairman for greater China. \u201cThey\u2019re schizophrenic now. They don\u2019t want today\u2019s business to be eliminated. But they know China\u2019s plan for tomorrow is to eliminate them in the Chinese market and then take them on globally.\u201d\n At $60 billion in affected products, Trump\u2019s China actions carry a bigger punch than the tariffs on $46 billion in steel and aluminum imports that he announced March 8.\n The impact of those earlier levies may shrink further: Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that products from the European Union, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil will not be affected when the tariffs go into effect on Friday while negotiations over potential exemptions continue.\n Trump already had exempted Canada and Mexico from the import levies for the duration of talks aimed at renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n Still, the likely China tariffs pose little immediate threat to the growing economy because they will touch just 3 percent of total goods imports, according to Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist for Capital Economics.\n The big worry is how China responds and whether the countries stumble into a tit-for-tat slugfest. In Washington, the Chinese Embassy distributed a statement from Ambassador Cui Tiankai rejecting Trump\u2019s claims of intellectual property violations and warning that his approach would hurt \u201cAmerican middle-class people,\u201d U.S. companies and the stock market.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t want a trade war. But we are not afraid of it,\u201d Cui said. \u201cIf somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will certainly fight back and retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.\u201d\n The United States last adopted this sort of uncompromising approach in a 1995 dispute over intellectual property rights. China ultimately acceded to U.S. demands, but today its economy is almost 17 times as big, making it less vulnerable to American pressure.\n A Sino-U.S. trade war would affect economies that account for roughly 40 percent of global output, which explains the mounting apprehension on Wall Street.\n \u201cTrump\u2019s economics team blew it,\u201d economist Chris Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank wrote in a research note. \u201c.\u2009.\u2009. Tariffs mean a trade war and the news has the world\u2019s investors running for the exits.\u201d\n The president blamed China for the loss of 60,000 factories and 6\u00a0million jobs, a number that most economists say blends the impact on U.S. employment of both Chinese competition and automation.\n Trump said that unfair Chinese trade practices are responsible for the yawning U.S. trade deficit with China, which has reached a record $375 billion on his watch.\n \u201cAny way you look at it, it\u2019s the largest of any country in the history of our world,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s out of control.\u201d\n The White House expects the new taxes, which could reach up to 1,300 specific imports, will have a \u201cminimal impact\u201d upon consumers. But even business groups that support the goal of requiring changes in Chinese industrial policy voiced opposition to the tariffs.\n \u201cThere is no way to impose $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports without it having a negative impact on American consumers. Make no mistake, these tariffs may be aimed at China, but the bill will be charged to American consumers who will pay more at the checkout for the items they shop for every day,\u201d said Hun Quach, vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n Trump and his aides provided varying estimates of the value of the Chinese goods at issue. The president referred in his Roosevelt Room remarks to \u201cabout $60 billion,\u201d while a senior White House aide who briefed reporters two hours before the president put the figure at \u201cabout $50 billion.\u201d\n The official cannot be identified under the ground rules for such White House briefings.\n Trump also ordered Lighthizer to complain to the World Trade Organization about China\u2019s discriminatory licensing practices for foreign companies, an effort that U.S. officials hope will draw support from American allies in Europe and Japan.\n The president described the actions against China as part of a broader reappraisal of U.S. global relationships, featuring a willingness to use tariff threats to force concessions from trading partners.\n \u201cWe will end up negotiating these things rather than fighting over them,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, in an apparent reference to fears of a trade war.\n The president also alluded to political calculations, saying that voter concerns over economic losses from bad trade deals was \u201cmaybe one of the main reasons\u201d he won the White House.\n \u201cThe era of economic surrender is over,\u201d Vice President Pence added.\n Trump\u2019s actions won plaudits from Democrats such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). But they drew fire from the conservative National Taxpayers Union\u2019s Bryan Riley, who called the proposed China tariffs \u201cself-destructive and reckless.\u201d\n Under the measures targeting Beijing announced Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will draw up new investment restrictions to address concerns about Chinese investors, including state-sponsored investment funds, acquiring U.S. companies to gain access to their technology.\n \u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trading practices,\u201d said Everett Eissenstat, deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs.\n Since the president took office 14 months ago, his remarks on China have swung between effusive praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping and tough talk about its trade practices. In recent months, Trump has adopted an increasingly bellicose tone, with the White House billing Thursday\u2019s actions as \u201ctargeting China\u2019s economic aggression\u201d and the president\u2019s trade agenda released in February labeling the country a \u201chostile\u201d economic power.\n \u201cChina is engaged in practices which harm this country,\u201d said Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy.\n Trump\u2019s trade moves potentially mark a sharp break with decades of growing U.S. economic engagement with China, which began in the late 1970s as the country emerged from Maoist autarky.\n Years of commercial delegations and diplomatic dialogue saw trade between the two countries mushroom to $635\u00a0billion from $116\u00a0billion in 2000. Yet at the same time, U.S. companies complained about strict restraints on their operations in the Chinese market. Government regulations typically limited them to a minority stake alongside a local partner.\n The administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama sought to persuade the Chinese to embrace more fully a market-oriented policy. Through 2013, when a high-level Communist Party conclave proclaimed a \u201cdecisive role\u201d for the market and officials promised to pare back the state\u2019s role in the economy, U.S. officials believed China was headed in the right direction.\n \u201cThat process has failed,\u201d Navarro said.\n Trump administration officials say that China\u2019s economic policies are distorting global markets for key products such as steel and threaten to have the same effect on more advanced industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n \u201cChina benefits far more from the U.S.-China relationship than the U.S. does,\u201d Navarro said.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Shane Harris", "body": "Officials in at least four countries have privately discussed ways they can manipulate Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, by taking advantage of his\u00a0complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter.\u00a0\n Among those nations discussing ways to influence Kushner to their advantage were the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico, the current and former officials said.\u00a0\n It is unclear if any of those countries acted on the discussions, but Kushner\u2019s contacts with certain foreign government officials have raised concerns inside the White House and are a reason he has been unable to obtain a permanent security clearance, the officials said. \n Kushner\u2019s interim security clearance was downgraded last week from the top-secret to the secret level, which should restrict the regular access he has had to highly-classified information, according to administration officials.\n H.R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, learned that Kushner had contacts with foreign officials that he did not coordinate through the National Security Council or officially report. The issue of foreign officials talking about their meetings with Kushner and their perception of his vulnerabilities was a subject raised in McMaster\u2019s daily intelligence briefings, according to the current and former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n Within the White House, Kushner\u2019s lack of government experience and his business debt were seen from the beginning of his tenure as potential points of leverage that foreign governments could use to influence him, the current and former officials said.\n They could also have legal implications. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has asked people about the protocols Kushner used when he set up conversations with foreign leaders, according to a former U.S. official.\n  [New White House security clearance policy could put \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019 on Kushner] \n Officials in the White House were concerned that Kushner was\u00a0\u201cnaive and being tricked\u201d in conversations with foreign officials, some of whom said they wanted to deal only with Kushner directly and not more experienced personnel, said one former White House official.\u00a0\n Kushner has an unusually complex set of business arrangements and foreign entanglements for a senior White House aide, experts have said. But his behavior while in office has only drawn more scrutiny and raised concerns that he would be unable to obtain a final security clearance, which he needs to perform the many jobs Trump has entrusted to him, from negotiating foreign trade deals to overseeing a Middle East peace process.\u00a0\n \n \u201cWe will not respond substantively to unnamed sources peddling second-hand hearsay with rank speculation that continue to leak inaccurate information,\u201d said Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Kushner\u2019s lawyer. \n White House officials said McMaster was taken aback by some of Kushner\u2019s foreign contacts. \n \u201cWhen he learned about it, it surprised him,\u201d one official said. \u201cHe thought that was weird...It was an unusual thing. I don\u2019t know that any White House has done it this way before.\u201d\n The official said that McMaster was \u201cnot concerned but wanted an explanation. It seemed unusual to him.\u201d\n In the months since, McMaster and Kushner have worked to coordinate so that the National Security Council is aware of Kushner\u2019s contacts with foreign officials and so Kushner has access to the council\u2019s country experts to prepare for meetings.\n \u201cGeneral McMaster has the highest regard for Mr. Kushner and the two work well together,\u201d said NSC spokesman Michael Anton. Everything they do is integrated...it\u2019s seamless.\u201d\n  [Mueller and Trump: Born to wealth, raised to lead. Then, sharply different choices.] \n Foreign governments routinely discuss ways they can influence senior officials in all administrations.\u00a0\n \u201cEvery country will seek to find their point of leverage,\u201d said one person familiar with intelligence intercepts of foreign officials discussing Kushner.\u00a0\n But Kushner came to his position with an unusually complex set of business holdings and a family company facing significant debt issues.\n A Mexican diplomatic source said that Kushner\u00a0\u201chas remained strictly professional\u201d in his dealings with the country,\u00a0\u201cwith both sides looking after their interests but trying to find common ground.\u201d\u00a0\n Officials from the UAE identified Kushner as early as the spring of 2017 as particularly manipulable because of his family\u2019s search for investors in their real estate company, current and former officials said.\n Officials at the embassies of China, Israel and the UAE did not respond to requests for comment.\n Kushner\u2019s lack of a final security clearance has drawn scrutiny in recent weeks. He had an interim clearance that gives him access to information at the top-secret level, as well as more highly classified information, such as the president\u2019s daily intelligence briefing. But the application for his final clearance dragged on for more than a year.\u00a0The downgrading of his interim clearance from top secret to secret was first reported by Politico.\n On Feb. 9, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that significant issues would further delay Kushner\u2019s security clearance process, according to four people familiar with their discussions.\u00a0\n Kushner has repeatedly amended a form detailing his contacts with foreign persons. Not fully disclosing foreign contacts ordinarily would result in a clearance being denied, experts said.\u00a0\n On Friday, Trump said White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly would make a final decision on whether Kushner would continue to have a security clearance.\n During 2016, Kushner was simultaneously running his family business, Kushner Cos., and helping to oversee Trump\u2019s campaign. One of his top business concerns was what to do with his family\u2019s investment in 666 Fifth Ave. in New York, which the company bought under his direction for $1.8 billion in 2007, the highest price paid at the time for a U.S. office tower. The purchase became troubled as the Great Recession hit, and Kushner refinanced it, leaving the company with a $1.2 billion debt that comes due in January 2019.\n The Manhattan property has been a particularly nettlesome problem inside the government because Kushner\u2019s company has sought foreign money on the project.\u00a0\n Kushner and his company had proposed a redevelopment plan that would double the building\u2019s size, requiring major new investment. Before Trump took office, Kushner and other company officials explored several options for the financing. They met with an executive of a Chinese-run insurance company, Anbang, which had bought the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. They also discussed a possible investment by the former finance minister of Qatar, who oversaw an investment fund. But after Kushner served as Trump\u2019s senior adviser for a few months in the White House, questions arose about potential conflicts of interest, the financing talks ended, and neither Anbang nor the Qatari fund signed on.\n  Thomas Barrack, a close Trump friend who asked the Qataris to consider investing in the Fifth Avenue property, has told The Washington Post that the refinancing efforts were \u201ccrushed\u201d because Kushner\u2019s move to the White House \u201cjust about completely chilled the market, and [potential investors] just said, \u2018No way \u2014 can\u2019t be associated with any appearances of conflict of interest,\u2019 even though there was none.\u201d\n \u00a0Questions have also been raised about whether Kushner discussed financing with a Russian banker. Kushner met in December 2016 with Sergey Gorkov, the top executive of Vnesheconombank.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n \n One short, newly-revealed email from a Manhattan banker just made it much more likely that the $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election violated federal law.\n NBC News on Friday reported that Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime ally and attorney, had used a Trump Organization email address as he worked to secure the payment to Daniels. Daniels alleges that the money was paid to keep her from telling the media about a sexual relationship she had with Trump; Cohen and Trump continue to deny that relationship.\n In particular, NBC received a copy of an email from a banker at First Republic Bank\u00a0that\u00a0was sent to Cohen. Cohen then forwarded the email to his private Gmail account and, from there, to Daniels\u2019s attorney.\n  Notice the email address. The banker emailed Cohen at mcohen@trumporg.com. Trumporg.com redirects to Trump.com. The domain is registered to the Trump Organization. It is, in other words, an email address that belongs to the Trump Organization. An asset of the company.\n And that means that federal election law was almost certainly violated.\n Last month, we spoke with Lawrence Noble, senior director and general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. He walked us through the danger zones for the Daniels payment in terms of what election law prohibits. At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear where the money had come from or how it got to Daniels. We lacked a number of details about how Daniels and Trump\u2019s team, Cohen in particular, had interacted.\n We\u2019ve learned a lot since then. In addition to the email above, we\u2019ve also seen the lawsuit filed by Daniels alleging that the agreement to remain silent was never in effect because Trump failed to sign it. Included in that lawsuit is this element of the \u201cfactual background\u201d to the matter at-hand.\n  Daniels\u2019s lawsuit asserts that Trump learned that she was talking to media outlets shortly after a number of women had come forward to rebut Trump\u2019s denial during the Oct. 10, 2016 presidential debate that he\u2019d never actually groped women as he\u2019d implied in the famous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Hearing that she might tell her story, too, Trump \u201csought to silence\u201d her, \u201cthus helping to ensure he won the Presidential Election.\u201d\n Those two things together \u2014 that a Trump Organization email address was used to facilitate the payment and that the payment was linked to the campaign \u2014 would constitute a legal violation. The email from the bank to Cohen doesn\u2019t prove that company funds were used to pay Daniels, which Noble told us last month would itself be illegal. But just using that email address is its own problem.\n Common Cause\u2018s Paul Ryan (himself a former lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center) noted on Twitter that the use of Trump Organization resources likely violates 11 CFR 114.2(f). That reads, with our added emphasis:\n  \u201cCorporations and labor organizations (including officers, directors or other representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election \u2026\u201d\n  \u201cThe use of the Trump Organization email is evidence that Cohen\u2019s services were, at least in part, being paid for by the Trump Organization,\u201d Noble said in an email. \u201cThat would be an illegal corporate contribution to the campaign even if the company did not pay the $130,000.\u201d\n Paying someone to be quiet so that they don\u2019t damage a political effort is an in-kind contribution to that campaign, covering a cost meant to aid efforts to win the election. When we spoke in February, Noble predicted that the almost-certain defense will be that the Daniels payment didn\u2019t qualify as a campaign contribution. That Cohen (who does seem to have fronted the $130,000 himself) made a payment to a woman shortly before the election for reasons that had nothing to do with the election itself.\n Noble was understandably skeptical of this argument, given what was known then. But he also pointed out that even if what happened with Daniels was the sort of thing that was very common for Cohen as part of his duties, the Daniels scenario could still be a contribution if Cohen understood that it would aid Trump\u2019s electoral effort.\n The Daniels lawsuit makes clear that her team, at least, thought that this was Cohen\u2019s (and Trump\u2019s) goal. The payment was made in part \u201cto ensure he won the Presidential Election,\u201d the lawsuit reads. What\u2019s more, the original agreement itself includes stipulations that Daniels (identified as \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d or \u201cPP\u201d) should take certain actions to secure her silence by Nov. 1, 2016 \u2014 a week before Election Day.\n  (\u201cDD\u201d was \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d \u2014 Trump.)\n So we have an agreement executed right before the election with a mandate that Daniels take certain actions protecting Trump against the story coming out before the election that resulted in a $130,000 payment that Cohen facilitated using resources provided by the Trump Organization.\n The final call is the FEC\u2019s. But in the view of Ryan and Noble, that\u2019s a violation of federal election law.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Matt Zapotosky", "body": "The FBI office that handles employee discipline has recommended firing the bureau\u2019s former deputy director over allegations that he authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter and misled investigators when asked about it \u2014 though Justice Department officials are still reviewing the matter and have not come to a final decision, a person familiar with the case said. \n The recommendation from the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility is likely to add fuel to the political fire surrounding former deputy director Andrew McCabe, who abruptly stepped down from his post earlier this year but technically remained an FBI employee.\n McCabe was hoping to retire in just days, when he becomes eligible for his full benefits. If he is fired, he could lose his retirement benefits. President Trump has long made McCabe a particular target of his ire, and the recommendation to fire the former No. 2 FBI official could give him new ammunition. \n Through a representative, McCabe declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cThe Department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated. That process includes recommendations from career employees and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.\u201d\n An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. \n Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has for some time been working on a report that blasts McCabe for allowing two high-ranking bureau officials to sit down with the Wall Street Journal as the news outlet prepared a story in 2016 on an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s family foundation, then misleading the inspector general\u2019s team about his actions. A person familiar with the matter said Horowitz\u2019s findings are what sparked the Office of Professional Responsibility\u2019s recommendation, which was first reported by the New York Times. Horowitz\u2019s report has not yet been released.\n  [Report said to fault FBI\u2019s former No. 2 for approving improper media disclosure, misleading inspector general] \n McCabe, 49, had long been expected to retire on March 18 though he abruptly left his post earlier this year after his boss, FBI Director Christopher Wray, was told of what the inspector general had found. \n The situation now seems fraught for all involved. If the Justice Department does not move on the recommendation, conservatives might view officials there as unfairly protecting McCabe. President Trump \u2014 who already has a strained relationship with Justice Department leaders \u2014 might be particularly displeased. \n But if the FBI fires McCabe with just days to go before his retirement, it could be viewed as bending to the will of a vindictive president. Trump has previously suggested McCabe was biased in favor of Clinton, pointing out that McCabe\u2019s wife, who ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Virginia legislature, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from the political action committee of Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a noted Clinton ally. The president remarked in December that McCabe was \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d \n The inspector general has since last January been investigating the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the politically charged probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, which is separate from the foundation probe. McCabe represents but a piece of that work. \n Horowitz is also examining broad allegations of misconduct involving former FBI Director James B. Comey, including the public statement he made recommending that the Clinton email case be closed without charges and his decision 11 days before the election to reveal to Congress that the FBI had resumed its work. McCabe briefly took over as the FBI\u2019s acting director after Trump fired Comey in May. \n The story for which McCabe authorized FBI officials to discuss came just as the bureau announced it was resuming its look at Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, though it focused more on a different case involving her family\u2019s foundation. \n The story presented McCabe as a complicated figure \u2014 one who lower level officials felt was stymieing their work, even though it detailed McCabe pushing back against Justice Department officials so the case could move forward.\n The inspector general was interested in McCabe\u2019s role in authorizing officials to talk about the matter, people familiar with the case said, because the story detailed ongoing criminal investigative work, which law enforcement officials are not normally allowed to discuss. \n The Wall Street Journal story was written by Devlin Barrett, who is now a reporter at The Washington Post. Recently released text messages show that Barrett had talked with the FBI\u2019s top spokesman, Michael Kortan, and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who worked for McCabe, two days before it was published. \n Background briefings with reporters are common in Washington, particularly when reporters have information that officials feel compelled to respond to or add context.

In mid-February, he surfaced at the only public forum between Lipinski and his liberal challenger, Marie Newman, sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, introducing himself to members of the news media\u00a0and asking if they wanted to interview him. On election night, several outlets ran news alerts about Jones\u2019s primary win \u2014 which was never in doubt.\n Republicans are now faced with putting up an alternative candidate that they\u00a0doubt\u00a0could win the election in November. In 2016, Lipinski faced no challenger at all; in 2014, a bad year for his party overall, he won reelection by 29 points in a district that was drawn specifically to keep him in Congress. But more than 64,000 votes were cast for his opponent, in a year when Gov. Bruce Rauner (R-Ill.) won by just 142,284 votes.\n Illinois election law gives\u00a0candidates outside the Democratic and Republican parties several options for getting on the ballot. Third-party candidates can file to run as late as June, and write-in candidates can declare as late as September.

In 2012, an unknown conspiracy theorist named Mark E. Clayton won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Tennessee; the party recruited a write-in candidate, who was halted after courts decided that Clayton had\u00a0fulfilled the requirements to be the Democratic nominee.\n Two years earlier, Kesha Rogers, a member of the fringe political movement led by Lyndon LaRouche, won the Democratic nomination in a House race the party had written off.

He\u2019s tired of advisers who are\u00a0steering him away from his true agenda and persona, goes this narrative; instead, he\u2019s finally getting back to the basics that make Trump who he really is.\n But this framing is built on a distortion that underplays just how dangerous Trump\u2019s evolution really threatens to become. What\u2019s really happening is that Trump is increasingly surrounding himself with advisers who are better than the \u201cadults in the room\u201d at\u00a0manipulating his erratic and shifting impulses and whims, by giving a shape to them that he can accept and act upon.\n Axios reports this morning that sources close to Trump \u201cfeels\u201d that Bolton \u201cwill finally deliver the foreign policy the president wants\u201d on Iran and North Korea. What makes this account almost certainly\u00a0dead on is the word \u201cfeels.\u201d As Michael Warren of the Weekly Standard points out, Bolton has skillfully used his conservative media perches to send messages to Trump that nudge him towards \u201cmore hawkish stances,\u201d by \u201ccasting them as fulfillments of Trump\u2019s own pledges and true beliefs.\u201d\n Bolton wants to bomb Iran. There is no particular reason to believe that Trump either favors or opposes that stance. Trump knows that the Iran nuclear deal is bad because Barack Obama negotiated it; Trump knows Trump is strong and Obama is weak; and Trump knows his supporters cheered when he vowed to rip the agreement to shreds. But Trump has not meaningfully articulated why we should pull out of it, because he can\u2019t.\n And so, when Trump was debating whether to certify the Iran deal last summer, and was unhappy with advisers urging him to do so on substantive grounds, then-adviser Stephen K. Bannon handed him a piece by Bolton urging him to decertify. Bolton\u2019s piece cast that\u00a0that as the only course consistent with Trump\u2019s \u201cview that the Iran deal was a diplomatic debacle,\u201d because Obama had given Iran \u201cunimaginably favorable terms.\u201d Trump has no idea whether this is true or not \u2014 it isn\u2019t \u2014 but it persuaded Trump to come close to decertifying, though ultimately the adults prevailed that time.\n The point is that Trump doesn\u2019t grasp the details, but Bolton skillfully gave shape to his impulses. Now Bolton will be in an even better position to persuade Trump to kill the Iran deal, and if and when that happens, to push Trump more in the direction of his own bellicose designs, which Bolton will almost certainly cast as in keeping with Trump\u2019s vow to be tougher than Obama.\n Or take North Korea. Everyone knows that when Trump agreed to meet with Kim Jong-Un, he did so on an impulse, with no thought through rationale or sense of the risks and complexities involved. Bolton wants to go to war with North Korea and has dismissed talks. But he cleverly greeted Trump\u2019s announcement by describing it as \u201cshock and awe\u201d and an opportunity for Trump to give North Korea an ultimatum if it does not immediately begin \u201ctotal denuclearization.\u201d This, too, gave a shape to Trump\u2019s impulse that he will very likely find flattering, but also one that might move Trump towards Bolton\u2019s position.\n If Trump now \u201cfeels\u201d that Bolton will give him the policies he wants on Iran and North Korea, it\u2019s because Bolton is skilled at making Trump feel that way. And that\u2019s ominous, because it means Bolton may be able to push Trump towards believing that Bolton\u2019s goals are a realization of his own foreign policy vision, such as it is.\n Trump\u2019s vision is formless\n And that foreign policy vision is formless. During the campaign, Trump opposed the Iraq War, sending the message that he won\u2019t get drawn into the misguidedly idealistic or stupidly conceived military adventurism so typical of our clueless, corrupt elites.\u00a0But Trump has never been either antiwar or an isolationist. His posture was rather that he will magically smash our enemies and aggressively represent our interests abroad effortlessly, without any serious cost, because he\u2019s tougher, stronger, and smarter than those elites. How hard will it be for Bolton to shape those impulses into something more in line with his own vision?\n On trade, the process leading up to Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs was a joke with no regard for specifics. But it did showcase the rising star of trade adviser Alex Navarro,\u00a0who unabashedly stated that he had provided the \u201canalytics\u201d to \u201cconfirm his intuition,\u201d which is \u201calways right.\u201d Trump just pushed out legal adviser John Dowd, who advised\u00a0careful cooperation with Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, and has added Joe diGenova, who has fed Trump\u2019s fantasies of a deep state plot against him, signaling the much more aggressive confrontation with Mueller that Trump clearly craves, without having the foggiest strategic rationale. In both cases, these people are successfully giving shape to Trump\u2019s impulses.\n As Michelle Goldberg recently observed, one after another, the people who are supposed to be \u201cchecking Donald Trump\u2019s worst instincts and most erratic whims\u201d have departed. But this doesn\u2019t mean Trump is getting back to being who he always wanted to be. It means he is increasingly listening to people who are good at exploiting and shaping those instincts and whims.\n * KELLY WANTED McMASTER OUT, BUT NOT BOLTON IN: The New York Times reports some of the backstory on why Trump is replacing McMaster with Bolton:\n  McMaster \u2026 had a difficult relationship with the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, people close to the White House said. Mr. Kelly, they said, prevailed in easing out General McMaster but failed to prevent Mr. Trump from hiring Mr. Bolton, whom they said Mr. Kelly fears will behave like a cabinet official rather than a staff member.\n  Also, as the Times notes, McMaster committed the sin of acknowledging that Russia interfered in our election, which drew Trump\u2019s Twitter wrath.\n * BOLTON FAVORS REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN: The Post\u2019s write-up reminds us that Bolton has gone a lot further\u00a0than merely calling for withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal:\n  In January, Bolton told Fox News that Trump should dump the nuclear deal, reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran, and work toward an overthrow of the government there. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do, and we should do it,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cOur goal should be regime change in Iran.\u201d He similarly called for bombing Iran in a New York Times editorial in 2015.\n  Why yes, Bolton did indeed call for bombing Iran in 2015.\n * A FRIGHTENING CHOICE: Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp aptly sums up Bolton\u2019s career and the significance of his appointment:\n  Bolton has said the United States should declare war on both\u00a0North Korea\u00a0and\u00a0Iran. He was credibly accused of\u00a0manipulating US intelligence\u00a0on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war and of\u00a0abusive treatment\u00a0of his subordinates. He once \u201cjoked\u201d about\u00a0knocking 10 stories\u00a0off the UN building in New York. \u2026\u00a0American foreign policy may be soon be shaped by someone who seems to truly believe that war is the answer to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n  As Christopher Preble of the Cato Institute puts it: \u201cBolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible.\u201d\n * BOLTON DEEPLY ALARMS DEMS: This quote from Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut aptly sums up the reaction of many Democrats to the Bolton appointment:\n  \u201cThe person who will be first in first out of the Oval Office on national security matters passionately believes the U.S. should launch pre-emptive war against both Iran and North Korea with no authorization from Congress. My God.\u201d\n  McMaster had urged caution against scrapping the Iran deal, though he\u2019d also urged a hard line against North Korea. Now we\u2019ve got someone even more hawkish.\n * SPENDING BILL PASSES AS REPUBLICANS SCRAP PRINCIPLES: The Post reports that the Senate passed the massive $1.3 trillion omnibus, which jacks up spending on defense and non-defense spending alike:\n  It abandons GOP claims of fiscal discipline in a stark reversal of the promises many Republicans ran on in capturing control of the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014 as they railed against what they described as a profligate President Barack Obama. And in another about-face, GOP leaders tossed aside their own rules and past complaints about Democrats to rush the legislation through the House ahead of the Friday midnight government shutdown deadline.\n  Anyone who is surprised by this hasn\u2019t been paying attention to how Republicans have operated for the last decade or more.\n * TRUMP THREATENS VETO: Hello, Mr. President:\n   I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J.

Yet Trump is systematically alienating those countries \u2026 Trump\u2019s trade policy is quickly turning into an object lesson in the wages of ignorance.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n \n It would have been fascinating to run into Donald Trump at one of his properties five years ago and complain about the service. Would he have accepted the criticism and pledged to do better? Or would he instead have suggested that the problem was with the team he was working with, that he really tried to get them to fix the problem and that he doesn\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t?\n As president, there\u2019s been a dearth of ownership of problems on Trump\u2019s part. Perhaps a thousand articles have been written about how Trump fails to live up to the \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d mantra that Harry Truman made famous, including by yours truly. In part, that\u2019s a function of Trump\u2019s consistently demonstrating his unwillingness to accept responsibility for what happens in Washington, an abdication that stands out in sharper relief given that his party controls both the House and the Senate. His frequent protestations that the filibuster is keeping the Senate from enacting his vision is hampered by the fact that the difference-making opposition in that chamber often stems from Republicans.\n Trump raised the filibuster again on Friday during what he\u2019d billed as a \u201cnews conference\u201d but mostly ended up being a statement to the media. That statement echoed his complaints earlier in the day that the spending bill passed by Congress didn\u2019t include what he wanted to see. He stopped short of following through on his tweeted veto threat, though, which wasn\u2019t terribly surprising given that the White House had on Thursday touted that Trump himself had locked up the critical parts of the funding bill.\n  \u201cThere are a lot of things that I\u2019m unhappy about in this bill,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that we shouldn\u2019t have had in this bill. But we were, in a sense, forced \u2014 if we want to build our military, we were forced to have. There are some things that we should have in the bill. But I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I\u2019m not going to do it again.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider, in many cases, them to be bad or them to be a waste of money,\u201d he said later. \u201cBut that\u2019s the way, unfortunately, right now the system works.\u201d\n It\u2019s trite by now, but it\u2019s still important to note that this was specifically the logjam that Trump promised to break while he was campaigning. He was the master of dealmaking! He presented to the voters that he possessed some sort of skeleton key to unlock bipartisan and international agreement on any and every possible point of contention. He breezily dismissed partisan bickering on Capitol Hill as the sort of thing he could brush aside in an instant were he given access to the White House. He was given that access; the skeleton key apparently remained back in Trump Tower.\n What\u2019s weird about Trump\u2019s positioning on this bill (and on past legislative stumbles, like health-care reform) is that Trump doesn\u2019t only abdicate his claim to being a master dealmaker, he also positions himself as somehow powerless in the face of the entrenched interests in Washington.\n   Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration.

The dealmaker who\u2019d drain the swamp now wrings his hands at how the swamp keeps him from making deals.\n There are two theories for what\u2019s happening here.\n One is that Trump is strategically positioning himself in opposition to congressional leadership because it lets him maintain one of his favorite selling points from 2016: He\u2019s an outsider. It\u2019s awfully tricky for a president of the United States to position himself as oppositional to the government he runs, but one way to do that is to hint at how the establishment is keeping you from getting anything done. Trump is the guy trying to crack D.C. open, and D.C. keeps fighting back. That, this theory goes, is why Trump willingly tells America that he can\u2019t do the thing that he said he\u2019d do when he got to the White House. He knows where the boundaries are, and he steps outside of them to maintain his image as the guy who is necessary to shake things up.\n That may be one step more complicated than it needs to be. The other theory for why Trump positions himself as weak is that he\u2019d rather blame other people for unpopular things than worry about how that reflected on his capabilities. This is the hotel question that we led with. The manager of a hotel would, ideally, accept responsibility for problems at the hotel and assure that they\u2019d be fixed. A manager who blames the cleaning staff and says there was nothing he could do? Not super confidence inspiring.\n That analogy is flawed, obviously, since Trump can\u2019t fire Congress (to his chagrin). But it demonstrates the difference between two approaches to leadership.\n Let\u2019s go back to Friday\u2019s bill. Why did Trump apparently have a change of heart overnight? According to The Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey, because people called him and complained about it.\n   Lot of Trump friends and allies are dialing him in the last 24 hours telling him he's going to look bad if he signs the omnibus spending bill and that he will be played for something of a fool by Schumer, per two people with knowledge of the calls.\n\u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) March 23, 2018  \n \n The reporting on Trump has consistently indicated that his views on a subject are often heavily influenced by whoever spoke with him last. When those views are critical of something he\u2019s contemplating, his position might then align with those views. If he\u2019s stuck having to embrace something about which he\u2019s heard complaints, the middle path is to go along with it while complaining about it. Trump tweeted that he was considering a veto, the strongest position a president can take in opposition to a bill. And maybe he was \u2014 but even if he wasn\u2019t he can now point to that tweet as evidence of just how unhappy he was about having to sign it. He can point to his public statement and say that it\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 fault.\n Trump came to office having spent decades as the autocratic leader of the Trump Organization. The presidency doesn\u2019t work that way. The presidency is heavily dependent on negotiation and compromise \u2014 even when the president\u2019s party controls Congress. What the White House did on Thursday is position Trump as the leader who brought both sides together for a solution. What Trump did on Friday is position himself as a lamentably powerless observer who was forced into a position he opposed.\n Either because he wants to be seen as hostile to D.C. \u2014 or because he wants to avoid blame for something people don\u2019t like.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "James Mcauley", "body": "Former top White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon spoke to supporters of France\u2019s far-right National Front March 10 in Lille, France. (Reuters) \n \n  Former White House senior staffer Stephen K.

And history is on our side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tide of history is with us, and it will compel us to victory after victory after victory.\u201d\n His speech contained a familiar litany of attacks against global elites, Hillary Clinton and journalists. Some of it translated; some of it did not. When Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, mentioned that he once sold a company to the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale, the room erupted in jeers, not cheers. \u201cI thought you might like that,\u201d he said, in response.\n   Former senior adviser to President Trump, Stephen K. Bannon, left, and National Front president Marine Le Pen, at a news conference Saturday in Lille, France. (Thibault Vandermersch/European Pressphoto Agency) \n  [Bannon\u2019s post-Trump, post-Breitbart life is not what you\u2019d expect] \n On some level, the speech presented another development in the transatlantic relationship between far-right movements in the United States and Europe, particularly in France. Last month, Marion-Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen \u2014 the niece of the National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen \u2014 spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.\n Her speech echoed many of the statements of Donald Trump, the man Bannon helped get elected to the U.S. presidency. \u201cI am not offended when I hear President Donald Trump say \u2018America first,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI want Britain first for the British people, and I want France first for the French people.\u201d\n  [Trump\u2019s GOP is morphing into France\u2019s far right] \n But in general, the meeting between Bannon and the party of Marine Le Pen came a particularly fraught moment for them both, with one and the other trying to remain relevant in an unforgiving political environment.\n During the 2016 presidential campaign, Bannon was a close ally and confidante of Trump, and he joined the West Wing staff as Trump\u2019s chief strategist. But he was forced out of the White House last August. \n Likewise, Le Pen was a prominent contender for the French presidency in May 2017, but she lost to Emmanuel Macron in a landslide vote. Her party \u2014 widely seen as the alternative to Macron during the election \u2014 then fared poorly in France\u2019s legislative elections: in a parliament of 577 seats, the National Front now holds only eight. That figure presents a striking contrast with the 34 percent of the popular vote that Le Pen won in the presidential election, and her party cannot be labeled the opposition.\n  [France\u2019s National Front lost big. Now it\u2019s in chaos.] \n To that end, rebranding the National Front\u2019s image is the primary purpose of the \u201cparty congress\u201d in Lille this weekend. Le Pen and her allies are also expected to announce a new name for the party that they hope will appeal to more voters in the future.\n Le Pen has long sought to \u201cde-demonize\u201d her party by distancing it from its origins.\n The National Front was co-founded in 1972 by her father, the convicted Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, who continues to refer to Nazi gas chambers as a \u201cdetail\u201d in the history of World War II. Last week, he published the first volume of his memoirs, \u201cSon of the Nation,\u201d which feature an empathic defense of Philippe P\u00e9tain, the leader of France\u2019s Vichy government, a body that willingly collaborated with Nazi Germany during the war.\n Although several of Marine Le Pen\u2019s aides were also accused of Holocaust denial during the recent election campaign, she claims to be estranged from her father. The party conference in Lille will also feature a vote as to whether the elder Le Pen can keep his title as the party\u2019s honorary president. His daughter officially expelled him in 2015, for repeating the gas chamber remark.\n Bannon had some advice for those who might be embarrassed by such a history. \u201cLet them call you racists. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists,\u201d he said. \u201cWear it as a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker.\u201d\n In French media, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 noting that Bannon was widely perceived as the \u201cmost radical\u201d of Trump\u2019s advisers \u2014 cast doubt on the value of his daughter\u2019s American guest.\n \u201cI think this is not exactly the definition of \u2018de-demonization,\u2019\u201d he said.\n   \n  \n  Read more \n  No publisher would touch Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s memoir.

Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) on \u201cMeet The Press\u201c), it seemed as though\u00a0he was contemplating the Heretofore Unthinkable Course of trying to shut down the Mueller investigation. His lawyer\u00a0John Dowd even put forth a request that the investigation stop.\n But there is no cause for alarm. Should the president attempt such a course, the Republicans who hold power in Congress have made it clear that they will \u2026 be disappointed.\n One or two even have definite plans to\u00a0compose a strongly worded letter to the president and think very, very hard about sending it. Another handful\u00a0will go so far as to whisper to some reeds growing just on the edge of the great swamp that they think this idea is \u201cvery bad, and a travesty of our values.\u201d\n With one voice, Republicans in Congress have made it clear that\u00a0if the president\u00a0takes this extreme step, they will not be afraid to defy him by appearing on a cable news channel and saying something noncommittal. As they are doing right now. For instance, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf he tried to do that [fire Mueller], that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d Beware, President Trump! If you continue down your present course, there is every reason to believe that Graham\u00a0may even go so far as to write a memoir where he calls this \u201ca dark, dark moment for this country, when people should have spoken up.\u201d\n Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is likewise standing firm.\u00a0If the president crosses this hardest, firmest\u00a0red line, Rubio will be, like, super bummed, and probably also go on TV and say words to that effect, and maybe even\u00a0deliver a speech that includes stinging phrases like \u201cI weep for our democracy\u201d \u2014 which would be\u00a0delivered directly into a camera.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said nothing publicly, but those around him have been given to understand that if the president crosses this red line, McConnell will crumple up whatever paper he happens to be\u00a0holding at the time and throw it to the ground and say, \u201cDarn!\u201d loudly.\n Some Republicans have even spoken up already. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said\u00a0this weekend, through a spokesperson, that he continues to see firing Mueller\u00a0as a red line, and that he is pretty sure that if the president crosses it, someone will stop him. (Someone brave, probably. Someone who was in a position to do something about this.) Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said he\u00a0has confidence that we will get to hear the outcome of the Mueller investigation, because when have we ever seen this president violate norms in a surprising, disappointing way? Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he is confident in the courage of his fellow Republicans, who have never let him down before, and that they will do the right thing regardless of the electoral consequences. (He\u00a0is not running for reelection.) But just in case that does not work out, he is in New Hampshire right now shaking hands and kissing babies.\n The red line is certainly not slowly\u00a0receding into the distance like a mirage; it is definitely real, and it\u00a0will kick in this time. People should not be worried: If the future of our democracy depends on the courage of the current crop of Republican lawmakers, we can rest assured that when the time comes, they will\u00a0put country over party and eventually say something stern,\u00a0as they open for Trump at a rally.\n It is reassuring to hear the Republicans in the legislative branch, one of the checks and balances holding our democracy precariously in place, speaking\u00a0in chorus that there are some\u00a0breaches\u00a0they will not enjoy\u00a0accepting with\u00a0only a murmur of protest.\u00a0It will be grueling and disheartening for them to sit there silently and watch this unfold without taking the slightest action to stop it.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n \n Between 2009 and 2011, I briefed almost every political appointee to enter government at the start of their tenure on what it means to be a government employee, and the responsibilities that came with the office. I had one overriding message: Whatever you came into government to do \u2014 whether to work on health care or foreign policy or climate change \u2014 before you could do any of that, you have to commit to serve the public. The reasoning was simple. Public office is a public trust, and unless the public trusts you to be working on their behalf, government as an enterprise will fail.\n While I was the one giving these talks, either to hundreds of federal agency appointees in the lobby of the Ronald Reagan Building or to each new White House staffer in small gatherings, the message didn\u2019t originate with me. The idea came from our Founding Fathers, and the decision to prioritize it in the past administration came from the president.\n That\u2019s why it\u00a0has been disturbing to have witnessed for the past year a complete upending of this concept by the current holder of that office. This week\u2019s revelation by Ruth Marcus that President Trump had White House staff sign a nondisclosure agreement compelling their silence long after their government service is over, ostensibly to be enforceable by Trump personally, is the latest example. It\u2019s not just a matter of law (though government does restrict disclosure of some confidential or classified information, these NDAs go far beyond those rules); it\u2019s about principle, and what these NDAs signify about the president\u2019s view of government work. At root, it has become clear that Trump doesn\u2019t view public office as a public trust, but rather as a personal fiefdom, to be controlled by whomever is declared the winner of an election.\n [ Opinion: Trump had senior staff sign nondisclosure agreements. They\u2019re supposed to last beyond his presidency. ]\n With the plethora of scandals coming out of this White House, it can be hard to process them all. It\u2019s important not to treat the latest revelations about the NDA or any other scandal as just one more item on a list, forgotten after the next staffing fiasco or outrageous tweet. Taken together, Trump\u2019s actions add up to something more: a president who isn\u2019t committed to the fundamental principle that government exists to serve the public.\n First, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s expectation that every federal employee works for him personally. That explains his disbelief that Attorney General Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation rather than \u201ctotally protect\u201d Trump. It explains why he asked in various ways for personal loyalty\u00a0from James B. Comey, Rod J. Rosenstein and Andrew McCabe, and has removed two of them (so far) when he felt their loyalty was insufficient. And it\u2019s what\u00a0is so misguided about an NDA that, aside from imposing an outrageous lifetime blanket omerta on public servants, purports to be enforceable (it\u2019s not) by Trump personally as a private citizen after leaving office.\n   Second, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s view that he alone can wield the powers of government however he chooses. Or, as he declared recently, that he has \u201can absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department\u201d (he doesn\u2019t). Consider also his statement on aluminum and steel tariffs: \u201cI\u2019m sticking with 10 and 25 [percent] initially. I\u2019ll have a right to go up or down depending on the country, and I\u2019ll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.\u201d You would\u00a0never know from that statement that there is a Congress or an executive branch or any process designed to take public input.\n Third, there\u2019s his campaign to undermine any form of public accountability: The\u00a0media\u00a0are\u00a0fake; the voters are engaging in fraud; the special counsel is conflicted; the judges are biased; the potential witnesses against him are liars.\n And last, there\u2019s the way Trump uses his public office to enrich himself and his kin, whether by refusing to divest his businesses and allowing them to serve as a conduit for alleged bribes, or using his platform as head of state to hawk his golf properties\u00a0in official speeches.\n [ Trump Organization\u2019s real estate partner in India accused of $147 million fraud ]\n When you take all of this together, you don\u2019t just have an attack on the notion that public office is a public trust, you have an attack on the idea of liberal democracy itself \u2014 that the public elects officeholders to carry out the public\u2019s business, who are constrained by a set of checks and balances to ensure they don\u2019t subvert that mission.\n As the democracy expert Yascha Mounk put it recently, it\u2019s for these reasons that \u201cthe Founding Fathers insisted that the primary duty of American citizens should be to a set of ideas and institutions, not to a particular person,\u201d and that \u201cIt is this fundamental tradition that Trump \u2014 acting more like an Old World monarch who is used to demanding fealty from his subjects \u2014 [has] attack[ed].\u201d\n I was asked on occasion when I served in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office if staff should be required to sign NDAs.

Trump\u2019s tax bill will make it easier for the company to pay off debt under that deal\u00a0because of regulatory changes that will allow it to return cash from overseas.\n The fortunes of the Carrier plant have not been so bright.\n Since Trump\u2019s jawboning, the plant\u00a0experienced\u00a0a round of layoffs\u00a0in\u00a0July, when 337 workers left the plant. Another 300 positions were terminated in January.\n \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem that the government is going to use its\u00a0contracts to exert any leverage on the jobs front,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not as much of an action item as it was a year ago, and it wasn\u2019t then either. It was just optics.\u201d\n Robert James, president of the local United Steelworkers union that represents the Carrier employees, said he hasn\u2019t heard of more anticipated layoffs. But workers are skeptical\u00a0about the\u00a0future. Four days after Trump visited Indianapolis to celebrate the Carrier deal, United Technologies\u00a0chief executive Hayes said in a television interview that he planned to invest in automation, reducing the need for human labor.\n Some Carrier workers expressed resignation that\u00a0they would\u00a0see little benefit from the big defense deals.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the government doing business with big corporations like always,\u201d said T.J.

Cohen fired back in his own filings last week, claiming he\u00a0was entitled to $20 million in damages because she had violated it 20 times.\n Adding to the tension, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is scheduled to air an interview\u00a0between Cooper and Daniels on March 25.\u00a0The White House has denied that\u00a0there was ever an affair between Trump and the porn star.\n In Tuesday\u2019s CNN segment, Schwartz told Cooper that Trump was a third-party beneficiary\u00a0to the agreement, and that Cohen had acted on his own accord. There was a spot for Trump\u2019s signature, but Trump didn\u2019t sign it. He didn\u2019t have to, Schwartz said.\n Cooper asked if it was normal\u00a0for an attorney to pay out of his own pocket on his client\u2019s behalf.\n \u201cNo, but there\u2019s nothing illegal about it. And given the context of this relationship there\u2019s certainly nothing\u00a0unethical about it,\u201d Schwartz said.\n \u201cIf all of that is believable,\u201d Avenatti spit back, \u201cthen why did Mr. Cohen draft an agreement with a signature line for Donald Trump?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s painting a fictional picture of the whole scenario,\u201d Schwartz said. He\u00a0then accused Avenatti of deliberately advising Daniels to\u00a0\u201cblatantly violate\u201d the contract.\n \u201cShe\u2019s going to be liable for $20 million,\u201d he said, pointing a finger at Avenatti, \u201cand Michael Cohen is going to collect every single penny of that money, make no mistake.\u201d\n They sparred for several minutes over the provisions of the agreement, some of which\u00a0require\u00a0Trump to stay away from her and her family and release her from claims he has against her, according to Avenatti. Schwartz\u00a0called Avenatti\u2019s view of the agreement \u201cabsurd\u201d and again\u00a0saying Daniels would be on the hook for a lot of money.\n \u201cWhy not just let her talk?\u201d\u00a0Avenatti\u00a0interjected, wagging his finger at Schwartz. \u201cWhy is it so important to your friend and the president of the United States to keep this woman under wraps, to keep her under the thumb, to shut her up?\u201d\n By way of analogy, Avenatti compared dispute over the agreement to buying a house for $130,000, then being told that only one of the bedrooms was available.\n \u201cIf it\u2019s gonna take him that long to explain it to the judge he\u2019s in big trouble,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go down in flames on this case.\u201d\n \u201cI hope you have a good malpractice policy,\u201d he added later, \u201cbecause when she\u00a0owes $20 million she should go after you to collect the money.\u201d\n In the weeks since the Wall Street Journal first reported that Cohen had arranged the $130,000 payment, questions have swirled about whether it was\u00a0intended to protect Trump\u00a0at a time when his\u00a0election was looking like a\u00a0real possibility. As The Washington Post has reported, there are at least two complaints\u00a0to the Federal Election Commission alleging the money was meant to influence the election and therefore amounted to an illegal in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign. The Post also reported last week that Cohen sought to\u00a0prevent Daniels from airing her story about her alleged affair with the president as early as 2011.\n Cohen has acknowledged he personally paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and said he was not reimbursed by the Trump campaign. He told Vanity Fair in an interview this week that the agreement wasn\u2019t an election issue\u00a0and denied claims by Avenatti that Daniels had been manipulated or intimidated into signing it. \u201cUnlike Mr. Avenatti, we are not handling this matter through the court of public opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are handling it through a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n Cooper asked Schwartz why it took years to strike the agreement: \u201cWhy anyone should anyone honestly believe this had nothing to do with the election?\u201d\n \u201cBecause this is when she came out and threatened to disclose this information,\u201d Schwartz responded.\n Avenatti scoffed. \u201cIt had everything to do with the election,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear as day.\u201d\n Schwartz fired back: If it\u2019s already an invalid contract, why file a lawsuit over it?\n \u201cBecause we want a judicial determination that this agreement is trash,\u201d Avenatti said, \u201cwhich it is.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Karoun Demirjian", "body": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.

Leonnig", "body": "For much of the past year, President Trump has declined to participate in a practice followed by  the past seven of his predecessors: He rarely if ever reads the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a document that lays out the most pressing information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from hot spots around the world. Trump has opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office rather than getting the full written document delivered to review separately each day, according to three people familiar with his briefings.\u00a0 Reading the traditionally dense intelligence book is not Trump\u2019s preferred \u201cstyle of learning,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The arrangement underscores Trump\u2019s impatience with exhaustive classified documents that go to the commander in chief \u2014 material that he has said he prefers condensed as much as possible. But by not reading the daily\u00a0briefing, the president could hamper his ability to respond to crises in the most effective manner, intelligence experts warned. Soon after Trump took office, analysts sought to tailor their intelligence sessions for a president with a famously short attention span, who is known for taking in much of his information from the conservative Fox News Channel. The oral briefings were augmented with photos, videos and graphics. After several months, Trump made clear he was not interested in reviewing\u00a0a personal copy of the written intelligence report known as the PDB, a highly classified summary prepared before dawn to provide the president with the best update on the world\u2019s events, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\u00a0\u00a0 Administration officials defended Trump\u2019s reliance on oral sessions and said he gets full intelligence briefings, noting that presidents have historically sought to receive the information in different ways. Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Trump \u201cis an avid consumer of intelligence, appreciates the hard work of his briefers and of the entire intelligence community and looks forward every day to the give and take of his intelligence briefings.\u201d Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement that \u201cany notion that President Trump is not fully engaged in the PDB or does not read the briefing materials is pure fiction and is clearly not based on firsthand knowledge of the process.\u201d He added that Trump\u2019s routine sessions with senior intelligence advisers \u201cdemonstrate his interest in and appreciation for the value of the intelligence provided. In fact, President Trump engages for significantly longer periods than I understand many previous presidents have done.\u201d   The PDB, which has been described as a newspaper with the smallest circulation in the world, is drawn from material provided by U.S. spies, satellites and surveillance technology, as well as news sources and foreign intelligence agencies.  [Trump\u2019s favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust? ]  Several intelligence experts said that the president\u2019s aversion to diving deeper into written\u00a0intelligence details \u2014 the \u201chomework\u201d that past presidents have done to familiarize themselves with foreign policy and national security \u2014 makes both him and the country more vulnerable. Leon Panetta,\u00a0a former CIA director and defense  said Trump\u00a0could miss important context and nuance if he is relying solely on an oral briefing. The arrangement also increases pressure on the president\u2019s national security team, which cannot entirely replace a well-informed commander in chief, he said. \u201cSomething will be missed,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cIf for some reason his instincts on what should be done are not backed up by the intelligence because he hasn\u2019t taken the time to read that intel, it increases the risk that he will make a mistake.\u201d \u201cYou can have the smartest people around you \u2014 in the end it still comes down to his decision,\u201d he added. The top-secret intelligence report, which dates in its current form to\u00a0the Johnson administration, is made up of individual \u201carticles\u201d written by career analysts, mostly from the CIA. The PDB is so tightly controlled that intelligence officials maintain a log to record when the briefers provide a copy of the document to a principal and when they retrieve it, several officials said. Mark Lowenthal, a\u00a0career intelligence officer who served as a CIA assistant director from 2002 to 2005, said Trump does not have to read the PDB if he is getting an extensive oral briefing. He warned, however, that a short briefing on a few select items would leave the president ill-equipped for major decisions over the long term. \u201cThen he\u2019s really not getting a full intelligence briefing,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cYou need to get immersed in a story over its entire course. You can\u2019t just jump into an issue and come up to speed on the actors and the implications. The odds are pretty good that something will arise later on for which he has no intelligence basis for helping him work through it.\u201d\u00a0 The document, while traditionally lengthy and dense, contains\u00a0key insights\u00a0that can create a cumulative body of knowledge \u2014 and foreshadow looming threats, intelligence professionals said.\u00a0 President George W. Bush faced a political firestorm over how closely his administration was paying attention to the PDB after it was discovered that a month before the 9/11 attacks, his briefing book had included a warning that Osama bin Laden was \u201cdetermined\u201d to attack U.S. targets using airplanes. In the current administration, versions of the president\u2019s written intelligence briefing are provided to at least a dozen top officials, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to people familiar with the dissemination. Aides say Trump receives his\u00a0in-person intelligence briefing nearly every day, although his publicly released schedules indicate that the sessions have been taking place about every two to three days on average in recent months, typically around 11 a.m. One senior White House official described the\u00a0Oval Office briefing as a distilled version of the sessions that senior administration officials receive earlier in the day. CIA Director\u00a0Mike Pompeo usually attends the session, as does Coats. During Trump\u2019s briefing,\u00a0a\u00a0veteran intelligence official\u00a0typically\u00a0describes intelligence highlights contained in a shortened, written version of the PDB.\u00a0Trump has rarely, if ever, requested that the document be left behind for him to read, according to people familiar with the meetings.\u00a0 Pompeo has said the president is briefed on current developments, as well as upcoming events \u2014 such as visits by foreign leaders \u2014 and longer-term strategic issues. \u201cThe president asks hard questions,\u201d he said in public remarks last month. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply engaged. We'll have a rambunctious back-and-forth, all aimed at making sure we\u2019re delivering him the truth as best we understand it.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s admirers say he has a unique ability to cut through conventional foreign policy wisdom and ask questions that others have long taken for granted. \u201cWhy are we even in Somalia?\u201d or \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just pull out of Afghanistan?\u201d he will ask, according to officials.\u00a0 The president asks \u201cedge\u201d questions, said one senior administration official, meaning that he pushes his staff to question long-held assumptions about U.S. interests in the world. Another person familiar with the briefing process said that, at times, Trump has been dismissive of his briefers. He has shaken his head, frowned and complained that the briefers were\u00a0\u201ctalking down to him,\u201d this person said. Trump has at times demonstrated a deep distrust of the intelligence community. He has accused Obama-era intelligence chiefs of rooting against his election and exaggerating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to delegitimize his presidency. The Washington Post\u00a0reported last year that intelligence officials in some cases have included Russia-related intelligence only in the\u00a0president\u2019s daily\u00a0written assessment, steering clear of it in the oral briefing in order not to upset Trump. The last U.S. president who is believed not to have regularly reviewed the PDB was\u00a0Richard Nixon. The historical record contains no references to him having read the document,\u00a0although\u00a0Nixon and\u00a0his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, received a copy each day, according to David Priess, a former CIA briefer and author of \u201cThe President\u2019s Book of Secrets.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt is not unprecedented for someone to get only an oral briefing of the PDB,\u201d Priess said.\u00a0\u201cBut it is the exception rather than the rule. And a rare exception.\u201d\u00a0 The intelligence community prides itself on tailoring the briefing document and the oral briefing\u00a0to each president\u2019s style. Obama preferred to received the PDB on a secure iPad to review before asking questions of his briefers.\u00a0\u00a0 President\u00a0George W. Bush typically read the\u00a0PDB first thing in the morning, with his briefer present to review the highlights and answer questions, according to former officials who briefed him. Neither Obama nor Bush reviewed the briefing book every day, and at times they skipped a session, especially when traveling President Ronald Reagan read the PDB every day but chose not to have a briefing from a CIA officer, said John Poindexter, who served as Reagan\u2019s national security adviser. Reagan often discussed the briefing document in morning Oval Office meetings with his top advisers, Poindexter said.\u00a0 Trump indicated early on that\u00a0he had little interest in immersing himself in detailed intelligence documents.\u00a0 \u201cI like bullets or I like as little as possible. I don\u2019t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page,\u201d he told Axios shortly before taking office. During the transition, the CIA offered to give Trump the same daily intelligence briefing that Obama received, a tradition for presidents-elect. But Trump declined a daily update, opting for less frequent briefings. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d Trump said in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview in December 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years \u2014 but eight years. I don\u2019t need that.\u201d At the time, Obama warned it was never wise to skip insights from intelligence professionals.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting their perspective \u2014 their detailed perspective \u2014 then you are flying blind,\u201d he said in an interview on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d During the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, the format of his intelligence briefings changed. In the early days, he received the traditional briefing sometime between 9 and 10:30 a.m.,\u00a0according to his publicly released schedules.\u00a0Within a few months, his intelligence advisers began augmenting the sessions with maps, charts, pictures and videos, as well as \u201ckiller graphics,\u201d as Pompeo put it at the time.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s our task, right? To deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we\u2019re trying to communicate,\u201d Pompeo\u00a0told The Post in May.  [How President Trump consumes \u2014 or does not consume \u2014 top-secret intelligence]   The early briefing sessions had a more freewheeling quality,\u00a0according to current and former administration officials. Five or more White House aides might join Trump for the briefing,\u00a0in addition to his briefer and intelligence officials. The meetings\u00a0were often dominated by whatever topic most interested the president that day.\u00a0Trump would discuss the news of the day or a tweet he sent about North Korea or the border wall \u2014 or anything else on his mind, two people familiar with the briefings said.\u00a0 On such days, there would only be a few minutes left \u2014 and the briefers would have barely broached the topics they came to discuss, one senior U.S. official said. \u201cHe often goes off on tangents during the briefing and you\u2019d have to rein him back in,\u201d one official said. After he joined the administration in July, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly slashed the number of people who could attend the intelligence briefings in an effort to exert more discipline over how the president consumes information, current and former officials said.\u00a0  Josh Dawsey and Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Sari Horwitz", "body": "(Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)     The Justice Department announced the indictment Friday of a notorious Russian troll farm \u2014 naming more than a dozen individual suspects who allegedly worked there \u2014 as part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into criminal interference with the 2016 election.

Eight years after nearly every Senate Democrat backed a sweeping set of new rules for financial firms large and small, the party is now split, with moderates, several of them facing tough midterm election contests, working with the opposing party.\n The core of the new bill exempts about two dozen financial companies with assets between $50\u2009billion and $250\u2009billion from the highest levels of scrutiny by the Federal Reserve, the nation\u2019s central bank. Supporters argue that the legislation would bring much-needed relief to midsize and regional banks that were treated like their much larger counterparts under the 2010 legislation known as Dodd-Frank. Opponents say it would weaken the oversight needed to stave off the type of dangerous lending and investing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees.\n The Senate is slated to take an initial procedural vote this week to move the measure forward, and if it eventually becomes law, it would be the most substantial weakening of Dodd-Frank since it was passed.\n \u201cOn the 10th anniversary of an enormous financial crash, Congress should not be passing laws to roll back regulations on Wall Street banks,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in an interview. \u201cThe bill permits about 25 of the 40 largest banks in America to escape heightened scrutiny and to be regulated as if they were tiny little community banks that could have no impact on the economy.\u201d\n Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a Banking Committee member and one of the new bill\u2019s leading Democratic supporters, said banks in his largely rural state have been going out of business in part because of the regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank.\n \u201cThe Main Street banks, community banks and credit unions didn\u2019t create the crisis in 2008, and they were getting heavily regulated,\u201d Tester said, contending that \u201cthere\u2019s not one thing in this bill that gives Wall Street a break.\u201d\n Critics dispute those claims, echoing a Democratic Party schism over financial regulations that pits liberals such as Warren and top Banking Committee Democrat Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) against moderate-leaning Democrats including Tester and Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.).\n Many of the moderates face political pressure to establish a centrist voting record, particularly after voting against the GOP tax cuts in December. Tester, Heitkamp and Donnelly are all up for reelection in November in states President Trump won by large margins. All three helped negotiate the banking legislation with its GOP sponsor, Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).\n Yet the coalition of Democrats supporting the bill also includes lawmakers such as Tim Kaine (Va.), Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in the 2016 election, and Mark R. Warner (Va.), who was among the lead authors of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act but also voiced concerns about over-regulating smaller banks. \n The GOP-led bill appears to have a clear path to becoming law. The level of Democratic support all but guarantees that the bill will have the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate, which will move toward debate on the legislation with a procedural vote set for Tuesday. And the Trump administration has been broadly supportive.\n The House has already passed legislation that would repeal larger chunks of Dodd-Frank, so proponents\u2019 biggest remaining challenge may be to reconcile the House and Senate versions.

Schumer (D-N.Y.), who represents Wall Street and is often motivated by the desire to protect his vulnerable red-state incumbents, opposes the bill, but he has taken a largely hands-off approach to the debate thus far.\n That a Wall Street regulatory rollback is possible is a testament to the financial sector\u2019s improved standing on Capitol Hill \u2014 as well as to the lobbying muscle of local banks and credit unions present in every state.\n Financial firms upped their campaign contributions to key Senate Democrats over the last year, with  Heitkamp, Donnelly and Tester becoming the top three Senate recipients of donations from commercial banks so far in the 2018 campaign cycle , according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The senators disputed any connection between the donations and their support for the Dodd-Frank rewrite legislation.\n Lobbying efforts ramped up as the Senate debate approached. The Credit Union National Association descended on Washington in late February to meet with lawmakers. More than 5,000 credit union advocates, including employees and chief executives from every state, arrived on Capitol Hill wearing \u201cvote yes\u201d pins and stickers. They held 600 meetings with lawmakers.\n The in-person push started with a White House meeting with Trump and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, during which credit union advocates pitched the bill as a way to rectify Dodd-Frank\u2019s overreach. \u201cWe understand the concerns that banks perpetuated the crash, but those were not credit unions,\u201d said Jim Nussle, president of the Credit Union National Association, who attended the meeting.\n Small and regional banks have complained that Dodd-Frank has put them under an unfair supervisory squeeze, punishing them for the sins of Wall Street. Many lawmakers from both parties have proved sympathetic to these claims, helping fuel bipartisan backing for Crapo\u2019s bill. \n While the bill\u2019s effects on the financial sector would only become fully clear after passage, the legislation aims to strike a middle ground between those seeking to gut Dodd-Frank and those who want the law left intact \u2014 or, at most, to be modified by tweaks and technical corrections.\n The new measure centers on an exemption for some two dozen financial companies from stricter supervision by the Federal Reserve. It would lift the asset limit for this scrutiny from $50\u2009billion to $250\u2009billion, easing \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 scrutiny on banks such as SunTrust and BBT. Fewer than 10 U.S. banks have more than $250\u2009billion in assets, although the Fed would reserve the right to apply tougher scrutiny to a smaller bank if it felt this was justified.\n Critics charge that advocates of deregulation are guilty of overly short memories and a false sense of security. There has not been a banking crisis since the Dodd-Frank law \u2014 named for its sponsors, former senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and former congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) \u2014 passed a Democratic-controlled Congress in 2010 on nearly party-line votes and was signed by Obama.\n The law was a response to the 2008 financial crisis that felled hundreds of banks and large financial companies, nearly toppling some of the largest U.S. financial institutions, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. The Bush administration was forced to seek a $700\u2009billion rescue package that stabilized the economy by keeping some of the largest firms afloat.\n The crisis was fueled by risky investments at all levels of the financial system. Local banks and mortgage brokers offered subprime home loans to people who had little chance of keeping up with their payments, and then sold those loans to firms up the chain. They were in turn bundled by larger firms and used for a string of exotic financial instruments sold around the world. When homeowners defaulted on their loans en masse, the bonds they\u2019d been bundled into \u2014 as well as other assets based on those bonds \u2014 collapsed in value, threatening to take the global financial system down with them.\n The Dodd-Frank law, which tightened supervision of the largest financial companies, made it harder for banks to use exotic financial instruments that could destabilize the financial system, tightened mortgage lending rules and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to prevent companies from ripping off borrowers. The law also created a system to wind down a large failing financial company in a way that limits taxpayer exposure in the future.\n The system for winding down failing banks has never been tested, and banks have been subjected to rigorous stress tests to determine whether they can withstand another shock. A number of large banks have been caught engaging in risky practices.\n Supporters say the bill includes a number of new consumer protections, including a one-year fraud alert in consumers\u2019 files and a provision aimed at protecting veterans\u2019 credit. Opponents point to the weakening of stress-test requirements and the elimination of some homeowner protections, including the blocking of homeowners from going to court to prevent wrongful foreclosures.\n \u201cThe public is not asking for bank deregulation,\u201d argued Brown, who sought compromise with Crapo on the issue last year before concluding that the bill was going in a direction he couldn\u2019t support. \u201cThis is not a community bank bill. They say it is. It\u2019s like the tax cuts weren\u2019t a middle-class tax bill; they want to say it is. This is a bill that helps some of the largest banks.\u201d\n Frank, whose signature law stands to be partially dismantled by the Crapo bill, opposes the new legislation. But he has been in touch with senators on both sides and agrees that it leaves the major protections of Dodd-Frank in place.\n He and others have argued over the years that Dodd-Frank did need adjusting, but \u2014 much as with Obama\u2019s signature law, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 most efforts for small-scale corrections stalled after being swept up into bids for full-on repeal.\n In an interview, Frank disputed the suggestion that the Crapo bill might lead to another financial crisis, arguing that the rules on mortgages and derivatives remain essentially unchanged. And Frank said he\u2019d rather see Heitkamp, Tester and Donnelly vote for the legislation and get reelected in November than vote against it and lose.\n \u201cIf they were defeated, in the next Congress you\u2019d get a much worse bill,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThe community banks drive this. They\u2019re in everyone\u2019s district.\u201d\n Democrats have been lured into supporting bank-friendly laws in the past only to regret it years later.\n The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act passed in 1999 with the support of 138 House Democrats, and it was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. That law allowed commercial banks and investment banks to merge, a phenomenon that many analysts later argued paved the way for the 2008 financial crisis by creating wobbly behemoths such as Citigroup.\n In 2000, Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, a law that led to the rapid expansion of certain complex financial instruments that were at the heart of the financial crisis eight years later.\n  \nRenae Merle and Jeff Stein contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Rubin", "body": "Then-acting FBI director Andrew McCabe listens during a news conference on July 13, 2017, at the Justice Department in Washington. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n \n It is no trifle when Stephen K. Bannon attacks the \u201cdeep state.\u201d It is not simply a legal ploy when Republicans running interference for President Trump call the FBI \u201ccorrupt\u201d or when Trump\u2019s lawyer John Dowd calls to shut down the Russia investigation. When a witness to conversations and interactions with Trump who has turned over information to the investigation\u00a0is fired, the danger goes beyond the investigation directly at hand. In one form or another, these are attacks on a vital pillar of democratic government \u2014 the apolitical administration of justice.\n As to Dowd\u2019s comments, which he later claimed represented his own views, reaction across the political spectrum was harsh, while many outside observers raised questions about the motive behind former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe\u2019s firing.\n Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a terse statement:\u00a0\u201cMr. Dowd\u2019s comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of the president and his legal team is not to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn.\u00a0The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel\u2019s investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s actions have broader implications for our democracy. Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group seeking to check attacks on democracy and illegitimate executive branch power grabs, put out a\u00a0white paper\u00a0this month that now seems prescient. \u201cIf those in power can wield the enforcement\u00a0authority of the state to punish their critics or opponents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or to turn a blind eye to\u00a0law-breaking by their friends\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we have lost the rule of law. Thomas Jefferson\u00a0observed, and the Justice Department quotes on its website, \u2018The most sacred of the\u00a0duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.\u2019\u00a0Each\u00a0time the White House intervenes with the Justice Department\u2019s handling of a\u00a0specific-party matter, it risks violating that sacred duty.\u201d\u00a0When the president seeks to reach down into the Justice Department to tilt the outcome of actions or to punish individual lawyers for pursuing justice, a grave injury is done to our democracy.\n Yascha Mounk, author of \u201cThe People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger And How to Save It,\u201d\u00a0tells me, \u201cFor citizens to have trust in their law enforcement agencies, justice doesn\u2019t only need to be done; it also needs to be seen to be done. Given that Mr. McCabe was fired after continual attacks from the President of the United States, we already know that this important principle has been violated in this case.\u201d He adds, \u201cEven if it eventually turns out that McCabe really did misbehave \u2014 and there is no publicly available evidence to substantiate that theory so far \u2014 the manner of his firing undermines the independence of the FBI and the trust Americans can put in their institutions.\u201d He continues, \u201cThe alternative is even worse: If the charges against McCabe eventually turn out to be spurious, then the partisan takeover of the FBI is very far along. And that should terrify any American citizen who values his liberty or his democracy.\u201d\n That politicization of the Justice Department and the implicit threat of retaliation for crossing the president should be of grave concern.\n Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is right to call for immediate hearings. In a statement released on Saturday he said, \u201cDuring my four decades in the Senate, I have never before seen our nation\u2019s career, apolitical law enforcement officials so personally and publicly maligned by politicians \u2014 indeed, by our President. And I have never been so concerned that the walls intended to protect the independence of our dedicated law enforcement professionals, including Special Counsel Mueller, are at risk of crumbling.\u201d He recounted, \u201c\u201cA month ago I asked Chairman Grassley to hold a hearing on the escalating politicized attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. We can all point to mistakes made by Justice Department officials over the course of high-profile investigations during the 2016 elections. Such mistakes rightly fall within the purview of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s routine oversight functions. . . .\u00a0 I believe the Judiciary Committee will fail to fulfill its core oversight responsibility if it does nothing in this moment.\u201d\n Between Dowd\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s after McCabe\u2019s firing, we see the intensification of Trump\u2019s deliberate interference with the Justice Department to suit the president\u2019s personal interests.\u00a0\u201cWhatever Andrew McCabe did or did not do, his firing two days before retiring would obviously never have happened if the President hadn\u2019t personally demanded it,\u201d Protect Democracy Executive Director Ian Bassin surmises. He tells me that this incident shows that \u201cTrump has moved from autocratic rhetoric to autocratic action, as personally ordering the purging of civil servants who are insufficiently loyal is what autocrats do.\u201d He warns the Justice Department inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility not to do Trump\u2019s bidding. Bassin asserts, \u201cTrump\u2019s certain intervention was also so manifestly corrupt that it likely violated constitutional principles that limit a President\u2019s authority to \u2018do whatever he wants with the Justice Department.'\u201d\n In sum, recent events should underscore the dangers that remain so long as Trump is president. First, he may use his executive powers to extract revenge, settle scores and instill fear in political opponents \u2014 just as the Nixon White House did with the Internal Revenue Service.\u00a0Second, he will continue to undermine the morale of prosecutors and investigators, causing them to leave, second-guess their actions or shape their work so as to avoid the president\u2019s wrath. And worst of all, Trump will undermine the public\u2019s faith in entities that are supposed to be apolitical fact-finders and enforcers of the law, leading Americans to question the honesty and fairness of our government and criminal-justice system. That, in a nutshell, is how authoritarians infiltrate and abuse the administration of justice \u2014 unless the voters rise up to stop them.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Carol D. Leonnig", "body": "For much of the past year, President Trump has declined to participate in a practice followed by  the past seven of his predecessors: He rarely if ever reads the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a document that lays out the most pressing information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from hot spots around the world. Trump has opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office rather than getting the full written document delivered to review separately each day, according to three people familiar with his briefings.\u00a0 Reading the traditionally dense intelligence book is not Trump\u2019s preferred \u201cstyle of learning,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The arrangement underscores Trump\u2019s impatience with exhaustive classified documents that go to the commander in chief \u2014 material that he has said he prefers condensed as much as possible. But by not reading the daily\u00a0briefing, the president could hamper his ability to respond to crises in the most effective manner, intelligence experts warned. Soon after Trump took office, analysts sought to tailor their intelligence sessions for a president with a famously short attention span, who is known for taking in much of his information from the conservative Fox News Channel. The oral briefings were augmented with photos, videos and graphics. After several months, Trump made clear he was not interested in reviewing\u00a0a personal copy of the written intelligence report known as the PDB, a highly classified summary prepared before dawn to provide the president with the best update on the world\u2019s events, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\u00a0\u00a0 Administration officials defended Trump\u2019s reliance on oral sessions and said he gets full intelligence briefings, noting that presidents have historically sought to receive the information in different ways. Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Trump \u201cis an avid consumer of intelligence, appreciates the hard work of his briefers and of the entire intelligence community and looks forward every day to the give and take of his intelligence briefings.\u201d Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement that \u201cany notion that President Trump is not fully engaged in the PDB or does not read the briefing materials is pure fiction and is clearly not based on firsthand knowledge of the process.\u201d He added that Trump\u2019s routine sessions with senior intelligence advisers \u201cdemonstrate his interest in and appreciation for the value of the intelligence provided. In fact, President Trump engages for significantly longer periods than I understand many previous presidents have done.\u201d   The PDB, which has been described as a newspaper with the smallest circulation in the world, is drawn from material provided by U.S. spies, satellites and surveillance technology, as well as news sources and foreign intelligence agencies.  [Trump\u2019s favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust? ]  Several intelligence experts said that the president\u2019s aversion to diving deeper into written\u00a0intelligence details \u2014 the \u201chomework\u201d that past presidents have done to familiarize themselves with foreign policy and national security \u2014 makes both him and the country more vulnerable. Leon Panetta,\u00a0a former CIA director and defense  said Trump\u00a0could miss important context and nuance if he is relying solely on an oral briefing. The arrangement also increases pressure on the president\u2019s national security team, which cannot entirely replace a well-informed commander in chief, he said. \u201cSomething will be missed,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cIf for some reason his instincts on what should be done are not backed up by the intelligence because he hasn\u2019t taken the time to read that intel, it increases the risk that he will make a mistake.\u201d \u201cYou can have the smartest people around you \u2014 in the end it still comes down to his decision,\u201d he added. The top-secret intelligence report, which dates in its current form to\u00a0the Johnson administration, is made up of individual \u201carticles\u201d written by career analysts, mostly from the CIA. The PDB is so tightly controlled that intelligence officials maintain a log to record when the briefers provide a copy of the document to a principal and when they retrieve it, several officials said. Mark Lowenthal, a\u00a0career intelligence officer who served as a CIA assistant director from 2002 to 2005, said Trump does not have to read the PDB if he is getting an extensive oral briefing. He warned, however, that a short briefing on a few select items would leave the president ill-equipped for major decisions over the long term. \u201cThen he\u2019s really not getting a full intelligence briefing,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cYou need to get immersed in a story over its entire course. You can\u2019t just jump into an issue and come up to speed on the actors and the implications. The odds are pretty good that something will arise later on for which he has no intelligence basis for helping him work through it.\u201d\u00a0 The document, while traditionally lengthy and dense, contains\u00a0key insights\u00a0that can create a cumulative body of knowledge \u2014 and foreshadow looming threats, intelligence professionals said.\u00a0 President George W. Bush faced a political firestorm over how closely his administration was paying attention to the PDB after it was discovered that a month before the 9/11 attacks, his briefing book had included a warning that Osama bin Laden was \u201cdetermined\u201d to attack U.S. targets using airplanes. In the current administration, versions of the president\u2019s written intelligence briefing are provided to at least a dozen top officials, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to people familiar with the dissemination. Aides say Trump receives his\u00a0in-person intelligence briefing nearly every day, although his publicly released schedules indicate that the sessions have been taking place about every two to three days on average in recent months, typically around 11 a.m. One senior White House official described the\u00a0Oval Office briefing as a distilled version of the sessions that senior administration officials receive earlier in the day. CIA Director\u00a0Mike Pompeo usually attends the session, as does Coats. During Trump\u2019s briefing,\u00a0a\u00a0veteran intelligence official\u00a0typically\u00a0describes intelligence highlights contained in a shortened, written version of the PDB.\u00a0Trump has rarely, if ever, requested that the document be left behind for him to read, according to people familiar with the meetings.\u00a0 Pompeo has said the president is briefed on current developments, as well as upcoming events \u2014 such as visits by foreign leaders \u2014 and longer-term strategic issues. \u201cThe president asks hard questions,\u201d he said in public remarks last month. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply engaged. We'll have a rambunctious back-and-forth, all aimed at making sure we\u2019re delivering him the truth as best we understand it.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s admirers say he has a unique ability to cut through conventional foreign policy wisdom and ask questions that others have long taken for granted. \u201cWhy are we even in Somalia?\u201d or \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just pull out of Afghanistan?\u201d he will ask, according to officials.\u00a0 The president asks \u201cedge\u201d questions, said one senior administration official, meaning that he pushes his staff to question long-held assumptions about U.S. interests in the world. Another person familiar with the briefing process said that, at times, Trump has been dismissive of his briefers. He has shaken his head, frowned and complained that the briefers were\u00a0\u201ctalking down to him,\u201d this person said. Trump has at times demonstrated a deep distrust of the intelligence community. He has accused Obama-era intelligence chiefs of rooting against his election and exaggerating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to delegitimize his presidency. The Washington Post\u00a0reported last year that intelligence officials in some cases have included Russia-related intelligence only in the\u00a0president\u2019s daily\u00a0written assessment, steering clear of it in the oral briefing in order not to upset Trump. The last U.S. president who is believed not to have regularly reviewed the PDB was\u00a0Richard Nixon. The historical record contains no references to him having read the document,\u00a0although\u00a0Nixon and\u00a0his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, received a copy each day, according to David Priess, a former CIA briefer and author of \u201cThe President\u2019s Book of Secrets.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt is not unprecedented for someone to get only an oral briefing of the PDB,\u201d Priess said.\u00a0\u201cBut it is the exception rather than the rule. And a rare exception.\u201d\u00a0 The intelligence community prides itself on tailoring the briefing document and the oral briefing\u00a0to each president\u2019s style. Obama preferred to received the PDB on a secure iPad to review before asking questions of his briefers.\u00a0\u00a0 President\u00a0George W. Bush typically read the\u00a0PDB first thing in the morning, with his briefer present to review the highlights and answer questions, according to former officials who briefed him. Neither Obama nor Bush reviewed the briefing book every day, and at times they skipped a session, especially when traveling President Ronald Reagan read the PDB every day but chose not to have a briefing from a CIA officer, said John Poindexter, who served as Reagan\u2019s national security adviser. Reagan often discussed the briefing document in morning Oval Office meetings with his top advisers, Poindexter said.\u00a0 Trump indicated early on that\u00a0he had little interest in immersing himself in detailed intelligence documents.\u00a0 \u201cI like bullets or I like as little as possible. I don\u2019t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page,\u201d he told Axios shortly before taking office. During the transition, the CIA offered to give Trump the same daily intelligence briefing that Obama received, a tradition for presidents-elect. But Trump declined a daily update, opting for less frequent briefings. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d Trump said in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview in December 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years \u2014 but eight years. I don\u2019t need that.\u201d At the time, Obama warned it was never wise to skip insights from intelligence professionals.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting their perspective \u2014 their detailed perspective \u2014 then you are flying blind,\u201d he said in an interview on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d During the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, the format of his intelligence briefings changed. In the early days, he received the traditional briefing sometime between 9 and 10:30 a.m.,\u00a0according to his publicly released schedules.\u00a0Within a few months, his intelligence advisers began augmenting the sessions with maps, charts, pictures and videos, as well as \u201ckiller graphics,\u201d as Pompeo put it at the time.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s our task, right? To deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we\u2019re trying to communicate,\u201d Pompeo\u00a0told The Post in May.  [How President Trump consumes \u2014 or does not consume \u2014 top-secret intelligence]   The early briefing sessions had a more freewheeling quality,\u00a0according to current and former administration officials. Five or more White House aides might join Trump for the briefing,\u00a0in addition to his briefer and intelligence officials. The meetings\u00a0were often dominated by whatever topic most interested the president that day.\u00a0Trump would discuss the news of the day or a tweet he sent about North Korea or the border wall \u2014 or anything else on his mind, two people familiar with the briefings said.\u00a0 On such days, there would only be a few minutes left \u2014 and the briefers would have barely broached the topics they came to discuss, one senior U.S. official said. \u201cHe often goes off on tangents during the briefing and you\u2019d have to rein him back in,\u201d one official said. After he joined the administration in July, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly slashed the number of people who could attend the intelligence briefings in an effort to exert more discipline over how the president consumes information, current and former officials said.\u00a0  Josh Dawsey and Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Beth Reinhard", "body": "Adult-film star Stormy Daniels reportedly was paid to remain silent about a sexual relationship with Donald Trump before he was president.

Trump said he contradicted Trudeau \u2014 \u201cWrong, Justin, you do\u201d \u2014 even though \u201cI didn\u2019t even know. \u2026 I had no idea.\u201d When Trudeau insisted, \u201cWe have no trade deficit,\u201d Trump replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He then called in an aide who supposedly told him that the U.S. has no trade deficit with Canada \u2014 but only if you don\u2019t count energy and timber. \u201c\u2009\u2018And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year,\u2019\u2009\u201d Trump quoted the aide as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n It\u2019s incredible, all right, as in literally not credible. Trump\u2019s own U.S. trade representative reports that the United States has a $12.5 billion trade surplus with Canada, and that includes energy and timber. But Trump didn\u2019t back down: He insisted that his \u201calternative facts\u201d were superior to actual facts.\n On Thursday, the president tweeted: \u201cWe do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive).\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was sent out to do a full Spicer by dutifully saying, without a scintilla of substantiation, that \u201cthere are plenty of things, once you take into the full account of all of the trade between the two countries, that show that there is actually a deficit.\u201d\n Like Trump\u2019s claims that Gen. John J. Pershing slaughtered Muslims, or that his inauguration drew record crowds, or that he would have won the popular vote if millions of illegal immigrants had not voted, this is another example of a would-be dictator\u2019s desire not just to sneak lies by us but to shove them down our throats. Trump is signaling that he doesn\u2019t care what the truth is. From now on the truth will be whatever he says, and he expects every loyal follower to faithfully parrot the official party line. Or else.\n Another disturbing indicator of the same authoritarian pathology came this week after Trump\u2019s graceless ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The White House initially claimed that Tillerson had been notified the previous Friday that he was being let go, but on Tuesday Steve Goldstein, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, contradicted that spin by telling reporters that Tillerson was \u201cunaware of the reason\u201d for his firing and had just found out about it. Goldstein was immediately canned and, in a significant bit of symbolism, replaced with a former host of \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d Trump\u2019s favorite TV show. Trump is sending a signal that not only does he insist on his right to lie but that he regards telling the truth as a firing offense. Government officials, take note.\n The same vindictiveness was apparent in Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s decision Friday night to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe after 21 years of service, just more than 24 hours before he was due to receive his pension. The excuse apparently was McCabe\u2019s supposedly unauthorized communications with the media about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, followed by alleged attempts to mislead investigators. But Trump\u2019s gloating tweet makes it obvious this was punishment for telling the truth about the Maximum Leader\u2019s attempts to obstruct justice and end an investigation into his links to the Kremlin. Those are inconvenient truths.\n As his presidency advances, Trump is becoming increasingly intolerant of disagreement and defiance, especially from aides who know what they are talking about. Economic adviser Gary Cohn tried to tell him that tariffs and trade wars are bad economics; Trump didn\u2019t listen and Cohn resigned. Tillerson tried to tell him that scrapping the Iran nuclear deal is a bad strategy, and now he\u2019s gone. National security adviser H.R. McMaster is said to be the next candidate for the heave-ho, because he reportedly rubs Trump the wrong way. Of course he does. McMaster is well known in the Army for his blunt willingness to disagree with superiors when he thinks they\u2019re wrong. Trump\u2019s ego is too fragile to handle the truth.\n The frightening thing is that Trump\u2019s insistence on redefining reality is working, at least with his base. The video news site NowThis has posted a hilarious and horrifying clip showing Fox News talking heads hyperventilating over President Barack Obama\u2019s promise to meet with the leaders of hostile states such as North Korea (Mike Huckabee: \u201cPresident Obama likes talking to dictators!\u201d), before going on to fulsomely praise President Trump for doing just that.\n Trump is sucking a substantial portion of America into his Orwellian universe.

At a time he lashes out at everyone from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to our trading partners to the FBI, he nevertheless bends over backward to avoid confronting the Russian tyrant. Instead of standing up for the United States, Trump rolls over for Russia.\n This behavior \u201csends a message to the American people that President Trump doesn\u2019t care about Russian interference in our election, that President Trump doesn\u2019t care about fair elections, and that what President Trump does care about is pleasing Putin,\u201d says former FBI special agent Clinton Watts. \u201cAlso congratulating Putin\u2019s electoral win, and then not challenging Putin on the nerve agent attack in the UK is the equivalent of telling Putin he can do whatever he wants.\u201d\n Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was irate. \u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country\u2019s future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d Likewise, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told a press gaggle Tuesday night, \u201cEvery time you talk with Putin and you give him a pass, that emboldens him. So our friends in Britain are probably disappointed the president didn\u2019t push back.\u201d\n As has often been the case, GOP leadership was far more muted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could only say that such a call would not have been \u201chigh on my list.\u201d Even worse, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) insisted that the call was \u201cfine.\u201d\u00a0It would be nice if \u2014 at least just once \u2014 GOP leaders and the committee chairman would challenge the president directly. \u201cMr. President, that\u2019s not how the leader of the Free World behaves. You communicate weakness or gullibility when you act this way. Why can\u2019t you ever manage to stand up to Putin?\u201d\n Human rights advocates were horrified. \u201cPutin should be condemned, not congratulated, for leading an authoritarian regime that cynically manipulates its own elections and actively works to undermine elections in the United States and other democracies,\u201d said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. \u201cThe United States should recognize Putin as the leader of a repressive government that seeks to export its model of denying fundamental freedoms, and its intolerance of opposition.\u201d\n Likewise, David Kramer, former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, wryly observed, \u201cIf he had to call at all, Trump should have called Putin on Saturday, the day before the so-called election, to congratulate him since the outcome was already known, with Putin having ensured \u2018victory\u2019 with the murder in 2015 of one leading Russian opposition figure (Boris Nemtsov) and the disqualification of another ([Alexei] Navalny) on an absurd conviction.\u201d He cautioned, \u201cNo Western leader should have congratulated Putin because Russia didn\u2019t hold an election in any true sense of that word. Russians deserve better. And to say nothing about the recent poisoning in the UK, interference in our and other elections, or Russian actions in Syria and Ukraine is to embolden Putin to continue such outrageous conduct.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s servility when it comes to Putin defies a benign explanation and takes us to the\u00a0heart of the Russia scandal: What does Putin \u201chave\u201d on Trump, and why is Trump so reluctant to defend American interests when it comes to only this world leader?\u00a0Mueller can ask Stephen K. Bannon and Michael Flynn about Trump\u2019s mysterious passivity, but he might want to question outgoing secretary of state Rex Tillerson, too.

Comey, Dershowitz argue the novel theory that Trump couldn\u2019t\u00a0obstruct justice by ousting his FBI director, even if his goal was to shut down the Russia investigation, because hiring (and firing) officers of the government is a constitutional power. \u201cRespectfully, I could not think Alan is more wrong,\u201d Toobin said in a June panel discussion with Dershowitz.\n Toobin isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s questioned Dershowitz\u2019s stances on\u00a0the probe and its many ramifications.\u00a0Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal and supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, has said that many of his old political allies have shunned him as he has\u00a0made his case in various television appearances and commentaries over the past year, as The Washington Post\u2019s Fred Barbash\u00a0reported.\n An array of legal scholars have criticized\u00a0Dershowitz\u2019s arguments about obstruction of justice, including Daniel J.

John Bolton, whom President Trump has said will take over the position next month, is unsuited for that role. His record is that of a rigid, bombastic ideologue with a history of bullying colleagues and twisting intelligence. His advocacy of extreme policies, including preventive war against North Korea and Iran, could lead Mr. Trump and the country to catastrophe.\n It\u2019s not clear if Mr. Trump chose Mr. Bolton because he agrees with his views or simply because he likes watching his commentaries on the Fox News network. (The president is said to have set aside previous plans to recruit the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations because he did not like the look of his bushy mustache.) Whether he intends it or not, Mr. Trump is likely reintroducing conflict and chaos into his national security team, which under fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson approached competence.\n Mr. McMaster, who joins the growing list of honorable public servants whose reputations have been besmirched by Mr. Trump, managed to purge the National Security Council staff of unqualified personnel imported by his predecessor, Michael Flynn, and to attract some foreign policy professionals. Now they will have to weigh Mr. Bolton\u2019s well-known history, which includes attempting to pressure State Department intelligence professionals into accepting the false conclusion that Cuba had biological weapons, and harassing an Agency for International Development whistleblower. USAID contractor Melody Townsel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2005 that Mr. Bolton chased her through a Moscow hotel in 1994 \u201cthrowing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman.\u201d \n Republican senators who studied this record refused to confirm Mr. Bolton as U.N. ambassador, and it is likely that he would have been rejected by the present Senate if nominated to a position requiring confirmation. Mr. Trump gets to choose his own national security adviser, but in selecting Mr. Bolton he is inviting not just staff turmoil but a radical turn in his foreign policy.\n Mr. McMaster, along with Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, persuaded Mr. Trump to put off some reckless moves, such as canceling the nuclear deal with Iran and withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Now the president\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser will be encouraging his inclination to breach the nuclear accord \u2014 something that would alienate U.S. allies and invite a conflict with Iran.\n Mr. Bolton\u2019s public advocacy of war with North Korea could sink Mr. Trump\u2019s already risky plan to meet with regime leader Kim Jong Un. If Mr. Trump were to heed Mr. Bolton\u2019s argument that a preemptive strike is preferable to managing the nuclear threat, East Asia and perhaps even the U.S. homeland could be exposed to unthinkable bloodshed. \n We\u2019d suggest that GOP leaders in Congress weigh in against Mr. Bolton, but they have shown again and again that they are unwilling to challenge the White House.

(Evan Vucci/AP)  Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian meddling, said in a statement: \u201cThe indictment reaffirms what our intelligence community concluded, what our committee\u2019s investigation has borne out, and what President Trump denies: that Russia interfered in our election in an effort to assist his presidential campaign and harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d Mueller\u2019s indictment came three days after the nation\u2019s top intelligence chiefs warned in Senate testimony that Russia is targeting the 2018 midterm elections in its continuing effort to disrupt the U.S. political system. But the intelligence community\u2019s warnings have gone largely unheeded in the White House. During the first 13 months of his presidency, Trump has rejected the evidence that Russia waged an assault on a pillar of American democracy \u2014 something many in his administration regard as objective reality \u2014 and has sought to discredit the case that Russia poses a threat to the United States. White House officials have said this is partly because the president wants to forge a productive partnership with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin to tackle problems in North Korea, Iran and other hot spots. Trump has never convened a Cabinet-level meeting on Russian interference and has resisted or attempted to undo efforts to hold Moscow to account, such as additional penalties imposed last August by Congress. On the National Security Council, there has been an unspoken understanding that the president would see raising the Russia matter as a personal affront. Trump\u2019s skepticism of the intelligence about Russian interference and his administration\u2019s handling of the security threat was documented by The Washington Post last December, including efforts to explore the return of two Russian compounds in the United States that had been seized by President Barack Obama.  [Exclusive: Doubting the intelligence, Trump pursues Putin and leaves a Russian threat unchecked]  Trump\u2019s doubts about Russia\u2019s role in the election drew considerable attention in September 2016, at his first presidential debate with Clinton. Moderator Lester Holt of NBC News asked Trump about the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cWho\u2019s behind it? And how do we fight it?\u201d Holt asked Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s saying \u2018Russia, Russia, Russia,\u2019\u201d Trump said, referencing Clinton. \u201cBut I don\u2019t \u2014 maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia. But it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?\u201d Thus began the 400-pound couch potato theory. It was not until January 2017 that Trump\u2019s advisers convinced him to acknowledge for the first time that he believed Russians were behind the cyber attacks. The leaders of the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies had traveled to New York on Jan. 6 to brief the president-elect on their findings. And in the days that followed, chief of staff Reince Priebus, son-in-law Jared Kushner and other advisers prodded Trump to accept the findings. They argued that he could affirm the validity of the intelligence without diminishing his electoral win.  Trump scoffed at the intelligence findings, arguing that they could not be trusted, but finally relented. On Jan. 11, in the lobby of Trump Tower, the president-elect held a news conference and said it once and for all: \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d Afterward, Trump told aides that he regretted the comments and he has since hedged his words when asked about Russian interference. Last November, during a trip to Asia, Trump met with Putin and apparently discussed the issue. Trump told reporters that he believed Putin\u2019s denials. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t meddle,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cEvery time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks roiled Washington and the president later tried to backtrack on what he had said. \u201cAs to whether I believe it or not,\u201d Trump told reporters the next day, adding, \u201cI\u2019m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership.\u201d Later that month, however, Trump was back to his old talking points. He tweeted last Nov. 26, \u201cSince the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Philip Rucker", "body": "Tentative plans for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to make his first visit to the White House to meet with President Trump were scuttled this week after a testy call between the two leaders ended in an impasse over Trump\u2019s promised border wall, according to U.S. and Mexican officials.\n Pe\u00f1a Nieto was eyeing an official trip to Washington this month or in early March, but called off the plan after Trump would not agree to publicly affirm Mexico\u2019s position that it would not fund construction of a border wall that the Mexican people widely consider offensive, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential conversation.\n Speaking by phone on Feb. 20, Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trump devoted a considerable portion of their roughly 50 minute conversation to the wall, and neither man would compromise his position.\n One Mexican official said Trump \u201clost his temper.\u201d But U.S. officials described him instead as being frustrated and exasperated, saying Trump believed it was unreasonable for Pe\u00f1a Nieto to expect him to back off his crowd-pleasing campaign promise of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall.\n Both accounts confirm it was Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s desire to avoid public embarrassment \u2014 and Trump\u2019s unwillingness to provide that assurance \u2014 that proved to be the dealbreaker.\n   \n  In a televised address Jan. 25, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said that Mexico will not pay for President Trump's border wall. (Reuters) \n \n A physically slight man, Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been loathe to put himself in an environment in which the more imposing Trump could play the bully. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s style is exceedingly formal and he is averse to verbal combat, making his carefully-scripted public events the opposite of Trump\u2019s often freewheeling appearances.\n With Mexico heading into a July presidential election, any action by Pe\u00f1a Nieto that could be seen as kowtowing to Trump or buckling under American pressure risks damaging the prospects for his Institutional Revolutionary Party.\n The two presidents\u2019 public posturing over the wall \u2014 Trump demands that Mexico pay for it; Pe\u00f1a Nieto insists that it will not \u2014 has harmed their personal relationship and jeopardized the alliance between their neighboring countries.\n \u201cThe problem is that President Trump has painted himself, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the bilateral relationship into a corner,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. \u201cEven from the get-go, the idea of Mexico paying for the wall was never going to fly. His relationship with Mexico isn\u2019t strategically driven. It\u2019s not even business; it\u2019s personal, driven by motivations and triggers, and that\u2019s a huge problem. It could end up with the U.S. asking itself, who lost Mexico?\u201d\n Still, negotiations between their respective administrations continue apace on the North American Free Trade Agreement and other issues. And both governments have striven to portray their ties as strong and the exchanges between their leaders as smooth.\n \u201cWe enjoy a great relationship with Mexico and the two administrations have been working for a year to deepen our cooperation across a range of issues including security, immigration, trade and economics,\u201d Michael Anton, the top spokesman for Trump\u2019s National Security Council, said in a statement.\n Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray called the U.S.-Mexico relationship \u201ccloser\u201d under Trump than in previous administrations.\n \u201cI think in many ways the relationship today is more fluid,\u201d Videgaray said earlier this month in Mexico City alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s closer than it was with previous administrations, which might be surprising to some people, but that\u2019s a fact of life.\u201d\n Traditionally, U.S. presidents have prioritized visits with their Mexican counterparts soon after taking office, considering the close ties between the neighboring countries.\n But in January 2017, just days into Trump\u2019s presidency, Pe\u00f1a Nieto called off a planned trip to meet Trump in Washington amid an escalating war of words between the two leaders over Trump\u2019s border wall proposal.\n In a Jan. 28, 2017, phone call, a transcript of which was published last year by The Washington Post, Trump suggested to Pe\u00f1a Nieto that they both try to gloss over their respective wall positions by saying \u201cwe will work it out\u201d whenever asked whether Mexico would pay for the wall.\n \u201cThe fact is, we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall,\u201d Trump told Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cI have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period. .\u2009.\u2009. If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that.\u201d\n Since that call, Trump has not visited Mexico City and Pe\u00f1a Nieto has not been to Washington, although the two presidents have spoken by phone and met in person last July at the Group of 20 summit in Germany. The two also met in summer 2016, when Trump traveled to Mexico City as a candidate.\n Earlier this month, a delegation of Mexican officials led by Videgaray met at the White House with senior adviser Jared Kushner \u2014 the president\u2019s son-in-law who is charged with managing the U.S.-Mexico relationship \u2014 national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other Trump administration officials to work out the parameters for a Pe\u00f1a Nieto visit, officials said.\n  [Jared Kushner proves to be a shadow diplomat on U.S.-Mexico talks] \n The Mexican officials left the Feb. 14 meeting believing they had an agreement with the U.S. side that Trump would not embarrass Pe\u00f1a Nieto by bringing up his desire for Mexico to fund the wall \u2014 a proposition Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government considers humiliating.\n One Mexican official described his country\u2019s position as, \u201cYou cannot talk about the bloody wall.\u201d This official said Videgaray left Washington believing Trump would not broach the wall during Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s visit.\n Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto made plans to speak by phone Feb. 20 and, assuming the call went well, their staffs would finalize an itinerary for the Mexican president\u2019s White House visit.\n But the call did not go smoothly, according to officials from both governments. Trump said that he would not be bound by any such agreement and could not commit himself to not talking about the wall.\n \u201cThat was a dealbreaker for us,\u201d the Mexican official said, adding that Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his administration were concerned in particular about a reporter asking a question about funding for the wall at a news conference and Trump answering it.\n Instead of announcing a date for a meeting in Washington, the statements issued by both governments summarizing the call were vague and said only that they had discussed their bilateral agenda on trade, security and migration issue. The statements also said the two presidents exchanged condolences for the high school gun massacre in Parkland, Fla., and for the military helicopter accident in Jamiltepec, Oaxaca.\n Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose department is responsible for border issues, has canceled an upcoming visit to Mexico. A Department of Homeland Security official denied Saturday that Nielsen\u2019s trip was scratched because of Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s disagreement, saying the decision to \u201cpostpone\u201d her Mexico trip was made a week before the two presidents spoke.\n U.S. officials said Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto agreed to have their staffs continue talking and try to reach agreement about the border wall and other issues, according to U.S. officials. A few hours after the two presidents spoke, officials said, Kushner called Pe\u00f1a Nieto to help smooth things over.\n U.S. officials said they anticipate Pe\u00f1a Nieto may try again to visit Washington, perhaps in the spring, and the Mexican official suggested the two presidents may get together in April at the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru.\n  [Mexicans see models of Trump\u2019s \u2018impenetrable\u2019 wall, and they\u2019re not impressed] \n \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d was a signature slogan of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 and has continued to be one through his presidency, even though Congress has not yet fully funded its construction. At his rallies, Trump would cry out, \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for the wall?\u201d And his crowds would shout back, \u201cMexico!\u201d\n Speaking Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump told his fans, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re getting the wall,\u201d adding that whenever he hears someone suggest that he does not really want to build a wall, \u201cthe wall gets 10 feet higher.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s statements are considered offensive and outright racist by many Mexicans, who accuse the American president of using their country as a \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d to motivate his most fervent supporters.\n In private, Mexican officials bristle at Trump\u2019s claims their government is passively allowing drugs and Central American migrants to pass through en route to the United States.\n The number of Central Americans detained and turned back by Mexican authorities has at times exceeded the number caught by U.S. border agents, but enforcement by the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government appears to have waned in recent years.\n Still, there is an understanding in Mexico that Trump is playing to his national interests, according to Larry Rubin, who for years has been a leader among U.S. Republicans in Mexico.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a better understanding of where President Trump is coming from and what his objective is and what his style is,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cLike in any negotiations, there is always posturing or issues that countries don\u2019t agree with.

He\u2019s bragged about the size of his \u201cnuclear button,\u201d repeatedly threatened military action and used playground taunts to demean America\u2019s adversaries. \n But in the first 15 months of his presidency, Trump has been cautious when it comes to actually using military power and putting U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\n The last two weeks could mark a major turning point in his presidency. In selecting John Bolton as his new national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as his secretary of state, Trump has elevated two of the most consistently hawkish Republicans in Washington.\n Now, the question is how these two Trump advisers will change a president with few, if any, fixed views on foreign policy.\n Bolton, a Fox News commentator and prolific writer, brings a coherent and unusually controversial foreign policy philosophy to the White House. He has been a fervent advocate for using American military power to prevent rogue regimes, such as Iran and North Korea, from acquiring and proliferating nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\n \u201cHe is unabashed about this,\u201d said Mark Groombridge, a former top adviser to Bolton at the State Department and United Nations. \u201cHe has no problems with the doctrine of preemption and feels the greatest threat that the United States faces is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n  [The return of John Bolton sparks concern around the world] \n Pompeo has described Iran as \u201ca thuggish police state\u201d and a \u201cdespotic theocracy.\u201d Both men have described the landmark Iran nuclear deal as \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n Trump was initially drawn to Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who he dismissed Thursday as national security adviser, for his reputation as a warrior in Iraq and Afghanistan. But McMaster\u2019s methodical and academic style grated on the president, who often complained that he couldn\u2019t stand being around him.\n Bolton and Pompeo are much more of a stylistic match. \u201cTrump likes the pugnacious, tough-guy style, and they reinforce it,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a former Bush administration official and Trump critic.\n They are also far more savvy bureaucratic operators than McMaster, who had never served in Washington and often tried to wear Trump down rather than woo him.\n The challenge for Bolton and Pompeo will be convincing Trump to support their aggressive plans.\n McMaster pressed the Pentagon for military options to strike targets in Iran. But his entreaties were routinely rebuffed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said U.S. officials.\n \u201cMattis has been daggers drawn with H.R. on everything,\u201d said a person close to both men.\n In most of these disputes Trump either backed Mattis or did not weigh in with his feuding advisers.\n  [Trump\u2019s favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust?] \n In Afghanistan, McMaster took a similarly tough line, pressing Trump to agree, against his own instincts, to double the size of U.S. forces to 15,000 troops and back a strategy that relies heavily on America\u2019s ability to improve Afghanistan\u2019s inefficient and corrupt government. But Trump never seemed to buy into the new strategy and resented McMaster for pushing it on him, U.S. officials said. Pentagon officials have said that they feel under intense pressure to show progress on the battlefield this year before Trump pulls the plug.\n Neither Bolton nor Pompeo share McMaster\u2019s belief that U.S. power can or should be used to reshape the world or spread democracy. \u201cBolton is almost entirely focused on U.S. national security,\u201d said David Bosco, an international relations professor at Indiana University who has interviewed Bolton for his work. \u201cHe has very little patience for the idea that the U.S. should be spending blood and treasure to improve other countries.\u201d\n In that way, both Bolton and Pompeo are much more of an ideological match with Trump. Their biggest impact in the immediate term could be on Trump\u2019s planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, scheduled to take place by the end of May.\n In approaching North Korea, Bolton has suggested that Trump should demand that the Kim Jong Un denuclearize and allow international arms inspectors unfettered access to the country \u2014 an outcome most Korea experts say is highly unlikely.\n Absent a total North Korean capitulation, Bolton is likely to press Trump to reject lesser concessions such as a freeze of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, said those who have worked with him.\n \u201cJohn hates the word \u2018freeze,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Groombridge said. \u201cHates it.\u201d\n Bolton and Pompeo also share Trump\u2019s intense frustration with the nuclear agreement that the United States and five other world powers reached with Tehran during the Obama administration. They will play key roles in advising Trump next month on whether to amend it or drop it entirely.\n Bolton and Pompeo will likely make their biggest impact on the daily operations of the Trump administration. For much of the last six months, if not longer, McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were widely viewed as weak and wounded players inside the administration. \n As CIA director, Pompeo has spent more time at the White House than previous directors, cultivating a relationship with Trump. He\u2019s likely to try to forge deeper ties at the State Department than Tillerson, who often ignored the diplomatic corps. \n \u201cPompeo has shown that he\u2019s committed to working with the team that\u2019s given to him,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, a senior vice president at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cAt State, he\u2019ll hear very different things than what the president wants him to hear.\u201d\n At the White House, Bolton is likely to reinforce Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d view of the world. Both the president and his new top adviser share a long-standing animus to any treaties, international laws or alliances that limit America\u2019s freedom to act on the world stage.\n Bolton has also shown that he knows how to influence Trump. Even when he was frozen out of a White House job at the start of the administration, Bolton managed to gain access to the president. \n For a brief period after White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly took over, Bolton was even completely blocked from the Oval Office. But the ban didn\u2019t last for long. Bolton won back his contact by drafting a plan to help Trump get out of the Iran deal at the same time that the president\u2019s advisers were encouraging him to stay in it.\n As national security adviser, Bolton\u2019s former colleagues said he would make access to Trump his top priority. His model: Henry Kissinger.\n \u201cJohn always said that he admired Kissinger,\u201d Groombridge recalled. \u201cHis model is very much an imperial-style National Security Council.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "Samantha Schmidt", "body": "Claudia Tenney,\u00a0then a state assemblywoman,\u00a0speaks at the Capitol, in Albany, N.Y., in June\u00a02015.

In a radio interview last week, she suggested\u00a0the domestic abuse allegations against former White House staff secretary Rob Porter were not \u201ccrimes of character.\u201d And in\u00a0an earlier interview on CNN, she said Democrats who refrained from clapping during the State of the Union address were \u201cun-American.\u201d\n \u201cOnce again Congresswoman Tenney has demonstrated how completely unfit she is to serve in Congress,\u201d Lukaske said.\n In a statement later Wednesday, Tenney defended her remarks,\u00a0pointing fingers at the left for politicizing mass shootings.\n \u201cI am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy,\u201d Tenney said in\u00a0email\u00a0statement to The Washington Post.\n \u201cWhile we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime,\u201d she added. \u201cI will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.\u201d\n When running for Congress, Tenney was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, which gave her an \u201cA\u201d rating. She has described herself as a \u201clife\u00a0member of the NRA, gun owner and shooting sports enthusiast\u201d who is committed to defending the Second Amendment. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016, and was previously a member of the state Assembly.\n In her radio interview with\u00a0Dicker, Tenney also suggested that mass shootings did not take place decades ago, when fewer gun restrictions existed.

(Alex Brandon/AP)\n \n The Post reports:\n  Attorney General Jeff Sessions late Friday night fired former FBI deputy director Andrew Mc\u00adCabe, a little more than 24 hours before McCabe was set to retire\u00a0\u2014 a move that McCabe alleged was an attempt to slander him and undermine the ongoing special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign.\n Sessions announced the decision in a statement just before 10\u00a0p.m., noting that both the Justice Department inspector general and the FBI office that handles discipline had found \u201cthat Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor \u2014 including under oath \u2014 on multiple occasions.\u201d . . . . The move will likely cost Mc\u00adCabe a significant portion of his retirement benefits, though it is possible he could bring a legal challenge.\n  In a blistering written rebuttal,\u00a0McCabe said he authorized two FBI officials to talk to a reporter \u201cto set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\u201d He asserted, \u201cIt was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week.\u201d He continued:\n  I\u00a0am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey\u2019s accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG\u2019s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday\u2019s comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.\n This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration\u2019s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel\u2019s work.\n  President Trump, never able to conceal his vindictiveness and incapable of understanding what evidence might be used against him, gleefully tweeted, \u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI \u2013 A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\u201d\n No wonder Trump\u2019s lawyers seem unable to imagine allowing him to sit for an interview with special prosecutor Robert S. Mueller III. He is likely to blurt out something akin to, \u201cYay, that\u2019ll show McCabe and others what happens when they decide to help Comey!\u201d That\u2019s the essence of the tweet Trump could not resist sending.\n Former White House ethics counsel Norman Eisen, now with the Brookings Institution, tells me, \u201cTrump and his enablers are engaged in a systematic effort to undermine the Russia investigation \u2014 including Robert Mueller\u2019s review of whether Trump obstructed it by demanding James Comey pledge loyalty and let Michael Flynn go, and by firing Comey when he would not accede.\u201d He continued, \u201cMcCabe spurned Trump and is a key corroborating witness for Comey\u2014ergo a target of Trump\u2019s ire.\u201d He added, \u201cWhatever McCabe may or may not have done (and we will need to await more details to judge him, and Sessions too for that matter), Trump\u2019s behavior is an appalling violation of norms. It may also be a violation of law\u2014we will find out, should McCabe challenge this behavior in litigation.\u201d\n Unfortunately for McCabe, his ability to challenge his firing is limited. \u201cThere is honestly few legal recourses for him to pursue absent discriminatory actions,\u201d says attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in defending national security employees. \u201cIn my 25 years of federal legal practice, I have found FBI\u2019s due process to be sorely lacking.\u201d\n From a political standpoint, McCabe\u2019s firing is likely to come across as vindictive, small-minded and cruel \u2014 the essence of the Trump administration. For those within the FBI and the Justice Department, it may turn up the long-simmering resentment against the president to a full boil. A president willing to force McCabe\u2019s firing is willing to fire any one of them; if they needed further encouragement, this latest affront is likely to cause them to redouble their efforts to root out the extent of Russian interference in our election and any cooperation with the Trump campaign.\n Sessions\u2019s willingness to go along with this retaliatory move will not be received well within his department. He too has much to lose by enabling Trump\u2019s vendetta against DOJ, given that Sessions was involved in the firing of Comey and the drafting of a pretextual reason for his firing. Sessions no doubt felt it was necessary to fire McCabe to keep his job, but he\u2019d best be looking over his shoulder in his own department. There are long-time civil servants who may have material relevant to Sessions\u2019s actions.\n As a legal matter, this is another ham-handed and downright dumb move in a long line of actions designed to derail, undermine and discredit the Russia investigation.\n Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney tells me, \u201cEven if McCabe\u2019s firing is appropriate based on facts in the unreleased IG\u2019s report, because of the President\u2019s long running campaign against McCabe and Attorney General Sessions\u2019 perceived vulnerability if he didn\u2019t fall in step, it has the taint of political reprisal.\u201d She adds that, \u201cif an obstruction case against Trump ever went to trial, there would be a large screen where the President\u2019s tweets would be prominently displayed for the jury as evidence of his efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation, while a parade of witnesses testified about conversations they had with him preceding each Tweet.\u201d\n In sum, once more, a Trump-inspired stunt is likely to backfire. The politics are irrelevant to Mueller, who now views each of Trump\u2019s antics through a single lens: Does this reveal corrupt intent to disable an investigation into Trump\u2019s conduct?

For notwithstanding his ineptitude, lack of presidential temperament, chaotic White House and deep unpopularity, Trump is continuing to strengthen his grip on power.\n The McCabe case illustrates the fundamental asymmetry between Trump and his critics. For anti-Trump commentators and activists who embrace the rule of law as the central tenant of their resistance to the president, McCabe is problematic. According to reports of the findings of well-regarded Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, McCabe wrongfully leaked details of the investigation of Hillary Clinton, then was not fully candid with investigators about it. If true, this is not the sort of conduct that \u201crule of law\u201d advocates are comfortable defending. \n Which brings us to Trump\u2019s two advantages over his opponents. First, until the details of McCabe\u2019s case are public, many Trump critics have been restrained in their reaction to McCabe\u2019s firing. They want to reserve judgment until the facts are in; they want to assess McCabe\u2019s actual culpability before taking up his case. \n But Trump is not similarly constrained in smearing McCabe and regaling in his ouster. Trump called McCabe\u2019s firing \u2014 executed by an attorney general under pressure to appease his boss \u2014 \u201ca great day\u201d and a reflection of the \u201clies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI.\u201d This was at least his sixth tweet about McCabe in recent months, leaving no doubt about Trump\u2019s grudge against the career FBI agent whom Trump has maligned with a long list of false accusations. \n McCabe has professed his innocence, and the Justice Department inspector general has neither confirmed nor denied public reports of his findings. Weeks or months from now we may find, as McCabe claims, that he did nothing wrong. But by then the swirl of Trumpism will have moved on. By the time the fact-based opposition has what it needs to defend McCabe, the next of Trump\u2019s victims will be \u201cin the barrel,\u201d to use Roger Stone\u2019s famous phrase. \n And what if McCabe did do something wrong in authorizing FBI officials to talk to a reporter, or while answering questions from investigators looking into the matter? Here is Trump\u2019s second advantage: the fact that almost every person who stands up to Trump will, themselves, be imperfect, be vulnerable to investigation, have made mistakes \u2014 that is to say, human.\n As Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt point out in their book, \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d modern authoritarian leaders do not consolidate power by coming after wholly innocent people: They exploit the fact that almost every person with a long public career \u2014 those who could be a check on the leader\u2019s power \u2014 has done something wrong, or something that can be cast as wrong, if scrutinized in a certain way. Former FBI director James B. Comey \u2014 fired for refusing to bend to Trump\u2019s will \u2014 made substantial and hugely consequential mistakes in handling the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton. Rex Tillerson \u2014 fired just hours after being the first senior U.S. official to join Britain in sharply criticizing Russia \u2014 probably was the worst secretary of state in modern history. The list goes on. \n They, and others, may well have deserved to face some consequence, perhaps even to have their government service ended. But, in the era of Trump, that is not the right question. \n In these instances, we need to ask not whether an individual did something wrong; the question is whether there is any reason to believe that is why Trump took action. In McCabe\u2019s case, the answer is obvious.\n From Trump\u2019s own words, it is clear that he had McCabe fired not for anything he did wrong, but for what he did right: His refusal to pledge political loyalty to Trump, his determination that the investigation of Trump and his campaign continue without compromise, and his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee corroborating Comey\u2019s damning account of Trump\u2019s obstruction. \n McCabe\u2019s firing serves Trump\u2019s purposes, whether or not McCabe did anything wrong. And every FBI agent investigating matters that Trump finds uncomfortable, every intelligence officer reporting on Russian efforts to corrupt our democracy, every career civil servant doing his or her duty in the face of political pressure has been sent a chilling message: Cross the president at your peril. He will single you out, he will harass you publicly, he will find a way to end your career. He may even deny you a pension you have spent decades earning through selfless public service.\n This, then, is the challenge that confronts Trump\u2019s opponents dedicated to protecting the rule of law from his political power. Standing up to Trump may indeed involve standing unequivocally with imperfect people, people who may have done something wrong \u2014 to stop the president from perpetrating an even bigger wrong, with an even greater cost to our system. \n I stand with Andrew McCabe.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Post", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": "Washington, D.C."}]}, {"author": "John Wagner", "body": "President Trump on Wednesday defended his congratulatory call to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin on his reelection, saying that getting along with one of the United States\u2019 biggest geopolitical rivals is a \u201cgood thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n In a series of tweets, Trump criticized his predecessors for failing to establish a better relationship with Russia, asserting that the last president from his party, George W.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who also first won in 2010, served as this group\u2019s biggest ally in the process argument. He mocked how big the bill was by tweeting that it was still printing in his office, more than two hours after he first hit print. \n The legislation \u2014 combining 12 separate funding bills that were supposed to have been approved six months ago \u2014 won on a sweeping bipartisan vote. A healthy majority of Republicans, as well as Democrats, supported the plan. \n Those conservative principles only went so far when they were measured against the unleashed spigots of federal funds, which had been tightly held since the 2011 Budget Control Act had placed strict spending caps. \n A bipartisan compromise last month gave a nearly $120 billion boost over the original 2018 spending limit, a massive 10 percent hike. \n House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) mounted a vigorous defense of the legislation, focusing on it representing the largest spike in military funding since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. \n He explained that the House had done its part in September, approving all 12 of the funding bills, while the Senate dithered. So members should have been able to read those earlier bills to have a sense of what would be in the final draft. \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t as if it was a one-week process. This has been a months-long process,\u201d Ryan told reporters at weekly Thursday briefing. He noted that Friday\u2019s funding deadline made it necessary to move quickly and also pointed to the need to allow several dozen lawmakers to leave early Friday morning to attend the funeral of Louise Slaughter (D) in Rochester, N.Y.\n   This year is shaping up to be a clash of Republican idealists vs. realists  \n   Pelosi, now minority leader, has long made a similar defense of the process of passing the health law, which transpired over nine months in 2009 and 2010, with multiple versions of the law publicly approved by different committees by the House and Senate.\n Ryan originally hoped to release the bill last week and hold a vote early this week, allowing the Senate several days to consider it. Instead, the talks dragged on and on, pushing up closer against the Friday deadline. \n And all the explanations fell flat to some Republicans. \n In last month\u2019s vote on the budget framework, 167 Republicans supported leadership, about two-thirds of the caucus. On Thursday, just 145 Republicans backed Ryan, a sharp drop that many attributed to the rushed process. Kelly was one of those who went from yes to no.\n \u201cI keep hearing about the process being broken,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThen why don\u2019t we fix it?\u201d \n In 2010, when John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) was minority leader, GOP leaders made process a central plank of the \u201cPledge to America\u201d, a campaign-style platform that gave voters a loose blueprint for how they would govern. Boehner believed that bad processes led to bad policy, a theme that Ryan echoed in his 2015 victory speech after he won the vote to succeed Boehner.\n So Republicans create the \u201cthree-day rule\u201d, mandating that a bill should not be voted on until the third day after its unveiling. Over the past seven years both Boehner and Ryan have violated that rule, because of imminent deadlines and potential doom of delay.\n But Republicans had never broke the rule on something of this magnitude \u2014 legislation funding every corner of the federal government. Even before they held a final vote, GOP leaders gaveled shut a procedural vote, 211 to 207, while some Democrats were waiting in the back not having voted. \n The whole scene brought criticism from some predictable rank-and-file Republicans who have always chafed under Boehner and Ryan. \n \u201cI never thought I would see the day when my party had a worse process than Obamacare did, but this was a worse process,\u201d Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas) said after the spending bill vote. \n But the class of 2010, whose campaigns were fueled with promises of legislative transparency, seemed most perplexed by the haphazard process.\n \u201cFor me, a 2,200-page bill is very tough to understand and read,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cAnd I was in the business world for 30 years, I wouldn\u2019t sign a 100-page bill. I wouldn\u2019t sign a 100-page contract on 24-hour notice.\u201d\n These Republicans worry that voters are fed up with process arguments to explain strange outcomes, particularly now that the GOP holds the White House and Congress. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a harder thing to explain back home than here.

Those two stories were three pages apart in Saturday\u2019s print edition of The Post.  On the front page, my colleagues Carol D. Leonnig, Shane Harris and Greg Jaffe reported that Donald Trump is the first president since Richard M. Nixon not to regularly review the document known as the President\u2019s Daily Brief, the distillation of information picked up around the world by U.S. intelligence agencies.  And there on Page A4 was the other one, under the bylines of Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett.  Jared Kushner\u2019s inability to get a permanent security clearance, for reasons that are not entirely clear, has become a source of vexation at the White House. But in the meantime, he has a temporary status that allows him to \u201csee materials, including the President\u2019s Daily Brief, that are among the most sensitive in government,\u201d they wrote. There are two sets of issues to be concerned about here. The more serious one, of course, is whether the president is getting the information he needs to keep the country safe \u2014 or alternatively, whether his handlers may be dumbing things down to avoid overtaxing his attention span or challenging his preconceptions. In the case of Kushner, there is a potential security risk but also the more immediate question of how appropriate is it for him to have access to the material under any circumstances. That takes us back to the fact that the 37-year-old real estate scion has no credential to merit holding his current White House job, outside of whom he married. It is hard to miss the irony of it all: Wasn\u2019t the main driver of the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails the fact that it suggested she was careless in handling the nation\u2019s secrets? The President\u2019s Daily Brief, or PDB, was the document that on Aug. 6, 2001, contained a heading warning: \u201cBin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\u201d It even suggested that he might hijack airlines to do it.  When such an attack happened a month later, that memo became Exhibit A in the case for those who argued that the George W. Bush administration was asleep to the danger. Of course, every president has his own style of processing information. But even Ronald Reagan, whose inattentiveness so often exasperated his closest advisers, made a point of reading the PDB every day.  White House officials say that Trump\u2019s decision to receive a shortened briefing orally reflects his \u201cstyle of learning,\u201d as well as his impatience with dense material. His intelligence advisers augment their presentation with charts, pictures, videos and what CIA Director Mike Pompeo calls \u201ckiller graphics.\u201d But it seems fair to wonder how closely the easily distractable chief executive is following the oral presentations. The time on his official schedule set aside for the briefings has sometimes coincided closely with his tweets, including ones about random things he seems to have heard on \u201cFox  Friends.\u201d  A separate issue is whether his oral briefings are full reflections of what the PDBs actually say. Last year, for instance, The Post reported that intelligence officials include Russia-related material only in the written version and avoid referring to it in their oral presentations, in apparent fear that it will set off another presidential eruption about witch hunts by sore-loser Democrats. While it is typical for a close circle of presidential aides to also have access to the PDB, it is far less so for someone like Kushner, a newcomer to government who has only a temporary status on his clearance \u2014 and who, it should be noted, is also a focus in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation. Kushner\u2019s lawyer Abbe Lowell insisted in a statement that Kushner\u2019s clearance is taking longer than usual \u201cbecause of the extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions.\u201d But the process has not been helped by the fact that Kushner has had to repeatedly update his security questionnaire, known as an SF-86, because he neglected to include all contacts he has had with foreigners. Concern about the casualness with which the Trump White House deals with sensitive material also has been amplified in the past week, with the resignation of White House staff secretary Rob Porter over allegations that he had abused two ex-wives. It turns out that Porter, whose job it was to control the flow of documents to the president, also had only an interim security clearance \u2014 and that the FBI had warned top White House officials that there was evidence that he committed a violent crime. Given Trump\u2019s background \u2014 the flamboyant bankrupticies of his businesses, the many lawsuits that he has filed and that have been lodged against him, the credible allegations that he has mistreated women \u2014 it is hard to imagine that he would be a slam dunk for a security clearance.

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo      JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be indicted in two corruption cases, police recommended Tuesday, ramping up pressure on the leader who has served more than a decade in office.  After months of investigations, Israeli police handed over their recommendations to Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit on Tuesday evening.  Netanyahu maintained his innocence in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday night. The first case, referred to as Case 1000, details gifts of cigars and jewelry worth hundreds of thousands of shekels that the prime minister and his wife, Sara, are suspected of receiving from billionaire benefactors such as Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchen and James Packer, an Australian millionaire who was briefly married to Mariah Carey. The other case, 2000, involves deals made between Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, publisher of popular Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth. According to information leaked to the Israeli press, the deal apparently would have allowed the prime minister to receive more favorable coverage from the newspaper if he agreed to weaken the status of rival daily newspaper Israel Hayom, owned by U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.  [Netanyahu suggests police could implicate him in corruption probe]  The police announcement will increase pressure on Netanyahu to resign, though he has given no indication that he plans to do so, adopting a combative tone as the investigations have circled closer to him.  He has repeatedly attacked the police, accusing them of being politically motivated and attempting to stage a coup.  That tension has ramped up over the past week amid leaks that police were preparing to recommend an indictment.  Netanyahu released a Facebook video telling his supporters not to worry and stating his often-repeated mantra: \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d It will be up to the attorney general to decide whether to indict him, he said, pointing out that many police recommendations for indictments go nowhere.  He later released a long Facebook message. \u201cThe real question is the integrity of the investigation, and the only way to get to the bottom of it is through an objective, unbiased and quick investigation,\u201d he said.  Netanyahu\u2019s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced to resign in 2009 after being plagued by corruption allegations during his term. He was indicted shortly after his resignation and was convicted in 2014.  As allegations against Netanyahu have built, so have weekly demonstrations calling on him to resign, though they have lacked scale, drawing only a few thousand participants.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) credit for finally saying that firing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III would be impeachable conduct by President Trump. \u201cWell, I think what the president will have done is stopped an investigation in whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign,\u201d he told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cI can\u2019t see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\u201d He also was candid enough to admit, in essence, that his fellow Republicans are hypocrites who put party above country. If it were a Democratic president, Graham conceded, Republicans would \u201call have a different view.\u201d\n Several things follow from this outpouring of candor.\n First, if Republicans under the same circumstances would take the view that a Democratic president\u2019s actions are impeachable, they have no business being in office. They are, if Graham is right, entirely incapable of upholding their oaths. At the very least, Graham has suggested that they very likely are not willing to put country above party.\n We have been saying much the same thing, namely that Republicans are signaling by their silence in the face of threats to Mueller that they have no stomach to really confront Trump. If they wanted to clear up any confusion, they could pass legislation \u2014 or simply a resolution \u2014 saying firing Mueller would be grounds for impeachment. They haven\u2019t, and their silence is telling.\n That realization \u2014 that they won\u2019t apply the same standard to Trump that they\u2019d apply to a Democratic president \u2014 tells us they must be voted out. If there is a substantial risk that they will not take action even when they know conduct has been committed that justifies impeachment, there is no reason to entrust the awesome responsibility of office, let alone the majority in both houses, to Republicans.\n Graham invites further scrutiny. In his mind, we now know, \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d in interfering with a prosecutor\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s own conduct is grounds for impeachment. But what if corrupt intent is revealed in a slew of other ways \u2014 drafting a false account of the Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, firing then-FBI Director James B. Comey, asking Comey to lay off Michael Flynn, threatening Comey (with some sort of claim that he improperly leaked information), cooking up a phony explanation for firing Comey, telling his White House counsel to fire Mueller, orchestrating the firing of a witness in the Russia investigation (Andrew McCabe), spewing baseless conspiracy theories to discredit the FBI so that the investigation will not have credibility with the president, and on and on? All of these actions demonstrate a pattern of action driven by corrupt intent. The test cannot be whether his corrupt intent succeeded in decapitating the chief prosecutor; it is whether Trump had the requisite criminal mind-set and took actions in furtherance of his corrupt intent.\u00a0In sum, if Trump took all the actions (and more) listed above with the intent of freeing himself from an investigation into his own wrongdoing then, under Graham\u2019s theory, impeachment is warranted.\n Two caveats are in order.\n Republicans may have higher standards than Graham (and I) believe. They should be given the opportunity to go on the record now (and before the midterms) and tell us that firing Mueller is grounds for impeachment. They can give their reasons \u2014 and explain why only firing Mueller (not firing Comey, for example) would trigger impeachment. In other words, knowing what we know now, has Trump\u2019s conduct to disrupt and impair the investigation evidenced corrupt intent?\n Second, unlike Democrats who could well say, \u201cWe think he\u2019s committed unimpeachable acts, but it would tear the country apart to impeach,\u201d Republicans could remove \u2014 indeed have the obligation to remove \u2014 the political taint by making justified impeachment bipartisan. It\u2019s their refusal to put partisanship aside (as Graham seems to anticipate) that would foist constitutional responsibility onto Democrats. Republicans will have rendered an appropriate congressional response to presidential conduct (impeachment and removal) dangerous to the survival of our democracy.\n In short, Graham deserves praise for owning up to the conclusion that interfering with an investigation to protect the president\u2019s own hide is impeachable. Now, we have to find out whether he thinks Trump has already met that standard by the pattern of conduct leading up to the present barrage of threats against Mueller. And if the voters have reason to believe Republicans will refuse to uphold their oaths \u2014 leaving in office an unfit president, or daring Democrats to set off a divisive political battle \u2014 they really need to get those lawmakers out of there.
